    "Given that this class was the first math course I've taken at Yale, I gained a lot from this course. The course itself was not that difficult, although exams and some pset problems pushed us to think more critically to understand some proofs and more abstracts concepts behind the basic linear algebra and were at times challenging. I learned to think more critically and was impressed by the wide range of applications of linear algebra. I enjoyed the second half of the semester where we looked at more applications of linear algebra from looking at basic models including population growth, differential equations, or predicting the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence to learning the math behind fitting the best regression line (useful in statistics and data analysis) to learning about singular value decomposition which is used in graphics and other areas. Although the course itself taught the basic math, it was good to gain the basic background for a lot of fascinating fields.",

    "I learned a basic understanding of linear algebra, with an emphasis on computation rather than theory. I appreciated the amount of time we spent on certain concepts, but I think I would have gotten more out of the course if it was focused more on developing a deeper understanding of linear algebra rather than as focused on computation as it was. I also think the pacing could be better, so that the course goes more quickly at first and slower at the end (relative to the way it was done this year).",

    "Strength: Lecturer Weakness: The class was organized badly. The TAs are not helpful. Office hours are unlimited. There's no review sessions for midterms. Also, the textbook is, in plain terms, simply horrible.",
    "Strength: Lecturer Weakness: The class was organized badly. The TAs are not helpful. Office hours are unlimited. There's no review sessions for midterms. Also, the textbook is, in plain terms, simply horrible.",
    "Math lecturers are... you know. I thought the psets were too long and repetitive, and there was not nearly enough time given for the midterm exam. Otherwise, we pretty much learned from Gilbert Strang's book, and I've heard this course is lighter on the workload than Math 225.",
    "it taught everything i needed to know about linear algebra, but lectures were often dry",
    "This was an introductory course that was structured through the textbook so there is little that should be changed.",
    "The lectures didn't really add anything to my learning the content - I felt I learned most of it from the book.",
    "Strengths: Jinwei's humor. Weaknesses: mostly everything else. The PSETs were unnecessarily long, and because each problem wasn't graded and solutions weren't available I didn't know if I was making mistakes. Additionally, while Jinwei's teaching started very solid, he got noticeably tired and less-enthused with time, leading to poorer explanations and more convoluted understandings of higher-level concepts. Additionally, he couldn't seem to time exams correctly (they took MUCH longer than anticipated), which was problematic given that the final was 50% of our grade.",
    "Important subject, difficult class, a little too abstract, professor sometimes hard to understand",
    "Strengths: The course avoids some formal language and matrix theory. This allows more time to focus on the computation and applications, which will be of greater utility to some students. Peer Tutors and TAs are great resources and do help quite a bit. Weaknesses: The pacing is really not great and mitigates the above strength. Particularly, the first two chapters receive way too much time and attention that it takes time away from the more important later chapters that focus on the applications (which are what make the class distinct from 225.) Similarly, the homework can be time consuming and tedious. I feel that a better choice of problem sets and a better way to work on them with other students (study halls) would make them more productive for understanding the content.",
    "It's great cause the proofs aren't the focus of the class.",
    "Not taught particularly well. Sometimes very long psets. Exams are hard af.",
    "More straightforward exams that were more similar to what we had done on problem sets.",
    "The class builds upon itself and is very clear.",
    "I struggle to think of a single strength of this class. The PSETs were long, but needlessly so (they were repetitive busy work). The lectures were dry, but didn't even cover much material (the same concepts were repeated week after week so we hardly covered half of the textbook). The professor was mean and rude to us (he seemed to think every student was an idiot in the class).",
    "The lectures sometimes moved very quickly and it would have been helpful to slow down and understand the intuition behind the new concepts we were introduced you. There were a few times when students asked for the reasons behind the methods we were learning, but the professor usually encouraged to just learn the method without taking time to understand the reasoning behind them.",
    "The textbook used in this course is really, really, bad, referencing topics that it hasn't introduced yet and doing a bad job of explaining concepts overall. That being said, this might actually work to your advantage, because if you manage to decipher it, you'll get a pretty good understanding of the material. The difficulty of the course was good; easier than multivariable calculus, but still quite challenging.",
    "Felt like we covered a lot of material. I think way too much time was spent on easy stuff at the beginning of the course (first half of the semester), and some of it wasn't really interesting or very applicable.",
    "The course was great!",
    "Professor Yang is an outstanding lecturer. Period. I do not know if the administration will read this response, but I highly highly highly suggest that the University retain Professor Yang, if only because of his outstanding value as a lecturer (it is my understanding that he does not currently have a contract for next year). As someone who previously took this course at Georgia Tech, Professor Yang's explanations were truly very clear and very succinct (a million times better than Georgia Tech's class). Furthermore, all the exam material was extremely fair. A think a hallmark of this class is that every class period (1 hour 15 minutes), felt extremely short every single time I came to lecture, because Professor Yang's presentation of the material was so easy to understand, but also interesting and engaging. My guess is that some students will say that his lectures were not clear or hard to understand or something, but frankly that is because those students are not putting enough effort in the class into understanding the material he is talking about. They might counter by saying they spent so and so hours trying to understand what is going on, but I can guarantee you that they did not do enough (i.e. do more practice problems, go to peer tutor hours, go to section, go to office hours). Furthermore, the average homework grade is very high in this class, so to say that Professor Yang is not a good lecturer (but somehow you still get high homework grades) to me implies that these students either did not actually do the homework or that they are contradicting themselves. A weakness of the course is that the scope of the material covered is probably too low. Considering that this course is called Linear Algebra with Applications, I think more time should be spent on real applications such as Google Page Rank, stochastic matrices, etc.",
    "Strengths, it's fairly simple material, and the textbook is good. Weaknesses is that there is too much burden on students to teach themselves material in class.",
    "It is incredibly boring. Having a better lecturer would be much better.",
    "I'm not sure this course has any strengths although I must admit I did not go to office hours, so I can't say anything about TAs. This class was pretty poorly taught. In the classroom, linear algebra is different from calculus in that a conversation about linear may sound something like: \"Only if the matrix is nonsingular will it's rank be n. It will therefore be invertible making it possible to diagonalize it.(Note quite true)\" If you don't know the definition of one of these terms or aren't able to make immediate connections between them, then the whole statement is total gibberish. This is to me what class felt like. In Calc, if you're lagging behind in class you can at least look at an integral and see what it represents, whereas here you are basically doomed to copy down nonsensical sentences into your notes for later review. I think that the teacher could recognize this and do a better job of communicating key ideas. The book is horrible and the homework is long and tedious. The average on the midterm was curved to a B- and the final was incredibly hard.",
    "The class covered all of the necessary topics and the PSETs were very useful for understanding the material in class. It could be nice to have lecture notes from class online or somewhere else though.",
    "This course was well taught overall and the notes were clear. The textbook could be confusing at times and disordered so potentially changing the textbook may be helpful. Sometimes psets varied drastically from being very short to being extremely long, so more balance may be nice.",
    "I can't really pinpoint why but I found the lectures hard to follow",
    "The material taught it the course was fairly incompatible with the materials in the textbook. But the course was well organized to follow.",
    "In terms of strengths, everything was at least decently explained, and the material was manageable enough to get a solid grasp on everything by the exams. In terms of weaknesses, there were wild jumps in the duration of each pset, and the instructor was unable to communicate with great clarity.",
    "The textbook is decent and the course goes through most of the basics of linear algebra. I would say, however, that the lack of theory\/developing an understanding of what things, such as a determinant, are, was frustrating, especially when the exams would have conceptual questions such as proofs.",
    "It's pretty good. I think people who complain are the same people who copy problems off Slader and fail the tests. Jinwei has a good sense of humor about the hard stuff and if you go to class, you will remember things at opportune times (ie, the exams!) 50% for the final was admittedly kind of rough but i understand.",
    "Strengths are organisation, clarity of textbook + homework. Weaknesses are some communication, exam write-up.",
    "Strength is that important concepts are taught. Weakness is that it is a broad but shallow overview.",
    "As mentioned above, the professor did not focus on explaining the key conceptual terms and left us to learn them ourselves. The problem sets were incredibly difficult and the exams were ridiculous. This was not supposed to be a proof based class, yet many of the exam questions focused on proofs.",
    "I did lit like the fact that there were only two tests. On the other hand less studying.",
    "I enjoyed the course but found that the tests did not line up very well with the pset problems.",
    "Lecture was decent, but the homework was from the textbook and the textbook was garbage. The best improvement the course could get is using a better textbook.",
    "The only strength of this class is that it isn't that much work; I felt as though the material was poorly paced (half a semester on Gaussian elimination, half a semester on everything else), the lectures were uninteresting, the PSETs were not fairly graded (only ~5 out of 20 problems were graded each time) and the exams were much harder than the entirely computation-based problems on PSETs and in class. Could be improved by actually teaching things about matrix theory at least a little bit rather than doing number crunching examples for half of each lecture, spacing out the difficult material, and having better lectures.",
    "Too many repetitive questions in the pset",
    "The link between computations and theory is left for the students to figure out (textbook is no help)",
    "A crowded lecture is not very helpful especially in a math class. In he beginning of the semester, a large portion of students didn't have seats. Lazy TAs. The course is very dense and we didn't have enough time to appreciate the material and actually learn. The course is abstract and the teacher didn't make any effort to help students get anything out of it.",
    "The textbook was pretty bad. One of the answers to the practice problems in the back was \"I think so.\" Poor explanations in textbook and class. Needed visuals so students could actually see what they were doing when they were performing the different methods. Also if you got an answer wrong on the pset little information was provided as to what you got incorrect. It would generally just be circled.",
    "Some of the problem sets are too long and filled with busywork.",
    "The course was too fast-paced and the exams were much harder than the practice tests.",
    "I liked the lectures, they were very clear and far more helpful than the book. I found the book to not be very useful, and hard to read.",
    "One of the weaknesses was that the midterm test was too long in too little time - many students like me were forced to leave questions blank when handing in the test because there was not enough time to complete the test. I think this greatly affected students' final grades since the class only had one midterm and a final."

    "I would not recommend this to someone unless they 1) are in love with math or 2) really need it for their major and are choosing between 222 and math 225.",
    "yes, because it taught the fundamentals of linear algebra",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes math, but is more interested on the applied side rather than proofs. I would also recommend it to anyone who isn't in the math major but is in some other major that relates to math (i.e. Econ, CS).",
    "If they need to take it.",
    "I cannot recommend this course, but with improvements I can see this course being much better in the future. a) Jinwei seemed like a promising lecturer at first, but his explanations dulled with time. He needs to more clearly explain the trickier concepts in the course. b) If you're not going to grade all of the PSET problems (which is another problem onto itself), then you need to post a solutions key. Otherwise, we could be doing problems incorrectly, creating bad habits. c) If this is going to be a class with high-stakes tests, they need to be clearly thought-out and well-timed, especially since so much of our grades ride on it... otherwise it's just unfair. This includes posting practice exams that are accurate portrayals of what the real exam will be like (look towards the Math 120 model). We've never solved a word problem on our homework and you give us two on our final... not cool. Unfortunately, at the moment, this course seems like another example of why STEM (and specifically math) at Yale is not situated to let students succeed.",
    "Take 225 and learn the application on your own or when you need to.",
    "Definitely! It is definitely easier than Math 120 and also more enjoyable! It has been my most favourite class at Yale so far, even though I know I will not be getting the best grade in it. If you enjoy Math and 120 made you think otherwise, then 222 might restore some of that joy you once found in Math! It definitely did for me! Jinwei Yang is also an amazing professor to take it with.",
    "Only as a pre-requisite. It's not taught well.",
    "I'd say take 225 or something more rewarding instead.",
    "Yes, it is extremely helpful!",
    "Do not take this class. The PSETs were long, but needlessly so (they were repetitive busy work). The lectures were dry, but didn't even cover much material (the same concepts were repeated week after week so we hardly covered half of the textbook). The professor was mean and rude to us (he seemed to think every student was an idiot in the class). If you have to take linear algebra, either take 225 (more rigorous, but excellently taught, from what I've heard) or wait until Jinwei Yang isn't teaching 222. Just avoid this version of 222 if at all possible.",
    "Yep! If you're taking linear algebra as a 5th or 6th credit, this one is probably the better call over 225. Even though my friends seemed to learn a lot more, I was still comfortable sticking with the basics.",
    "No, unless they need to get credit.",
    "If they wish to take a math course Id recommend it!",
    "If you are great at math, take 225 or 231, this course is too easy for you. Or if you took this course before like I did, I would suggest skipping it entirely and taking 244, 246, or 301, or some other math class (the material presented probably isn't any different than what you learned before (it was actually less than what I had learned before). If in math 120 (or equivalents) you got an A or A-, and have never taken linear algebra before, I would recommend you try this course, the difficulty is probably just right or on the easier side. If in math 120 (or equivalents) you got a B to B+, this course is probably suited for you (but on the harder side).",
    "Yes but if you want to learn a more in depth linear algebra course do 225.",
    "Yes, linear algebra is a very important skill for advancing in mathematics or computer science, and this course gives you essential foundational knowledge in the field.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I took it, because I wanted to learn linear algebra while taking 4 other credits. If I was only taking 3 other credits, I definitely would have taken Math 225 which I hear is fantastic.",
    "Yes, you will most likely be taking this for a major requirement, but it is a good class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. Linear algebra is fundamental to a large set of fields and has many applications. You learn the basics of linear algebra in this class that can be applied elsewhere and it is always useful to know if you are going into any STEM field.",
    "no. If you don't fear the workload, take 225 instead.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is 1) not at all interested in theoretical math; or 2) does not have the time to take Math 225.",
    "I've heard from rumors that this course was much less gutty than it used to be under the previous professor. I'd agree. Although the name of this course was \"Linear Algebra With Applications,\" we focused on a disproportionately large amount of theory. Prof. Yang is an expert at linear algebra, but that means he moves through the material quickly and often leaves his students confused until a brave soul raises their hand and asks for clarification. The exams are mostly application but have some proof-based questions (\"Prove the statement or disprove it with a counterexample\") that require pretty in-depth intuition. Because of this, I suggest not skipping lecture.",
    "I would recommend it if it is required or if there is a reason you want to take it. It's not horrible, but I probably would take MATH 225 if I had to start over.",
    "Would recomment. Make sure you go to class since the book is not that great of a intro book (I think Strang's \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\" book might be a bit better). Honestly, I found it really fun . The final was more like a lot of cool puzzles rather than too much plug and chug, though a good portion of the course is doing plug-and-chug until you understand the stuff in and out.",
    "Yes, needed and useful for many STEM majors",
    "I would recommend as an introductory course.",
    "No. I think this was a poorly taught linear algebra course that expected its students to learn material that was not clearly taught.",
    "Too disorganized. Take only if necessary.",
    "It's the easier linear algebra course. Take it if you want a non-proof-based, ok linear algebra class. The textbook is terrible, and the homework comes from it, but many similar questions and explanations can be found online so that can help you understand. The grading is very final exam-heavy, about 50% of your grade, which is frustrating because homeworks can take a lot of time and they're not worth much.",
    "No, take math 225 if you want to understand anything about matrices and\/or not want to fall asleep every single lecture. You learn very little in this class despite the normal workload; please just do yourself a favor and put in the extra 5 hr\/week and take 225. This class was boring, poorly planned, graded and tested, and not at all enlightening.",
    "It is a good course with fast pace and condensed materials. The learning and teaching style is a lot similar to MATH 120. Working load was heavy in the first half of the semester because the pset usually takes 8 hours a week; the workload becomes manageable later. It will be fine if you do your pset and you will learn very well.",
    "No, take 225 if you really want to understand linear algebra. You'll have to put in more time and effort, but it'll be much more rewarding and useful than skating by in 222.",
    "If you're a STEM (except pre-med) major, you probably need to take this course to fulfill the requirements. Otherwise, you won't learn anything from a large lecture and a cynical teacher.",
    "no",
    "The teaching quality for this class is very spotty because it changes every semester. I found lectures hard to understand and largely relied on the textbook. The psets this semester were also sometimes a little ridiculous in length (30+ questions)."
