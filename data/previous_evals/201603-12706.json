    "I can't believe how much I know about color theory. I also received some excellent feedback on my writing, and lots of practice moving between art history, philosophy, aesthetics, and other areas of inquiry in a single session.",
    "I made the mistake of going into this course thinking that I'd \"figure out\" color. If many of us talk about paintings as if they were done in black and white, than I thought I'd leave the class speaking in hues. This was an unreasonable expectation for myself. If anything, I think I walk away from the seminar understanding why color is a problem, why it is difficult to describe and why this difficulty is romanticized and turned into a weak excuse for silence on the part of scholars. I now know where to look to start talking about the problems of color (e.g. De Piles, Newton, Goncourt, Runge, Chevreul, Albers), what my archive might be. Working through the final paper for the class was really a revelation in this regard: I wasn't going to \"solve\" the color in a painting, or even figure out how and what color \"signifies,\" and I didn't feel that I was altogether successful in my analysis! But that failure, or--rather--that un-success, that sticking and struggling over color is the lesson I'm looking for. It's too easy to turn color into metonymy, or describe it imprecisely without rigor. There are so many ways to describe color without rigor and it's so easy to be satisfied with yourself when you do that! I repeatedly felt disgust and revulsion at some of my formal analysis, and kept turning to our readings for ways out. A striving for better and more righteous ways of discussing color is what I take away from this seminar--not a finished product, in and of itself.",
    "This seminar made me think about paint and color in a more engaged and critical way. It has changed how I look at and engage with paintings.",
    "A thorough exploration of color theory from its origins to its practice in contemporary art history and art theory."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The field trips were fun--it was nice to have a change of scenery. There was an excellent balance in class between lecture and discussion. I'm really glad Professor Armstrong and Professor Suthor led class each week instead of having students do so. Also, the atmosphere was intellectually rigorous but still informal. I am very pleased that students were required to turn in preliminary drafts of their final papers two months in advance of the end of the course. Weaknesses: Too much reading. The readings were often meandering and occasionally unpleasant. I did not have the training to engage productively with the philosophical texts we read, so I wish we would have had more secondary readings on how color was used and conceived of throughout history. More technical readings would also have been helpful. I also wish that the class would have been more organized. Readings were often posted a few days before they had to be done.",
    "I really appreciated the course's rigorous engagement with the selected material. Carol and Nicola are both brilliant, so hearing them come at the texts from their own vantage point was also really exciting. I think it could have been useful to begin with an overview text that provided a better framework within which we could place the different readings and concepts. Also, to include some thought about color through different disciplines- post colonial theory, race, etc--- or discussions about how painting has entered that conversation.",
    "The co-teaching method used by Profs. Armstrong and Suthor was brilliant. Prof. Armstrong had the ability to quickly and substantively lay out the problems of our readings, while Prof. Suthor tended to cut in and apply pressure to us and our ideas. I deeply appreciated the insistence from both instructors on site-specific learning and object engagement. They encouraged us to present from our objects, to schedule study visits ourselves, while they themselves took us out to West Campus to talk with conservators and see the sheer stuff of color in painting, to the storerooms of the Albers Foundation. Having the insights and opinions of two faculty members on a single seminar paper was exceptional, especially insofar as I could understand what details and arguments stood out to two different readers, to see and compare their differing opinions!",
    "A great dynamic between the professors, I loved hearing them discuss topics between themselves during seminars. The field trips to galleries and West Campus were fantastic and extremely germane to the theme of the course. Discussions were thoughtful and were aided very well by having us prepare selections of text beforehand. Overall, it was a wonderful seminar and benefited greatly from the enthusiasm of the professors and the students.",
    "The course was very well formatted and had a great reading list. I think it could be improved by applying a more structured narrative for it to follow. Perhaps by medium, movement or author."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I enjoyed having Professor Armstrong and Professor Suthor as instructors, and I enjoyed my classmates and the field trips. I had reservations about the readings, but most people enjoyed them, so I think most students would get a lot out of taking the class.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to someone interested in the history of aesthetics, painting, or connoisseurship. Carol and Nicola are also worth the recommendation. I do not think I would take it again, but due to my lesser interest in the exact material taken up by the course in regard to color. It was well-represented in the syllabus, I just didn't think it through enough.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "The seminar should certainly be taught again. A seemingly integral, foundational seminar for all who write about art.",
    "If you have a lot of drive to deliver original ideas in a well researched manner, this class is for any student of art history. Best to have a background in critical theory, methods, but little technical examination knowledge needed."
