    "Course focused on advanced reading of Akkadian texts. I would recommend.",
    "Yes. The pace is not overwhelming but the student will leave the class with a greater knowledge of Akkadian literature as well as Standard Akkadian as a language.",
    "I strongly recommend students within the areas of NELC and outside NELC consider taking a course with Professor Frahm as it will only benefit students. I personally believe that we are very fortunate to have him as an instructor in the dept of NELC.",
    "Reading Enuma Elish and a few short creation accounts in the original Akkadian",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to any student of Akkadian. It is an excellent introduction to the epic of creation, one of the most important cuneiform texts, and to creation myths of Mesopotamia in general."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "My dissertation will likely entail evaluation of texts from the ANE as well as the Hebrew Bible, thus studying Enuma Elish provided a unique opportunity to do just that.",
    "I developed interest in studying Assyriology two years ago while taking beginning Akkadian courses here at Yale. Each time I take additional courses in Assyriology, I continue to develop passion for these courses and I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to continue to study course work in the dept of NELC.",
    "The course deepens one's knowledge of the Akkadian language and literature, a necessity for future research. It also broadens one's knowledge of creation literature in Akkadian and a Mesopotamian context."
