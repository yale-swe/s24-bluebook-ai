Weaknesses: Terrible time slot - many other classes meet at Friday 1230-230. Military GMTs have been done too many times, and waste time that could be spend on more productive ventures. Lack of midshipmen engagement due to not respecting others' time.",
    "We just had to do it. The material can be boring at times, but it is necessary and important",
    "I hate GMTs, but I understand that we need to do them. I do appreciate, however, that the staff are able to plan certain trips (for CAC cards, for example) during lab so that we do not need to give up any additional time (beyond what we already do for weekly NROTC activities)."
