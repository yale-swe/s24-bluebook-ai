    "On weeks that we had homework, I would spend about 4-5 hours or more. Midterm and final took me about a week, sending 2-3 hours per day. I had no genetic background and did not hold a science-related degree from my undergrad, so I felt that this had a lot to do with the number of hours I would spend on the homework. It took me a bit to really understand everything.",

   "comments": [
    "Overall, I thought the course was great and the instructor did a very good job keeping the entire class engaged during a 2 hour period. The only thing I would point out as a weakness is the speed of the course -- I often felt that we went over topics too quickly and that the professor assumed everyone in the course understood. This made me fall behind at times and have a difficult time understanding future topics that made reference to previous topics. Perhaps if there is a way to either not include some topics or spend more time on the difficult ones (like LOD score, etc.), then I would not have felt so lost during some of the homework assignments and lectures.",
    "I have no background in biology and I felt difficult to understand some of the concepts during lecture, so I read the materials that were listed in the classes v2. I think the instructor is good in delivering lectures and I do like the lab sessions' contents which I believe are helpful for our future research.",
    "Provide essential information for all the genetic concept in public health. Started from the basic knowledge to the newest technology.",
    "I enjoyed this course. It was a good intro to genetics in public health. I enjoyed the labs a lot and thought it gave us a good idea of what genetics researchers do. One thing - I would have liked to have more practice problems in class similar to those we did in the homework.",
    "This course provides a broad introduction in molecular epidemiology. It is very useful for students who don;t have much biology background but want to know more about molecular epidemiology including pedigree analysis, GWAS analysis and next generation sequencing. However, since the course covers a lot, it is impossible to go very deep in every topic. So sometimes the definitions of certain terminologies are confusing to students eve those have biology background during lectures."

    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0I thought professor DeWan was great. He was very enthusiastic about teaching, taught the material clearly, and was very helpful if anyone had questions.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0I would like to have more time during lecture to elaborate key concepts and examples, because I usually cannot focus when the instructor was introducing some papers. Generally, the lectures contained adequate contents and I have learned much.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor Andrew is a great person. Alway quick in question and response. Very patient. Also free to student for career path talk.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan is very nice and friendly and was eager to answer students' questions. He was working with a very quiet (and tired looking) bunch of students, but definitely tried to make the most of it! I thought he put together a great class.",
