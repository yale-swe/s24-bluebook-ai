    "Mme Charney is a fun teacher and class is never dull. For me, the class helped my confidence and fluency in speaking quite a bit. (I came in with a 5 on the AP, which means you are encouraged to take 160, but I had virtually no emphasis on conversation in high school.) There is a lot of work, though, and readings can be long. Mme Charney does what she can (she doesn't control the syllabus) and is pretty understanding. She is really nice and I would recommend that you try to get into her section, having talked to some people in the others.",
    "Yes -- you'll read a lot and watch several films. Most of your time in class will be spend with analytical discussions of the text, and your speaking will get better without you realizing it. The course can be a lot of work at times, but it's manageable. Just don't procrastinate until the last minute - I've made that mistake too many times.",
    "I would highly recommend this as a first L5 French course."
