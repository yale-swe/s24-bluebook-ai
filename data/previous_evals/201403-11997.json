    "To, agr aap ne L1 aur L2 le gaye, aapko L3 lena chahiye!",
    "I highly recommend L3 Hindi! We mainly practiced our speaking and writing skills and only learned a few new grammar concepts. We also used more authentic materials such as newspaper articles and advertisements for reading. The class is very enjoyable and the professors are both wonderful!",
    "If you're considering 130, you did L1 and L2, so yeah, get your language requirement out of the way. It's not that hard of a class and Hindi is a cool language. L3 isn't really that much work compared to L1 and L2, although the final project required a lot more work than in L1 and L2.",
    "Obviously this is required for the language requirement, but highly recommended nonetheless. You gain much more comfort with the language than in either l1 or l2.",
    "Hindi is a great language to take. It is easy to pick up if you pay close attention to the beginning of the course; learning the basic grammatical structure is imperative to a successful track throughout the course. The instructors are very helpful and care a lot about each of their students. Conversation sections can sometimes be a little rough in the beginning, as conversation is something that comes more towards the end of the semester, however everything is very helpful and at the end you leave with a pretty substantial knowledge of the language as well as the culture. Overall a very good course."
