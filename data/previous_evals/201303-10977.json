    "English 125 is not for the feint of heart. Readings take a significant amount of time, especially at the start of the term, as you also have to learn how to read middle English. But don't let that keep you from taking the course if you are genuinely interested. I was dreading this course, because other students had told me it was tedious and uninteresting compared to the rest of the English major. I came out of it really enjoying Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne. Discussions in class are extremely helpful.Though I can't speak for other professors, I can confirm that Professor Cornelius is very good. He is extremely knowledgeable and patient, and good at helping you interpret the readings. Overall I had an enjoyable experience in this class.Another plus side-- I can now read modern English very rapidly.",
    "Mediocre introductory survey course - avoid it if you can. If you can't, that's ok, too. It's uninspiring and sort of a dull waste of a credit, but it's not painful.",
    "This is a class you take if you want to be an English major. Unless you really love canonical early English poetry, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not taking it for kicks. Some of the material is interesting, some of it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Spenser in particular can be a challenge, but luckily things improve with Shakespeare and especially with Donne. These are all, of course, important guys to read, but I thought the way we went about reading them in Professor Cornelius\u00e2\u0080\u0099s section could be dry and oblique. He lays a great emphasis on scansion, which can, again, just be . . . dry. He is a very good scholar and knowledgeable about his subject, and is helpful in answering historical and contextual questions. Also a fair and charitable grader. My one complaint is that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he always moderated discussions in such a way to promote a steady progression of thought. Instead, students would often throw out opinions (sometimes quite bad ones) just to say something about a poem, which is not the way I think a seminar should work. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid to shop multiple sections--you want to be sure you get along with your class's discussion dynamic.",
    "Engl 125 is one half of the prerequisites for the English major. That being said, it is a fantastic course and does not feel like a prereq by any means. The workload is normal for an English class (5 essays- 3 long and 2 short), and the readings are very manageable. Also, don't worry about the Chaucer recitation that all the 125 classes require! It's very low stress. Ian Cornelius is a wonderful professor! Very soft-spoken, not a harsh grader, good sense of humor. He gives excellent feedback on papers, and is always available for questions. Take 125 with him if you can!",
    "Professor Cornelius is a fantastic teacher, and I highly encourage you to take the class with him.",
    "\u00c3\u0080 fabulous exposure to Donne, Shakespeare, Chaucer, and Spenser, as promised.",
    "I would recommend Professor Cornelius's course for any potential English major. Otherwise, don't take this course.",
    "Wonderful selection of poets. Instruction from Professor Cornelius was spot on. I feel that my analytical tool kit for close reading verse has expanded profoundly. Some students complain about Spenser, yet if you put in the time, you will find even him enjoyable. A great class to take as a prospective English major. At least for me, it helped me realize that this is the major for me.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student only if they are interested in the material; for someone who isn't planning to major in English, this class can get a bit dense."
