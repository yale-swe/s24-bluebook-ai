    "I gained so many insights into American Indian history and theory that I never understood before. That may be partially due to the fact I have never taken any other classes in this area, but I truly learned so much that I did not know or never considered before.",
    "Different ways of creating histories and narratives",
    "An understanding and knowledge of how tribal histories are written, incorporating a wide variety of types of sources and providing opportunities for native peoples to self-deterministically construct their historical narratives.",
    "Through this class I gathered more of an appreciation for a different type of history that isn't taught in common curriculum. I appreciated that this class was taught in the same style as other historical literature classes that I have taken. Also, for the first time in my academic career I have been asked to write, validate, and defend indian histories."

   "comments": [
    "I loved how this class gave you free reign to explore any project related to Native studies, but I felt that the early part of class (where you read some books and discuss) could have been better structured. The discussions didn't seem to go anywhere, or even prepare you for the project.",
    "Very conversational. It might be cool to have class time in which we help each other do research",
    "The reading list and seminar format were definitely the biggest strengths.",
    "The strengths of this class were that there were a good mix of students to contribute their varying perspectives to discussion. The professor was able to draw upon his deep knowledge of Indigenous literature. There were Native students that could offer a living connection to the material in which we were engaging. There were students that were interacting with Native American histories for the first time. All together everyone was able to learn from the class in their own way. The weakness was personally the time and length of the class. It was hard to concentrate and offer my best input at 9am on a tuesday morning."

   "comments": [
    "Only take it if you are willing and eager to spend most of the semester engaging deeply on a particular research project. Otherwise you're wasting your and everyone else's time.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in learning more about American Indian history and delving into a certain aspect of your choosing. I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It was also great to learn about my classmates' projects. The books we read at the beginning of the term were really thought provoking as well.",
    "For someone without a history background, I really appreciated the interpretive tools presented in this class. Highly recommend Prof. Blackhawk, and I highly recommend students of history to invest time studying the subject matter of indigenous history.",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation. The reading list for the course is phenomenal, the class discussion was engaging, and the final paper provides a unique opportunity to pursue one's own interests through deep engagement in historical research and writing.",
    "Yes, I believe courses in Native History should be highly encouraged or required for majors like Anthropology, US History, ethnicity race and migration, etc. They should be required because often students can graduate without engaging in such material at all. This serves to handicap their ability to properly articulate a historically accurate telling of world history."
