    "TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",
    "I was really excited to take this course at the beginning of the semester. But by the end of the semester I didn't want to go to class. Discussions were lopsided - only a couple people spoke the whole time - and Petranovich could have done a better job facilitating it. The syllabus and readings are really great, and if you have any interest in American political thought, you will like the work. Also, you'll learn more about some of the great resources Yale has that may be relevant to writing your term paper. Since this course is new, I expect many of the issues will be shored up for future years, but for me the course was somewhat disappointing.",
    "It\u0092s a basic overview of topics in liberal and conservative thought from Reconstruction to the present, even though when I took the course we did it in opposite order. I would recommend it for those who have some experience in the subject - unless he reverses the order to make it go from earliest to the latest.The paper is manageable, and he requires you to have a prospectus in early. That helped me quite a bit.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in reading the texts. If you are not, you will hate it.",
    "Interesting class because you get to read a lot of different intellectuals.",
    "Do not take this class. It is the worst I have taken so far at Yale. The readings are dense, and discussion does a poor job of clearing up any confusion. Professor Petranovich provides no feedback whatsoever. Literally, I am writing this, and I have not gotten a single grade back on anything I've done so far for the class. Also, I have forgotten almost all of the readings already. This was the biggest waste of time I've encountered so far at Yale.",
    "PLSC 330 is, on paper, a great class - interesting readings and weekly themes, with a final term paper that you really get freedom with (choosing the topic is almost entirely up to you). However, I think the quality of the class largely depends on who is in the class. This year, the personalities in the room meant that a few people spoke a lot, driving discussion away form the readings and toward their own opinions, while many of us struggled to get a word in edgewise.",
    "If you are a student whose passion is conservatism and liberalism, then this class will be a great venue for you to argue with your peers. If you have an interest in the topic, but not much knowledge, you will not gain much from this class as the students lead the seminar, especially those who have a very biased opinion of the topic.",
    "This class is an in-depth survey of many of the seminal writings of 20th century American political thought. It would help to come to the table with some previous background in the topic, but it's easy enough to pick it up if you don't have background as well. I would recommend this course to students interested in the subject, especially if they want to speak up in class and really discuss the central questions raised by these texts. Really engaging with this material can be quite rewarding-while sitting on the sidelines can get boring.",
    "It's an interesting seminar, and good to take if this stuff is what you're interested in. The kids who dominated the class were YPU types who know all about these writers. That made it a bit difficult\/intimidating to get in on discussions, since even if you prepared a lot with the assigned texts, others in the class were pulling in all sorts of outside knowledge which quickly took the discussion beyond something easy to participate in.I didn't love this class. I wish it had been more accessible as a basic introduction, but I think that was my fault for not having accurate expectations, not the course's fault.The workload is manageable--weekly reading, a handful of reading responses, and the final paper. Final paper is very open-ended; you can write about pretty much anything you want.",
    "Political Science 330 is a rigorous analysis of ideologies and their development in American history. I would recommend it to any student who is particularly interested in politics, policy, and ideology, but would suggest that they have some background in the subjects prior to taking this course.",
    "The readings are pretty great but be careful about who else is taking the class because it is a seminar and dominated by student discussion, which could sometimes be interesting, but often devolved into \"true\" conservatives and liberals constantly repeating their principles. Some reading responses, a presentation, and a very open-ended 20 page research paper, which all wasn't too bad."
