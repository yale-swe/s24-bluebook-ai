    "I would recommend the course, it focuses on an important piece of appropriate behavior in science and provides a space to discuss cases of scientific misconduct that are relevant everyday.",
    "It's definitely important information to know. I would definitely recommend it, and anyways it's required.",
    "This is a required course. I would have preferred not to take it. Most of what was presented was what I believe to be common knowledge.",
    "Yes. You must know about these topics! They're all important. This course is also required by NIH.",
    "I would recommend this course because it covers a wide range of topics, which are interesting and which research students should be familiar with.",
    "It is a required course. With that said, it is actually enjoyable, so if it was not required, I'd recommend it."

    "This course was helpful in ensuring that I understood what is appropriate and acceptable at Yale. It will certainly be helpful, not only in my dissertation\/research, but also in my school life on the whole.",
    "It's good to remind you just to be mindful of these things. Everybody is going to encounter something from that class in their own research life and it was a good way to get us all thinking about it.",
    "This is a great refresher for going forward with doctoral research.",
    "This course increased my awareness of ethical concerns that may be present while conducting research.",
    "This helped a lot with my understanding of what it is that goes on beyond the research aspect of doing research."
