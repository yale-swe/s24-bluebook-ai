   "comments": [
    "MATH 222 is a great and pretty straightforward introduction to linear algebra. Not a heavy workload but I usually liked to break each week's problem sets up into two sessions. Casson is the man so you should take this class with him. Make sure you attend class. The material is not too hard, but if you don't go to class you will fall behind and have a hard time catching up.",
    "Interesting topic but tedious at times. DO NOT take this class at 9am. Your exams will also be at 9am, which is terrible.",
    "It's a great class! Learned a lot. Can be hard depending on your teacher.",
    "MATH 222 is the study of linear algebra with a greater emphasis on applications of the math than on proofs; that said, be prepared to do some proofs anyway. The course was more difficult than I expected it to be, in terms of the material. A lot of my friends who had taken it said it was easy, but I think that unless you can visualize the geometry of what is going on, it will take some getting used to, and will not be as intuitive as you expect it to be. There were weekly problem sets, which I thought were quite difficult and actually took some time, so it was best to do them over the course of the week, then ask questions about them in the optional section. There were two in-class midterms; the first was extremely easy, and the second, while still fair, was much harder. The final exam is worth fifty percent of the final grade, which is pretty tough, especially because the proofs are pretty unpredictable. Professor Casson was a great teacher, though. I took it with him because of scheduling, but I thought he was excellent; he spoke and wrote very clearly, and was approachable and willing to answer questions. The only thing a student might have an issue with was that he was unwilling to answer questions outside of the scope of the course; I think that this was because he did not want to confuse anyone who might be struggling, but it might bother people who are looking for a more robust understanding of the material; in that case, you might want to shop MATH 225. Overall, this course was very strong, but I would not underestimate it when it comes to workload or difficulty.",
    "I'd only really recommend taking this course if completely necessary. Overall, the class was relatively boring, but most of that is due to the fact that linear algebra itself is rather boring.",
    "It's a comprehensive introduction that you need to pay full attention in.",
    "This is a solid intro the linear algebra. Casson's section is taught at a very reasonable pace. Anything that is difficult to grasp in section you can learn by watching Gilbert Strang's MIT lectures online (he wrote the textbook).",
    "If you need to take it, this is the section to take! If you don't need to take linear algebra and like math, definitely consider it because it's a beautiful subject!",
    "Casson's style is rather old school but effective. It's a pretty standard lecture class in that you can do just fine not going to lecture (if you're willing to put time into reading the book) but you'll have an easier time if you go to class. I found the subject to be interesting without being particularly difficult so I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys math but isn't looking for the strain of something like differential equations.",
    "I would not recommend Math 222 to a student unless he\/she needed to take it as a prerequisite. Although the material was not difficult and at times was interesting, Strang's textbook is written in a way that is extremely difficult to follow (nothing like the Math 120 textbook which was very straightforward) and very confusing.",
    "Would possibly recommend with different teacher.",
    "As far as math courses go, it was pretty good. Definitely much easier than differential equations.",
    "MATH 222 is a course I enjoyed mainly because I think that Linear Algebra is fascinating. It is not for everyone, however. Professor Casson is a good teacher, but you have to have a mind for math to truly understand everything. Overall I would recommend this course, especially if one is considering pursuing math further.",
    "This is a fun course, that is pretty interesting. It isn't very much work, and it is a great introduction to Linear Algebra for those majors that have it as a requirement\/prereq.",
    "take it. it is pretty easy.",
    "Yes, take the class!If you put in the work, it pays off and it's very satisfying.",
    "Really good course. Professor Casson presented the material in a really clear and concise way which really helped me understand.",
    "If you're reading this you're probably deciding between 222 and 225. From what I've gathered, at least in the spring term, they average out to the same difficulty. The homework for 225 is harder than 222, and the midterms are easier. The 222 midterms were medium difficulty and so was the final, as opposed to the difficult 225 exam. The homework for 222 takes a long time to complete and it is very proof-oriented, but without any of the proof formalities. If you're in it for the love of math, take 225. If you're trying to finish a prereq, take 222.",
    "A solid class and not as difficult as some of the other math classes. I'd take it if you need a math class other than the into calculus classes.",
    "MATH 222 is a good class to introduce you to linear algebra. It can be very difficult for some people and very easy for others, but as long as you keep up with the material, there are not many assignments. Professor Casson is a great person to take this class with since he's a really caring professor and really wants to make sure everyone's learning the material.",
    "I would recommend it!",
    "Math 222 with Andrew Casson is harder than with other professors.",
    "It was a good course on Linear Algebra. I recommend it to another student.",
    "Professor Casson did a good job teaching the course. His exams were very fair, relatively short and similar to the psets. Definitely recommend.",
    "Linear algebra is linear algebra and if you want to learn linear algebra but not be skewered by the theory class, take this. It's not extraordinarily stressful and you will learn the material as long as you apply yourself.",
    "AMTH 222 01 is a good survey of linear algebra and some of its relevant applications. I would recommend it to people who are interested in math. For those who aren't interested in the subject, it may be tough to follow. It requires a lot of focus.",
    "Math 222 is a thorough course on Linear Algebra -- from basics like Gaussian elimination and matrix multiplication to more advanced topics like eigenvalues, eigenvectors and diagonalization. Most of the course focuses on the theory, although there are occasionally applications to the real world... For example, we spent some time talking about the solutions of differential equations using eigenvalues. That being said, \"applications\" were generally few and far between, which I didn't necessarily see as a problem -- just a bit of a misleading course title. Overall, I certainly enjoyed this course -- it was pretty straightforward, the exams were fair and the homework was reasonable. And I certainly learned a lot of Linear Algebra by the end. I would recommend this class to anyone pursuing further math or science -- it certainly seems fundamental to many fields.",
    "A good course, not too difficult. Casson is easy, but you still feel like you're learning something.",
    "Professor Casson makes the material very straightforward and easy to learn. We occasionally had to do proofs, but usually the homework was application-focused. Make sure you get the right book, especially if it is online -- the British version has totally different problem numbers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Although it is harder than Schulteiss' class, Casson explains very well and he is overall a better professor. One of the few problems about this course is that there are no practice exams available before the test. This may change in the near future, though, because 2013-2014 was the first year Casson was teaching.",
    "Interesting course. sometimes slow. other times fast.",
    "It's linear algebra, but if you take it with Casson and want a class that teaches you ways to use linear algebra resourcefully, you might hate yourself.",
    "Excellent practical exploration of Linear Algebra. A must take."
