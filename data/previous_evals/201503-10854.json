   "comments": [
    "It's required. There are some interesting tidbits, particularly at the beginning. The end gets pretty boring. The paper is just one you churn out by summarizing some news articles. Nothing special, nothing bad, nothing to write home to Mom about.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as ethics is important for scientists.",
    "Ethics is a course that you need to think about. The issues discussed therein will crop up, so you better know how to approach them to avoid ensnaring yourself.",
    "Using lots of cases to give ethical education. I would highly recommend this course, because ethics is important for every person.",
    "Parr will show you that there is more to scientific misconduct than meets the eye (sorry if that's cheesy). Definitely would recommend the course.",
    "Interesting course could have been more engaging. Recommended.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a required class for all graduate students and any undergraduate student actively doing research in a lab, so it isn't a class that necessarily needs to be recommended. However, I did enjoy the class and think it is a good idea for all inspiring scientists to be aware of the issues addressed. Since I think it is necessary for those in the field, I would recommend it.",
    "CHEM 590 teaches students about the types and consequences of scientific misconduct. I would definitely recommend it to incoming graduate students, but I'm not sure it's quite as useful for undergraduates, especially those who aren't working in a research lab.",
    "It's a useful class",
    "A good introduction to ethical conducts in academia",
    "You have to take it, its mandatory.",
    "It is a class that is required and should be required because it will help remind you that ethics is important as a scientist.",
    "I would recommend it to another student because it is an essential topic for anyone doing any type of research.",
    "Honestly it wasn't much to learn in class but it's a required course for chemistry students."

   "comments": [
    "It helped put the rose-colored glasses with which to view science back on, but I'm not sure I feel much better equipped to deal with students who cheat or that I am less likely to commit ethical misbehavior.",
    "The course educated me on ethics which is important.",
    "I know more about scientific misconducts.",
    "Behaving badly in research is a lot easier than one might think and while some of the rules often seem to be common sense, Parr taught us that sometimes you need to make a conscious effort to make sure that you are conducting yourself with intellectual integrity.",
    "I learned from the course about all categories of ethical misconducts. The most important knowledge is about falsification. All these points I learnt help me set up a right attitude towards upcoming research.",
    "It was informative about situations I will possibly encounter later in graduate school.",
    "This course 100% relevant and necessary for all graduate students. Although it did not necessarily deepen my scientific knowledge, it provided information on important aspects of the scientific community such as publishing expectations. It indirectly contributed to my research as it reinforced what is accepted\/expected in terms of ethical conduct.",
    "It stresses the importance of academic honesty, which is essential for our research.",
    "After taking the course, I have a better understanding of what constitutes scientific misconduct, which will help me as I begin graduate research.",
    "I know what not to do now.",
    "I learned more about the frauds done in science that I would not have looked up myself or imagined. It is a good reminder that I should always be honest with presenting my scientific results and be a responsible person in the community."
