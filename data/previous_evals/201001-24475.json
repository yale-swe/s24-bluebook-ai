    "Fastastic class. Must take it. It has drastically improved my writing and was a great class to take overall.",
    "Write every day, on a variety of prompts. Lecture may not be helpful. Take it if you want to improve as a writer and write every day. Take it if you want to do something creative. Don't do it if you don't have a lot of ideas or don't want to write a 250-300 word theme every day.",
    "I would definitely recommend Daily Themes to another student, especially someone who wants to force themselves to write on a daily! basis. I would warn that not every prompt is helpful\/enjoyable, some of them are really bad and just plain annoying to write.",
    "The lectures consist of the professor reading out some excerpts from various works that exemplify the overarching theme of each week (Perspective, beginnings, endings, sound, etc). He then talks about what he likes about each pieces.It's really easy to tune out, because it's not very concrete. When you hear his opinions, it makes sense but is incredibly difficult to turn it into any kind of principle to apply to your own writing. (The tutors don't want to see you just mimicking the techniques from the excerpts in class.)Strengths:- Forces you to write everyday. Whether you realize it or not, your writing will develop and evolve as you are more aware of the techniques and pieces that go into your writing.- A change of pace from your other Yale courses. No reading, but an assignment due everyday, which sometimes can be a pain but is ultimately helpful. Lectures once a week.Weaknesses:- The writing assignments within each week are supposed to cohere. There were supposed to be stages whereby after completing initial assignments each week, they were supposed to inform your writing on the later assignments each week. I often was not able to see howthe assignments progressed each week. This could be made more explicit to the student.- Feedback from TAs very abstract. Hard to apply directly to your writing. I think it's more meant to make you think about the concept of writing, and thereby improve it. I'm not that kind of thinker and would have preferred a concrete \"I don't like this part of your piece. Here's why. And here's how you could fix it. What do you think? How does this fit in with your concept when writing the piece?\" kind of approach.",
    "This course is great! Take it! I was worried that writing 300 words a day would be too much work, but this course felt like high-level-journaling for credit. You'll learn a lot and improve a ton as a writer if you take this course.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed my experience in the class. Lectures were a little dull, mostly because nothing new was said that wasn't already on the handouts we were given. 300 words a day is a lot, but it's worth it if you get a good writing tutor. Mine was great, and made the class worthwhile for me.",
    "Its a lot of work but if you want to write its very good for you.",
    "without question, take daily themes. it will change how you think about your world (cliche as that may sound..).",
    "Take this course if you want to become a better writer.",
    "Yes. Take it if you've ever felt like you're a \"writer\" but don't really know how to approach it in a disciplined and focused way. This is a great course for anyone!",
    "Daily Themes is exactly what it sounds like: you write about 300 words on an assigned theme every day. Don't expect to love the lectures, or to produce work that can grow into longer pieces necessarily, but do expect to become much more comfortable with expressing yourself in writing. Perhaps somewhat less useful for students who have taken other creative writing classes, as I have, but even for me it helped make me feel that filling an entire blank page is not intimidating.The work load feels like a lot at first, then toward the end of the semester becomes so light and regular that this barely seems to take up as much time as a credit should.",
    "If you have the time to commit to Daily Themes, it is an extremely rewarding class. After five themes a week for thirteen weeks, your writing simply has to improve. To my surprise, I ended up really enjoying nightly writing.",
    "English 450 was a great way to experiment with different modes of writing, and to force myself to write every day. It is definitely not for everyone....you need to be motivated to write a creative piece almost every day.",
    "Definitely. If you don't have a heavy courseload aside from this class, it's great. You write every day, you improve, and at the end of the semester you have a ton of work to show for it.",
    "Daily themes is a cool thing. It is nice to look back at the pieces you wrote. The experience entirely depends on your tutor - the lectures don't have to do with much. Some feedback is very helpful and some is just difficult to apply because the theme prompts are so specific. Writing every day is impossible - the routine does not get easier. You can probably guess if you will have a hard time with it.",
    "Great class! A lot of work, but worth it.",
    "Take this class if you love to write and want to improve as a writer.",
    "Daily Themes is a really great exercise; writing every day really improved my writing. At the same time, however, the lectures can be a bit silly at times, although it's nice to listen to Langdon Hammer read to you. Overall, I say take it!",
    "It's good practice in writing, and you'll feel good having produced so much work over the course of the semester, but sometimes it's really a pain. I'm glad I took it and it's a unique course, but you do have to write every day for it to work.",
    "Daily Themes is the ultimate introductory writing course. I had never studied creative writing formally, although I know several of my classmates found the class rewarding even after several other writing classes. For the beginner or the expert, Daily Themes changes the way you experience the process of writing. It becomes less formal, less intimidating, more stressful (and, in a sense, less stressful too), and more an ordinary part of life. To anyone willing to put in the work - and to take it seriously, five days out of seven, all term - I certainly recommend the class. Be prepared to sit through some fairly uninspired lectures, but don't let them put you off. It's worth it.",
    "Good class. Lecture could have used work. Make sure you get a good tutor. Try to stay inspired.",
    "This was not nearly as good a course as I expected. The lectures were pretty useless, and Langdon Hammer seemed to know it. I almost feel that Daily Themes should do away with lectures altogether--the substantive part of the course, of course, is writing the themes. The prompts generally restrictive rather than inspiring.",
    "Take Daily Themes if:1. You like (or can stand) writing every day and think can think of a writing topic in a short period of time (or want to develop that skill)2. You want to focus in on short bits and pieces of writing, not full-length epics3. You don't mind showing up to a lecture that is required (they hold the prompts, etc. hostage in class), but useless. \"useless\" is an arguable term--some classmates really liked the lecture, some didn't have a problem with it, and I found it a waste of time.4. You want to get individual feedback on the nuts and bolts of your writing with a TA that will get to know your style, strengths, and weaknesses over the course of the class.In short, Daily Themes might not be for everyone, but if it's for you, make the most of it.",
    "It is a great lecture course with a very intensive writing component that lets you write creatively, but hold you accountable for what you pen. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes absolutely. Although I am an English major, there were tons of people from all majors. It was wonderful to get to write with varying subject matter and styles, and it really pushed my writing to another level. I thought it would get to be a drag because you had to write everyday, but that really helped me get over writers' block for my other classes as well. Take Daily Themes! It's one of those great Yale courses everyone should take.",
    "Requires a lot of dedication, but writing definitely improves.",
    "The lectures are not helpful. Professor Hammer just reads a dozen quotations each week. The main strength of the course is the daily assignment component, which I think does improve your writing. I would recommend the course, just don't expect to gain anything from lecture. In fact, just don't go.",
    "Daily Themes is a fantastic writing course. My writing improved tremendously throughout the semester, and I had a great time writing many of my themes. Writing daily is a challenging, but it makes you grow a lot, whether you are an English major or a geology buff. Developing a relationship with a writing tutor is incredibly valuable, because he or she sees where your writing can be improved. I recommend this course for anybody!!",
    "I would recommend Daily Themes because it IS extremely valuable as an exercise to be writing every day. Beyond that, it's awesome to be surrounded by (and commiserating with) other people passionate about writing, and to be exposed to the example and exemplary themes each week. That said, I hope Langdon Hammer begins to do more than just read from excerpts each class, because I didn't find lectures very helpful unless they were guest lectures.",
    "Yes, take it if you want to be forced to write daily and end with 60 great brainstorms.",
    "Want to become a better writer? Take this course.",
    "Yes, definitely, especially with a different Tutor.",
    "Take it. It's a great part of the Yale experience. Sure, the \"daily\" part can get annoying, but as a science major, having the opportunity to express myself creatively - or attempt to do so - was really wonderful, and I feel a grew a lot as a writer.",
    "I would recommend students think carefully about whether this is the type of course you want to take or not. It is very different from other Yale classes in its assignments, and that is both a strength and a weakness. I enjoyed the change of pace from the my other courses, but I found it repetitive and am not sure how much I learned. Also, I would not take it with Prof. Hammer, as his lectures were not exciting. At all.",
    "Take it. So good.",
    "Take it. Just be aware, your TA will play a big role in determining how enjoyable things are, but this is a class where your benefit from it will be proportional to how much work you put into it.",
    "Yes because it's fun to write every day, but not because the class and tutoring sessions will be helpful. Class is completely useless and tutoring is mildly useless (but fun).",
    "It's a lot of hard word - you underestimate how hard it is to have an assignment due every weekday. But you do improve, and it gets easier.",
    "Yes, this course taught me some interesting writing techniques, and introduced me to ways of thinking about the written word and the world that I had previously been unfamiliar with.",
    "This was a very good course if you are a person who handles routines well. You also have to be willing to push yourself to improve over the course of the class.",
    "This is a great course that anyone who enjoys writing or wants to get better at writing should definitely consider taking. I'm so glad that I did.",
    "It's a great class if you want to improve your writing and it added a nice mix to other classes that meet more frequently. It is a lot of work, but if you get into a rhythm with your themes it's not bad. I learned a lot and had fun too.",
    "Daily Themes is a unique class at Yale, and if that is something that appeals to you, it's worth taking. The lecture itself is dismal, and consists almost entirely of the professor reading short selections from various works aloud. Since you are a Yale student, you will be capable of doing this yourself, in your head and much more quickly than the professor. There is some discussion of each passage before the next is read, but it is too brief.The tutorial system is great, however, and provides a rare opportunity to meet with a TA one-on-one every week to discuss your work. These sessions really helped me improve my writing, at least of daily themes, and were enjoyable and very different from section.The overall amount of work is not terrible, though there are always nights when writinga theme is extremely unappealing. Most themes will be written in about 90 minutes on the day they're due.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who likes writing, thinks they like writing, or just wants to be a better writing. It's a wonderful way to explore all different types of writing in a fairly low-pressure environment.",
    "It was an interesting course, and the tutoring sessions were especially helpful. It gives you a good opportunity to practice writing on a daily basis.",
    "Take it! Great chance to write regularly and get, hopefully, highly attuned constructive criticism on your work. You probably won't write anything too worthwhile in this class -- the 300 word limits produce a uniquely untransferrable format -- but you might learn a lot about your writing. I learned more about my own \"voice\" in this class than any other,and the specific challenges and blindspots I face as a writer.",
    "Yes. You should takes it. Realize the time commitment is pretty significant to get the most out of it, but totally worth it.",
    "AWESOME COURSE. There are few writing course that accept almost all students unconditionally (even ENGL 120 has a lottery), and creative writing is a valuable way to connect to the world. It felt wonderful to use my imagination, in a way that is foreign to many other disciplines. It's a chance to discover something new about oneself.Students attend one lecture a week and have a private 30-minute tutorial with a teaching fellow. They are expected to write 5 themes of about 300 words each, based around the topic of the week (e.g., \"Voice,\" \"Style,\" \"People,\" etc.). It's definitely an instruction about the importance of practice, rather than a survey of technique. But that can be nice, too - I was able to develop my own voice and my own routine over the course of thirteen weeks. Professor Hammer is a good speaker, but his lectures can be hit-or-miss. Of course, it was his first year teaching the course, so I'm excited to hear how it grows. It always takes some trial and error in the beginning.The tutorial is where \"Daily Themes\" really shines. TFs are assigned randomly, and I think one's experience varies according to one's connection to that TF. Almost all of the TFs seemed like open, encouraging, and enthusiastic teachers; I only heard about 2 or 3 duds, out of a cast of 20 TF. I happened to have a wonderful, supportive teaching fellow, who encouraged to write verse as well as prose.Take this class -- it'll make you grow immensely as a writer.",
    "Be aware that you have to write five days a week, every week, except for one free pass week that you're allowed to take. Be aware that you need to let your tutor know how critical to be. They won't give you real advice if they think you can't take it. That said, TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It's a different sort of work than any other class I've taken. I learned to accomplish more in a smaller space, and I now have a body of work to use a starting places for portfolio pieces.",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone interested in creative writing, whether professionally or just as a hobby. It is an excellent exercise in improving one's writing.",
    "If you develop a solid working relationship with your tutor, you can have a truly special experience in this course. The daily prompts really allow you to experiment with different types of writing. Yes, this will very likely be the course that defines your semester, but it doesn't take over your life. I consider myself a slow writer, and I took about an hour each night on the 250-300-word writing assignments (we have five each week). I highly recommend this class, even to seniors working on their senior essays, though you'll probably get more out of the experience and develop as a writer more if you are able to devote more focus to the writing."
