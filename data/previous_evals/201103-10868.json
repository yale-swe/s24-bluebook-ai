    "It is a fun course to take, but best with some prior knowledge of invertebrates, either modern or fossil. For a grad student, the course requirements include an original research project, which, done correctly, requires a significant time investment. I would recommend this course to a student who is interested and willing to put the time in.",
    "A class that discusses a variety of topics in invertebrate paleontology with several different lecturers talking about their research or relevant topics. Yes I would recommend this class to fellow students wholeheartedly. Not only were the lectures interesting, but the project gives you a chance to work with a postdoc on a topic not necessarily in the scope of our own research."

   "comments": [
    "My profession is invertebrate paleontology, so this course deepened the most basic and fundamental knowledge of this discipline: knowledge of invertebrates, particularly those most common in the fossil record. It only indirectly contributed to my dissertation, however, since my dissertation focuses more on questions of fossilization, which are not very specific to a group of organisms."
