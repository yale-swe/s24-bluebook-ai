    "If you're interested at all in biology based modeling take this class! The work load is completely manageable and Professor Campbell is the best. You get a great overview of several different applications\/approaches (mostly done with Matlab) for modeling biological systems, and its also quite hands on -- the class is about half lecture and half \"lab\" where you work on building models in class.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class. It is a great introductory course to modeling on different programs. It is not too much work, however the final project is a little challenging and time consuming.",
    "Yeah! It's not too challenging and the material is interesting. Professor Campbell is great and it's cool to learn modeling outside of Matlab.",
    "Great class. The structure of the class is really cool, with the majority of the work being done in class in a lab style. It was very well taught at the beginning of the year, and sort of got a little more unorganized and rushed towards the end. But I'm sure that will be fixed next year, since this was the first year the class was taught. Campbell is awesome, too.",
    "One of the best BME classes you could possibly take at Yale. Don't be intimated by the stuff Prof. Campbell covers during shopping week- it is a lot of work, this course, but Prof. Campbell walks you through it. All of us had a wonderful time with this course.",
    "Yes, yes, yes.",
    "BENG is a solid introduction to multiscale modeling. We cover a lot of topics in a seemingly short amount of time, and all of the concepts can certainly be used as a basis for learning more in-depth modeling techniques. The course simultaneously hones an understanding of biological systems, modeling and writing code in Matlab and other biomedical programs, and the ability to read scientific papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Campbell is fantastic, and you get a better understanding of modeling applications of different scales. Be sure to give yourself enough time for the final project. Don't pick something too ambitious and know what you're getting into if you decide to use Continuity."
