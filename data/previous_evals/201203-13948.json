   "comments": [
    "rather helpful",
    "I love this course.Strengths are professor is knowledgeable and very kind, TA is helpful, course requirement is consistent and meaningful.",
    "This course is really disorganized...",
    "it is simply an excellent course. I learned a lot, it is not only theoretical, but also practical.",
    "strength: interesting topicweakness: the course is focused in designing the protocols itself, but in real world, a lot of clinical trial specialist roles cover much wider work spectrum. I think it would be helpful if the professor can add one more lecture talking about clinical trial related regulations and contemparary legal issues",
    "Great class, homework was very helpful.",
    "Overall, I thought the course was offered a decent overview of the fundamentals without going into a lot of detail. However links between statistics and their application could have been made clearer. In addition, the material covered in lecture could have been covered more efficiently.",
    "This lecture instructs fundamental principles and knowledge in clinical trials. Prof. Makuch is a very experienced and prominent researcher in this area. Theory and practical examples are used in combination to illustrate. However, sometimes I cannot follow the instructor quite well, so I think the instructor should convey his ideas and lectures in a clearer way that students who have not been exposed to this area and have no idea or basic knowledge about it can understand more easily.",
    "The course is aimed at those with little stats background, but is also appropriate for advanced students.",
    "very good",
    "strength: very helpful for the future work that I would like to do, content is interesting.",
    "Really learnt something",
    "This was a great course. A strength is the instructor's extensive knowledge in the area. The course could be improved with a bit more clearly stated exam questions.",
    "This was a good class because it exposed me to things that I would never have known. The instructor has knowledge beyond that of a textbook, and he teaches using real life examples, which really adds to the class. This might actually be considered a small weakness as well, since it is hard to reconcile any differences between lecture notes and the textbook.",
    "The articles the professor assigned us is a really good exposure as a preparation for future research work. The course is indeed helpful as a start of clinical trial research learning.",
    "Overall, I thought this was an excellent course. I loved the interesting stories that the professor was able to give that went along with the principles he was teaching throughout the semester. The mid-term and final were both a bit tough, but I do not think there were any glaring weaknesses. A little more practice (in the form of graded homework) calculating K-M by hand might have been useful going into the final.",
    "The professor gives us a lot of examples in class, which is very helpful. If he adds a little more theoretical explanations, this class would be excellent.",
    "Excellent",
    "The course was very helpful in introducing students to clinical trials. It would've been morehelful if the lecture slides were in more detail.",
    "strengths: Dr Makuch offers a wealth of experience, his stories help to fixate in our memories the concepts he talks about.He is trying to involve the students and maintains the level of attention quite high during his lectures.I was particularly touched by the personal approach and his taking us out for a gathering, he is definitely a superbright and kind man!I also liked the choice of readings: both the textbook and the articles were extremely helpful.",
    "Strengths - It's great to hear real world examples from a professor who clearly has a lot of experience in the field. The class dinner was also great.Weaknesses - It might be helpful to have more experience with quantitative problems in the homework",
    "this course is relevant to regulatory affairs track students, however, I would recommend it only to second year students because the second half of the course if very heavy in linear regression methods.",
    "good",
    "Overall, the course is very well structured and it was fun taking it. The major strengths is the concrete delivery of quantitative tools. At the same time, this is the course's major weakness. For example, one lecture introduced concepts of linear algebra which seemed extremely powerful. Yet, the concepts were only touched instead of explored in further detail. Since the course is, overall, quite quantitative, it might make sense to require a certain level of math entry skills. This suggestion applies, perhaps, to a few other courses at YSPH.",
    "I really enjoyed the course, I think it was a good combination of some basic statistics tools (survival analysis, sample size calculation) and practical clinical trials concepts. I would highly recommend it to both masters and doctorate level students.",
    "Great class! Sometimes difficult to get the take away from lectures but great course overall.",
    "Overall, the course was well structured. I liked learning sample size calculations and survival analysis.",
    "very useful for epidemiological research. can use the concept in drug study into Epi research design.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed Clinical Trials. It provided a good basic overview of the issues that arise when developing and conducting clinical trials.",
    "Survey course of what was needed in clinical trials. Weakness was that I did not feel prepared for the exams since the homeworks did not prepare us.",
    "The overview and the topics covered was great. The final exam included some of the materials that was not covered during the lectures. TA was very helpful.",
    "The course was very good overall. I do wish it was more focused on the statistical analysis rather than the planning of the trials.",
    "This was a great course. It has many practical applications, and the material is very interesting. The book selected does a great job of synthesizing the material and I still use it as a reference as I design research projects. Overall, the course was intellectually stimulating, and provided important practical skills that if applied correctly will save future researches time and effort. This course teaches you to foresee research design problems and correct them before they become a problem.",
    "The lecture topics were very relevant and interesting. The notes will be useful tools to have for future classes and research projects. I also found the homework to be helpful for practicing the skills we learned in class."

Some topics, like survival analysis, are taught in pieces and repeated over some 5 different lectures. Also I appreciate hearing about his experiences but all the storytelling can be very distracting.",

I hope Prof. Makuch can focus more on the basic ideas and principles in clinical trials, instead of going into details some very complicated trial examples, so that beginning learners in this area can understand and follow easily. Also, I hope Prof. Makuch can write the powerprint in a more detailed and clear way.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0a person who has lots of fun",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Overall, the instructor was good. However, I wished that the instructor posts the homework and readings a week before they were due. I had to prioritize my classwork, so knowing the homework and reading assignments one week ahead of when they were due would be have been helpful to me.Also, for one of the final exam questions, an equation was given in class that was necessary to use on one of the final exam questions. The equation should have been introduced in lecture notes and\/or be asked on a homework question so that students are aware of the equation. It was unfair to test the students on an equation that was not discussed in lecture notes and\/or introduced in the homework. The equation was only given at the last day of class and it was written on the board.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0see above-",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Same as above",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is one of the best professors in our school. Dr. Makuch knows how to teach in a way that makes learning something more than an academic task, he knows how to make the material seem relevant and applicable in the field and not just something that lives in textbooks. I enjoy his stories about working in the NIH and how he is able to connect them to the material that he is teaching, it make the point that what we learn is actually something that is useful to us and not just something that we have to learn.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very nice instructor, very experienced and knowledgeable of clinical trials. However, it would be better if the lecture layout is more systematic. For those who know little about clinical trial, some concepts and basic biostats knowledge should be explained in the lecture.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The professor is very nice and eager to help.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The instructor is very experienced and delivers the course in a structured and thoughtful manner. His examples from industry and really enriching and actually quite unique compared to other courses as YSPH. This real life course delivery is clearly the greatest strength.Probably, the major weakness is his unavailability at times to ask questions or discuss the course - he seems like a very busy man.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The instructor was great. Thorough explanation would help to engage students during the lectures, and more case studies would help.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch taught the course very well. He was well prepared for lectures and I always got a lot out of each lecture. The class slides were helpful. The only weakness was that he often would tell stories and get off on tangents in class. Sometimes the stories were helpful to understand the material and I generally enjoyed them, but often they were not.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch is really an expert. His experience in the field spans several decades as well as several continents. He is very knowledgable and personable. He is always ready to provide advice or answer questions. His teaching style is very straightforward, and he often interlaces his lectures with personal experiences that illustrate the point he is trying to make. Very few instructors can bring together his level of expertise and knowledge and combine it with an exceptional teaching style that is straightforward without oversimplifying the material. And yet fewer can share the personal experiences he has had in the field. Overall, I enjoyed Professor Makuch's course.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch is very knowledgeable about study design and analysis of clinical trial data. He very clearly answered questions. I also enjoyed having guest lecturers come to talk about different trial designs and analyses."
