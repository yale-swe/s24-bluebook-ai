   "comments": [
    "This course taught the thinking skills and perspective needed to evaluate a scientific argument. More importantly, it gave a great introduction to the founding works and schools of thought in epistemology.",
    "I learned how to not fall into typical logical pitfalls while writing essays. I also received a broad overview of the science vs pseudoscience debate between famous philosophers throughout history.",
    "I learned about philosophy of science, objectivity in science, applications of science, cultural bias in science, and learned to write academic papers, debate, and critique academic papers",
    "How to read and understand college level texts. How to have intelligent discussions about said texts. How to write essays using problem, claim, warrant, evidence, and motive.",
    "Writing, reading and critical thinking skills. Better perspective on nature of science.",
    "I really felt like I learned how to write an effective research paper and how to analyze essays to understand the basic meaning. Also, I have a better understanding of what science is in its rawest sense and, more importantly, what it is not.",
    "I greatly improved my writing skills and reading abilities. I have a much greater appreciation for the study of science. I am more inquisitive and skeptical. It was a very enlightening course.",
    "I became a better essay writer and I now am better at analyzing and picking apart other people's arguments."

   "comments": [
    "I cannot see a real weakness in this course. It's paced perfectly, the scope of works that we read is broad and interesting, and the instructor does a great job of both involving students in conversations and explaining more complex or confusing elements of the texts we read.",
    "Strengths: -insightful comments -great discussion in general! -challenging but overall amazing readings that are definitely worth it! Weaknesses -sometimes essay feedback is hard to interpret.",
    "Strength: really engaging, great discussions that often continued after class, interesting real world connections at the end of the course Weakness: the Plato unit wasn't my favorite - I think I would've liked it more had it had more applications and science related discussions",
    "Some more in-class discussions on how to improve writing skills would have been beneficial.",
    "The discussions helped a lot in understanding and analyzing the material. There is a good amount of reading involved but helps you gain a better understanding on the subject matter.",
    "I thought that the essays that we had to read and discuss in class were very well chosen to allow students to progress through the course continually questioning the very nature of science while also seeing many different viewpoints of the same discussion. Also, Dr. Templanza is a great professor and makes sure that the students constantly question their own stances on the subjects discussed in class. I would say that the only weakness of this course is that it doesn't give enough time to some very interesting and elaborate essays that could use a couple days to analyze thoroughly.",
    "It is organized incredibly well and the discussions are very engaging. The reading load is very reasonable and the essays are interesting. I think the course was structured perfectly.",
    "This course is very well organized, my biggest criticism would be to say that we should analyze essays which are poorly written as well as those that are well written, this way we would better understand the differences that make an essay work as well as what not to do."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. Not only will your writing skills improved tremendously, but you'll gain a new understanding and appreciation for how science influences the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It does a great job of dealing in science while still being a fundamentally writing course, and I think the conversations and debates in which students engage are fulfilling and interesting.",
    "This English class is amazing, but it is definitely not easy. The readings are at first difficult to understand, and discussions may or may not clear up the confusion. However, Prof Templanza is a very nice and idiosyncratic teacher who will definitely make you laugh and think at the same time. Be prepared for some work though.",
    "I highly enjoyed this course as a science major and it made me think about science from a philosophical and societal standpoint - I strongly recommend this course. Professor Templanza is really great and your perspective of science will definitely be challenged.",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting course and the in-class debates were very stimulating.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course since you gain many skills such as critical reading and writing skills in addition to better articulating your thoughts.",
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to any student that wants to major in the STEM field or otherwise wants to take a deeper look into the scientific method as it was in the past and is today. 10\/10.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is structured very well and has a very reasonable reading load. It is incredibly interesting and very enlightening.",
    "Highly recommended, even if one has no intention of majoring in the humanities."
