    "Professor Luckow is in the process of editing yet another of her own films. She's written, produced, shot, and earned financing for a number of films. Isn't this the kind of person you want to learn from? She's tough but very reasonable. She's opinionated and critical, as she should be. She's helpful and dedicated. The work load is intense! You may not want to take this class if you have a heavy load!",
    "I'd only recommend it if they're willing to put in time. This course is trips to the DMCA, reading responses that feel like extra work on top of the filming and editing you're already doing, and a lot of logistical film shoot nightmares. But that's film. Wouldn't recommend the course as a casual experience.",
    "This class provides the student with an introduction to the equipment and techniques needed to create a short documentary film. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to explore the process of hands-on filmmaking."
