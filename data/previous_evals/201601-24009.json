   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot both about film making and the American industrial food system. There is something for everyone in this course wether that is policy, worker's rights and justice, the questions of feeding the world, socioeconomic barriers to food in America, animal rights, preventing environmental degradation, social mindsets, cinematography, and so much more. The documentaries we watch provide a lot of food for thought, and our conversations were enlightening. The student presentations also taught the class so much, and are a hugely valuable part of the class.",
    "A thorough introduction and overview of our current agricultural system through documentaries, discussions, and insights from Prof. Cheney. This is a strong introduction course to all the aspects of our food system, so none of the areas our studied too in depth.",
    "Take it. it's incredibly low-stress yet you learn a lot about how messed up the food industry is, through the lens of documentary films. Who doesn't love watching movies and talking about food?",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. You can love food or documentary, you don't have to love both, and you'd still love this class. This year, we had three papers, a short one, about 4-5, and midterm one, about 8-10, and a final one (about 4-5) where we propose an idea for a film we'd like to make. We also have a presentation where we present on a particular film we watched that week. It may seem like a lot of work but it's not as much as it sounds, and it seriously one of the best classes out there - Ian is an extremely kind, caring, funny guy who's directed a bunch of great documentaries (King Corn, The Search for General Tso, etc.) and it's great to be in a class with him learning about documentaries and talking about what makes them great and what makes them not so great. If there's a lot of reading one night he'll cancel some of the reading and is very kind and flexible when it comes to class. Other reviews may mention the pop quizzes, but don't worry, he doesn't grade them, it's just for you to know if you're keeping up with the material. The class is a huge amount of fun - we watch great documentaries, read great articles and books and talk about their merits.",
    "The course is a good survey of issues of agriculture and food, and discussions were always productive and stimulating because of Ian's discussion leading. However, the class doesn't go into much depth on the topic of documentary. A lot of the time it felt as if the documentaries were just a prop for talking about food and ag, but weren't a focus of the course. For students who already have a backing in a lot of the topics that were talked about (animal agriculture, organic agriculture, food security, etc.) the class won't be productive.",
    "This class felt like I was just getting a course credit for watching lots of really cool documentaries. I would say that my knowledge of the American food system was expanded much more than that of documentary. I would recommend this class if you want to know where your food comes from and what factors are important to consider in choosing it.",
    "I would recommend the class if students are interested in either documentary or food. It is an interesting class that tries to integrate both. However, note that it is an introductory class to both topics - if you are looking for in depth doc techniques or in depth discussions on ag issues, this course only offers a more basic view",
    "Yes! Take this course. It is so much fun and you really don't need to know anything about documentary to be a part of this class. You basically get to watch food porn and ponder about the ins and outs of global food systems. This class will make you think and question your current thoughts on food but in the best way possible. The professor is great and super easy-going. He makes class unique and interesting. The assignments are creative and pretty open-ended so there's a lot of room to explore. Seminar is fun and sometimes you even get to skype filmmakers and prominent people in the food world! Much less a class and more like a fun discussion section in which you talk about something we all need to survive, food!",
    "Do you like food? Are you interested in food issues? Do you like watching movies about food issues? If yes, this class is for you. A great class with an amazing professor (Ian Cheney is the producer of the documentary King Corn, among other documentaries). Each week has a different theme, and every week you watch a documentary and have a relevant student presentation by two people. Talking with awesome people in the food\/documentary field is also a common occurrence during class -- we skyped Dan Barber, Paul Greenberg, and Kip and Keegan (the creators of documentary Cowspiracy). Class is discussion-based and Ian leads the discussions really well. There are three papers which aren't too difficult - you basically can write about whatever interests you. An awesome class that's not very difficult -- would recommend to anyone interested in learning about\/talking about food issues!",
    "Take it, take it, take it!"
