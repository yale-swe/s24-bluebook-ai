    "Very good, but challenging, course.",
    "The class was excellent and I really enjoyed it. Potentially a greater focus on contemporary European issues would be good, but the historical focus was also excellent.",
    "European Politics boasted nothing but strengths. First and foremost, Professor Cameron is a brilliant scholar--evidently one of the leading experts of his field. No doubt, he is one of the best professors I have had at Yale so far. He is not only incredibly brilliant but also tremendously charismatic, humorous, approachable and caring. He went above and beyond to educate and care for every single one of his students."

    "If you are willing to do in depth, sometimes dry reading, then yes. I definitely learned a lot from the class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely - the class had excellent discussions and I learned a huge amount.",
    "This course is a must-take for anyone interested in the politics of developed nations or Europe more broadly. You will gain tremendously from Professor Cameron's wisdom, the breadth, depth and structure of the material and discussions--facilitated expertly by Professor Cameron--with brilliant classmates."
