    "The colloquium itself is crappy, but that's okay because you can just do homework for other classes on your laptop the whole time. If you're considering the year-long or three-semester essay, do it. You'll get a lot out of thinking about a research question for a long time. The colloquium isn't that bad and will turn into an easy A.",
    "Well, you take this if required. At best, marginally useful to all those involved. At worst, you waste 2 hours\/week that you could have spent doing something far more productive.",
    "If you did research over the summer or plan to do it over winter break, this is a good class to take.",
    "Yes, strongly. Your essay is bound to be more meaningful because you've thought about it, presented on it and tested theories with a very receptive and helpful group of people.",
    "At the risk of sounding tautological: this is the seminar if you are writing a year-long senior essay; if you are planning to write a year-long senior essay, you'll be taking this course.If you are planning to write a senior essay, you should know what to expect; as for this particular seminar, I would say that it was at times helpful and at times frustrating. I wish that there had been more structure to make it more valuable, but at the same time would have resented such... so... ultimately it was probably a-OK.Your success in utilizing the time for this colloquium will depend on what youput in, and how hard you work with your advisor. If you are diligent (and come to school prepared from summer research) then you can do a lot to make your life less stressful in the spring semester. Either way, not a bit deal."
