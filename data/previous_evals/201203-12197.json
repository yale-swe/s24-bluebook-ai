   "comments": [
    "Econ 110 is a great introduction to micro, I highly recommend it IF YOU CAN GET INTO THE SEMINAR. I didn't take the large lecture, but I've heard it's not nearly as good as the seminar. Both professors are knowledgeable and funny. I am not an econ major and I enjoyed the course, but be prepared to do the reading!",
    "I would only recommend Economics 110 05 to students who are interested in economics. In this section you definitely get a lot more personal attention but it can be taxing if you aren't sure whether Econ is for you. The professor is great, the resources are available,you just need to put in the work!",
    "Econ 110 is a thorough introduction to micro and provides a more traditional classroom setting (around 30 people). From what I've heard, it's more challenging than the lecture, but you also get a lot more out of the class. If you're lucky enough to get a spot, take it! It provides a solid foundation of microeconomics and if you're remotely interested in the subject I would recommend it.",
    "It was a very good intro econ course. Not having taken AP econ before, I felt a little lost at the beginning, but completing the reading and psets helped me understand the concepts better.",
    "If you are expecting an intro course, it is not for you. You will find yourself with prospective econ majors, generally caring for their grade, already knowledgeable about econ, and competitive. The professor is sometimes confused, but generally approachable and smart, but the course overall is for people with particularly strong motivation to learn economics.",
    "A class that is challenging at times but very doable. The workload is not too bad as long as you stay on top of your work. I would suggest taking this over the seminar.",
    "Take it over the lecture.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to other students. Some of the material was a little dry (but if you keep up with the reading outside of class, that will solve part of the problem), but the seminar is the best way to learn microeconomics. The work isn't too difficult at all.",
    "If you want a more thorough understanding of the material with more calculus, the seminar is probably better. However, with so many strong students, the curve ends up being determined by pretty nitpicky questions and you can easily get a poor grade despite being very competent. Overall, I probably would have learned as much important information in the lecture and had an easier time.",
    "Yes, highly recommended! Econ 110 was an informative, interesting, and challenging class that provided a comprehensive introduction to the field of microeconomics (and we even delved into some game theory and behavioral economics topics). Professor Simons is knowledgable and enthusiastic about the material, and I'm glad I was able to take the class with her. It was also nice to be in a seminar environment while learning micro - although it was mostly lecture, Prof. Simons usually allowed for some supplementary conversation at the end of class that I found valuable. Her lectures were straightforward, so we were able to cover a great amount of material in class, probably much more than in the lecture. Overall, I'm glad I took the class - it's really applicable, mostly engaging, and not too difficult a QR credit - and feel I came away with a solid foundation for taking some more economics classes. Stay on top of the work!",
    "I took this class because I wanted to take micro and the lecture didn't fit into my schedule. I thought that it good for an intro micro class; Professor Simons was pretty good and I feel like I have a fair understanding of the material. The curve is definitely better in the lecture, and I think that the final was much harder than the midterm, though. Otherwise, I'd recommend it.",
    "I'm not sure what the lecture class is like, so I can't say if it's better or worse. If you're looking to get knowledge of economics, it's pretty good. I stopped keeping up with the readings. I feel like if I had and come to class more prepared, I would have gotten more out of it. Just try and keep up and don't be afraid to ask questions. Also, the problem sets aren't too bad. Working in groups is great."
