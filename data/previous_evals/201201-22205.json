   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend it. It covers material that is very important to learn and be aware of.",
    "Definitely take this class if it is offered again. Cultures of Travel is certainly a diamond in the rough, giving you an opportunity to explore things like study abroad, that one would never otherwise learn about.",
    "Absolutely, especially if Talya is teaching it. You will read great readings and become a better writer and learn a lot about the world and yourself. I feel like I have a different, more informed and aware outlook on life after taking this class.",
    "yes!",
    "Cultures of Travel was an adventure into the world of why travel isn't as awesome as we always thought it was. Which seems like a silly thing to do, but it's actually very worthwhile, and made me re-think a lot of things. As a junior seminar it was a very manageable workload, discussions were fun and interactive, and it was applicable to a lot of areas of life outside just the classroom.",
    "A seminar that changes.every semester. This semester was called cultures of travel, and was a critical look at travel. You read a broad set of theories that will change the way you think and how you see globalization, imperialism, and tourism. If Talya's teaching it, take it.",
    "Cultures of Travel is a fascinating and challenging class that was one of the best I've taken at Yale. The theorists we read in the class were really interesting and applicable to most other cultural studies classes you might take at Yale. The papers were fun to write and each forced us to think in different, but valuable ways. The workload is totally manageable and includes readings that are pretty straightforward, even if they are theoretical.",
    "Yes! I can't recommend this class enough. Everyone should take it- especially if you're considering doing ANYTHING international. (From studying abroad to doing foreign policy stuff in the future.) I feel like it should be required for everyone. It's completely changed how I view the world. It's pretty depressing at times though, as a warning. You realize how everything you do is kind of problematic (from wearing Toms to studying abroad). Expect a personal or existential crisis at some point during the semester.",
    "Cultures of Travel was a class about traveling that focused on anti-imperial, anti-racist theory. Good exposure to a lot of theory that's not taught very often at Yale, even though it should be!",
    "If Talya teaches this class again, take it! The theory may get a bit much at times but it's really interesting.",
    "If this class was offered again with Talya or for that matter of any class was offered with Talya the answer would be to take it. This class has changed the way that I look at the world around me and was interesting and fun throughout."
