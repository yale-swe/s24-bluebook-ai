    "best class",
    "SO GREAT. Jess is the best. Awesome mix of good readings, interesting discussions and interactive activities. Loved the creative component (projects >> papers). Light courseload (5-8 page midterm paper, final project, class presentation) and SO much fun.",
    "Great class interesting course topics",
    "Take this class! It's amazing - one of the more hands on dance classes at Yale. The required papers can be substituted with dance\/film\/relevanr topic projects, so you'll get a better chance to show what you're capable of. The work really isn't bad at all, and frankly it's so interesting that it's not a bother. You'll have so much fun, Jessica is amazing (take her other classes too)."
