    "Great course on special topics in water -- excellent opportunity to discuss current research areas\/sectors of water resource management with two highly regarded professors!",
    "Great class- taught interesting material in much needed detail.",
    "The class is a bit misnamed, as is the syllabus, we didn't really talk much about watercycles or processes, but we did learn a lot about shale gas, energy, hydrology, and virtual water. It was an interesting mesh of topics.I would have liked to hear more about the two professor's research and how it related to what we discussed in class. I think reading the literature in these areas and discussing it was helpful for those of us who were interested but that's all we did. All of the class discussions were really student led.",

    "The discussion and classroom dynamic made it the perfect forum to talk about sometimes controversial topics. Great learning experience!",
    "So I was a tiny bit mislead by the title of the course - but I figured that out on the first day and decided to stick it out. I gained a ton of really good knowledge, but I am not sure how applicable it will be to my professional career. I will be able to talk extensively about fracking and virtual water however. All in all a great course that stimulated a lot of thought and discussion. If I have one regret it is that I felt we often got lost in the details - in my opinion there could have been more effort to focus on the big picture and policy implications rather than one tiny flaw in one part of one guys argument.",
    "Allowed for in depth exploration of new and important topics.",
    "Reading the literature in depth on two very interesting and high-profile areas and determining for ourselves and with our peers our thoughts on the information and the topics.",
    "I really appreciated two professors taking the time to carefully go through journal articles with us and help us to understand the way they analyze arguments and data presented in articles. Because of this strong feature of the course, I felt this was an indispensable course for those wanting to better understand how to interpret and critique journal articles. This should be a fundamental skill acquired in a masters program so I hope that more of these seminar type courses are offered.",
    "The course taught me to read scientific literature carefully and critically."

    "The title... it is definitely not about Watersheds... perhaps Virtual Fracking is a better option.",
    "Organization - materials for class to be distributed through classesv2 earlier",
    "The organization and instruction of the course, and maybe add a bit of breadth in the class with the depth. LIke some watercycles and processes lectures. Just a few.",
    "Although the literature on these subjects is still a work in progress, some of the readings could be improved. Many assigned readings presented a lot of the same information, and there could be some adjustments made to gather new sources. However, as new material is available and with the improved knowledge of the instructors on the topics, the class could easily continue to evolve and become a solid foundation course for students interested in water resources. I also think a guest speaker or two would help break up the presentations every week.",
    "To improve the course, it would be good if the progression of articles in the virtual water portion of the course was streamlined to make a bit more sense in terms of building on background information. Also, it may have been useful if some of the assignments were more completely thought about prior to being assigned to ensure they were doable.",
