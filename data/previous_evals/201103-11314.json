    "The professor was not familiar with the program software which was what the course was based on. As a result, if there were any problems with the program, she was unable to help.",
    "Readings were well chosen, but lectures could move too fast through the atmospheric science that students were not as familiar with.",
    "I feel very fortunate that this class was offered while I am a student at FES. I think it is a tremendous asset to the school, and I would certainly encourage other students to take the course. Nadine's lectures are very clear and really do start from the very beginning so that non-scientists can take full advantage of the course.I would love to see the course split into two courses, though. I think it would be useful to have a course focused solely on the material covered in lectures--a scientific overview (quite in-depth) of the Earth's climate--and a course focused solely on modeling--which would likely be a more advanced course. The climate model used in the class was fun to use, and the experiments were interesting. I would definitely like to see a course more focused just on modeling, though--there does not seem to be a course like that anywhere at Yale (not in FES, G&G, etc.), and it would truly be an asset for such a course to be based at FES.The choice of papers was also excellent--they were scientific articles, but the quantity and length of the articles was kept to a minimum so that students could easily do all of the reading and understand the content.",
    "Interesting class, good introduction to climate models, helpful and knowledgeable instructor. Very light on the mechanics of the models such as the mathematical treatment, though.",
    "Keep up with the good work!"

    "-organization-running the labs and the assignments-use of the program and instruction relating to the program",
    "Better knowledge of program used for labs (edGCM) and how to fix it if it doesn't run properly on student's laptops",
    "The final project is a great idea that could benefit for some additional tweaking. Getting to work with a climate model is a really exciting part of the class. But for the final project, some of the conclusions seem preordained - increasing the CO2 trend will lead to warming, for example, or the model does not have enough resolution to do regional studies. More time with the instructor is needed to come up with interesting ideas that can be modeled. Editing some model parameters will be a more difficult but more intellectually rewarding project.",
    "We should have more support to solve problems that program has. Also we should have TA to learn all the tools that the program has.",

    "The course is a technical course, which fits very well with my background.",
    "I was very happy that FES offered this course. Climate modeling is important for anyone interested in climate change to understand since so much of our future understanding is predicated on these models. It is naturally difficult to balance a course between the physical science of climate modeling and educating students interested in policy about climate models. I hope this course continues to be offered so that the instructor can improve the material and students can benefit for learning about this important aspect of climate change.",
    "Climate models link emissions to predicted climate change. It is the latter that matters, not the former in se but it is the easiest variable to manipulate. It is important to understand the limitations and possibilities of climate models to know what position to assume in the emissions space, dominated by energy-related carbon dioxide.",
