    "This course gave me a deep understanding of Musil's epic novel \"the man without qualities\", which was structured through the wider context of Musil's oevre and main motifs. The ongoing close reading created a one long discussion throughout the semester in the deepest level possible. In addition to the vast knowledge on Musil and his work, the course helped me develop the skills of close yet well contextualizes reading."

    "The focusing on one main work was of benefit to the class and discussion. I wish we had more courses focusing in one masterpiece allowing to observe through it wider literary, philosophical and historical phenomenons and questions. The choice of secondary literature was inspiring and contributed a lot to the class."
