   "comments": [
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to people who are like me: needing a pre-1800 for the English major, but not too enamored of most of the standard pre-1800 options. Professor Rawson makes texts that I often would otherwise find dry absolutely fascinating.",
    "The reading list is a wild ride; from Horace to Swift to Eliot, you'll read things that blow your socks off and things that bore you to tears. Satire itself is often either hilarious or very upsetting, and that sort of shows up in how you feel about the class while you're taking it. Rawson insists on really nitpicky (how do you spell that?) exams and lots of assignments, so it's a class you'll really have to commit to. He is sort of charming and sort of inept. Very knowledgeable, but perhaps a bit infirm. Take it for Gulliver's Travels. What a great book. Actually, all the Swift and Pope part of the semester was really great. The rough parts were the Romans at the beginning, and boring Renaissance satirists like Marston. Who the hell is Marston? Auden at the end was fantastic, too.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It is so much fun, even if the discussion was a bit tangential at times.",
    "Yes, it was a really good course.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have taken an English seminar before. It's tough: the grading of essays is tough and the tests require very specific recall of details from all texts. So there's really no way to get around doing almost all the reading. Also, you must have read both Paradise Lost and the Iliad to really get a lot out of this course. I hadn't and was at a loss.",
    "This class was a Directed Studies class at the next level up. The reading was classics, but really good works that I always felt I should have read at some point in my life. Professor Rawson is a clear speaker who really knows his subject area- he edited most of the volumes used for the class. He really pushes the class to get to a more than surface reading of these texts. His tests and IDs were ridiculously difficult, but I learned a lot!"
