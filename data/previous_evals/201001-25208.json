    "Good class. Bring your laptop because the lecture doesn't always require your full attention. The workload is minimal.",
    "I would say that this is a great course if you're interested in psychology, or the law, or both. Or neither. This is a great course for anyone who likes to learn about interesting subject material and isn't uncomfortable with re-evaluating your views about certain subjects. There is a lot of reading, but the exams are based mostly on the lectures, which you won't want to miss anyway because they are so interesting.",
    "Don't expect much law in this class. You will not read a single Supreme Court opinion. If you are interested in the law, take Greg Huber's Crime and Punishment instead. You will discuss many of the same topics in a more rigorous and legal setting.",
    "Yes, take it! The law is intertwined with so many aspects of our society and learning about it from a psychological aspect is very interesting and rewarding. I learned so much! It's also not too much work. The overall structure of the course is not very well organized, so often in lecture it seems like Prof. Lockhart is jumping from one topic to the next. However, Prof. Lockhart tells you everything (literally, everything) that will be on the midterm and final so the disorganization doesn't really affect your grade and it was definitely worthwhile.",
    "Prof. Lockhart is very nice, and the lectures were usually entertaining. There's nothing that isn't already common sense though. Take it for an easy A.",
    "take it. easy a. baller course",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject matter. If you take it Cr\/D\/F, be sure to study so you don't accidentally end up getting a D...",
    "Interesting and not too much work. Take it!",
    "Psych and the Law is kind of a crap shoot. On the one hand, you will learn a lot of really interesting information. On the other, you will have to memorize a lot before the midterm and final and write reading responses every week. I think it's a good class is you're committed to actually attending lecture each week, but because Professor Lockhart puts the lecture slides online it's really tempting to skip class. Overall, it is a super interesting class, but it could be structured and taught better. Not a must take, but still valuable, especially if you're interested in the law.",
    "No. This course taught me very little that I did not already know. The \"law\" part of this course is nearly non-existant. We never read a single case, and the law journal articles assigned were pathetic. The \"pysc\" part basically re-affirms common sense with terrible data. The exams are really tedious, and lecture is boring as heck.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course since it is not too much work and you learn a variety of interesting things.",
    "Kristi Lockhart is going to give you as much information as she possibly can in an hour and fifteen minutes, and while she's really knowledgeable, it adds up to a LOT of information. Section's worth a third, but it doesn't relate to the class at all (meaning lots of reading in a very thick course packet, leading a discussion section, writing a final paper and visiting a courthouse).",
    "Psychology and Law: Several things are discussed: Racial profiling, eyewitness testimony, confessions, recovered memories, judges, juries, death penalty, and moreI absolutely recommend this class, and I have done so to many of my friends already.",
    "An interesting course that is graded fairly. Great for non-psych majors.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course if you don't mind the workload. It was my favorite class this semester and Kristi Lockhart is a great professor. The workload, however, includes a midterm, final, section, thought questions, being a section leader, and a final paper. Fair grading overall though, and the final paper is fun to write since you actually get to observe a court case and write about it. Prof. Lockhart is a bit biased towards males during class, but it's pretty funny when she makes remarks about how males are responsible for all the crime and deviance in society. Finally, I want to emphasize that you learn a lot about both psychology and law in this class, and if you're interested in either one, or both, it's a must take. One of the better psych classes Yale has to offer.",
    "Take this class! The material is so interesting and very applicable to real life.",
    "Psyc 330 is all about criminal law and not even so much about law, but about criminals. You only have to read the course packet and don't have to read the textbook at all. But go to class! Professor Lockhart covers everything that is on the test during her lectures (including examples from the assigned readings). Go to the review sessions because she outlines what the exam covers.",
    "Informative, at times entertaining, at times boring. Prof. Lockhart rambles too much but has a lot of good anecdotes. A little too jaded about the legal system - I came out of the class feeling a bit like she had just pointed out all of its flaws. Kind of dramatic\/sensationalist. Overall pretty good though. Exams are not too bad provided that you've studied. Not necessary to do all the reading.",
    "Take it if you are interested in psychology, and have a side interest in the law. It is not a law course, but it does provide a lot of terminology and cases which would prove helpful for law school.",
    "If you are very interested in the subject matter take it. The course load isn't bad, but lectures are kinda boring.",
    "Um, I don't know. It's cool...but not worth the workload I don't think.",
    "Probably not. While I did learn a lot about the legal system, it wasn't very enlightening as a psychology class.",
    "Easy, intuitive, interesting. The best kind of course.",
    "This class rocks. Take it.",
    "I don't think I would recommend it. The work load is not bad, but the class is sort of boring.",
    "Good, straightforward class. Exam questions are a bit nitpicky and overly technical.",
    "A lot about blacks and the law, the mentally disabled, and procedural stuff. Interesting for a non-psych major. Too easy and too little thinking for someone who is really interested in psych.",
    "This is an awesome course. If you like Criminal Minds or Law and Order, take this course. You learn all about interesting cases and the basics of law with a psychological twist. Keep in mind though that the exams are a lot of material to memorize, but its worth it. And section is worth 1\/3 of your grade so if you put in the effort, you will do well without a problem.",
    "This class is a must-take at Yale. I learned so much about the criminal justice system, and it is a great primer for those (like myself) who don't know much about the legal system going in.I found the topics covered absolutely fascinating, and it has definitely alerted me to the numerous social justice issues within the legal system and the huge need for reform. You will definitely be startled, saddened, and disgusted by some of the miscarriages of justice that you learn about.The class is a decent amount of work between exams and sections, but it is fairly easy. Professor Lockhart tells you exactly what topics to study for the exams, which is very helpful.",
    "The material covered is certainly interesting and the course packet readings especially are great, but lectures are almost intolerable because they are so dull. Still, if you are interested at all in the criminal justice system, I would recommend taking this class. It definitely gives you an interesting perspective on legal matters, and the assignment at then end of observing a court trial is particularly worthwhile.",
    "PSYC 330 is a great psychology class, mandatory section, weekly responses, a midterm, a final and a final paper. The work is manageable and the topics are interesting.",
    "Yes.",
    "The course is very interesting! It is definitely worth taking. The class is not too difficult, just keep up with all the studies that Professor Lockhart covers.",
    "Not a lot of work- 4-5 page paper, midterm, final exam, plus weekly written responses for section. Fascinating material made even more interesting by Professor Lockhart's lecture style.",
    "YES YES ABSOLUTELY! I loved this class!! It was so great and so well taught. Professor Lockhart loved what she was teaching and made every class fun. This is one of my favorite classes at Yale. If you take no other Psychology class, you must take this one.",
    "If you have the energy to actually pay attention, the material is worthwhile. The problem is that it could probably be covered equally well in about a third the amount of class time.",
    "Take if if you're interested in the bridges between psychology and the law, but don't expect anything mind-blowing. The amount of readings and assignments can sometimes be too much, but I solved that problem by not doing the readings. You can easily get by without them and just studying the lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Just be ready to learn your law cases.",
    "It was an interesting topic of study but I felt like Professor Lockhart was all over the place with her lectures. Strengths included how interesting the topics were and that it was pretty easy to study for the exams. Weaknesses were the lectures, they were really easy to tune out and the ridiculous amount of reading assigned. I think if the amount of reading were streamlined or less costly, that would be great. I wouldn't recommend it to students who don't like lots of reading or her lecture style...",
    "I think that all students should take it, even non-psychology majors- a lot of information is extremely interesting regarding the US Justice system. Professor Lockhart is very friendly and also teaches well, especially for a lecture.",
    "Psych and the law is a decent class. You don't need to do the readings (you can skim the ones required for the reading responses) and you (arguably) don't need to go to lecture. Lectures can be a little slow, so be prepared to sporcle pretty often. Exams are straightforward, so it's easy to do well without investing too much time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "An in-depth analysis of how the legal system and psychology relate\/interact with each other. A lot of interesting issues are covered, such as the death penalty, philosophy on prisoner treatment, and underlying reasons for crime. Recommended for a strong professor and interesting material. Should be started as a credit\/D due to the heavy coursework and reasonably-challenging midterm.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in what the title says. Its very interesting and not too much work. One of the better courses I have taken.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The class was very interesting and you end up learning a lot of interesting things about psych and the law. You don't need to have any psychology background since the class is very accessible to everyone. She makes the lectures easy to understand, though they can be a little boring. The review sheets before the exams have all the information you need for the test, but I recommend going to every lecture, because even if you don't take notes or pay too much attention, you still retain the information you hear.",
    "If you have any interest in the law and how various psychological phenomena impact legal proceedings, I would definitely recommend this class. The material is interesting, and it gives you a much deeper appreciation for the legal process, especially in criminal proceedings (the primary focus of the class).",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in either law or psychology. Especially if you like crime shows like Law& Order, CSI, etc. There's a lot of reading and a few films--the readings are usually pretty interesting, and the films definitely are, but sometimes the work is a lot to keep up with. Midterm and final both have crazy amounts of information on them, but Professor Lockhart has review sessions to tell you what will be on the test. Also: 8 reading responses and a4-5 page paper. Separate syllabi for the lecture classes and section, which is interesting, but sometimes frustrating.",
    "If you are really interested in both psychology and the law and how they play off of each other, this is the best course for you. It takes a lot of learning on your own and going to class is a must in order to understand the slides.",
    "Good class to learn about the criminal law system.",
    "Definitely check out the class if you're looking into a psych application outside of the clinic. I'll say it kind of makes you doubt the fairness of the legal system (if you didn't already have your doubts), and shows you plenty of ways to manipulate it (easier said than done, I'm sure). That said, I picked this as a fifth class and I'm not sure that's wise. I either had to invest more than Iwanted to or not spend as much time as I would have liked to study for tests (there's a lot of cases \/ studies to remember).",
    "Psych 330 was a very interesting course. The structure was fairly normal with lectures and sections. Sections often went over very interesting topics. I would highly recommend it for this reason, along with the fairly reasonable workload. Work typically involved some reading and a thought question response (about a page). There was also a midterm, a paper, and a final exam.",
