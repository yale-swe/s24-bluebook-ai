   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it, though I'd give the caveat that class discussions sometimes seem slow.",
    "History 805 01 is a basic readings course on Latin America (mostly the Spanish areas) before independence. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Latin America or early colonialism.",
    "Invaluable preparation if you want to do a field in colonial LatAm (probably every book will end up on your list). You'll get more out of it if you try to do some of the supplementary readings. Professor is a world class expert, but also quite friendly and accessible. May also be useful for people working on early modern period in other regions.",
    "Would recommend for all graduate history students in Latin American history, as well as historians of British or other imperialisms looking for comparative background in context of spanish empire.",
    "Thematic review of scholarship of colonial Latin America. I would recommend this course, although I wish there had been a bit more lecturing (in conjunction with the student presentations)."

   "comments": [
    "Introduced me to a broad set of methodological concerns",
    "This course helped me to consider many of the problems intrinsic to the study of colonial Latin American history in more detail. Prof. Schwartz also provided useful advice about the more practical aspects of being a historian.",
    "Great preparation for minor field (and a course I may be expected to teach someday). Discussions influenced the way I intend to frame my dissertation topic.",
    "Hard to say as I am first year, but I would say, perhaps indirectly, as my dissertation will in all likelihood focus on modern Cuban history.",
    "This course was extremely insightful and helped lay the foundation for my future work."
