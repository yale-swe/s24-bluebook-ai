    "This class is invaluable and Dr. Ashton's mastery of the subject matter is remarkable. More importantly, he clearly cares about engaging students and goes above and beyond to incorporate relevant information and student interests to make the material even more relatable. Best professor I have had at Yale!",
    "The professor was enthusiastic, offered a wealth of knowledge, and is clearly committed to his students and their understanding of the course content.",
    "I cannot state the value of the course (Question 12) strongly enough. If I had taken Silviculture my 1st year instead of my 2nd, I likely would have changed my whole research focus. Excellent, excellent course with one of the most impressive professors at this school. Mark is a joy to learn from.",
    "Mark was an excellent instructor. Some of the course material covered during lectures could have been explained more succinctly, but I think the field trips really helped with that.",
    "I found that this course felt a bit exclusionary for non-forestry students, and the amount of detailed material was extensive. The final prescription and exam assumed a knowledge and level of detail I did not feel prepared for.",
    "It'll be good to have a single actual textbook for the class that people can just buy and then keep afterward, rather than many pdf's--made it a little harder to read when everything was on the computer. Field trips were overall valuable, although I wish we'd gotten a bit more diversity in stands--not just water company land, a nursery, and an urban spot; Quabbin would have been great + a non-water (e.g., wildlife) stand would have been valuable.",
    "1. The readings were great! They were a wonderful review of lecture material and were well-organized.",
    "This was a very special course that I would recommend to all students, both those preparing for a career in forestry and others curious about management practices.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and it helps me to understand forestry a lot!",
    "I think the class would have been improved by additional field trips to East Rock or West Rock Parks for more experiential education opportunities.",
    "I took this class because it got excellent reviews from almost everyone I talked to who already took it. I was not disappointed! This is definitely a must-take class at FES, even if you aren't an MF or MFS. Though challenging for me, this is one of the best classes I've taken at FES. I loved it.",
    "For questions one and two, I declined to answer because: 1) I did not do any of the outside readings--I found lectures to be clear and understandable, and if I was confused about something I consulted the recorded online lectures; 2) I don't recall any outside-of-class assignments except of course field trips and exams which were basically parts of class. I said the workload was roughly the same for other courses because while I had relatively little work outside of class, the amount of time spent in class or on a class activity was much greater than any other class I've taken at Yale. I thought the field trips could have been a little smoother or more useful at times. I really liked the organization and activities on the Yale Meyers trip. Some of the other trips felt a bit like wandering through the woods (which I enjoy, but not in a group of 20+ people) or listening to a lecture and I would have preferred a bit more structure or group activities. That said, the information I learned on the field trips from Dr. Ashton was extremely interesting so I'd still like there to be some of that. I really appreciated Dr. Ashton's humor and energy and enthusiasm for both the material and his students (and life). However, sometimes I felt we could have accomplished a little more, or finished lectures quicker if Dr. Ashton stayed a little more on track or spent a little less time poking fun at students (some of that is essential to create an interactive, attentive class who like each other, but at times it detracted from the lecture and felt a bit out of place or a little too much).",
    "The textbook is excellent. The field trips help to ground many concepts boarded on class and to start gaining experience on practical aspects of silviculture."

   "comments": [
    "Field trips were both fun and engaging and really helped to solidify the course material. The field exam was also really enjoyable.",
    "The material and subject matter is very real-world applicable and tangible, but the instructor (Dr. Ashton) is by far the best part of this course.",
    "Learning in the classroom and in the field. The professor's passion for teaching and silviculture came across in lectures, which were excellent.",
    "I have never looked forward to going to a class at 8:30 AM, but I truly enjoyed Silviculture. Mark's passion is tangible, and he is a challenging but fair professor in every way. I loved the field trips. I feel that hands-on learning is critical for this type of work, and learning from Mark is just great.",
    "The field trips were definitely helpful in solidifying concepts and ideas that we learned in class. It was nice to spend so much time in the woods.",
    "I really liked the overnight field trip and felt that was when I learned the most information.",
    "You cannot miss this class if you have any interest in how plants grow.",
    "Mark's extensive knowledge, the extremely relevant readings and field trip, the class spirit that evolved over the semester.",
    "The readings were so clear and to the point. And all the work Mark puts into the field trips and material. Also listening to Mark at 8:30 am brightens my day.",
    "I thought this course was excellent. Professor Ashton is an incredible resource and knows this material as well or better than anyone else. He wrote the book. I thought it was extremely valuable course even for folks who are not MFs or MFS's. If you want to manage land (or water) resources in any capacity you should take silviculture.",
    "Ashton's charisma and ability to break down complex concepts into simpler\/more manageable narratives",
    "Mark's seemingly boundless knowledge of and enthusiasm for the subject, and the field trips, which were an excellent way to synthesize lectures and readings and put things into context.",
    "The course was very comprehensive, which made it difficult to master the material, but helped me see the big picture and how all of it fit together. It also taught me that silviculture is a very comprehensive field and that many components go into a field prescription. The field trips were also great. I was unfortunately not able to make all of them, and there were quite a few! The ones I did attend were worthwhile and helped drive home the concepts.",
    "The best aspects of this course were the field trips. This was a great way to engage with the course material in a practical and dynamic way.",
    "I greatly enjoyed the field trips offered in the course.",
    "The field trips were both fun and educational.",
    "The field trips are very interesting",
    "I really enjoyed the chance to do some hands-on learning in the form of field trips, and I feel that was able to gain a much greater understanding and appreciation of global forests.",
    "Mark Ashton makes this course very enjoyable. He has so much knowledge and loves to teach. The instructor is the best aspect of the course.",
    "The field trips were the most useful aspect of the course; especially the group work during the field trips.",
    "The best aspects of this course: - Professor Ashton. His lectures are engaging, entertaining, well-prepared, and jam-packed with useful information. Professor Ashton is a true scholar, with expertise that is both wide and deep. He pays careful attention to the quality of his instruction and clearly cares about the learning outcomes of his students. He is a gem at this school. - The field trips! They were well-organized, well-timed to coincide with the content of instruction, and good fun. - The class culture. A sense of camaraderie was cultivated among the students, facilitated by weekly \"Silviculture Breakfast,\" frequent field trips, and playful lectures.",
    "The field trips - that's where I really learned the most. Mark's course set up is fairly traditional, with two hour lectures twice a week. The field trips are where he really comes alive and his joy for teaching and forestry is really evident. Plus, some of the concepts are relatively easy to grasp in theory, but really make sense once you see them in place out in the forest.",
    "The best aspect of the course was Dr. Ashton's infectious love of forestry and the material and his humorous and engaging delivery. Naturally, I find the material interesting on its own, but this was especially true with Dr. Ashton's teaching style and extensive knowledge. The field trips were also a wonderful component to this course as they provided a chance for students to get outside and apply what they're learning in the real world, something I've found surprisingly uncommon in many Yale classes. They also provided a good way to get to know the other students in the class outside of the classroom. And the exams too. These were by far the most fun and creative yet challenging exams I've taken at Yale and I really appreciated that.",
    "The instructor and TA are very responsive and take care of every detail. The field trips are great way to settle concepts and to start feeling comfortable with the practice of silviculture. The class integrates very well social and ecological aspects of silviculture and is very inclusive of concepts such as traditional silviculture and agroforestry."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Perhaps more interaction with silvicultural applications, ideally through field trips.",
    "Would not change a thing.",
    "I would have loved to gain more experience throughout the course practicing silviculture prescriptions before taking the midterm and\/or final exam. One or two take home assignments that ask students to develop a silviculture prescription for a given landscape would have been helpful. The final exam asked questions that felt peripheral to the main content covered in the course. I believe the final should reflect key takeaways from the course instead of trivial material (which can be left to bonus questions). An in-field lecture on tree ID would have been very helpful in the beginning.",
    "This is very small: I would've loved a pinch more tree ID (though we did a great deal of that in the field).",
    "I wish there was a way to incorporate the text book readings, or even other readings related to the field, into the class. A discussion-style lecture on the readings once a month or so could have been useful and encouraged people to stay on top of them.",
    "None",
    "I think the course should be smaller to facilitate a better learning environment and ensure everyone is on the same track.",
    "I enjoyed the class thoroughly.",
    "I thought the readings were extremely valuable but honestly didn't do them until right before tests. It would be helpful (even though people would probably think it's annoying at first) if the TF's could hold a bi-weekly or at least one a month discussion about the readings that was mandatory instead of the review sessions.",
    "The field trips were great, but Professor Ashton has some pretty high expectations regarding extra lectures outside of the normal class period. While I value the passion and the information delivered in the extra lectures, I thought it was a bit beyond what should be expected of students in terms of an in-class time commitment.",
    "Timing\/pacing; lectures should a)be contained to their actual allotted time, b)get to everything in the Powerpoint\/notes, given how long is allotted for each one. I also wish we'd spent more time on silviculture for applications like water, wildlife, a bit more rigorous focus on quantitative, etc. The agroforestry and urban stuff was interesting but I felt like I knew much of it already.",
    "I wouldn't change anything about the course.",
    "Although the trips are a great opportunity, I found there were insufficient opportunities to supplement our grades beyond the in-class exams. I found it overwhelming to keep up with the volume of information presented in the class, and believe periodic assignments would contribute to a stronger understanding of what is to be expected in course examinations.",
    "There should be more incentive to do the readings in a timely manner, perhaps discussion groups. The readings are great, but I found myself putting them off until right before the exams.",
    "The workload was too heavy.",
    "I struggled a bit with some of the lectures (though perhaps this is also partially because I am not a morning person!) Some variation in activities within the course meeting time in order to have more student interaction would be helpful, I think.",
    "Utilize the local outdoor classroom more - we could go outside to Sachem woods for example.",
    "Sometimes we wouldn't finish lectures within the allotted class time - I wish I hadn't needed to watch the ends of so many lectures on Canvas (though I was grateful that so many lectures had been recorded).",
    "As mentioned above, I think the lectures could be a little more on track so as to cover the necessary amount of material in an organized fashion that is not rushed. I don't think any more material should be covered in the class as I felt pretty saturated (in a good way) throughout the course and wouldn't have had time to take in much more. I also think the field trips could be a little more organized and feature greater student engagement as opposed to lectures.",
    "The theme selection that is intended to be taught in this course is very ambitious and many very important concepts are addressed briefly or not even get to be addressed. I think this is related to the fact that the class is designed for a very broad audience with or not experience in forestry and ecology concepts. I would advice to think about designing two different classes: one that addresses basic concepts of forest ecology and some silviculture that needs to be understood for people that will use it indirectly and another course that can dive more in depth to silvicultural prescriptions."

As mentioned above, I found them highly effective in getting students out of the classroom, meeting classmates, and transferring concepts from a power point to an actual forest. However, I think they could have been a bit more hands on, or involved more group work to allow students to test their knowledge more effectively than answering the occasional question, or trying to fit more knowledge into their heads from a lecture."

It is also clear to see why the MF program is so well-respected and highly-regarded with instructors like Dr. Ashton.",

    "My research focuses primarily on freshwater ecosystems, and I wanted to understand the impacts of forests on watershed management. I learned everything I hoped to and then some (all very valuable). Again, I would've changed my entire focus here had I met and worked with Mark early enough in my 2 year program.",
    "As someone who will likely work in the field of forestry and\/or forest conservation, this course was a keystone in my education in this program.",
    "This course is one every MF\/MFS should take, therefore it fit perfectly into the rest of my degree program, especially after taking Stand Dynamics in the fall.",
    "It's an essential class to my mastery of Forestry and my understanding of landscape scale dynamics. Mixes theory and practice in the best way I've seen to date.",
    "Supports my interests in trees and gives me a good vocabulary to speak to folks who manage the land that I will want to work on in the future.",
    "Necessary for my degree",
    "My focus is human dimensions of natural resource management so this course is more based in the natural sciences than other courses I take. It was able to inform the work I do by helping me understand the decisions that go into forest management and different decisions that shape the landscape.",
    "This course is good for future career building",
    "I have been hoping to gain greater understanding of plant biology and ecology to apply to work in agriculture, and took this course in that context.",
    "Working in mining closure, and including forests as necessary aspects of mining reclamation, this course was a great fit.",
    "This course is an essential component of the Master of Forestry degree. The content is relevant to all aspects of forestry - industry, conservation, urban, landscape design, etc. It was a great follow-up course to \"Stand Dynamics,\" and will be a useful prerequisite for \"Management Plans\" - I appreciate how this trio of courses build off of each other so well.",
    "I am not an MF or MFS, so the forestry classes I've taken are mainly for interest. (I also think, as a student at the School of Forestry, that I should have some basic knowledge about forests!) I am studying conservation, and I took silviculture because I think it's important for me to have an understanding of how forests work and how they are managed because I'll probably end up working in conservation in a heavily-forested area.",
    "As an undergrad E&EB major, this course is very important to me. Perhaps first and foremost because it took me into the great outdoors. I find it quite astonishing that one could go through four years of college and leave with a degree in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology having taken almost entirely classes in which you never had to go outside. So this class thankfully did not follow that paradigm and taught us practical skills that we then took into the field and used. It was also extremely useful in teaching me how to read and understand a landscape better, especially from a human land-use point of view. Of all the classes I have taken at Yale this has been one of the most useful to my major and I can't even count it towards my major. Isn't that odd?",
    "Its one of the most important courses for me as an MF. I would even consider making it a two semester course. Content is very important and it is also the course that helps integrate social, ecological and technical aspects learned in other courses."

    "NA",
    "I didn't participate in a formal work group, but often discussed the concepts learned and strategies for studying for the midterm and final exam with an informal group of classmates, which I found helpful considering the breadth of information covered.",
    "I loved the group work during field trips (and the final field exam). Discussing possible management decisions with peers is a great way to learn, especially given the range of experience levels present in the class.",
    "We really only did group work during the field trips, but it was a fun way to bounce ideas off of one another and learn each other's strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I wasn't asked to be part of a work group, but would have found it valuable if groups were organized.",
    "I liked working in groups during the field trips. It was helpful talking things through.",
    "People all are very collaborated and I really enjoy working with them.",
    "Many of my classmates had more background in forestry, and I benefited a lot from being able to discuss the course content with them.",
    "The advantage is that it is easy to learn from peers and easier to learn by teaching others. The disadvantage is if one relies on shared brainstorms too much, one will not learn to think alone.",
    "There were no group projects, per se, but a lot of the field trips had group exercises in them. This was great for me since I could rely on my teammates for help, and we could work through the exercises together. I think a lot of students found this helpful, since we were all coming into the course with varying degrees of experience in forestry.",
    "I found the group work to be very useful and fun. It allowed me to get to know other students, and also learn about their interests. It was also a good way for a few students to practice concepts from class and receive advice\/guidance in a way that everybody got to take part, but more efficiently than doing individual work. It was also a fun way to learn from classmates and practice work that would often be done in groups in a job setting."

   "comments": [
    "Do the readings!",
    "Take it! You will learn so much from this course no matter what level you come in at and Dr. Ashton will make the material fun and engaging. I cannot stress enough how valuable this course was to me and how real-world applicable it is to anyone working with forestland and \/ or conservation more generally.",
    "Definitely take the course before graduating. It is time consuming, but well worth it. The readings are the most helpful when read in tandem with relevant lectures. Pace yourselves and stay on top of the readings from the get-go.",
    "You should do it! Do not save the readings for exam studying--read as you go through the lectures. And, take good lecture notes. Mark is a wealth of knowledge who can teach you so many valuable things. Listen to everything he says, and write down as much as you can to read later. I will keep my notes from this class permanently.",
    "Make sure you have enough time available for all of the field trips and readings. It is time consuming, but worthwhile.",
    "Begin studying for the midterm and final exams as early as possible.",
    "Take it, but be prepared for a lot of work. It's well worth it.",
    "Make sure you give yourself enough time to do the work .",
    "TAKE IT and do the readings before lecture like he says to.",
    "Take it! no matter what your interests are at FES, I feel like this course is valuable.",
    "Actually do the readings and stay on top of them each week--you'll probably get a lot more from the lectures if you do!",
    "Go on all the field trips! They're a central part of the course.",
    "There is some hard natural science in this class, so it's a good introduction to applied science and applications of research for pure scientists.",
    "Attend all of the field trips that you are able to.",
    "I would recommend attending all field trips if possible, they are very educational. I would also recommend doing all of the readings in a timely manner.",
    "I think I will. But will also remind them to take the heavy workload into consideration.",
    "The lectures can be a bit of a challenge if that is not your learning style but overall, you should go for it!",
    "Being in Forestry school, this course is a must!",
    "Keep up with the readings. Watch the lectures online before class.",
    "- It is useful though not essential to take Stand Dynamics before taking this class. - It's worth it to have a conversation with Professor Ashton early on in the semester so that he knows what you're specializing in and what you're trying to get out of the class. He can help tailor his instruction to meet your needs and make reference to your interests during lectures.",
    "Don't fall behind on the readings like I did! Since there are only two exams, and no assignments in between, it's easy to push the readings aside to work on other coursework. I think I wouldn't have been nearly as stressed studying for exams if I had kept up with readings, because the readings complimented the lecture materials. Also, just note that there are field trips almost every Friday. You don't have to go on every single one, but understand that they do take up a lot of your time and if you really are set on having Fridays off, don't take the class. Make sure you go on the overnight field trip if you can though! That was my favorite one - we learned so much and it's a lot of fun!",
    "First off, definitely take the class while Dr. Ashton is teaching it. He'll convince you to get up that hill multiple times a week when most people are still sleeping. He's great. Second, definitely attend the lectures, and as many field trips as possible--you learn so much from them! Also, for studying for the exams, watching the recorded lectures can help solidify material or see it from a different angle since it is often a bit more clear and organized than the in-person lectures are. Having heard the material (especially bits I was confused about) twice from a couple different angles was very helpful.",
    "Highly recommendable course! Addresses broad aspects of forstry, useful for urban forestry, agroforestry, industrial forestry, community forestry etc. It is a very high time requiring course so balance with other courses."
