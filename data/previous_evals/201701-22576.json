    "This course covered expansive new grounds for me in terms of historical and thematic content. I do not think I have stepped away from any other course in my time here and felt so transformed, so matured by the work. In addition to historical material, Professor Allen also continued her commitments to making her students better readers, writers, and discussants, and for that I am also incredibly grateful."
