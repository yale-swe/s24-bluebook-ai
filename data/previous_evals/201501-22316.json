    "Take notes carefully because in the ppt posted, there is no caption",
    "Definitely recommend it. You learn so much about the first civilizations in the world - what can be more exciting than that ?? It added so much to my understanding of the world, history, art, and archaeology at large.",
    "A great course if you are looking to not only learn about the Art and the Near East and the Aegean, but the history as well. Too often art and artifacts are overlooked as historical tools, and this class will expose you to a breadth of knowledge. Every class is exciting! Prof. Foster is a great teacher, as well.",
    "A great way to learn interesting material in a low-stress environment that encourages learning. You will never be bored and will certainly take away important history."
