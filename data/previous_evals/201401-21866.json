    "Blue is a class where you make art, talk about art, and hear experts talk about art. Several interesting guest speakers come in to talk about the medium of art they work with. The gallery visits were fun and different from any other class. In blue you'll learn more about yourself and what you are capable of in terms of writing and art. I would definitely recommend this class on the basis of the excellent professor and relaxed environment.",
    "YES. This class is amazing. Jessica is amazing. You have to take this class. It's okay if you've never taken an art class before--most of us had not. More than anything, this course teaches you how to think about abstraction and understand the conceptual motives behind artwork. It's pretty challenging at times and Jessica really pushes you to think about your own work as well. There is a visual project and a short written assignment each week. For the visual assignments we worked across different mediums (collage, painting, iPad, film, photography). They require a lot of thought and work, but it's a fun type of work (better than essays and problem sets for sure). We went to the art museums and libraries every week to look at different pieces using blue and learned how to interpret them. We had guest speakers. We watched films. We had fun. Everyone's final projects were incredible. Take this class. Just do it. It's unlike any other class at Yale. Actually nothing like this really exists anywhere else.

    "ART 003 01 is abstract. Yes, because it teaches one to look at things up close and from afar and think about them from different points of view.",
    "If you have experience with visual art or graphic design, you should consider this class. If you can barely draw a straight line and are majoring in MCDB, you should definitely take this class. Art 003b, Blue, exposes its students to the process of creating and thinking visually in a way that transforms them into better viewers and better makers, regardless of prior skill level and background. If you realize early that this class is what you make of it, if you\u2019re brave and push boundaries, you\u2019ll develop so much as a person, both in terms of skill and character.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. We were the first class to take ART 003, so it might change, but this is how it worked for us: On Monday, we would have an art project due. A collage, a series of pictures, whatever. There were a variety of skill levels; no one expected top level art out of these exercises, although some people certainly excelled. We would then critique the assignments as a class, which isn't as nerve-wracking as it seems. Then, on Tuesday night, we would have a short written assignment due (usually 200 words or so). Sometimes we would discuss it in class the next day, and sometimes we didn't. We visited the art gallery\/library several times and had numerous guest speakers. If anything, it was a great chance to experience Yale's vast art treasures. We truly grew over the course of the semester, in a way I never imagined we would. This sounds sappy and overdramatic, but I promise: This class is phenomenal. I wish I could take it again.",
    "Yes a thousand times yes. Just know that it is a lot of work. I spent at least 6-7 houfs each week on our weekly projects and often more",
    "Don't take this class if you want to know exactly what you're in for. It is all over the place and definitely challenging, but this is what makes it so unique. Freshman seminars are an amazing opportunity to study something outside of your comfort zone, and that's what this is! It was unlike anything I've ever taken before and I learned a lot of varied things.",
    "Art 003 is a once in a lifetime art forms course. It covers many divergent types of media such as the collage, animation, poster making, and digital art. I would highly recommend this course to both science and humanity interested individuals. It will give them skills and knowledge that they can take with them no matter what subject they pursue."
