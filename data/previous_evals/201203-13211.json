    "Overview of plant phylogeny, botany 101, further opens your eyes in a whole new way, greater appreciation of plants ensured!",
    "I thought this was a great course, even though plants aren't usually my primary interest. There is a lot of material, but it's manageable in terms of workload, and Professor Donoghue is great. You get to go on a couple field trips to see (and practice identifying) plants in a natural setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to those interested in science. Take it, you'll like it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. It is a very hands on course (taught in conjunction with a great lab), and Professor Donoghue really knows his stuff. I felt by the end of the semester I had acquired a really surprising amount of information about plant diversity and feel that I learned it really comprehensively. It isn't one of those classes you will forget at the end of the semester.",
    "Yes. If you'd like to gain some interesting knowledge about the plants that surround you and how they fit together phylogenetically, take the class. Your plant blindness will be miraculously wiped away."
