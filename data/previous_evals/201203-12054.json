    "Yes, take it!!! I think this should be a mandatory class. The workload is manageable and fair. The midterm and final are take-home! Professor Camacho is the greatest and the nicest, although lectures could have been more engaging and interactive. The material is really interesting, and this will change how you view the world honestly. We learn about things that we were taught in history courses, but looking at it through the vantage point of the minority is really eye-opening.",
    "Yes! Take it! One thing I should warn you about is that there were some weeks when the reading assigned felt a bit too much.",
    "AMAZING. One of the best classes that I have ever taken at Yale. I would recommend it to everyone -- regardless of prior interest to the subject material. It is something all well-read people should take.",
    "This class is an introduction to the methods used in the fields of ethnic and cultural studies. It's the perfect mixture of history, anthropology and sociology--with some art, film, literature, and philosophy mixed in. Unlike most history classes, this class is not meant to cram you with information and dates to regurgitate on a final. Rather, the goal of the course is to equip you with the analytical and scholarly skills required to reexamine history critically and to discuss a wide variety of current (and relevant!) issues. After this class, I feel much better prepared to talk about topics concerning race, ethnicity, and human movement, and how these affect and have affected social and political structures. The reading is definitely substantial, but much of it is very interesting and eye-opening. I found the rest of the workload to be very manageable: there's a take-home midterm and a take-home final, as well as a paper that you can substitute for a rewarding community-based learning project. Professor Camacho's lecture style takes a bit of getting used to at first, but if you pay attention, the contents of the lecture are very engaging. Professor Camacho is hands-down one of the most marvelous, kind, approachable and mothering professors I will ever have in my Yale career (not to mention very knowledgeable and great at what she does). If you look at the syllabus and its contents interest you in the least, take this class! I vehemently recommend it. It was different from anything I've ever studied, and it was, in short, an amazing experience.",
    "Take it! Take it regardless of your major or your interest level. This is a course that will change how you think about the world and make you a better human being.",
    "Yes. As a non-ER&M major, even a non-humanities major, this class was excellent! Good things to know just as a human being, and a Yale student. Especially if you have taken a US history course in high school, you should take this class to get a different perspective!",
    "MUST TAKE! This class is a necessary second perspective to the history you learn in elementary school. Professor Camacho is passionate about what she's teaching and has a plethora of knowledge to share. The workload is completely manageable and enjoyable.",
    "This course begins as the \"American History you didn't learn in high school,\" but it creatively ties many processes of identity formation across temporal and geographic boundaries.This class is extremely relevant and will provide very important tools and perspectives with which to understand the world.Besides the amazing lectures (including from guest lecturers throughout the semester), the amazing TAs,and fellow students (who make section discussion extremely interesting), the readings and movies are really interesting and eloquent -- you'll have the urge to write down quotes every two seconds. Oh yeah, and the Community Based Learning project is fantastic -- I was disorganized and didn't end up making it work, but just start early in the semester and get into the community!Definitely take this class.",
    "Everyone at Yale should take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. It provides an excellent framework to talk about issues of ethnicity and race and changes the way you see the world. Professor Camacho is a fabulous professor and the class is engaging. The variety of projects through out the semester are relevant and intersting. This is an excellent class.",
    "If you are interested in ethnic and minority studies, this class is for you. The students are for the most part very passionate about ethnic studies and have a lot to say about it. If you are simply looking for a social studies credit, look elsewhere. Though the workloadisn't super great, the class can be emotionally taxing and\/or boring.",
    "Intro to ER&M will really enhance your understanding of history and society. Yes, the material can be heavy, but even with all of the oppression in history, you learn about resilience and hope. Professor Camacho is an amazing woman and role model and really helps make the class personal for students. Take the class!!!",
    "I think ERM 200 is a great course for anyone interested in issues of race, ethnicity, migration, and racial conflict. The class covers a myriad of topics from Jewish identity to Native American genocide to sexuality and ethnic identity in South Asia.However, the topics are all connected with similar themes. Professor Camacho invites guest lecturers to discuss various topics such as Mexican-American identity, the creation of New York's Chinatown, and the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides. The readings can at times be a little lengthy but worth the read. Attendance is taken in lecture and handouts are given that are not put on classesv2 so do go to lecture. Assignments include a take home midterm with IDs and analysis with an essay, a research paper or a Community Based Learning Project, a Global Playlist project with your section, and a lengthy take home final. Camacho encourages students to participate in lecture and makes her lectures both interactive and inspiring.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "You might be wondering what kind of topics are covered when one studies issues of \"Ethnicity, Race and Migration\"? ER&M is an excellent class to explore this.At the start of the semester, we look at events defining America's formation - slavery, native americans, civil rights movement, chinese immigrants etc. - from a \"racial view point\" as opposed to the usual \"historical view point\". Rather than simply learn as \"fact\" what the European settlers did to Native Americans, we use this as a case study to explore what defines racial interactions between these two groups. Rather than simply learn as \"fact\" that slavery happened and look at the atrocities of this trade, we use this as a case study to examine how idea of a \"racial discourse\" allowed something like this to happen. It's truly an eye-opening class that will change your perception of the world and modern day issues surrounding race.Towards the end of the semester, we look at issues such as colonialism and Western Imperialism. These are terms that are usually \"acknowledged\" but then \"fly over your head\"...do you truly know how ravaging the effects of colonialism were on Third World Countries? You know it \"was\" ravaging as a singular fact, but not \"how\" ravaging it was. Again, we use this as a case study to examine how the associated \"racial discourse\" justified something like colonialism. We look at how the racial logic embedded in modern day issues like racial profiling and terrorism. TAKE THIS CLASS! IT WILL ABSOLUTELY CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE WORLD AND ITS PEOPLE!The class also has a community based learning option, I took it and it put all the issues of migration into context of the real world. I was working with the organization called Junta to help illegal immigrants apply for \"deferred action\" - a kind of temporary citizenship. I learnt as much in a few hours of community service as I did in Prof. Camacho's wonderful lectures!",
    "Ethnicity, Race, and Migration is a wonderful course for any student interested in activism who wants to understand how U.S. history has been influenced by persecution, race, and advocacy. The CBL is a great complement to the course.",
    "I am very glad I took this course. It strengthen my understanding of the past and opened my eyes to important issues of the present. The readings -- make sure to keep up with them --strengthened the lectures. The section was really helpful in helping to truly understand concepts and connect ideas across readings and lectures and students.The instructor provided an excellent introduction to this area of study. Her lectures were accentuated by the variety of media she employed, from images to films and personal testimonies. Overall, this was a brilliant course, one in which the last class included song playlist presentations and tearful farewells from a professor to her students.",
    "Please take this class!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. The workload is pretty easy; weekly reading, a take home midterm and final, and a 5 page paper or the community based learning project. I absolutely loved this class, I was excited to go every Tuesday and Thursday. The lectures were fascinating, and the guest lectures were fantastic! This class offers a new perspective to your standard American history. I would recommend having a basic knowledge of American history before taking this class, as it makes it easier to see the connections Professor Camacho makes during lecture. I loved this class, everyone should take it!",
    "ER&M is a fantastic introductory course to take, even if you do not plan on pursuing this field in your studies. Professor Camacho explains common occurrences based on race in a very helpful manner. The course will definitely expand your skills as a critical thinker and as a more conscious individual.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a very important class for understanding the history of race and it is crucial to understanding our world today.",
    "It teaches a specific way to think about history that can be very helpful, thought provoking, and aggravating at the same time.",
    "Take it. Camacho isn't the most engaging lecturer (she'd be much better in a seminar I think), but she's a sweetheart and the stuff we learn is priceless. This should be required learning for everyone at Yale.",
    "ER&M is about the stuff that they usually don't teach you in the history books and why that is, it'll make you rethink the basic assumptions that you have about this country and the way the world works, take it!",
    "Great class! I learned about global issues that I had never heard about before that I think everyone should know about! Professor Camacho is a great lecturer and it was cool to have guest lecturers as well. There was a lot of reading and the topics could sometimes get repetitive but overall I really liked the class.",
    "Definitely take this course!!! Opened my eyes up to so many things I had previously been ignorant of, and no matter what major you are, you will take something life-changing away from this course. A lot of injustices are exposed in this course, which can at times be depressing, but also really drives you to want to change society. It gave me a new perspective on how I view the world. Professor Camacho is the sweetest, the TAs are all amazing, and you can feel this collective passion and energy from everyone else each lecture. The guest lecturers (especially Professor Mary Lui and Professor Pitti) are also awesome. Workload-wise there is a lot of reading, but they're all really good and offer something to the course. You end up wanting to finish all of them anyways. Other than that it's just a take home midterm and final, plus a 5 page paper that can be substituted by a community service project write-up instead--so it's really not that bad. Take it take it take it!!",
    "Ethnicity, Race& Migration introduces us in a somewhat general sense to the experiences of racial and ethnic groups in the United States and around the world. It lays the framework for an understanding of the social instruments and processes that define them, and is indispensable to understanding our country,",
    "ER&M is a great class with a reasonable workload. If you are at all interested in the origins of racial tension in the american society, this course is a must-take. The fact that Professor Camacho is teaching the course is also a reason to take the course."
