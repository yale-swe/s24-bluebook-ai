    "It's really a you-get-what-you-put-into it class, except it's hardly a seminar. All of us just sat around on our laptops. Nobody did the reading, and it didn't matter. For the first two months, TN lectured us for the entire class period. For the last month, we had 45-minute student presentations (two per class period). The only work, and the only thing you will be graded on, is the presentation and a 25ish page term paper (you'd be advised to do both on the same topic; will make the class even less work). I did work for this class twice the entire year. Writing the paper was fun though--I might turn some ideas from it into a senior essay. It's definitely an easy way to get the seminar requirement for the major out of the way.",
    "This is an outstanding course. It offers a comprehensive and well-structured telling of India's and South Asia's development story - something that is not only infinitely relevant today but also extremely interesting. One learns a great deal from this course in an accessible way. Must take.",
    "The material is interesting. You just have to decide whether or not you like the way the class is taught, which is that seminars are more like lectures, and you're only graded on a class presentation and a final paper."
