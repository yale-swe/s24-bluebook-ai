    "YES YES YES. This class will change your life",
    "I sometimes felt that the lectures dragged on for too long without much substance.. Also, the readings were a bit long (entire books at a time, on top of other reading), but I did love the reading selections in the end. Nevertheless, I would recommend this course to anyone who is even remotely considering pursuing ER&M. Even if one is not considering ER&M, the themes covered in this course will greatly help to cultivate one's understanding of identity and identity perception in the world.",
    "Take this class. its REALLY interesting, despite what your initial opinion may be",
    "Good introduction to the way the US and the wolrd approaches ethnic minorities and ethnic groups.",
    "ER&M 200 is a course spanning the ethnic and racial history of the West with a focus on the movement of peoples. I often describe it to friends as a non-white history of \"the West.\" The course gives a voice to the voiceless by focusing on the underrepresented or ignored perspectives of Native Americans during the colonial encounter in the New World, migrant women in the developing world, the development of human rights discourse, etc.Every student at Yale should be required to take this course. It has shown me that the concept of race and its places and moments in history have had a profound impact on the development and construction of today's society. The CBL (Community-Based Learning) section was probably the greatest part of the course. I was able to link course knowledge and personal experience through volunteerism, which helped enhance my ability to articulate the historical and current experience of race and ethnicity in the West (and America in particular).My TA was amazing! I also hear the other two TAs this year were phenomenal.Camacho's lecture style is wonderful and she is so passionate about social justice and human rights. But the course takes a very LIBERAL approach to almost every issue it raises, and students tend to attach themselves to these arguments like flies. My suggestion is that we receive more politically moderate (or balanced) readings and lectures in order to foster a fairer approach to the study of ethnicity, race, and migration. I personally enjoyed the liberal approach, but I certainly felt there were blatantly ignored perspectives on issues such as illegal immigration, human rights, and the colonization of the New World. However, keep in mind that this is an introductory course, so you can't expect it to cover every side of every argument.",
    "I would recommend ER&M purely because much of the subject matter is based on history that most people don't know.",
    "This is a really eye-opening course, and material-wise, I think possibly one of the best and most relevant I've taken at Yale. The weekly workload is very manageable - just a lot of reading. Be forewarned, though - the midterm and final exams are both take-home. I wish they had been papers instead - the take-homes averaged about 8 pages each, and required about 4 essays worth of reviewing course material. Prof. Camacho is very sweet, accommodating, and a wonderful person. I just wish her lecturing style were more dynamic, especially since what she says is so interesting. If possible I would take it with Stephen Pitti, for a more engaging lecturer. If the syllabus grabs you though, take it, regardless of professor. You might have some sleepy days, but it's worth it for the material. The course rethinksand reexamines race, culture, and the movement of peoples in ways you might have never considered before. I definitely recommend.",
    "TAKE IT. It makes you more sensitive to how cultures develop because of one another, and only in relation to one another.",
    "Definitely take this course. It's a lot of reading, but it's so worth it. It changed the way I look at many social justice issues and was an excellent introduction into the department. Also, take advantage of the community based learning project. I had a lot of fun getting to know the partner organization, learned a lot, and it's definitely worth doing instead of a term paper.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "I'd certainly suggest that you take this class if you are looking for a historical perspective on the contemporary and systematic problems of the American society. At first I was a little hesitant because the class looked as if it was only about the US, but the methods the class uses are definitely applicable to other geographies. The readings were a little more demanding than the other classes I took, but there were not many writing assignments.",
    "ER&M 200 was my favorite class this semester. I learned so much in this class, and I'm glad that I took the advice of my friends in signing up for this course. This workload and structure of the course was well-moderated and gave us enough time to soak in the information rather than speed-feeding us history. This course far exceeded my expectations and I hope to take another class in the ER&M field! Professor Camacho is a wonderful professor and I hope to take more classes with her in the future!",
    "Absolutely. It was my favorite class of the semester",
    "Take this course before you graduate. It is a great survey course that shows how race, ethnicity, and migration affect us all today."
