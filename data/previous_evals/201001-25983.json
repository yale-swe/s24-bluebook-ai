    "I would tell fellow students that the course gives a general overview of major philosophical schools and thinkers of the modern West, including both text study and analysis of the claims being made. I would definitely recommend this class to others.",
    "TAKE DS PHILOSOPHY. well, in general, take DS. it will change your life. my perspective on the world has changed completely.",
    "You will read books that ask questions about what does it mean to be a good person, what does \"mean\" mean, and what does \"does\" do. If any of these questions interest you, take the course.",
    "Second semester of DS Philosophy with Raul Saucedo was awesome! In terms of reading, we covered the highlights of Western philosophy from the 20th century - Descartes, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Mill, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Goodman. Some of these are interesting, some are impenetrable, some are downright crazy, but it's rewarding to trace the trajectory of ideas. The lectures were helpful and informative. But section with Raul Saucedo helped me appreciate philosophy a lot more than I did in the past. He effectively presents the themes\/arguments of each author, and facilitates interesting and informative discussions. He's always open to your questions and objections. Also, Raul is a huge help when it's time to write papers; make sure you discuss your plans with him, not just to help your grade but more importantly because he's a really nice guy and great to talk to. Although he was new to DS this year, he rose to the challenge and did an excellent job.",
    "Take it if you like humanities.",
    "I would recommend (and have already recommended to every single prefrosh I met) the Directed Studies Experience! Directed Studies was incredibly rewarding and I cannot say enough good things about it. The intellectual community that was developed over the course of the full year, the opportunities to get to know professors, the in-class discussions, colloquiums, and Art Gallery Talks...all made Directed Studies an in-depth and rich experience! The reading assignments are lengthy and there are many papers, however, the works we read and the students' excitement and curiosity about the reading makes the experience challenging and rewarding."
