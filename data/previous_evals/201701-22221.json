    "I was exposed to a very wide range of interesting phenomena under the broad umbrella of \"many-body interactions.\" From the random phase approximation to Fermi liquid theory to superconductivity, we learned about many different physical behaviors and techniques in condensed matter. The problem sets explored a series of specific applications that were also very enlightening. Professor Glazman also included many references to advanced textbooks and primary literature, so I always had the means to go learn even more about specific topics that interested me.",
    "I learned a lot about many-body quantum systems and the analogies between field theory and many-body quantum mechanics.",
    "Theoretical methods in condensed matter physics",
    "I developed knowledge of the techniques of many-body physics theory and of various aspects of many-body systems."

    "The material in this course is very interesting and well-presented, and there is a good variety in the range of topics covered. I enjoyed it a lot. Compared to some other courses, it was a little bit easier to get lost or confused, since the presentation didn't hew closely to any particular textbook or posted set of class notes. That's not to say there was a shortage of pointers to reference material, but it meant that I sometimes had to do a little more legwork to figure out a confusing topic.",
    "This was an excellent course, perhaps it could be made clearer at the outset what the unifying logical threads throughout the course are. This becomes much more clear at the end.",
    "Very clear and insightful.",
    "The course is exactly the right level for graduate students interested in many-body physics. I would have appreciated typed lecture notes to be able to follow the course more closely."

    "Professor Glazman is a great lecturer, and if you're at all interested in condensed matter physics, or theoretical physics, or both, you will enjoy the material in this class. There's also a lot here that you probably haven't seen in any class before.",
    "Yes, great.",
    "Yes, any theoretical candidates concerned about quantum physics.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in many-body physics."
