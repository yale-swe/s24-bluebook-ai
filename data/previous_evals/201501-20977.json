    "I will recommend it.",
    "It teaches the fundamental forces that are relevant on the nanoscale, between atoms and molecules, covering material often left on the edges of other classes (larger than quantum mechanics, smaller than statistical mechanics, some chemistry). Very much geared towards grad students in engineering, though students in other disciplines can still get a lot of quality information. I would recommend this course to anyone doing some kind of condensed matter\/materials science - it is a good foundation to build all nanoscale behavior off of.",
    "This course tied together many topics on forces, from hydrophobic\/hydrophilic surfaces to Keesom\/Debye\/London forces. Each concept was well derived to give an overall view of how modern physics looks at forces on the nanoscale. I would recommend this course not only for the material but also the final presentation in which students learn how to improve scientific talks\/presentations.",
    "This course is necessary to anyone who work in the nano science field. I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "It is a course that would be suitable and understandable for any students with science and\/or engineering background, if they are interested in the topic.",
    "This is all you need to know about attractive intermolecular forces. You should take it. You should definitely take it.",
    "ENAS 787 covers in detailed major forces in the nanoscale. I would recommend this class for all material science-related students because it is very useful and very applicable to most material science researches.",
    "Yes. I would recommend. It helps us to understand the foundamental principles of nanoscale forces",
    "I would recommend it, specially for someone working at the nanoscale."

   "comments": [
    "It helps me to have a deep understanding in this area.",
    "This course tied together concepts that were previously left separate from classes in thermodynamics, physics, and chemistry. The final presentation was especially helpful in learning about 12 other topics from students.",
    "I learned the interactions between two items in nano scale. It is necessary for me to explain my experimental phenomena from the level of nano.",
    "Coming into the course, I had general knowledge about all the forces outlined in the lectures. The real value of the course is the laying of foundations in all of those classic equations.",
    "I learnt a lot from this course. Most part of the topics discussed in classes are very useful in improving my research. The topics covered, I believe, are very fundamental and important in material science and can be applicable for my research.",
    "It helped me a great deal to gain insight into the interactions at the molecular level, which is critical for my research"
