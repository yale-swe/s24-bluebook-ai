   "comments": [
    "Great class, Professor Jaynes is very good at communicating new concepts and he has a very laid back teaching style allowing for much conversation to happen but always making sure class discussion was going in the right direction. Not having grown up in the US, the class made me understand the complex relationships of race of this country and appreciate the ongoing struggle to ensure true equality.",
    "Jaynes is baller but, that being said, only take if you're looking for a moderately interesting case law class on anti-discrimination law in the US that satisfies an econ credit. also if you want a light work load this class is definitely for you (2nd semester seniors this is for you). there is very little economics in the class. you have to be interested in talking about the subtleties of language used in the constitution and Court decisions. class discussion gets boring sometimes since many don't do the reading but on the flip side, if you're having a busy week skimming the reading is not a problem. Jayne's personal stories relating to the topics we discuss are definitely the best part of the class. and you only have 1 10pager at the end with a low stress presentation of the reading you do with partners in one of the class meetings.",
    "Take it if you are interested in reading and understanding supreme court decisions relating to discrimination cases. I thought it was very interesting, but be aware that there is barely any economics, and absolutely no math (this might be a positive or a negative for certain people).",
    "Good seminar. Not much economics. You read a lot of discrimination court cases. Workload is light--readings every week, leading a class discussion once a semester, and a 10 page term paper. Highly recommended if you enjoy the law.",
    "Not a very demanding course load at all. Professor Jaynes is a great person to get to know. Prior knowledge of Constitutional Law will make the class much easier to follow.",
    "It's less an economics class than a legal history class, which is nice if you're looking for something easy on math. The discussions are interesting, but the readings are mostly dry court cases. Jaynes is one of the most fun and easy-going professors I've had.",
    "Good class for anyone interested in the history of discrimination, especially related to gender and race. There is very little economics in the course, though, and we mostly read Supreme Court cases. Our seminar was too large, which hindered discussion, but if put with the right group of people, could be really interesting. Not too much work - just weekly readings and a 10-page final paper that is topic of your choice and really interesting to write."
