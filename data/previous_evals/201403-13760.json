   "comments": [
    "A nice introduction to Riemannian geometry. The course will be a lot easier if you've already had some background in smooth manifolds. I would recommend the course to another student, because the material is worth knowing.",
    "Yair is great, so you should take this course if the material interests you.",
    "Yes, I would say take it. It's the only option for a Riemannian geometry course, and the field is absolutely key to doing most mathematical work. I'd summarize this course as a series of lectures, which for me consisted of about half the learning, followed by a final project, which consisted of the other half. The project was actually really fun and I learned lots, best part of the course.",
    "It was a great course. I would recommend it to anyone in physics or mathematics."

   "comments": [
    "I understand a lot more about Riemannian manifolds now, which I had wanted to learn about for a while. I doubt that this class will contribute directly to my research, but it seems like this is background knowledge that all mathematicians should have.",
    "(I'm an undergraduate.) This course provided the fundamental vocabulary of differential geometry at the level grad schools seem to expect, and reinforced it with neat example theorems. This will clearly be helpful in my research unless I go in to foundations or something.",
    "I am an undergraduate so it did not contribute to my nonexistent dissertation. However it did introduce me to Riemannian geometry, and the introduction is the most important part.",
    "It improved somewhat my understanding of Lie groups, so I would argue it is a rather helpful course."
