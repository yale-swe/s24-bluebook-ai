    "It is a terrific class. Because I love the language and I want to major in the subject, I think I have a different view on the class from most people. The language is a dead language, and doesn't have much practical use, so if you would rather learn a language that can be spoken, I would recommend a different class. However, if you are interested in Ancient Egypt, it is a wonderful class and the professor is terrific. Sure, there is a lot of vocabulary and signs to memorize in the first few weeks, it is not too difficult. I would recommend it to anyone who has interest in Ancient Egypt!",
    "Very good class if you are interested in this kind of material. Workload is very fair.",
    "Yes. If you are really interested in Egyptian grammar and writing, i would recommend the class. The one caviat is that you have to be prepared to make extensive use of the dictionary, since you will be reading a lot of text with vocabulary you have never seen before. Other than that, the grading is very lenient on the homework, and you didn't have to take the final if you went to 10 or more sections.",
    "Definitely worth taking. Good introduction to a very obscure language, pretty light workload. Purely a language class though, no history or culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it is a unique opportunity to learn ancient hieroglyphs and the instructor is very accommodating and helpful.",
    "Interesting, informative, relatively easy, and a good way to fulfill your foreign language requirement. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It is so unusual and interesting-- when else can you study hieroglyphics?! It has a medium amount of homework, but I find that the timne flies by-- it's like you're solving a puzzle. Also, won't it be fun when you're 80 years old and visiting the pyramids of Egypt to be able to translate the inscriptions?"
