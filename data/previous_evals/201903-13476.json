    "I came into this class with a very vague understanding of the history of the book, and after leaving I feel like I have a foundation on which I can build in the future",
    "Learned to look at the book as object and think about materiality and its effect, social and physical uses of the book; reconsideration of some concepts taken for granted author, editor, reader.",
    "I learned about book history, print culture, and lots of different ways to think about books in their material form.",
    "This course was an introduction to book history for me and was a really interesting one at that-- I think the material grounding of the concept of the book as object was a really fruitful approach both to thinking about book history and immediately problematizing it. This was one of my favorite courses of the semester because it was such an insightful class, and one that was above all interested in questioning all of its premises. I don't know how strong of a grasp I have on the field of book history now, but I certainly have a set of foundational ideas and interests, honed in this class, that have thus far been communicable with most book historical works we've read.",
    "Book as Object was my favorite class this semester. I loved learning about the technicalities and grey areas of what I call the book. I learned to ask new questions of my same materials, and how to build a moving story out of something static.",
    "knowledge on Book History different critical theories, on bibliography, materiality"

   "comments": [
    "Exciting and insightful discussions with people from different interests and backgrounds; An opportunity to dive deep into the Beinecke; Annotating an old book with a quill;",
    "This course was a really compelling survey but, as a survey, a bit overwhelmingly broad and diffuse. I really enjoyed this class but I think it could have benefitted from David and Kathryn laying out the ground of book history relatively early on; because we moved around thematically, it would have been useful to have in the first place a stronger grounding in how book history developed as a field and where it had been.",
    "There was a lot of reading. Too much reading. But David and Kathryn knew that and addressed it by assigning students to lead the discussion each week. That arrangement worked for me. I would have liked to spend more time in Beinecke for more hands-on learning but we did have a good amount of opportunities for hands-on learning even with 1 Beinecke class. Having people with such varied interests come together to talk about their individual academic backgrounds made for a very exciting class.",
    "strengths: readings, professors' engagement, heterogeneous class, Beinecke"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I really enjoyed this course. It was great to be able to think theoretically about books since we all interact with them in our work, regardless of what we are studying",
    "Yes! This class was such a wonderful experience. Professors Kastan and James are wonderful, and come at the subject from such different backgrounds that they compliment each other perfectly. They both bring a lot of passion and curiosity to the class. You'll do a lot of reading, but it'll pay off when you can discuss the subject in ways you never encountered before.",
    "Yes, I think so; it was a really engaging course, and a really useful survey. Plus David and Kathryn have such fascinating and different perspectives, so it was incredibly useful to have them in conversation alongside us.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Its a very fun way to fulfill the Early Modern requirement for someone whos not necessarily an early-modernist.",
    "definitely. Great overview of Book History as a field, insights on current stakes"
