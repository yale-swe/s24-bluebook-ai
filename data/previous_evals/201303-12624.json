    "Hopefully this class will be taught next year. If so, TAKE THIS CLASS. You will have to show up every day of shopping period, seeing that it is probably the most popular English 114 section offered during the Fall semester (I think around 40 students showed up for almost the entire shopping period for an available 12 slots).Your writing will improve drastically and you will have a lot of fun along the way.",
    "Disney in Society touches on the multiple aspects of Disney in social media and teaches students to write methodical essays with contestable claims in a well organized fashion.",
    "This class is a really fun and also challenging class that is based on article reading and essay writing. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it is a great way to learn the higher standard required of college writing (as opposed to high school writing). And it is indeed really thought-provoking to analyze Disney and the ways in which it is and is not the 'happiest place on earth.'",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. In short, it is a great class about the role of Disney in Society that teaches you how to write and has a fantastic professor to boot. There is a solid amount of work, but it's not unmanageable and it's never busy work. Please keep this class running!",
    "This was unequivocally one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Paul really engaged the class each week with super interesting material and guided us in our transformation from mediocre to more focused, aware writers. As one of my first seminar experiences at Yale, this class inspired me to be more vocal about my ideas, and it taught me how to approach academic literature, both in deciphering and interpreting other scholarly work and in clearly conveying my own research writing. However, there are clearly not enough sections for this class, considering the massive demand and wait lists that accumulated at the beginning of the semester - so if you are lucky enough to get in, be sure to take this course. You won't regret it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student. I would take it again if I could.",
    "Amazing class. Fun, interesting, thought provoking and you learn a lot.",
    "This course was my favorite course of first semester. It's an exploration in understanding how to read and write, all through an extremely accessible topic in Disney. I would absolutely recommend this course to every single Yalie because it was the course that made me most excited about Yale academics first semester.",
    "English 114 18 is a writing course about Disney and Society. It analyzes multimedia, the history of Disney, the commercial aspect of Disney, feminist\/racist issues within Disney, among other topics. Through submitting draft and final forms of essays and readings about writing incorporated into the class, one improves his or her writing. I would recommend this class to another student. As a writing class goes, this class was on a very interesting topic. The critical thinking about aspects of Disney and ways to analyze multimedia were extremely interesting and useful, more so than the help the class actually gave to improving writing skills. Though the class did improve my writing, it also limited it in a way, because basically each essays follows one, precise structure"
