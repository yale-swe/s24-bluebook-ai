   "comments": [
    "Definitely take the class if you're interested in the material and have some sort of psychology background. There's no real pre-requisite, but I think that it helps to have engaged in some psychological material before taking this class. That said, work load is super manageable.",
    "Challenging course that has a lot of interesting material, but you will learn a lot. You should really be interested in the material if you want to take this class because you will have to work hard!",
    "Nice course but don't take it if you don't like neuroscience",
    "Overall, the class is a fascinating introduction to how animal models have been applied to the treatment of human patients with clinical disorders. It gives an overview of several disorders, and is interesting because it offers details about both the animal studies and clinical trials or direct outcomes for human patients. This is especially great if you've taken other classes and wondered exactly how animal models and experiments are directly relevant to humans! While the material is understandable even without previous knowledge (and there's help from the professor's notes and practice questions), it doesn't hurt to have some psychology if not specifically neuroscience-related background already, if at least to be familiar with certain brain regions or molecules for example. But there's a \"practice test\" to see what the exam format is like, and 2 midterms, and a (slightly cumulative) final, without extra assignments beyond readings. There's also a final paper, but the outline for it is very clear, and you get to choose whatever clinical disorder to analyze animal models for.",
    "I would recommend this class to students that have a background in chemistry and psychology.",
    "In terms of what I got out of the class, this is probably the best class I took this semester. The class is challenging but not impossibly so, and Professor Donegan did a great job in ensuring that we all had a good chance of doing well. I definitely feel like I know a whole lot more about the biological mechanisms of a host of psychiatric disorders; I would recommend the class to anyone considering it.",
    "I would recommend a psyc course before this, and maybe an intro bio or near science course. You cover an insane amount of material, but it is almost all relevant, helpful, and cool to think about. The review question packets are essential. Read them, study them, they are your savior. Also the TA can be a second savior. This is a difficult science credit, but if you want to learn something legit, this is the class. research paper and a final.",
    "This class is very interesting but very dense and reliant on rote memorization of neurobiology. I would recommend it if and only if you find the information interesting and are able to stay engaged in class; I personally found the lecture style dry and had a hard time sustaining my attention"
