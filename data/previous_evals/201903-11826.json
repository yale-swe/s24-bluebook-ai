    "Spanish grammar and vocabulary through talking, writing, and reading.",
    "Strong understanding of grammar tenses and vocab. Also learned how to read more complex Spanish literature.",
    "I learned a lot of Spanish grammar, and improved my speaking and reading skills.",

    "A review and furthering of grammar and vocabulary skills learned in SPAN 110 and 120.",
    "We reviewed many of the grammar concepts from 120, and towards the second half of the semester began learning new\/more complex topics. We also spent time watching short videos, reading a novel, and watching a movie.",

   "comments": [
    "This course was the best Spanish class I've ever taken. It was so well organized and taught by the professor. I learned so much, both for academic purposes and personal use.",
    "The overall course was very well structured. My biggest complaint was the really boring book at the end of the year that we had to read way too much of every night.",
    "I think the class should have more class discussions in Spanish and oral evaluations and less written tests.",
    "Great teaching and many ways of instruction were provided. But the participation grade should be based on participation, not skill.",
    "All around, this was a great course. Sometimes the workload can be a bit much, especially with the excessive amount of SuperSite homework. But this was not a frequent problem. The main weakness is the ridiculous price of the text book, which is required for many facets of the course. Other than that, the actual course itself is well structured and designed to build off prior knowledge and strengthen newly gained material.",
    "This course felt very fast paced to me. I realize that meeting every day for a language is beneficial, but homework each night was definitely a pain.",
    "I think a strength was how much we got to practice improvised speaking with partners or small groups.",
    "The course moves at a nice, quick pace. However, I wish more time was taken to master the mechanics\/grammar during class time. Often, class time was devoted to discussions, which I didn't always feel prepared for after one night of homework focused on a particular sentence structure or part of speech.",
    "The course is very structured and feels very robotic. There is no room for creativity in the course. The readings and online video activities feel outdated."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This class was extremely well taught. It made my mornings much more enjoyable.",
    "Yes. I learned so much Spanish.",
    "I would recommend it to other students, but I would tell them that it has almost no speaking component.",
    "Yes, I would it's a good course that can increase your Spanish speaking and comprehension level",
    "Yes! Great course",
    "Yes! Especially with Professor Seymour. She is a wonderful professor who is always more than happy to answer your questions and genuinely wants to see you succeed at the language and overcome any adversity you may be experiencing.",
    "Definitely. Challenging but by the end it was rewarding.",
    "Yes, because I think it was a good way for me to improve my Spanish.",
    "If you have a firm grasp on the lessons taught in 110 and 120, but you want more practice having conversations, yes. If you don't, and you don't need this course as a graduation requirement, then no.",
    "If you are in this class, it is probably because you have to be.",
    "I found this class to be the least engaging of all of my classes at Yale. It felt very repetitive and didn't offer me a lot beyond good grammar review."
