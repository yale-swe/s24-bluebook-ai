   "comments": [
    "Math 112 is an easy calculus class to take to satisfy distributional requirements or requirements for a major.",
    "Take it if you need it for a major - otherwise, it's not worth it.",
    "Very difficult for a lower-level math class. Prior calculus knowledge is basically a necessity if you'd like to be successful in this class. I would not recommend Professor Orszag as a teacher.",
    "yeah, its a nice survey. you pretty much need to take it or a higher level to function in the real world.",
    "if you're just looking for a QR, then don't take this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless it's a requirement.",
    "The program includes many basic mathematical concepts that undoubtedly are truly useful in various areas, for example in Economics.",
    "Difficult",
    "If your math is fairly good, taking Math 115 might be a better idea. The course was not satisfying this semester, so based on what I have gone through, I do not recommend this course.",
    "An all right introduction to Calculus. I would much, much prefer exercises out of the book as opposed to weekly trick questions that the professors enjoy making up, which are much too hard relative to the work we do in class. Practicing useful topics would be useful. The tests too were also less than straightforward and could not adequately be studied for based on the assigned book material or online material. Overall though, a reasonable experience. The curve helps the class dramatically if you can do math at all.",
    "Unless you have already taken AP Calc, avoid this class. It's survive-able, but the instructors are not exactly the best. There were multiple review sessions led by the instructors in which the instructor could not solve the questions assigned to us, the students. However, if you do wind up in this class, avoid taking the class led by Professor Orszag.",
    "Math 112 is a great intro class to take if you are interested in Math. Don't take it just to fulfill a QR credit. Professor Orszag is great at explaining the concepts in a very clear and concise way. The problem sets and practice quizzes are difficult and take a lot of thinking, not just a general knowledge of the subject, but they are good for making you really understand how the basic math concepts relate to real life problems. I feel more prepared to take higher level math classes after this intro course.",
    "Math 112 involves derivatives and limits only. It is the first part of AP Calculus AB. If you need a review of derivatives it would be a very informative class, but if you are certain that you know derivatives forwards and backwards I would take Math 115. Just make sure that the instructor speaks clear English!",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is poorly taught and ineffectively tested. If it does anything, it kills the joy for calculus you carry from high school.",
    "I would not recommend Mathematics 112 to another student.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, especially not with Orszag unless you want impossible tests.",
    "I would not ever recommend this unless it is required of your major or you're premed.",
    "Do not listen to what everyone else will tell you about how easy the class is. Maybe because it was totally revamped our time, the class requires a fair amount of practice because only then will you know the application of every concept in almost every way because the exam will require you to use fairly straight forward concepts to solve unfairly difficult questions. The problem sets do not prepare you for the tests, and the final is no joke - be warned. Most people were not happy with Orszag - the other instructors apparently were more generous with disclosing hints for tests and problem sets.",
    "IT's good. I would recommend it for another fellow student"
