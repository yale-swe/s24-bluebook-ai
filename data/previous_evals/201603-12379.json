    "Gained familiarity with extremely valuable overview of the history of sinological methods and their connections with broader philosophical approaches to language and meaning.",
    "This course offers me a thorough exploration of the early encounter between China and other cultures through the lens of language study. Unlike the traditional sinology or philology, this course guides me to a critical reflection on their legacy, examining the historical and epistemological foundation of the biased mutual recognition and considering the potential inspiration to the transcultural studies nowadays."
