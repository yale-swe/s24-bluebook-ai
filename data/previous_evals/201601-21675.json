   "comments": [
    "If you end up taking ENGL 120, actually go to the writing partners in the writing center! I did not take advantage of this soon enough in the term and I learned later on that it is a fantastic resource, especially because most of the tutors there have taken ENGL 120. Dean Hill is a kind and helpful professor. The nightly readings for the course are quick and enjoyable - many are from the New Yorker, which is always a fun read.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to someone who wants an English class\/wants to become better at writing\/likes reading essays\/thinks they don't like reading essays. Fast paced class, really fun, and fairly rewarding.",
    "Favorite class of the semester; gets you writing and thinking about your writing. Really enjoyable syllabus as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to another student - this is a must-take at Yale! It allows students to go out of their analytical-writing comfort zone and explore creative writing. It's something I had never done before, but absolutely loved.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to better their writing. I learned a lot about what it takes to write at the college level in this course."
