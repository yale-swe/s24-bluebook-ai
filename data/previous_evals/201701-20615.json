   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One notable weakness of this course was the usage of a discussion forum. Though the intention of the forum - to give students an opportunity to practice their writing skills - was eminently reasonable, and the usage of such things is considered a 'high-impact' practice in the education field, the implementation was poor. The students included in the forum from other universities contributed at most one or two sentences per week, so interactions were limited to those between Yale students. Additionally, the per-week sentence requirement led to students optimizing for shorter, more numerous sentences rather than complete thoughts.",
    "I understand that immersion is the style of teaching in the German department, but I would love it if grammar and vocabulary could be taught more structurally rather than thrown at you.",
    "Definitely take it, the course is absolutely amazing. Tobias is the best teacher one can imagine, perfectly combining productivity with really pleasant, fun environment. Our discussions on various topics in class were always great and he is always eager to provide with extensive feedback. Obviously it requires dedication as meetings happen 5 times a week and there are regular tasks to be done outside of class but is extremely rewarding. One thing to be improved would be maybe to replace forum homeworks with something more purposeful such as e.g. weekly translating articles of choice",
    "Over the course of the semester, as topics became more heated, many conversations slipped into English, which defeated the purpose of the course. I felt that perhaps the material being presented to us was a bit too heavy for our limited knowledge of the language and culture."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to students who think they learn well through immersion. I'm much more of a structural learner, so this class is very difficult for me.",
    "As described above, I strongly recommend this course, and definitely encourage everyone to at least give it a try.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Great way to learn the language. I enjoyed the structure of the class; it was nicely balanced between leaening new grammar and vocab and practining speaking and learning about german culture."
