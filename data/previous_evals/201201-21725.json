   "comments": [
    "I would take this course if you are interested in the mathematical side of control systems.",
    "EENG 436 is a wonderful course. It is fast-paced - much faster paced than EENG 310 - and requires quite a bit of time. I would strongly recommend that you take this course when you have a lighter load in your other classes. The final project is a great learning experience, but again is a large time commitment. Problem sets are challenging, and there is a bit of a step in comprehension and application of concepts between what you learn in class and what is required on problem sets. While this is an extremely challenging class, Professor Narendra is a phenomenal teacher and is committed to working with students and helping them throughout the whole process.",
    "The course provided an in-depth look into many aspects of control and systems theory. At times the mathematics involved became slightly dense, but pictures and examples were used to clarify individual systems. There was a lot of flexibility for the final project, which allowed students to choose to research and implement exactly what they were interested in.I would recommend taking this class after a linear algebra class, as well as EENG 310. Certain topics such as stability and feedback make much more sense when you have already seen them in simpler (1 variable) systems.The problem sets can be a bit rough, especially towards the end of the semester. They are a mix of theoretical work (proofs) and actual systems."
