    "This was a course where you got out what you put in, and you're very likely to learn a lot from your classmates as many students who are interested in energy access have probably traveled and worked abroad. The readings were often very academic, so it was not always easy to follow the economic analyses. However, given enough time to digest, the readings were useful in helping students understand how academics theorize potential opportunities and their analyses' shortcomings.",
    "The course was useful in providing better understanding of approaches to programs combatting energy poverty. However, the readings and assignments were significantly more time intensive than a standard 1-credit course, and more on-par with the requirements of a 3-credit course.",
    "This course was unorganized and poorly structured. Workload was about 3-4 higher than the standard 1-credit workshop at the School of Management. While knowledgable, Dr. Pauchuri too often allowed class discussions to go unchecked, often going off-topic and entertaining questions and theories that were not relevant to the topics or questions at-hand."

    "Class discussions.",
    "Readings and class discussion.",
    "The best aspects of this course was having a practitioner with experience in this field as the instructor.It was easier relating to the examples in class as some of them are on going studies and\/or projects. In addition to that,the presentations were more student (working as teams) led giving room for more creativity and deeper engagements.",
    "Class discussion, which was almost just like 3 hours of office hours every two weeks with Shonali. You could ask whatever you wanted, especially as your questions related to the theme of the week. I thought all themes were very relevant.",

    "I would have liked a little more direct instruction from the professor.",
    "I feel it was well balanced between lecturing and discussions.",
    "I don't think we realized how much work a 1-credit class would be until midway through the semester. It would have been helpful to establish this as a 2-credit class and maybe make the class a few people smaller. I felt that not all my classmates took it seriously by the end. Also, rather than a blog, it would have been easier to just have a few people responsible for a given theme to write up a response as an assignment and have everyone else go around the room and critique\/provide feedback. That would have forced students to all be more engaged. The blog format was too lax and challenging to monitor.",
    "The course-load requirements were significantly greater than anticipated, and occasionally redundant. Some of the lectures also did not provide additional information not covered in the required readings.",
    "The course's workload she be adjusted to be commensurate with a one-credit course. Dr. Pauchuri should provide lectures instead of relying entirely on discussion and student-facilitated discussions.",

    "While I have worked on energy access in a developing county,I have had not hard any course on the same.This class provided an introduction to the energy access question while also providing a valuable forum for discussing the potential solutions in terms of business models,financing and technology that can be used to address the energy access challenges at the least cost.This fits into my interest of energy economics and policy by giving insights into successful business cases and the interaction between environment and energy.Beyond the knowledge gained (which is my area of interest),the presentations and discussions equally sharpens ones' communication skills whereas the blogging and writing the research paper nurtures the writing skills which I believe is of great value for any scientist.",
    "I'm interested in energy finance, so energy access issues are directly related to my interests. It's very valuable to understand the real-world delivery challenges that go with energy access despite well-formulated potential studies.",
    "The course helped me understand where my interests in energy policy lay relative to expansion of renewable energy in off-grid, developing communities or for more centralized infrastructure. This is useful as I seek to narrow my focus on policies to promote renewable energy integration with existing energy investment and infrastructure.",

The modules for the course details how to define and measure the impacts and benefits of energy access.Moreover it gives us an opportunity to think through what acceptable potential approaches would employed in ensuring energy access. The course also offered an opportunity to interact with other students who have worked in advancing energy access in other countries which is valuable as one gains from their perspectives based on practical experience",

Bring in a speaker or two to discuss the work they're doing (@ Google or Facebook) to tackle energy access. Bring someone in from SE4All, or some global institution!

The realization that the outcome in terms of the blog post or class presentation is entirely based on the teams effort creates a desire to own the project and give the best.",
