   "comments": [
    "Very good class, great professor, the discussion was always lively and interesting, whether you are coming more from Am Studs or WGSS or more from a film studies background.",
    "Really interesting class, it's a great opportunity to really understand the output of two great directors.",
    "This was a fantastic class. The series of movies we watched were equally thought-provoking and entertaining. I loved the discussions, both because of how well Professor Gregg led them and because the material was so interesting. Professor Gregg is one of the best professors I have had at Yale, hands down. A fantastic instructor in every regard: explaining things during class, leading discussion, and helping with papers. Also just a lot of fun. Definitely my favorite class of the semester - and I'm a history major!",
    "If you're interested in looking at two directors over a period of time, analyzing the shifts and consistencies in their style and content, this is a great course for you.",
    "A great film class for a major or amateur. Take it!",
    "Take it! Ron Gregg is brilliant and a good portion of the Lubitsch films you get to watch are really hard to get a hold of so the screenings are an excellent opportunity.",
    "Loved it. I shopped it as a kind of random, \"why not?\" type class that had nothing to do with my major.Ron Gregg is fantastic. It's clear to see from day one how interested he is in the material he teaches and the students in his class. Definitely one of the warmest and most accessible professors I've had. He sits down one on one with every student to discuss paper topics over coffee and was incredibly in helping me narrow down a good thesis and providing relevant sources.The class goes over a ton of fascinating Earnst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder films, so screenings were always something to look forward to. Sometimes there'd be a large amount of reading but most of it was pretty interesting. Weekly reading responses (a couple questions\/comments for discussion) and two papers (5-7 and 10-12) made for a pretty managable work load."
