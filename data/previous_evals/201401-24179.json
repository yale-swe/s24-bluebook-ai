    "I would highly recommend this course to any student with the appropriate math\/engineering background and even a mild degree of interest in computational modeling. It provides an excellent overview of the computational modeling of biological systems, including how the models are designed, constructed, validated, and interpreted, and their applications in furthering our understanding of biological systems and generating new hypotheses.",
    "Fantastic introduction into the world of Multiscale Modelling. Students should be aware that a lotof topics are covered and hence not everything can be covered in depth. A more advanced follow up course would be awesome"

    "I learned extensively about computational modeling and how it can be used to further the understanding of biological systems, generate new hypotheses, and optimize the design of artificial systems. I find computational modeling approaches to be fascinating and powerful, and I definitely intend to incorporate them into my research."
