   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about Britain's Empire and specifically how to compare typical historiography with new arguments. It enhanced my understanding of American and European history. I gained a lot of knowledge about the subject and can critically engage with the historiography now. Good history lecture.",
    "Seeing how much of our present world was shaped by the thoughts of powerful Englishman in the 17th and 18th centuries, and understanding why history is not just a bunch of facts but a narrative",
    "What I liked about this course was that it wasn't just a chronology of events in the British Empire, or a traditional lecture. Professor Pincus came to each lecture with some takeaways and a broader argument, and many times contrasted this with a prevailing view. In addition to helping us think about history critically, it also helped us think about historiography. Unfortunately, many times we read history books and take what we read as facts, but that was not the case in this class.",
    "This course is full packed with lots of knowledge and facts about how Britain rose to power as an Empire. This course has a lot of excellent readings that really develop the thought and thesis of the lectures.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of not only Britain's history but also the United States' history, which really fascinated me. The primary sources were very interesting in the class, and I feel like I developed a deeper understanding of just how large Britain's Empire was.",
    "A great course for gaining insight to how empire develops and the politics and thought processes of the rulers involved.",
    "I specifically gained a tremendous amount of knowledge from this course regarding Britain's history as an Empire from roughly 1600 to 1776. I'm not going to go into specifics as Professor Pincus knows them better and can explain them better than me, but I felt that I definitely did learn and retain plenty of information from Britain's imperial history. Furthermore, I learned the narrative that Professor Pincus wanted to tell and he also explained the narrative that many historians (who seem to be wrong) like to spin. In terms of skills, we definitely were taught how to read and analyze primary sources quite well and we also learned how to craft a research essay which I found to be a tough, but rewarding project.",
    "I gained a much complex understanding of the British Empire as a whole, which in turn gave me a much better understanding of particular political events which had until now been taught quite separately\/as relatively unconnected to one another."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some strengths of the class are Professor Pincus himself, solid lectures, and interesting material. The biggest weakness of the class was that we were expected in section to have thoroughly read 200-300 pages of primary source documents, which made discussion impossible and often alienating. I think the readings could be significantly cut back and discussion would improve a lot. Also, I think the second half of the course became disjointed sometimes, though mostly strong.",
    "This has the potential to be a really good class. The material is very interesting and Professor Pincus is a fun lecturer. Unfortunately, it is let down a bit by poor planning. Professor Pincus tries to jam far too much information into this course, more than anyone could possibly learn in one semester, and as a result the quality of learning decreases. If the course trimmed the fat and focused only on the really crucial parts of this long period of history, students would walk away with a much better understanding of the big picture. In addition, the reading workload is just stupid. It overwhelms students and as a result they just don't do it. Section would be far better for everyone if there was less reading and everybody did it, instead of everyone sitting in silence except for 2-3 students who somehow found 10 hours in their week to do all the reading. Again, this is just poor planning, not all of the readings are critically important. Trim the fat, figure out what information is important and what isn't, then this course could live up to its full potential.",
    "I really loved this class. I think professor pincus is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. My only recommendation would be to provide all the readings in a course packet from tyco and possibly reduce the amount of reading because it is too much, especially in such a short section.",
    "There are a lot of readings that are physically difficult to decipher... also, a lot of secondary scholarship that is long and difficult to understand. I thought the final was quite difficult too--arcane ID's, cumulative essay questions on fairly narrow ideas. Would have preferred a more diverse set of topics--I enjoyed the indigenous peoples lecture, would have liked to see more like them.",
    "I thought this course did a very good job of presenting information in a new way. I think Professor Pincus was very passionate about the subject, and that shone through a lot in his lectures.",
    "Strengths: The main strength of the course was Steven Pincus's knowledge and passion for the period. Each lecture was full of information concerning the British Empire and challenged a modern narrative. Weaknesses: The course was an organization disaster. The lectures were often poorly timed and the readings were impossible to find. The readings and lectures were often disjointed and the readings were not discussed sufficiently to be meaningful.",
    "The course was very engaging and amazing. The sections were incredibly helpful - Seb is a great TA and really pushes us to think critically about what we've learned in lecture and the readings I think my only problem is that, on the exam, we have to identify passages from primary sources. It was doable on the midterm, but really got hard on the final as there were way more primary sources, and the quotes were from random parts of the sources. I get that identifying the primary sources - or at least being able to wing it, based on context clues or names\/events dropped in the quote - shows a solid understanding of the material. I just wish that maybe the passages chosen were easier or maybe, and this might seem juvenile, if we had like a \"word bank\" of possible passages that it could be? Like if we have two passages we have to identify, maybe having a list of 7 primary sources?",
    "I think that the lectures had a lot of really interesting information, but it sometimes felt like too much that we were going over too quickly. I would have preferred to maybe go over a bit less and go over it in more detail. The readings for the class were also all very interesting, but there often were just too many. It was very hard to do all of the readings for each week that sometimes got as high as 10-12 readings so I often felt unprepared for section each week. So, I would probably just pick more of a focus each week or tell us ahead of time which few readings we should pay extra close attention to.",
    "Professor Pincus is very engaging, which is great since this is a lecture course. I can throughly say that I learned numerous things about Britain that I did not know better. I think its a great class overall and people should definitely take it.",
    "It would be great if the online resources were organized by week. I felt like I spent a lot of time sifting through stuff that could have been spent actually learning the material.",
    "I think the course has a large amount of strengths. Firstly, I think that the course does not try to get too ambitious in the amount of material it covers. Professor Pincus may breeze through lectures at times, but I enjoyed that we focused on a specific roughly 200 year period and really dove into it. Other than having a robust syllabus that took on a reasonable amount of material, I enjoyed that the course prevented a very alternative narrative. Professor Pincus explained to us what the average historian says about the given topic and then also explained his alternative interpretation to us. Finally, I enjoyed that the course had a research paper that made up a decent portion of the grade. The paper allowed each of us to truly explore a topic that we wanted to focus on more and I found it to be a fun departure from some of the history classes that have shorter essays scattered throughout the syllabus or have no essays at all. In terms of weaknesses, I think that there was a bit of a disconnect between lecture and section, but I will touch on that more in my teacher and TF evaluations.",
    "Strength: Lectures were incredibly informative. Weakness: Key terms and reading questions need to be updated so that they align with the current syllabus."

    "A good history lecture\/pre-industrial credit. Probably wouldn't recommend to non-history majors (a lot of nitty-gritty details about historiography, assumes that you've taken some significant early American history, etc.), but at the end of the day I was happy I took it. My biggest critiques of the class are that there's simply too much reading (almost all primary sources -- often 200+ pages), which makes discussion section impossible -- no one has ever done the same reading, yet we focus specifically on the primary sources in section. Also, I think I realized during the course of the class that early British history just isn't that interesting to me, which I thought it would be. But Professor Pincus is a great lecturer and a great historian, and the lecture this year was small enough to engage with him directly, which was wonderful. Overall, a solid class if you're very interested in the subject and don't mind a lot of primary source readings.",
    "Yes, fairly straightforward history class (i.e., focused on wars and politics) that provides a different and more nuanced perspective on the early British empire. We read a lot of primary source documents, which is very interesting but also time-consuming. Sometimes I felt that I lacked a base amount of knowledge that made understanding Professor Pincus' analysis tricky, but I learned a lot of information and gained a new way to think about politics differently in one semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to any students who are interested in empire or British\/American history. It was certainly interesting to me, but I think anybody who really studies in those fields would find this to be even more engaging and relevant than I did.",
    "If you are interested in the period or the subject material, then take the course. However, it is a lot of work and is essentially Steven Pincus advancing his opinion.",
    "I definitely recommend this to other students. It's a really engaging course that not only teaches students to think critically, but also teaches good historiography skills. Also, the format is awesome: each lecture is not a review of facts, but a story that follows a larger argument. One lecture, for example, talked about Ireland and the West Indies, but answered two key questions and formulated a larger argument based on this. I would say don't take this with too many hard classes as it will take a lot of your time. It is worth it, though.",
    "This is definitely a great course for all. It is packed full of information and really teaches you tons of facts from a large period of time in Britain. It has a lot of readings but overall is very manageable and interesting.",
    "I thought the class was very interesting, and I definitely learned a lot from it. I probably wouldn't recommend it to someone else, however, because there was just too much going on between the really fast lectures that went over a ton of information or the amounts of reading that were just very hard to finish. I do still think the information about Britain's Empire was all interesting, and I'm glad I now know it.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student deeply interested in the course material. It is not a very accessible course for non-humanities majors, but offers a very in-depth exploration of British colonial policy.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "A lot of primary source reading and a difficult paper. The lectures are very interesting, and the class is certainly worth takings.",
    "If you are interested in the British Empire (especially political and economic history) I would take this course.",
    "I would recommend HIST 238 to a certain type of Yale student. I found the course to be a fascinating and apolitical (as in it did not have an agenda of politicizing a history) run through of Britain as an Empire from 1600-1776. For any student who enjoys challenging themselves in a history course, this is a great one to take. It does not require memorization, but instead required a broader understanding of themes and trends throughout the course and for those who want to learn a more thematic history, this course is perfect. Ultimately, not every Yalie wants to take a challenging thematic history course (that is also filled with many names that matter on the ID section of the test), but for those who want to gain a new perspective on a history that Americans don't like to talk about much, I'd strongly recommend it.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in the British Empire, early America, or the American Revolution. Don't be intimidated by the workload, it's actually quite manageable on a week-to-week basis and most of your learning will be done simply by attending lecture. You understanding of the geopolitics of the imperial world will be completely changed, and your view of particular events (ie, the Revolution, or the French and Indian War, etc) will be challenged. Absolutely a must-take for anyone interested in Early America!"
