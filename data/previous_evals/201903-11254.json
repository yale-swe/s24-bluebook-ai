   "comments": [
    "Having already taken Differential Calculus in high school, this course strengthened my knowledge on the matter, as well as providing me the derivation for many of the theorems and formulas utilized in the differential calculus. This class also allowed me a space to improve upon my note-taking skills, which I believe were severely lacking before arriving at college.",
    "My knowledge of integral calculus was expanded on and reaffirmed from Calc BC in highschool, and this class was my first exposure to college problem sets and explorations, which helped me learn how to prepare for class each day.",
    "How to approximate curvy things with straight things.",
    "learned all about cal 2, covering topics from basic integration to polar",
    "solving problems with integrals, infinite series, introduction to multivariable calculus (rotation of solids, several variables)",
    "calc ii skills integration, series sequences, etc.",
    "I learned the basics of Calculus 2.",
    "Developed Calculus 2 skills.",
    "I developed insight on how to problem solve.",
    "I learned how to do a variety of problems in calculus but also learned how to think of them bigger picture. Instead of just memorizing strategies for solving problems, I learned why we use the methods that we do and how better to approach a problem.",
    "I learned how to approximate curvy things with straight things",
    "I took BC Calc in high school so all of this material was review.",
    "Series, integrals, polar functions",
    "I developed multiple methods of solving and using integrals. I also developed problem solving skills through the specific tests\/ways to solve each integral. In turn, I learned that the first method would not always be right.",
    "Calculus",
    "I developed more in-depth problem-solving skills when confronted with challenging applications of basic calculus concepts we learned in class on the midterm and final exams. I also gained more insights into the importance of calculus and college math as a discipline itself due to my instructors contagious passion for the subject material and enthusiasm for the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course did a great job in teaching the skills of calculus, even at a beginner level. I believe that one of the bigger issues in my experience was the structure of the second midterm. Many of my peers who are also enrolled in this course brought up the fact that the second midterm was not paced well, and that it was much more difficult than it is. As well as this, some of the decisions to extend or shorten the time allotted for a problem set around the week of a break was not favorable to me personally, as I would have much rather had the option to work on the assignment beforehand instead of having to complete it in conjunction with work from my other classes.",
    "This class covers a broad range of material, which means that people who have very little knowledge of integral calculus to people who are pretty confident in their skills and only need some brushing up in the later units all are grouped together. This leads to very low engagement from some and a lot of struggling from others. There almost needs to be a further breakdown between learning all the way from Riemann sums for those coming from Calc AB versus just relearning some series and parametric\/polar stuff for those from Calc BC who know the earlier material very well already.",
    "I loved how my instructor would pause to allow us to think of questions.",
    "The professor was really helpful and understanding when we had questions, and I felt I learned cal 2 critically and in-depth. A weakness is that it is still cal 2",
    "Its a course of very important information, but I didnt like the format. I felt like very little got done in class",
    "The teaching across all sections was not uniform, which led to some discrepancies in the knowledge of students across sections. This led to some questions on the midterms having been addressed well by some instructors, while others had failed to cover them. Overall, it was relatively well taught, and Dr. VandenBoom was great.",
    "Vandenboom is a really good teacher. He is super organized and class flows in a logical way.",
    "I really liked the explorations and the problem sets because they very directly helped emphasize what we had learned in class and helped me prepare for both the midterm and the final. I think that, to improve the course, the lectures could be broken up with more worksheets or activities instead of just listening for the majority of the 75 minutes.",
    "The course is graded very harshly.",
    "Material did not seem useful",
    "Strengths of this course: in depth discussion on each topic with lots of room for questions, explorations to give a preview of each class, a wide variety of sections giving lots of people to work with. Weaknesses: Wednesday problem sets Improve: move problem sets to Friday or Sunday",
    "The professor was great and very passionate but the class seemed impersonal a lot of the time",
    "Although my professor did a wonderful job pausing to answer questions and trying his hardest to make sure every student in the class was on the same page, the second midterm and final seemed disproportionately challenging compared to the material and practice problems covered in class\/homework assignments. Furthermore, the exploration activities that were due at midnight before each class period did not really have the intended effect for me. They often took me much longer to complete than the average time and provided little insight into the material we would be learning in class the next day. It would have been more effective for me personally to use the time I spent trying to figure out the exploration activities instead reading the chapter in the textbook and completing the examples provided in each chapter, a task that I ended up completing in addition to the exploration activities (as a result taking me much longer to complete these assignments before each class)."

   "comments": [
    "For someone who wants to pursue a field in mathematics, or needs to take this class as a pre-requirement, I believe that the course was very well laid out, and I had an overall positive experience.",
    "I'd recommend this course to those looking to build up their calculus knowledge, but I would recommend it to someone who has probably already been exposed to some of the material, as the later units seemed to move very fast and wasn't as clarifying as it could have been for those that hadn't seen such problems before.",
    "Yes, it is a good math class.",
    "Yes; a background in math is necessary for STEM and useful for other areas",
    "This course is a great introduction to university mathematics. I took calculus in high school and was already familiar with integrals, but techniques that we used in the class were completely different.",
    "if u have to take it sure",
    "I would not unless you plan to take higher levels of math. I was told to take it because it would help in Econ. It did not.",
    "I'm not sure this is a class that people take if they do not need it to fulfill a requirement\/go further in mathematics.",
    "Sure but it's hard to get excited about a required course like this.",
    "Yes. It is a very helpful gen ed class to get a basic understanding of calculus.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to gain a foundation in calculus. It was taught clearly, and it was very easy for me to get help from peer tutors or office hours if I sought that out.",
    "Yes, excellent course. Very good to learn integration and Calc 2 at a steady pace.",
    "I would tell other students who have to take 115 to shop different sections to find a teacher they understand well.",
    "If they have to take it",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has taken Calc 1. Very similar course with expansion into integrals.",
    "Yes but only if they have already taken BC Calculus because the course is fast paced",
    "If the student was passionate about math instead of just trying to fulfill a prerequisite, I would highly recommend this course. However, I believe passion and self-motivation are two very necessary components to success in Math 115 and students who lack this might find difficulty in the class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they must take it as a requirement. The curriculum causes the course to be taught at a really quick pace that puts students who have not had exposure to Calculus II at an inherent disadvantage. Also, the curriculum emphasizes the wrong topics that are not seen on exams."
