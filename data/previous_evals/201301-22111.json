    "I'd recommend her gamelan class over this one. It was more fun and way chiller. This one has some brutal transcriptions that are just ridiculous.",
    "Music 306 changed the way that I listen to music. Through transcription, composition, and analysis of music from several cultures, the course teaches another way to listen to music, from tuning to ornaments to melodies to phrases to large-scale musical structures. I would definitely recommend every musician take Music 306.",
    "Transcription! If you really hate transcribing music, don't take this course. But if you're okay with it, go for it! Sarah knows that students are at all different levels and it was nice to know that she expected each student to work at their own level.",
    "I took this course to fill one of the slots for the theory requirement. Sarah Weiss is the best--she's very kind, and sympathetic with students having trouble transcribing 8 minutes of rapid Arab music never having heard it before--don't take it if it's anyone else.",
    "This is a good class if you want a very broad overview of world music. It focuses on tramscribing music each week that is not meant to be notated, which I found to be pretty difficult. However, Sarah is very open and enthusiastic, and wonderful to talk to.",
    "A really interesting and challenging class that will dislodge you from your traditional Western conception of mode, scale, and performance. The transcriptions can get really tough, but if anyone Sarah is awesome at calming your nerves when you feel like your transcription sucks. I would recommend this if you're interested in expanding your musical horizons in an interactive way.",
    "Tough. Very good for developing independence as a student. Operates much more like a grad seminar than a theory class."
