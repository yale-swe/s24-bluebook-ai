   "comments": [
    "There is a TON of material in this course. With no problem sets, you can basically cruise between the three exams (two midterms and a final, which are weighted equally and you get to drop one), and then kill yourself the two nights before each test. Professor Crabtree actually wrote the textbook himself and follows it more-or-less, so if lecture seems like an information overload, you can enjoy the even denser reading at your leisure. Organometallic chemistry is a little fuzzy in terms of how it justifies effects; it seems like any phenomenon can be rationalized by using the correct mix of explanations (with \"back-bonding\" being by far the most common). Crabtree does a pretty good job highlighting historical errors where confirmation bias created some heated debates in the scholarly community, using these examples as learning tools for future research and scientific debate (this was a nice practical part of the course). Overall, I believe this course provides a complete and manageable introduction to the field, and any aspiring organic or inorganic chemist should have this on their shopping list.",
    "CHEM 452 is good advanced chemistry class to take. The lectures are entertaining and follow closely with Crabtree's book",
    "A continuation of inorganic chem. Same style, except there's no section and no homework. Tests are tough but it was an interesting class, and it must be one of the easier \"advanced chem lectures\" (at least with Crabtree).",
    "Seems at first to be a recap of 252 but then moves into some more complex stuff about halfway through. Not especially difficult, especially as upper-level chemistry courses go, but you have to teach yourself a lot of the material since lectures can be a bit unclear, but the book is engaging and helpful. Go to lecture and take notes, otherwise you'll find yourself looking at the lecture slides later and not understanding what's going on. Looking at the book helps a lot.",
    "If you want a more thorough version of inorganic chemistry, go for it! Be prepared to really study and work on your own, but it's good.",
    "Pretty similar to the inorganic chemistry class but with extra material. No problem sets, and there are two midterms and a final, which you get to drop the lowest score. Be warned however that undergraduates and graduate students get graded separately and not many undergraduates take the class."
