    "Very good course, about the diverse aspects of early modern London. It was interesting to trace the development of London from its little walls and parishes to a London we recognize. Really well developed and well taught. Professor Wrightson is lovely and provides ample individual guidance. A much better balance between discussing secondary and primary sources.",
    "Definitely -- his class straddles a balance between and undergraduate class and a graduate class. We were entrusted with the maturity to explore with issues and angles that we really cared about instead of being spoon-fed questions. Prof. Wrightson provided enough support and direction in our research that ensured a real wholesome learning of not only society and culture in London but also on historiography itself."
