    "This class has a relatively light work load but Thompson makes lectures extremely entertaining if you go and you definitely come out with a completely new knowledge you would probably never touch again.",
    "Definitely a good time.",
    "It is an amazing class that you should definitely take! The material is interesting and the work load is pretty light. It makes a great 5th class.",
    "A better course then first semester's Mambo, actually. More afro-centered then Creole Americas.",
    "Yes",
    "There are only three assignments you need to complete for the class: two hour tests and a research paper. The lectures are pretty chill. Be prepared for Professor Thompson to call on you (he calls on students to participate\/ dance in almost every lecture).",
    "exploration of historical and artistic elements of many different African cultures and societies",
    "Best class ever!! Very light workload..never a dull moment in class. Master T is the man. MUST TAKE at Yale",
    "If you want a gut course that's often pretty interesting and, failing that, usually pretty entertaining, take this. Plus Master T is an institution and getting pretty old, so you should take this soon.",
    "Definitely. Easy credit",
    "I took it to get a humanities credit. At first I liked it, but the whole rigmarole of interactions between Master T and football players got pretty old. Master T mumbles, presents what feels like a very random PowerPoint, and really has no sense of what's going on in class (oftentimes, he would keep going past 12:25, so students would all pack up and leave, and he would still keep talking oblivious to this)",
    "Must take.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is well known for being a gut class but your grade is based on what TA you end up with, and there's always a panic before each midterm because no one knows what to study for them.",
    "A great class for all! Not too hard either!",
    "It's a gut",
    "No, nothing gained, nothing lost, a simple waste of a credit.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in traditions of the black atlantic african traditions. Not difficult and very interesting. Perfect humanities credit for anyone looking to take a class covering unique information.",
    "Very interesting, very easy.",
    "Great gut",
    "If you need a fun class for a humanities credit, you cant go wrong with this class",
    "This is a great and interesting class. Not too much work, just 2 midterms and a paper, and Master T is the most entertaining lecturer at Yale. Plus this is a classic Yale course, must take.",
    "I would recommend this as a non-major class that could boost your GPA.",
    "yeah the material was not especially interesting to me but it was an easy 5th class",
    "I recommend it",
    "Yes, great class if you need something fun.",
    "I treated it almost as an independent study course. I loved it. It changed my perception entirely on modern and contemporary art. Must take at yale.",
    "This is the most unstructured class I've ever taken at Yale. Yes, it's entertaining at time, but it's impossible to tell what's important and while Master T is awesome, his lectures are incredibly disorganized. If you're looking for a course that you can skip all of the classes for and still get a decent grade, this is the one. There are so many better classes out there though!",
    "Black Atlantic is a fun class about the history and culture of dance, architecture, art, etc",
    "Freaking awesome. Take it.",
    "Amazing class. Master T has so much ashe its uncanny",
    "Master T is a great guy and an engaging lecturer. I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "A must take class if only for the experience of watching Master T lecture.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Only a midterm, final and a final paper. Every class, Master T. performs, sings, and dances. Sometimes there are live performances too. You must take a class with Master T before you graduate. He's incredible!",
    "It's a gut. There is basically no work, but be warned...you still have to put in the effort to study for the exams!! They can tell who studied off of a group study guide and who never went to class. And they really reward you if you go to class. It's pretty disorganized, and hard to understand Master T at times, especially when he starts speaking in foreign languages. I would take it if you intend to go to class and are looking for minimal work during the year.",
    "The coolest part about the course is walking into the African Art section of the art gallery and realizing you actually understand some of the underlying aesthetic conversations taking place. If you go to lecture, you will learn something new about a part of the world and area of art history that is too often neglected.",
    "Yes.",
    "I really enjoyed it. It provided a new view and perspective on Black history that I didn't have before.",
    "yes! great class to complete your education at Yale, fun and interesting",
    "Yes, makes you look at world differently",
    "I'd recommend this course if you're interested in AFAM studies or looking for a semi-relaxed enjoyable class. It's definitely fun and interesting",
    "Good class. I'd recommend it. Prepare to study for the midterms though. The essay is over spring break.",
    "Your experience is very dependent on your TA, but Master T really knows what he's talking about!",
    "Yes, this class is very interesting and exposed me to a subject that I knew very little about. After taking this class, I began to see African influences in the contemporary music and culture that I previously took for granted.",
    "This is a pretty simple class, not too much work. Most people refer to this class as a \"gut\". You only have two exams and one paper, all three of which are super basic with lots of time in between. The class will probably be about 300 people but after the first two weeks most people stop showing up.",
    "Take this class as a fifth class.",
    "Probably one of the easiest classes offered here, though your grade is very dependent on your TA. If you study for the two tests and write a decent paper then you should be golden.",
    "Best class ever. Take it.",
    "Large lecture with a storied professor. There are very few assignments (1 paper, 2 tests) so you have to be ready for them.",
    "Amazing class! Don't bother going to lecture. Just look at the syllabus, and teach yourself a few facts about each of the topics covered. You can do this by skimming the required textbooks. For the tests, try to memorize A LOT of info about ANY topic regarding West African culture. The test prompts are extremely broad, allowing you to write about pretty much anything.",
    "#funtimeswithmastert",
    "YES!",
    "If you take it seriously, it can be a great class. If not, don't waste your time.",
    "Absolutely. Take it for an easy credit.",
    "I would recommend Black Atlantic for fellow students who are genuinely interested in the material. Some of it is very eye-opening. However, the issues with the structure and organization of the course can be problematic for learning.",
    "If you take it, take it Credit\/D. The TAs grade harshly",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a fairly easy A and a very light work load. I also recommend that everyone take a course with Professor T at some point in their Yale career.",
    "I would recommend taking this class on the condition that you get a good TA. Yes this can be an easy A, but the grading in this course is extremely subjective. The lectures are amazing, and Thompson is so passionate about his work that you will get excited about the material. Generally the TAs are very lenient and you will get a good grade, however, there is always one TA who consistently gives bad grades. In this it is a toss up so just keep this in mind. The tests are simple and open ended asking you to talk about what you learned so I would recommend this course.",
    "Interesting. Take it",
    "Awesome class that changes your views on African Arts and Traditions",
    "Take the course.",
    "This class is an easy A if you have a good paper and get good notes for the in class tests. Don't take the class to lightly though",
    "Take it",
    "POW!!! A rhythmized figure moves to the beats emanating from the surrounding drum circle, pounding out multiple meters in stark contrast to the 4:4 sensibilities of the West. This is Africa. This is Master T.POW!!! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in class, third week in. Attendance has dwindled, but T doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss a step. He calls you out during a riff on the Kongo dance tradition and takes you to the stage. Your pulse quickens, the whole class is watching \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but more than that T is watching. T, a man who has known the world and loved its women.POW!!! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the day of the final. You have done a bit of the reading, but aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure if that will be enough to do well. The lights dim, the test questions come into focus: \u00e2\u0080\u0098What have you learned since the midterm?\u00e2\u0080\u0099.To put into words? To scrape onto these dead trees with the carbon of life past what T has shown about life. Pick up the pencil. Eye, forward and piercing. Face, stone cool.Don't be a fool.",
    "- Its a good humanities credit. A isn't easy if you have a horrible teaching fellow than mine. In that case, make Master T check your stuff, he is damn cool! This is a good intro to African culture and not that work intensive. I recommend it but run away if you get Audrey Sands as your TA",
    "Black Atlantic is a great class if you're looking for something that will be a more relaxed environment, but will still provide you a chance to learn about a subject you probably know very little about. Great class.",
    "Take the class.",
    "Large Lecture. Pretty chill. Good class for when you have a busy schedule.",
    "It's the most fun class I've taken at Yale. Unlike a lot of people in the class, my main reason for taking the class is that I was genuinely interested in the subject matter (the fact that it's an easy class was just a plus). That being said, I definitely feel like I learned a lot from this class. It isn't a class where you will come away with a step-by-step chronology of black art. Instead, it'll make you question the way you view black art in general, especially the relationship between black art in Africa compared to in the Americas. I'm a very type A person, so this was a great class for me to shut down that part of me and allow myself to be more flexible.",
    "Great class, informative, entertaining and I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Take it! Master T is hilarious. The material is different and interesting. The class is pretty chill with two hour exams and a ten page final paper.",
    "Don't take it",
    "100% recommend this class to a classmate. It was not a lot of work but always interesting.",
    "Definitely take this class. Master T's lectures are one of a kind.",
    "Your TA pretty much decides your grade in this class, some are fairer graders than others. Otherwise I would really recommend this class, it's very interesting and you learn a lot from a really fun professor.",
    "This lecture is a zany, interactive story time that is a welcome break from more traditionally taught courses. Recommend if you are willing to go along for the ride!",
    "Absolutely take it",
    "Great class! Take it!",
    "Perfect Credit\/D you'll do no work",
    "this class has essentially no work. most people never go to class but if you do, master T is downright hilarious. if you're looking for a class where you basically do nothing, this is it. however, grading really depends on your TA. mine was harsh on the midterms (each 1\/3) but easy on the paper (another 1\/3 of final grade)",
    "Really interesting material, I definitely recommend it to anyone!",
    "Good 5th class with a minimal work load and low time commitment. Your grade is based on how strict your TA is though so it's not necessarily a guaranteed A.",
    "Take it. Not a lot of work and fun. And Master T is a professor you want to take a class with.",
    "Very fun and interesting class. Provides a good change of pace from regular class schedule.",
    "Must Take. You actually do learn a lot and its fun if you go to lecture. Great 5th class.",
    "I would recommend this class. Material is interesting and workload is very manageable.",
    "This is the most chill class I've ever taken. The exams are very open-ended, so just know some info to write down. And enjoy the fun lectures!",
    "African American native dance, music, art, and culture.",
    "An absolute must take. The class could benefit from some more organization, but the class presents a field of study so radically different from what I study (MCDB) that I found myself immersed in it and absolutely loving the class. Professor Thompson is great and the TFs aren't that bad at all",
    "A must take. Loved the class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it- only if you are interested in the african diaspora though. Master T makes the material fun, but in order to read the books you have to have a true interest as well.",
    "If you pulled out a dictionary and looked up the word \"joke\", you would find this class as the definition. No one ever goes to lectures, and the tests could have been taken by middle schoolers (and possibly made by them). If you get a competent TA, you can easily get an A, and if you take it Cr\/D\/F, then you're about to waste a good portion of your life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is very interesting and very low work load. that being said, take the time to learn the information and read the books - they are fun easy reads and you will actually learn a lot",
    "Good class, helps balance schedule.",
    "The course is definitely a gut in the sense that there is hardly any work at all - class meets twice a week for 50 minutes, no section, and only a few books to read over the course of the semester. The grade consists of two one-hour tests and a 10 page research paper. Even though there is little work, this does not mean the class is an easy A. I read all of the books and studied throughly for the exams and did not score extremely well on the exams. It seemed that my grader was a harsh one; the grade I received on my paper was equivalent to the score another student received even though she didn't include citations. It seems to depend on who your TA is and it should be said that most TAs are fairly easy.",
    "Not a gut at all!!! Don't take this!!",
    "Take it.",
    "It is the study of various cultures including, but not limited to, the Mande, Kongo, Dahomey, and Yoruba. Also, we focused on dances, and even an epic poem. It is a very interesting class that I would recommend.",
    "Black Atlantic is different than any course I have taken at Yale. There isn't much work, but that being said it isn't necessarily easy to get a good grade. A lot of your grade will depend on which TA you get. So, you definitely want to be careful.",
    "Great class. Rather strange material but still very interesting.",
    "Take it!",
    "great",
    "yes it is a fun humanities credit.",
    "Yes because it teaches you a lot about African culture.",
    "Great class with relatively little work load. Master T is a legend and if you get the chance take him out to eat one time. You will not regret it.",
    "Black Atlantic is, as everyone knows it to be, one of the easiest courses at Yale (depending on your TA). The information itself is kind of interesting but, really, most of the students are in it for the easy grade. I went to most of the lectures and did the readings about a week before the two hour tests and knew all I needed to know. If you want an easy class about African culture and dance, this is it. It can be quite frustrating at times though because the class is actually that boring.",
    "It's a great class if you have a lot on your plate for the semester.",
    "can i get a G-U-T? seriously though if you don't do well in this class, someone messed up in admissions.",
    "Amazing. Life changing. Tons of fun. Please actually go to class and have an open mind. You'll be so glad you did",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You will learn a lot about a very relevant subject and will have fun in the process. Lectures are great and the readings are interesting too. Master T is awesome and any class with him is going to be good.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student",
    "An art history class that is entertaining because of who teaches it. The art history itself is cool, but lets be honest, many people take this class as a gut (and several get screwed), so it's really what you want to get out of the course",
    "A very enriching class with a great professor. Learning about an entirely new culture is something an undergraduate must experience during their tenure here.",
    "It's a great class and you learn a lot about various African civilizations and their influence on the Americas. The workload is very light: one 10-page paper on the topic of your choosing, and 2 in-class hour exams, which are totally manageable if you attend lectures (and do the readings you're \"supposed\" to do). This class was so much fun to go to!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student--it was an interesting and enlightening experience.",
    "Great class, absurdly easy."
