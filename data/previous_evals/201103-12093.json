    "This is a very interesting introduction to the field of global health and the social issues that impact health. I would definitely recommend this class to any student. Very interesting, not much work.",
    "Only take this class if you are seriously interested in global health and don't mind learning theory rather than practice",
    "This was a horribly disappointing course out of which I learned just about nothing.The professor is a very smart, approachable, knowledgable, and caring woman; she's great. That being said, the course was a terrible failure: the class is a twice-a-week lecture with no section (and therefore no means to actually digest or think about the course content). There is literally no work for the class - only four quizzes, a midterm, and a final. All of those examinations are taken directly from the lecture, meaning that the insignificant amount of dry and superficial reading that you do is never actually tested.Professor Panter-Brick is good at lecturing, but bad at putting together a lecture. Generally she threw together Powerpoint slides an hour before class started, and then used them over the course of 75 minutes to make a point like, \"Poverty is bad,\" or, \"We should do something about poverty.\" She was absent for about half of the semester (mostly due to family emergencies), so we had a few interesting videos and guest speakers.It's an easy class, a class that won't teach you anything, and not a good way to learn anything about global health.",
    "Take it. It's a great class; comprehensive, interesting and not too much work.",
    "Don't take it. It doesn't live up to the potential of the subject by any means. You leave without a real grasp of anything. Maybe if you're completely unfamiliar with any sort of health issues, then it's a good survey course. Otherwise, it's a waste of time. Take another health course.",
    "ANTH 257 is a great introduction to Global Health if that's what you're looking for. Overall a good course, but needs better structure.",
    "though the course gets a bit repetitive and seems pretty intuitive by the end, i ended up really liking it! prof. panter-brick is a baller, and she deals with all of these super-sensitive topics very well. it's also pretty chill work-wise, so that's nice",
    "I came into this class not knowing much about Global Health and having little interest, and left in love with Global Health and with a strong knowledge base on the challenges in Global Health. Professor Panter-Brick is a wonderful professor and will make you fall in love with Global Health. She does a great job of teaching students how to approach Global Health and what needs to be done. You will come out of this class feeling the urge to make the world a better place. I really loved the anthropological basis of this class and felt like it was a great viewpoint that you don't usually see in Global Affairs classes. Professor Panter-Brick shows that all goals of international development are contingent on global health and shows the huge connection between poverty alleviation and global health. If you are at all interested in international development, TAKE THIS CLASS! You will love it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Even if you think you don't care about global health, take this class. You will learn about policy, what affects behavior, and what works to make effective change--skills applicable to any major, not just global health. I got my mind blown twice a week. I can't recommend this highly enough.",
    "This class was a disappointment. Take it only if it would \"blow your mind\" (as I have heard classmates say) to learn that health and social inequality persists on this planet. If you want to sit through a lecture in which the professor painfully tries to treat a hall of over 100 students as if they were a seminar, this is the place for you. In one class the TFs spent a solid 25 minutes leading a \"discussion\" about students' \"feelings\" in response to a movie. Every class is conducted with the expectation of some sort of class discussion, which is impossible to hear and turns into a total waste of time.It often felt as if the professor was just trying to bide time. Professor Panter-Brick only lectured for twelve out of our twenty-four classes. HALF of the class was spent on movies, guest speakers, and student presentations. This would be great if this were a seminar... but it's not. This is a lecture class you will dread going to twice a week. The subject matter should be fascinating, but it's presented in such a haphazard way that it becomes grating.",
    "This was a wonderful course. Panter-Brick is an amazing professor and woman and really personalized the class which made it much better. Work load isn't bad and most of the assigned readings are gone over in lecture (at least what you need to know for quizzes) and she gives you the exam essays beforehand so it's great.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING! Definitely take it if you get the chance. Professor Panter-Brick is a great lecturer and really teaches you how to think about the field of global health. The work load is really light (4 quizzes, a midterm and a final whose questions you get beforehand).",
    "I really liked the material of the course and I found it very interesting and insightful. What I didn't really like was the way the course was set up. That is to say, I would had much preferred to have section every week where we could discuss the material, because the current framework was somewhat unnerving in the sense that I sometimes felt that it was OK to delay my reading until the quizzes or exams which was not very productive. Also, I feel that section would be useful in order to discuss the material in greater depth.",
    "yes very interesting and new perspective on health studies",
    "Introductory course on global health.",
    "This class seems very interesting at first but gets repetitive very quickly. The same problems and same lack of solutions are presented over and over again to the point that they seem to lose importance. That said, Prof. Panter-Brick is really great, she really cares about her students, takes student feedback into account, and is always trying to make her class better. The workload is minimal (short readings- do them! you'll regret not doing them later), only one midterm and a final. Basically, take this class if you can handle the seeming uselessness of anthropology and want a chill class with a great professor.",
    "If you are really interested in global health, don't take this class until it is restructured and gets a lot better. You will be insanely frustrated otherwise.",
    "Take this class. You'll learn a ton, and the material and structure of the course is very straightforward.",
    "It is about global health. Not very demanding workload but doesn't allow for original thinking or discussion which can be frustrating.",
    "This is a great introductory course because it covers a long list of interesting themes without too much depth, but I still feel like I learned a lot. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for an easy fifth class, for example, because it wasn't too challenging.",
    "I would recommend it with reservations about the breadth of the course.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're looking for an easy 5th that will be mildly interesting. If you are seriously interested in global health, then this class might be a good jumping off point. I would not recommend it if you're looking for a serious, in-depth study of global health interventions.",
    "Professor Panter Brick does seem genuinely committed to making the class as good as possible, so she'll probably adjust the class a lot for next year. Take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in a sort of survey of global health, from a less biological perspective and from a more social perspective. It's not too much work and the concepts are easy to understand, Professor Panter-Brick is great, and she brings in a lot of good guest lecturers and lets you watch movies. The quizzes and tests aren't difficult, and you don't have to do all of the reading either since she explains a lot of it really well during lecture. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this is class is if you are looking for more of a methods\/science based approach to global health - then some of the concepts might seem a bit too fluffy.",
    "Anthropology 257 is an introductory course to the field of global health. The course content is as broad as the topic itself, encapsulating the multi-faceted nature of global health itself. I would recommend this course to another student if he or she were interested in global or public health. This is very much an introductory course.",
    "It's an alright course",
    "ANTH 257 is a class that poses questions about how global health should be addressed (this comes up in the beginning of the course with the discussion of anthropological theory) and then goes on to specify the most important challenges in the field at the moment.i would not recommend this class to any student who has any sort of understanding that global health is a complicate issue that involved more of biology. If you understand that there are social determinants of health, you probably won't learn that much in this class.",
    "This class was incredibly frustrating because it has a great message but horrible presentation. I know that there are those who will say this course is amazing (and I can only hope that they are freshmen who will see they are wrong when they take other, truly amazing, courses at Yale) but it was very poorly executed. The professor uses class time to go over the reading, if she's even the one lecturing at all. She would also try to have discussions in a class of over 50 people -- something that did not work because of the size. I would not recommend this class at all unless it's required for some program you're doing. Assignments: 4 quizzes (that tested you on exact wording of readings), midterm, final.",
    "i would absolutely recommend this class to another student. i plan on pursuing a career in global health, so i'm a little biased, but i think this class presented us with really important things to consider pertaining to any type of international work",
    "This is a course that can be taken as a gut or serious course. It definitely allows you to skate by not doing any work, but if you don;t want that, you can make it into something more meaningful. I would recommend itif you want a simple 5th course. However, if you want a course that talks more about real world issues and not theories, this is not the course.",
    "Good 5th class, you can absolutely get away with not doing the reading and they give you the midterm and final questions in advance.",
    "The class doesn't live up to everything it seems like it will be during the first lecture. It is enjoyable though, and the work is minimal. The reading isn't necessary and she shows the exam questions ahead of time. The professor is awesome.",
    "YES TAKE IT. You learn a lot about global health which is a new-ish discipline and very very relevant to the world today. Also with a great professor, and great reading material. Not a bad workload at all!",
    "I would not recommend this class unless the entire structure of it gets completely reworked; right now, there isn't any organization or flow to the lessons, there isn't an emphasis on real life problems, and the lectures get so repetitive that it seems like there is onlyone real point to the entire course: culture matters.Professor Panter-Brick is a baller, though; she's done some incredibly cool work. I wish she would bring more of that to the class.",
    "This is a broad intro course, but it is so broad and general that it becomes useless. If you need someone to tell you \"this is what global health is and it is important,\" by all means take the course. If you actually want to learn concrete things and come away with any real knowledge or skills, stay away. I felt it was a waste of a credit.",
    "not much work and interesting material. the readings and lectures were sort of bland but if you like the material it's a good gut and there's no section",
    "Awesome course if interested in Global Health.",
    "Take it! This is a great class that will make you think and give you a deeper understanding of the challenges that face global health. Professor Panter-Brick is great!",
    "This is an amazing introduction to the current state of global health in the world and an in depth discussion of problems with current attempted solutions. Take this class if you are interested in gaining a greater background on global health and want something that won't kick your butt!",
    "This was an outstanding course taught by an amazing professor. If you have any interest in how health is approached on the global scale through all different disciplines, Professor Panter-Brick will really help you to develop a passion. There are four short quizzes that were pretty manageable, and the midterm and final consisted of a few essays that were chosen from prompts that had been revealed the week before. On the first day she said that she wanted us to have the opportunity to \"really shine\" on the midterm and final. She wants you to care about global health the way that she does.",
    "It's a pretty interesting class, but it gets really repetitive really quickly. The entire class is very vague and theoretical, and all like \"these global health problems can't really be fixed, when we try, we just screw something else up.\" The readings are never discussed, and the quizzes aren't bad at all. The midterm and final are graded fairly; you get the questions beforehand.",
    "An introduction to global health issues.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload is definitely manageable and almost all of the readings are informative and interesting. Professor Panter-Brick is an amazing lecturer and the guest lecturers that are brought in are also very good. This class was a great class to help build knowledge on the fieldof global health and the problems it faces.",
    "The class is basically an introduction to a wide spectrum of global health issues from a theoretical standpoint, with some examples thrown in here and there. Not to much work (4 quizzes, a midterm, and a final, all in class).",
    "Take it if you're looking for an easy introductory course to global health. You'll learn some very interesting things, be bored at other times, but overall come away feeling as though you've learned something. Good 5th class.",
    "The central message of this class reveals itself to you very early on. After this point, the class consists of driving this message home. You learn that it is better to approach problems in global health from a holistic, \"upstream\" perspective, and that interventions should be not just culturally appealing but culturally compelling. There are less case studies used in the class than most of us hoped for. Much of the readings are theoretical and highly anthropological.It can be interesting and easy. The quizzes are are centered around key terms that you learn very early on. After some point, most of us stopped doing the readings and still did better on the quizzes, because we had a closer understanding of the central message that we were supposed to regurgitate.The TAs ask for a very specific format in quiz essays, but once you grasp it, the rest should be easy.Don't buy the books that she asks you to buy. If you just check it out from the library, or grab it from a friend, you will be fine. We only had two or three readings from these books, and by the middle of the class you might have stopped doing the readings.",
    "This was a great course. Professor Panter-Brick really made class interesting with movies, guest lectures and interactive assignments. This was not a very difficult class with not much reading, but I found it very rewarding",
    "No, I definitely would not recommend this to another student. It was really quite bad. The lectures were incredibly repetitive and lacked any sort of real substance. We basically had the same handful of points repeated to us over and over again. Lectures were scattered, and the course as a whole lacked any sort of cohesion because the professor was barely present (she only taught 12 out of 24 classes), so most of the course was taught by movies or guest lecturers.The workload was really easy, but it was not worth it at all to have to sit through an entire semester of this class. It was really very unpleasant. Do not take this class.",
    "It's a gut. take it if you're interested in the material. don't be surprised if you feel frustrated by the lack of novelty.",
    "The promise of learning about \"global health\" while paying attention to cultural\/anthropological factors is undoubtedly great, but the question is whether this class measures up to that promise. I will say that the class offers many tools for examining particular global health challenges and interventions, and especially for understanding why challenges persist and interventions fail. Some degree of theoretical framework is given. Prof. Panter-Brick is an engaging, intelligent, funny and accessible lecturer who makes class worth going to. However, my problem with the class is that the lectures often seem disconnected, and that there are very few constructive solutions given. There were many abstract themes thrown around (explanatory models, health equity, structural violence, etc), but few concrete examples of how to address\/work with these concerns on the ground. The class is a good overview of the field of global health, but it quickly becomes frustrating\/demotivating to realize how small your toolkit it in actually working with real-world problems.",
    "I would describe the unique perspective that this class takes on global health. I think if you are pursuing global health, this anthropological perspective is necessary. I have already found the subject matter useful for several applied projects I'm involved in.",
    "TAKE IT. Great course, not too hard.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in learning about the many questions and problems within global health and medical anthropology today, with little background in both areas. Otherwise, the material will probably be to shallow and not challenging enough. In other words, the class is really only meant to be a survey of different topics, and often the lectures and readings promote the exact same take-home messages. The repetition and lack of depth can be a little frustrating.",
    "Yes! It gives great in-depth coverage of issues in global health.",
    "Anyone could and should take this class. It's easy to manage and is useful knowledge.",
    "I would recommend Biocultural Perspectives on Global Health to a fellow student that is interested in third-world health challenges and humanitarian aid in the 21st century. The course requires a moderate workload and lecture attendance is optional, but helpful. Four quizzes test knowledge of reading material and lecture content, most of which is posted online. There is no discussion section to accompany the class, which may be viewed positivelyby some, but I found that only a cursory treatment of critical issues was possible in the lecture setting. All in all, Health Studies 260 is an interesting and relevant course that I recommend to any student in search of a moderate course load to supplement a difficult academic schedule.",
    "Takes a while to get started and lectures can be slow but at times there are interesting topics.",
    "This course promises a wealth of information regarding the current field of global health but fails to deliver. The lectures are unrewarding and full of ambiguous, unrelated information. Although Professor Panter-Brick seems to genuinely care about how students perceive her course, the readings are not very interesting and her PowerPoints are disorganized. In addition, I did nearly all the essential readings and was still stumped by questions on the quizzes that apparently only came from these readings.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it if you want to be introduced to global health.",
    "If you do the reading and focus in class, you will enjoy it and easily do well.",
    "This class was okay. Basically you read a lot of theories and hear of a lot of examples pertaining to global health. But it seemed like the class almost degraded to importance of actually having medicine in global health, which I don't think it intended to do. Also the class was incredibly biased - we learned a lot about why global health is important to the world, but never really seemed to read any counterarguments to that (like how will any of these amazing new programs be funded?). That being said, Professor Panter-Brick is a wonderful lecturer, and sometimes the examples\/readings were interesting. I'm just not sure how much of a real topic 'global health' is - it's basically just a combination of a bunch of other topics, and all seems to boil down to common sense.",
    "It is a good introduction to \"Global Health.\" While it is engaging and eye-opening, it is also not a difficult class.",
    "Yes, most definitely. If you're premed, it reminds you that the requirements are just a few stepping stones to doing work thats going to help you make invaluable impacts on people's lives. Put everything into perspective for me.",
    "It is an introduction to global health from an anthropological standpoint. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Good course with interesting topics for those interested in global health.",
    "Prof. Panter-Brick is wonderful. Her lectures are fun and interesting, and the course included lots of cool guest lectures and thought-provoking films. On one hand, ANTH 257 was successful in providing me with a new view on global health and how we approach the obstacles associated with it. On the other hand, having completed thirty-something credits, ANTH 257 was personally the most frustrating class I have ever taken at Yale. The amount of work you put into the course does not correspond to the grade you receive. Quizzes that actually test your knowledge of the lecture and reading material count for a very small portion of your grade, while the midterm and final exams (all essays) constitute the rest. These exams do not test your grasping of the course, rather, they test how well you can organize the material given to you in the week you have with all of the potential exam questions in front of you. Translated: it's not hard at all to manage a B\/B+, but the difference between that and any flavor of A truthfully might as well be a coin toss.",
    "An absolutely phenomenal class, one of the very best I've taken at Yale so far! The course material is fascinating and super engaging, and Professor Panter-Brick is brilliant. You will love this class and leave it with a burning desire to change the world.",
    "Yes if you want to know what global health is about in general. You will be disappointed if you already know a lot about it and are looking for in-depth study of a particular issue.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - the course was very interesting, and the case studies were eye-openersBear in mind that the course will be theoretical towards the beginning but as Professor Panter-Brick explores specific examples, it becomes more engagingOn that note, Professor Panter-Brick is great - she really cares about making the class the best that it can be",
    "No, I wouldn't, unless the course is changed significantly to add sections or capped at a smaller number."
