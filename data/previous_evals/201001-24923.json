   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're a math major. Otherwise, don't bother.",
    "I would not recommend it if you want to just take a math course. It's not very interesting and extremely difficult.",
    "Like most classes, I only enjoyed this one after it was over. It's a lot of time and not particularly rewarding during the term, but once you finish the exam it feels good to have a understanding of some math that is critical for higher science classes. Take it if you need to, use the MIT opencourseware site (http:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/OcwWeb\/Mathematics\/18-02Fall-2007\/VideoLectures\/index.htm), which does a great job of explaining everything.",
    "Math 120 is a really cool course. You learn lots of interesting things and gain a much better ability to think in higher dimensions--although to do well it pays to just make it mechanical. Make sure you stay on top of your stuff and ask questions \/ go to office hours if you need help: you MUST understand Stokes and the Divergence Theorem, let alone Green's.",
    "Math 120 is simply Multivariable Calculus; odds are, you're taking it because you need to or because the math department toldyou to. That being said, I thought it was a good class. We covered double and triple integrals, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, Divergence Theorem, etc. The textbook is good, the problem sets are doable (though they get longer\/harder toward the end), and the exams are very fair.I would highly recommend Petros as a TA. He gave good notes, effectively covering both concepts and examples. He patiently answered questions, and is willing to meet with you not only in office hours, but whenever works best for you. He prepares you for the exams really well. Best of all, he's just a really nice\/funny guy. (There were even Dunkin Donuts periodically throughout the semester!) I'm not sure if he'll be around next year, but if he is, be sure to get in his section!",
    "I recommend the class, but be mindful that your experience is highly dependent on your TA."
