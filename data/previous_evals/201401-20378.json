    "do not take this course if it is taught by John Pittard. The class is pointless otherwise",
    "Broad. Yes.",
    "Definitely take this class! The format of the class is very straightforward, worth the effort you put in, and you definitely get a lot out of doing the readings and going to section and just listening to Pittard talk. He has a great sense of humor and always explains things well and he's super open and easy to talk to. It was a challenge diving in as a freshman who never took a philosophy class before, but so worth it. I absolutely loved it.",
    "My first philosophy class, and I found it to be excellent. There was a good balance between breadth and depth. The exams and quizzes were manageable (potential questions were given beforehand, so you don't have to study literally everything). The readings weren't too overbearing (and I really enjoyed some of the topics!) Professor Pittard put great handouts of the notes online for each class. There were about 25 people in the class. Total workload was 4 reading quizzes, 2 five-page papers (for undergrads), and a final exam at the end. Getting an A is definitely manageable if you put in the effort.",
    "Great class. We talked about a lot of issues in the philosophy of religion, like arguments for God's existence, the problem of evil, religious disagreement, and morality. Nothing was discussed in a whole lot of depth, but that's to be expected for such a broad course. This is a very comfortable entry point to philosophy, as I had never studied it before, but was able to track with the material quite well. The workload consisted of two papers, four quizzes, and a final exam for which the professor gave us the questions beforehand. If you're interested in the philosophy of religion, take this class, even if you've not studied philosophy before.",
    "Great class about the philosophy of religion, mostly Western monotheism. This class talks less about tenets of the major religions and more about the existence of God, how to approach having faith, the problem of evil, and the attributes of God, just to name a few. Very reasonable amount of work, but try not to fall behind in the readings if you can help it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is not quite sure what they believe, or would like to learn more why people have the basis for their beliefs.",
    "Philosophy of Religion is a really interesting class. The readings are of ancient and contemporary philosophers who argue for and against the existence of God, make arguments about the problem of evil, and make arguments about the compatibility of religion and science. Professor Pittard is a good teacher, although the lectures are occasionally a bit dry. I learned a lot in this class and would recommend it to another student.",
    "Good class, if you're interested in Philosophy, it's a good introductory course."
