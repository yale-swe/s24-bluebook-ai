   "comments": [
    "This class was wonderful. It was everything that I wanted it to be. Both the workshop setting and the one-on-one meetings with the professor were immense help. I feel like my writing improved both through my own work, and in exploring and evaluating the works of my peers and established writers. The professor was incredible. Not only was this class extremely helpful, but it was also highly enjoyable. I looked forward to it every week. Professor Woodard was also wonderful. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in fiction writing.",
    "Take English 245 with Professor Woodard if you get in. I am so glad I did. You'll have the chance to read some great stories and try your hand at writing stories of your own. Conferences with Professor Woodard are incredibly helpful, and she makes workshop something to look forward to. I always felt there was more I could strive for in terms of my own work in this class, and I think that proved to be very helpful, because I have walked away with two long stories I didn't have the skills to write at the beginning of the semester.",
    "English 245 is a workshop-driven course in fiction writing. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who feels truly ready to work and stretch him or herself to become a better writer. If you pay attention to Professor Woodard, participate fully in workshops, and put a lot of effort into your work for this course, your writing will be completely transformed by the time you leave.",
    "This course is oriented for writers or aspiring writers, but it can be fun for someone who's just interested in passing as well. Either way you will develop a creative practice in writing and you'll read fresh, interesting work from other students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! If you have any interest in writing at all, apply.",
    "Woodard is wonderful--she is kind, but just. This is not a class to screw around in though. She will push you, along with your fellow classmates, and if you fall behind, it will be obvious to everyone. It was the highlight of my week."
