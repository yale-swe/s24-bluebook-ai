    "Learned a lot about identifying orders and families of insects, insect collection and curation techniques",
    "I learned so much about bugs, it was fun.",
    "I learned so much about arthropod classification and collecting in addition to curation. Really this course taught me practical field skills and how to memorize a lot of Latin names.",
    "I learned not only how to capture different arthropods but also how to preserve, pin, and recognize them. In addition, I learned a lot of valuable observation skills in order to spot insects from looking in hidden places to the obvious ones. In a way, I had to think like an insect, trying to determine where they would most likely be. Furthermore, I was able to practice balancing the skills of the slow, stealthy approach to a more immediate, fast reaction in order to catch different types of bugs.",
    "I learned a lot about arthropod taxonomy and identification. I also gained practical skills in bug specimen collection, storage, pinning, presentation, and curation.",
    "Identification of terrestrial arthropods, particularly spiders and insects. Skills on creating museum quality insect collections."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Could be improved by decreasing the requirements of collection-there is not enough class time provided to finish the collection. You have to put in hours and hours of your own time (i.e. there until 8\/9pm every day during reading period) to get an A\/A- quality collection. Way too much time commitment for only 0.5 credit class. Strenghts: TAs and Professor Wells are super knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material, get to bond with them and your peers with the exorbitant amount of time you spend in the lab",
    "It is very time consuming, but I know Marta is aware of this. I think the trip to Florida can be improved. It should be shorter, or there should be breaks in the day considering people have other work to do for other classes.",
    "The quizzes each week, once they begun, were very helpful as they forced us to stay on top of studying and made the final practical much less overwhelming. One improvement for the course would be the time management towards the end. Near the end of the course, there was much outside work that needed to be put in, in order to finish the collection. The timing for this was terrible as there were other exams that students had to study for as well. If more work could be planned ahead of time, that would be a major improvement.",
    "The course is fun, interesting, and actually relaxing. It's nice to come to lab once a week and go outside to collect bugs or casually pin and arrange bug specimens. Plus, you learn practical skills used by entomologists in the field and in the lab. The course is too much work for a half credit though. The collection requirements are REALLY steep, and the weekly quizzes feel kinda futile. They're over so quick and what do we learn?",
    "The course was extremely well-taught, although the workload was a bit too much."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend but hopefully the workload is decreased in the future. Free trip to Florida (only a $50 contribution from students) fun, but leaves no time for catching up on sleep or other work. Really get to bond with your classmates and TAs\/Professor Wells. BEWARE, you spend much of reading period working on ID-ing your collection, takes up quite a lot of time, in lab from 10am to 6pm every day",
    "I recommend, but make sure you have a lot of time on your hands.",
    "This class is very time consuming but extremely rewarding. Collecting bugs is surprisingly very fun and this class will definitely give you an appreciation for it, but don't underestimate the time commitment curating and identifying a collection is. Overall I had an amazing time in class but it was by far the most difficult and time-intensive one I've taken.",
    "I would recommend this class with the warning that it does require a lot of time towards the end in order to finish the collection. Despite that, the course was excellent and provides you with different types of learning that simply cannot be taught inside a classroom. This include a familiarity with the habitats and behaviors of creatures, to observation skills in order to find them, and of course the physical and mental skills required to catch them at all. Overall, a great experience that provides a challenging, but fun and rewarding time.",
    "This course is a lot of work at the end of the semester. The semester-long project is to create a bug collection, and the requirements are *steep*. Do NOT underestimate how much time you will have to spend for this half-credit course. It's a lot. That said, I would still recommend this course. Collecting bugs is fun. Hanging out with Marta and the TA's is fun. Going to Florida is fun. It's fun.",
    "Must-take if you're interested in entomology."
