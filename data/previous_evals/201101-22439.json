   "comments": [
    "Although the workload at times was heavy, I learned a lot in this class and left at the end of the semester feeling accomplished. I definitely recommend the class to all engineering majors, and anyone else that is interested in learning the basis of how things work\/are made.",
    "No. Don't take it. Professor Dollar makes you want to shoot yourself with his lectures and the lab is way too much work to only be 1 credit altogether. All the material is either outdated or will be covered in Meng 280 or Meng 400. If you want an easy grade, the class isn't too much commitment until reading week, when you essentially live in lab finishing your project.",
    "Yes if you are interested in what is Mechanical Engineering. It can consumes up a lot of time because if you cut something out of the laser cuter and realize that it doesn't work, you have to wait 30 mins to make another cut. But if you paid more attention to the solidworks models, this shoudn't be a problem.",
    "MENG 185 is a LOT of work, but it pays off in the end. You end up with a fully functional remote controlled robot that you designed and built from scratch. For those who don't like building, or just want to take a casual robotics class, this class is not the one to take. For those truly passionate about robotics, engineering, machining\/industry\/ or design, this class is a great overview that gives you a lot of experience prototyping, problem solving, and learning about products from design to manufacturing.",
    "I recommend it if you are thinking of majoring in MechE. You will get to tinker with things and get basic experience with the machine shop and laser cutter.",
    "Mechanical Design provides a great overview of the design process, as well as the opportunity to apply some of what you've already learned in other foundational engineering classes to two major projects and competitions. Overall, I was able to gain a lot of practical experience that I would not have had otherwise, and would definitely recommend this class to other student. This course is, however, a lot of work, particularly during reading week before the final project is due.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in Engineering. It provides a good overview of what kind of work an engineer does.",
    "Take it if you plan on majoring in MechE",
    "The class is a good course to take if you are interested in majoring in Mechanical Engineering but are not entirely sure if you want to pursue the major. The course is a lot of work and you will end up spending a lot of time on SolidWorks. If you are giving the major serious consideration, I would recommend taking the course. The course helped me decide to stick with the major. I feel like the course does not encompass all aspects of mechanical engineering and thus the decision to pursue the major cannot be based on this course alone. However, the course is still worth your while to take."
