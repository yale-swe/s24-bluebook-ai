    "Do not take this course. Ever. Worst class I ever took at Yale.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Your time is better spent elsewhere. Class discussions go no where and are so off track you will leave the class thinking \"What the heck did we just talk about for the past 2 hours?\" Also it's very hard to have a differing opinion than the professor, which becomes a problem when it comes to writing the papers. If you want to be in a 5 person lecture for 2hrs, do take take this class, but take it for credit... but seriously DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "Don't take it unless it is with a different Professor.",
    "Wonderful reading list (seriously), great classmates, not so wonderful class. Had the potential to be so great, but really wasted it with completely off-topic discussions and a distinct lack of focus. Professor Kevles is hot and cold (yes and no, in and out...etc.) She did bring in some interesting historical context for all of the plays, but the class just wasn't cohesive enough. If you go into the class treating it as a book club, I suppose it'll be okay."
