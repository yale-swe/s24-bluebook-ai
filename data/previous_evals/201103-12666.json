   "comments": [
    "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 250 is an excellent course whose strengths include its dynamic lecturer (Professor Wells is very knowledgeable of and passionate about her field), its fascinating material (terrestrial arthropods do some truly amazing things), its structure (three units, each of which is presented through a well-considered balance of PowerPoint slides and video clips), and its reasonable and rewarding requirements (two mid-term exams, one 12-page paper, and a comprehensive final exam). On the basis of these strengths, I would highly recommend the class to any student interested in learning more about bugs.",
    "The course provides a vibrant survey, which is exactly what I wanted. It catered especially well to students--like me--who are not studying science as a major, but who still love it. In particular, each unit was organized around not just characteristics of insects, but the evolution of those characteristics, which allowed students to think about the \"big picture\" ideas that really are exciting.Marta is Ms. Frizzle incarnate. The fact that she is crazy about this subject is apparent, and it rubs off. In addition, the class is pretty self-selecting in attracting students who are interested, and that energy together makes it a very dynamic lecture.",
    "Absolutely take this class. I took it as a non-science major with AP Bio as my only preparation and it was totally fine. Lectures were really enjoyable and entertaining. Exams were fine if you had reviewed notes and lecture slides. I definitely learned a lot about something I didn't even know I was interested in. Definitely a painless and even fun way to get rid of a science requirement.",
    "Biology of Terrestrial Arthropods is awesome. Lectures are interesting, and include a nice amount of Planet Earth-style videos. There's basically no homework (readings are all redundant of lectures), but exams definitely do require studying. There's a term paper, but it's pretty easy and fun!",
    "Marta is a wonderful professor who cares passionately about her subject and teaching. Bugs are awesome. You will learn so many fun facts.TAKE THE LAB. The lecture means so much more with it. You end up with your own collection, the field trips are amazing, Marta feeds you, and in our class we had amazing people who I now consider friends.As a non-science major, take this class to learn about a field of science you probably haven't considered, and actually have a real introduction to science in class with people who do. It's a real class with real work (2 midterms, paper and final), but it's not hard.",
    "YES. This class is for students who want a substantial science credit. Marta is amazing in every sense of the word. Her lectures are engaging, thorough, and clear. She is very approachable and did everything she could to help me succeed. One of my favorite professors at Yale.TAKE THIS CLASS. Every lecture was filled with fun and exciting information.",
    "I used this course for my SC requirement, and as a History major I found that to be a very good decision. I found myself well-prepared for exams, and the material is quite fun. Professor Wells is a wonderful person, and the material is not easy, but it's also very learnable. Very little required knowledge.Also--the bug videos are quite fun.",
    "Very fun class. Prof Wells is an incredibly knowledgable woman and is so, so excited about the topic. Lots of amazing videos. Do study for the exams; sometimes they are pretty easy, and sometimes they require really special knowledge of the lectures and example-bugs used throughout the course.",
    "Arthropod Biology is a broad survey course in the biology and ecology of terrestrial arthropods, with a focus on insects more than arachnids or myriapods. The professor is very lively and engaging, which more than makes up for the dryness of the textbook. There are occasionally technical moments, but on the whole, it's much more idea-oriented. It's not necessary to take the prerequisites to do well in the course, so long as you have a decent background in general biology.",
    "Lots of cool bugs. You will not be disappointed.",
    "It's a class about bugs, and it's probably the best science credit you could take. You don't realize how weird and amazing and horrifying bugs are, but they are all of these things. Professor Wells is amazing.",
    "WONDERFUL course. I highly recommend it to anyone interesting in bio-type stuff. You learn a lot about bugs, the lectures are really fu, and Marta is so kind. That being said, the class is NOT a gut in any way. You have to do a ton of memorization and prepare a lot for each exam. So, if you're willing to do some work, you will really enjoy the course.",
    "Very interesting stuff. You'll see arthropods, especially insects, in a totally different way after taking this class",
    "If you like biology and are even a little interested in bugs, take it. Getting a kick out of gross things is a plus. And Marta Wells' attitude is infectious.",
    "You are going to enjoy this course. It's hard not to fall for Marta's love of bugs, which could appear over the top if it were anything other than genuine. She and Rich (our TF) are just an incredible and dynamic duo, so have some fun and learn about something that will rekindle the kid in you, leave you with a lot of great content, and give you evo-bio principles that you can use for understanding life and as metaphors in your english papers.A few recommendations: I'd print out the slides ahead of time and take notes on the slides. It's fun taking notes by hand because there's plenty you'll want to draw. But it's nice to have the text from the slides on paper already so you can avoid worrying about getting that down.Go to lecture! It's fun, and if you pay attention nothing on the test will be a curveball.Sometimes, it's frustrating learning about a topic so vast in one semester, and I think Prum's class on Ornithology gets into more depth with fewer topics. Just something to consider depending on your style, but I'd recommend both.",
    "It's not easy. But it's better than taking a throwaway science course.",
    "Take it! You will learn a lot about insects from Marta. She is crazy in a great way.",
    "This class was a study of bugs through various lenses. One week we would focus on their predation skills and the next we would focus on how they survive extreme temperatures. Each lense was incredibly interesting and thought provoking because you saw parallels of how bugs operate to how human beings operate. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student."
