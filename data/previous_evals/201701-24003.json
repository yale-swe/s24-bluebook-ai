    "I learned a lot about the biology of reproduction in this course, taking home many interesting facts about how the human body works.",
    "Kenkel is not a good lecturer. Please replace",
    "Learned about reproductive biology...",
    "All about reproductive biology.",
    "By taking this course, I gained a basic understanding of both male and female reproductive systems. Besides learning about their development and how they function, I also got a sense of the issues that can arise and how doctors can treat them.",
    "I learned a lot about women and men's reproductive organs, cycles, and maturation.",
    "I learned so much about the body, particularly women's bodies, both during pregnancy and just all the time. I finally learned about hormones and what they're actually doing as well as all the things that can cause a pregnancy to fail (there are A LOT!)",
    "I learned a lot about the human reproduction system. I learned how to memorize for the exams, and to acknowledge the interdisciplinary fields this course presented.",
    "Interesting knowledge about biology of reproduction! Felt like a medical school class!",
    "I learned about many different facets of reproduction, sexual development, sexual health etc",
    "No skills. This class is solely arbitrary multiple choice questions. You won't learn much new stuff, and it's incredibly boring. Also taught by like 20 guest lecturers, so nothing it coherent and everything is redundant. Would not recommend at all, even for MCDB majors.",
    "I gained a large basic knowledge about reproductive biology. I really loved this course and feel like it had specific learning goals that allowed students to take away concrete knowledge from the course. Very well executed for a team-taught class.",
    "I learned how to integrate multiple topics taught from different professors to help me learn what biology of reproduction fully entails.",
    "I learned all about reproduction!",
    "I loved the course. It's one of the only courses at Yale that focuses on human biology and I'm so glad to have taken it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: different perspectives from the different lecturers of this course. Weaknesses: because of the different lecturers, there was often much overlap about some fundamental concepts that were repeatedly said over and over again. However, that was also useful in solidifying concepts.",
    "Amazing class!! Such a great overview of reproductive biology. The only weakness was that each lecture was taught by a different professor, and certain topics got covered multiple times due to lack of communication between the professors.",
    "Strengths: covers everything in a sequential fashion! Weaknesses: A LOT of info",
    "Strengths are the topics of the class as they are really cool",
    "A highlight of this course was that it was taught almost entirely by guest lecturers. In general, the lecturers selected were engaging and had in-depth knowledge on their specific topic. I thoroughly enjoyed this. I also thought the exams were extremely fair. They seemed to cover details that lecturers had emphasized as important, so studying for them was straightforward. A weakness of there were certain lectures repeated content from earlier lectures. In other cases, lecturers assumed that we had gotten a more in-depth lecture on a particular topic than we actually had, so they presented more complex material that was confusing without a foundational knowledge. However, this was mostly a problem in the early lectures of the course, focusing on the development of the reproductive system.",
    "The guest lecturers are such a strength. Each lecture was different but equally awesome.",
    "The class is wonderful and the information is great! I think, however, that it may be easier to have just one or two professors teach. If that's not possible, at least have similar formats in PowerPoints and have all the information in Classes V2 as a PowerPoint or PDF. It's disconcerting to have some of the class material as PDFs, some at PowerPoints, some as information found only on a website, and some as just text in a document.",
    "Super interesting, guest lectures knew their material very well, I liked having guest lectures speak on their specialties and I felt the class built well despite not having one professor",
    "I loved that lots of different professors taught the course, but I wish it were more organized!",
    "No strengths, absolutely terrible course. It's taught by over 20 GUEST LECTURERS. You DON'T HAVE A REAL PROFESSOR. This is because no person would be motivated enough to teach an entire course on this. It's badly planned, there is no communication with students (i.e. when section was happening, what the paper assignments were), and the multiple choice exams are arbitrary and a waste. You could skip all of the lectures and ace the exam, or you could go to everything and still not be on the same wavelength as the tentmaker. Totally garbage class, would not recommend.",
    "Strengths were the variety of the opinion and breadth of the material. Cons were the lack of continuity, just in the respect that it made it hard to get to know the professors.",
    "I really appreciate learning about topics from the people who are at the top of those fields.",
    "Having a new professor every day was extremely jarring. Additionally, having only three exams made me extremely anxious about performance to the extent where it was difficult to study",
    "Although the material for the class was extremely interesting and relevant, you will hear many students who have taken the class say that having a constant rotation of professors was jarring and not conducive to learning. I would have to agree - not because I dislike having different professors, but because many of the medical professionals invited to speak were, quite frankly, not teachers. All of our instructors were experts in the field being discussed in class, but few were actually good at explaining the material. Otherwise, great class with an extremely manageable workload.",
    "I thought the structure of having guest lecturers every class made the quality of lectures highly inconsistent and made them seem disjointed. While many of the lecturers were great, I would have preferred to have a main lecturer with fewer guest lecturers because it seems unnecessary to have different professors cover general topics of reproductive biology."

   "comments": [
    "A fantastic course that could be taken either sophomore junior or senior year, I found it to be a great fun class to cap out my time here at Yale.",
    "Yes! Great Cr\/D\/Fail class if it's not required for your major. No section, no p-sets, no reading, no final. Only three non-cumulative midterms. What a gem!",
    "Yes as I found the material fascinating.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material was interesting and the lecturers were clearly excited about the topics they were teaching. It was also convenient not to have a final exam, which made my reading period load much lighter. I looked forward to coming to class each day.",
    "This course had 3 all multiple choice slide recall test.",
    "Take this class! It is so fascinating and well taught, it actually re-inspired my love for life sciences so much. It's easier than other MCDB classes yet I learned SO MUCH. And I mean actually learned, like I will remember most of it forever because of how well it was explained. My favorite bio class at Yale and definitely like top 3 most enjoyed classes overall.",
    "Yes, this is a great class. Just make sure to memorize everything for the 3 multiple choice exams you will get.",
    "Yes! So interesting even for non-MCDB students",
    "Take if you are interested in reproduction! You will learn so much. If you are not interested it will be a drag",
    "Not at all. An absolutely terrible class. It's taught by over 20 GUEST LECTURERS. You DON'T HAVE A REAL PROFESSOR. This is because no person would be motivated enough to teach an entire course on this. It's badly planned, there is no communication with students (i.e. when section was happening, what the paper assignments were), and the multiple choice exams are arbitrary and a waste.

    "Yes. 100%. You learn a lot and there's not a lot of work. And the material is SO cool.",
    "I think this is a very interesting course and very engaging. I learned a lot through taking this course.",
    "Yes this is a very interesting class with a low and easy workload!",
    "I would recommend this class to STEM and non-STEM students for a couple reasons: the information is very interesting AND relevant, the workload is manageable, and many of the professors are quite interesting."
