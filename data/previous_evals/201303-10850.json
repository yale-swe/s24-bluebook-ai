   "comments": [
    "An interesting topic and not too much of a stretch difficulty-wise. However, I often felt that the lecture content, the problem sets, and the exams were somewhat disjointed. The p-sets often test a students abilities to use statistics software rather than their knowledge of the core concepts (which is more important for the exams). Otherwise, lecture is interesting and fairly helpful. The professor is helpful, entertaining, and quirky. Helps make a potentially dry subject more engaging.",
    "Not the most interesting class but as long as you do the homework and understand what you are doing you should be fine.",
    "A fine intro to stats; occasionally boring\/impersonal, but offers a good amount of real-world material to make it worthwhile for a less-STEM-inclined individual looking to get an intro to the subject.",
    "A bit dry, but a very thorough intro to stats.",
    "Summary: baby stats. If you want to actually understand statistics but drown in numbers, this is what you need. Learn a lot, feel like you've learned a lot, get a lot out of the class.Recommendation: take notes in class, and don't fall into that Facebook trap. Don't do it! Paying attention in class\/at review sessions will be your saving grace.",
    "If you are looking for a low commitment QR class, then this would fit it perfectly. Meets twice a week. Minimum homework, plenty of opportunities to get help. As interesting as Intro Stats gets.",
    "Take it if you have an interest in Stats or have an okay math background and need a QR. Better than a lot of the other options. I'm used to interesting humanities classes so thought this was boring, but everyone I know who takes science\/math classes said JRS was one of the more interesting lecturers they've had in those departments.",
    "While the class moves at a super rapid pace, you do learn a lot. If you are required to take a stats class, you can't take it with a better professor.",
    "This is an excellent introductory statistics class. Its biggest strength is Professor JDRS; he is engaging, lively, approachable, and quite funny and manages to present the material in a way that is digestible to those who may not be particularly mathematically-inclined (like myself). His lectures notes are incredibly helpful and present the concepts clearly with ample examples. He makes himself readily available for extra help, and will patiently explain concepts over and over until you understand. The problem sets are not terribly tricky (although the one on probability was unusually challenging), and the midterm and finals are of reasonable difficulty. If you are not an especially \"mathy\" person, you will likely have to seek extra help in order to do well, but this is easy to do, and JDRS offers review sessions before the midterms and final.",
    "A great introduction to stats for the non-mathematically-inclined. JDRS is an interesting (and funny) lecturer, and he is very understanding as well. The p-sets were tough at times, but there were tons of extra-help sessions and the actual in-class assessments were very straightforward and fair. Take this if you want to get a solid general understanding of stats!",
    "For those looking to get QR credits out of the way, only take this class if you know you can stay focused through uninteresting lectures and dry notes. The material itself isn't all that difficult, but as a humanities\/social sciences person, it can be hard to find anything exciting.",
    "Very decent intro stats class. Not too hard but not super easy either. Class is made bearable and even fun by the professor (JDRS). Work is manageable but it really helps if you go to class (both for tests and psets). Lecture notes are exactly what he covers in class, so you have a great resource there. Plus, there are a lot of office hours if you need them.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer is great! He's approachable and really wants his students to understand. I definitely recommend taking this course. It's pretty fast paced in the beginning, for those who have never taken statistics before, but it gets a lot better when we break intosmaller sections.",
    "This is a really interesting and easy introduction to statistics. If you have to take it for either Political Science or EP&E, I would definitely recommend it. The material is not super-hard, and if you keep up with lecture and study for the midterms and final, you'll do fine. Only thing to consider is that the homework is quite different from the exams, so go over the samples a few times",
    "It's a pretty good way to get your QR out of the way, but I would not recommend it if you are not interested in statistics. Professor Reuning-Scherer was great and he made lectures much more fun by including jokes and anecdotal stories.",
    "A manageable course to take if you need it for your major or want to use it as a fairly straightforward QR credit, or if you happen to have a genuine interest in collecting and analyzing data. Taking it somewhat on a whim like I did is a bit of a risky decision, but will pay off in the form of a QR credit.",
    "It stinks. But if you've got to take it, take it with Jonathan.",
    "A good combination of engaging teaching and a very practical subject. Take it whether you need to or not, there are a lot of bad statistics being thrown around out there and this is the first step to seeing through them.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. JDRS is phenomenal, and the sole reason why I took the Social Science section as opposed to Political Science (and I wasn't the only one who made that choice). He brings humor, enormous energy, and a good spirit to class everyday. He is also so accessible for help or assistance. The class does move very quickly. I had taken AP Stats, and found that what took a couple months in a daily high school course could last a week in this class. However, I think it's definitely more than doable even if you haven't taken Stats before, and probably the vast majority of students haven't.",
    "This is a well-designed, well-taught introduction to statistics. Take it. It will be helpful to anything you do that requires analysis of numbers or data in some way. It will also just help you think more analytically.",
    "STAT 103 is a decent course. The setup of the class is pretty straightforward - at the beginning of the semester, you print out about 300 pages worth of notes that are covered in lecture and you have a pset just about every week. There are two mid-terms before the class splits into different modules. STAT 103, Intro to Social Sciences, keeps the main professor and follows a pretty similar structure and concludes with a cumulative final. (NOTE: It seems like the other modules DIDN'T have cumulative finals so that is something to keep in mind.) I came into this class with NO prior experience in statistics and I found it pretty manageable. I found the mid-terms somewhat tricky, but fair. The final was not bad at all. I would recommend checking out one of the recommended textbooks via BorrowDirect through the Yale library.",
    "I would recommend STATS 103 as a broad, relatively useful QR. Not too much work, and the material is applicable, if only at a basic level, to the real world.",
    "It's good for a basic knowledge but it moves very quickly and you should be prepared to do a lot of independent studying to understand the material but the professor provides excellent notes so it's not too difficult to stay caught up.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. JRS is extremely enthusiastic and the class teaches you necessary statistical skills applicable to almost any field.",
    "This course was taught extremely well. I feel that I have a good grasp of basic topics in Statistics after this semester. JRS is a great teacher and his examples in class are diverse and applicable. Lecture was always worth going to. Psets were pretty manageable.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is a solid basis for statistics. The workload is not too heavy, and the exams are not too bad. I learned some useful practical tools like using MINITAB, which I think I can apply to many other disciplines.",
    "If you pay attention in lecture, work hard on your problem sets, and attend office hours if you have any questions, you should have no problems with this class.",
    "Huge waste of time, ten times worse than any other science or math class I have ever taken. If you want to learn Statistics, take a different class or skim through a textbook. You'll probably get more out of a Barron's AP Statistics review book than the class. Try to stay awake during lecture, since the material is extremely boring and the professor's stories are irrelevant. The professor seems to go very fast through all the material, but if you actually look over the curriculum, you'll realize that you actually take away very little from the class. Make sure you don't skip lunch before lecture. I didn't have time to grab lunch on Tuesdays\/Thursdays, so this probably added to my awful experience in the class. The one thing I did get out of the class is that Minitab can magically perform several statistical tests.",
    "STATs is a very fast-paced and intensive course that covers all the introductory concepts in statistics. It has weekly problem sets, two midterms and one exam that all require a lot of work but it is definitely manageable.",
    "If you are looking for a QR credit, this is the way to go. It's a nice overview of statistics, which isn't math-based and is actually pretty applicable to any field\/major. Weekly P-Sets weren't that challenging and the tests were very doable. Jonathan David Reuning-Scherer is hilarious, which makes the class that much better!",
    "Not a bad class",
    "Only take this class if you need it as a prerequisite.",
    "STAT 103 is a good Introduction to Statistics course. JDRS is really entertaining and great, and although the material isn't the most interesting thing in the world, JDRS makes it about as interesting as it can be.",
    "It's a good course but moves a little fast. The P-Sets need to be completed with time. The concepts are tricky (especially probability, so I would suggest you dedicate some time off to relearn and practice stats at home. Also, take the second part of the course with Prof. JDRS",
    "If you haven't taken intro to stats, take this class. Everyone should take this before graduating.",
    "Statistics is a really useful course to take! Professor Reuning-Scherer is an awesome professor and made the material interesting. I have already used much of what I have learned in the course to analyze data that I collected in another class. You also learn how to use the statistics software program, Minitab. Many people believe that statistics is daunting and overwhelming, but Professor Reuning-Scherer made it manageable.",
    "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",
    "Good class if you need a QR and want to learn something useful.",
    "This class requires learning on your own and going to office hours. I would also buy a stats textbook to help you along the way. The lectures are EXTREMELY BORING. The homework is manageable (one pset per week) but only focuses on minitab (a stats software program that the class requires you to download). So, you can become a minitab expert, but by the time the midterms and final come around, you'll have to know how to do everything by hand (which the professor doesn't teach you how to do).",
    "I've often thought \"I should take this class because this material is important to know in life\". While this line of reasoning tends to backfire, this time it did not. Taking stats is important in anything from understanding NYT articles to contributing some useful data to projects in your other classes. There's really no reason not to take it. The class is easy, honestly. Just pay attention in class, otherwise you'll do poorly without a lot of extra effort.",
    "Yes. First, Stats is really important to know regardless of what field you end up in. Second, for those who can't stomach math, Stats is much more digestible. With Professor Reuning-Scherer, you're offered a ton of real examples, so you can see exactly how you would apply the concepts. Also, Reuning-Scherer is just a delight. He's funny, understanding, and he really cares about people doing well.",
    "This is a good class overall. It does get substantially harder after the first midterm.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Not a bad class but I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Good class, and JRS was a GREAT professor. Glad I took it (even though I had to for my major) because before taking it, I didn't realize how much stats applied to every day life, but now, I feel like I've learned really necessary information.",
    "Stat 103 is a great section to pick. Jonathan is a very entertaining lecturer and he will do anything to help you be successful. If you go to office hours for help on the homework you will do well in this class. It's a good option for people who don't like math and need to satisfy the QR requirement or if you just want a basic statistics background. I definitely recommend 103 as opposed to other sections.",
    "Yes",
    "It's a good Stats course. JDRS is a very engaging professor and does a fantastic job with the huge number of students. Definitely be sure to go to your TF's office hours and the JDRS help sessions because they are very helpful and take the place of section. That's the other thing: there is no assigned section meeting time with your TF. Thus, it gives you flexibility and you can meet with any of the TF's during their office hours. But, it means you are not forced to have any intimate learning so you really need to seek help early. There's a pset a week usually and that's the only work you are expected to do: there's no required reading or anything else. Technically just the psets. Statistics really is something everyone should know and this is definitely not a bad way to learn it, though it is very different from most Stats courses in high school.",
    "Stats 103 was a good introduction to stats. Although the subject material, statistics, was incredibly boring, Professor Reuning-Scherer made it entertaining through his humor and passion. If one has to take statistics, I would recommend this course.",
    "If you're looking for a QR credit that isn't hard but isn't a joke, this is a great option. Professor Reuning-Scherer is great -- funny and good at explaining things. You do a pset every two weeks or so and they're not that hard (well, except the pset on probability), especially if you get a study buddy to go over the answers with you. There are two midterms, which you should really study for, and a final that was actually pretty easy.",
    "I am happy I took it as a QR. I think statistics is a useful thing to have a foundation in. It is also pretty boring.",
    "This is a really good course if you need a stats course. I actually was only taking it as a requirement, but had a newfound interest in stats because of this course. Definitely take it with Prof RS though, he's the best.",
    "A straightforward stats course with a fantastic professor.",
    "Yes, but I enjoy the many opportunities to apply statistics in everyday life, so it is more of a love for the subject itself. I would say the workload is challenging but manageable, and the class gives you a very good introduction to statistics.",
    "It's a comrehensive course and it you work and keep up with it, you can learn the material and succeed",
    "This course was fair and comprehensible. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an overview of probability and statistical methods and models. We used a computer program to apply the concepts. I think I learned a lot in this course that will stick with me and help me in other areas. JDRS is wonderful; I am glad I was in 103 (social sciences) with him the entire semester.",
    "This class is difficult if you have never taken a statistics class before. However, statistics is something that can be applied to many areas of study so it could be a good class to look into taking.",
    "Fast paced intro statistics course that isn't too hard for non-math types. I would recommend it, but it's not very interesting."
