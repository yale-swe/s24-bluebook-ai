   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to explore different types of experimental ethnography, this was a valuable experience because it allowed me to see more faces of my research project.",
    "While the course did not directly contribute to my research, it was nice to have a chance to write about parts of my fieldwork experience.",
    "This course has been instrumental in the radical change of my writing attitude and product experienced during this semester. My writing used to be 50 pages of notes in order to write a 10 pages essay. It was time consuming and nerve-wracking. Now, I can open a document and write, I feel I can communicate what I want to say! I used to write consistently and to publish successfully in my mother tongue, and I could not enjoy the process of writing in English. Given the pleasure I derive from it again, I am now able to establish a routine of writing and stick to it!More specifically, I am now confident in exploring different ethnographic writing, I am less afraid of trying new styles and experimental constructions of the text. I can include ethnographic vignettes with some professional awareness of the disciplinary styles of narration. On the other side, my reading of ethnographic material is more critical and more aware of the different possibilities among which a contemporary writer chooses.As mentioned above, the merit is in the teacher attitude, more than the course per se. The same course with the same requirements could have been completely vain.",
    "Guest speakers and readings helped me better understand the often painful process of turning a research proposal into a finished dissertation, and also pushed me to refine my own research ideas."
