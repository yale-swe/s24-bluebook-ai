   "comments": [
    "I developed a different kind of writing skill that was a change form academic writing. I think the most powerful thing that I learned was how to make my words have the power my voice does. We learned techniques on how to make our statements have a stronger affect, and get our message across my \"showing\" not \"telling\", a powerful persuasive technique.",
    "An excellent insight into how to write real world essays. When taking English 120, one is stripped from the comfort of high school style, argumentative essays and thrown into the world of personal narratives, humor, interviews, and cultural satire. This class greatly develops one's ability to write creatively.",
    "English 120 is one of the best classes at Yale. I enjoyed taking a new approach to my previously assumed tactics of writing. The class taught me to look deeper, to ask for more, and to adhere that into my own writing.",
    "My ability to write creatively, clearly, and effectively drastically improved with this course.",
    "I think I became a much better writer.",
    "I genuinely believe that this class helped more than any other that I've taken in my development as a writer. Professor Ulrich was incredibly specific and insightful in her commentary in a way that I hadn't yet experienced. Previous English teachers and professors that I've had have always made their comments in a way that felt very nebulous and arbitrary, in such a way that made me feel like they didn't know what they were talking about. Not so with Professor Ulrich.",
    "BEST CLASS EVER- Taught me how to write, think analytically, loved the professor so smart!",
    "I learned how to write well!",
    "Emily is an amazing english professor. Through her class, my reading and writing skill improved extraordinarily.",
    "I became a stronger writer and learned critical skills that allowed me to evaluate my own writing and the writing of other students.",
    "I learned how to write a better personal\/nonfiction creative essay through pretty intensive reading, writing, revision, and discussion."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I honestly can't think of weakness in this course. In class we sometimes did in-class writing activities and partner work. I think if the class would incorporate these activities more often it would greatly stimulate thought and engagement.",
    "Excellent course. My only qualm is the very short turnaround for some of the hardest papers (only one week to begin the unit and complete a rough draft). Perhaps by combining the first two essays (both of which are personal narratives), the course would have more time to fully develop skills instead of rushing through different categories.",
    "I enjoyed the set up of the course, the style that discussions were in, and the atmosphere of workshopping. If I could change one thing about this course, it would be to have Emily Ulrich teach every section.",
    "This course is absolutely amazing. Analyzing existing work and constantly working on your own greatly improves your style and ability as a creative and analytical writer. Writing really isn't a skill you can teach, but something you develop through constant exposure to it. This class does an excellent job embodying that idea.",
    "No weaknesses, all strengths!",
    "This course is perfect in every way and could not possibly be improved. We read great essays and wrote about interesting topics, we discussed with a professor who engaged with everybody and their writing at a superhuman level, and we came away with five heavily revised papers that show a clear progression in writing skill. 10\/10",
    "One of the strongest parts of this course was the ability to receive feedback from the teacher and other students on essays and drafts. I wish there had been more opportuniities for peer evaluation, as this was very helpful.",
    "The revision process is one of the best parts about the course. It made writing each paper less stressful because you knew your first draft wouldn't be graded, which meant you could take more risks and write more freely. In-class discussions were always engaging and helped me to think about each assignment in a critical way immensely. If there were one thing that could be improved, it's that there was often more reading than could be discussed in one class. I loved all the readings and would not want to cut any, but if we could at least touch on all of them in class, I would get more out of them."

    "The workload of this course different from any other course. For this course, we typically read 3-4 essays (all super interesting) of usually 5 pages. Then we would have to write a short blog post on our analysis\/reflections of a reading. This homework is very engaging and easy to do. Writing the essays was a bit more challenging. I think it depends on how you write though. I would spend several days of 3-4 hours each writing my essay. But editing the final draft is a much quicker process. I think the motivation behind so much work of that you really have to look at each word that comprises a sentence, and then the sentence as a whole. Everything serves a purpose and has to be working towards the total affect of your essay. But definitely worth it. You challenge yourself to get better with each essay. I would absolutely recommend this course. From my entire first year here, this is the only course I actually learned something in. Further, I know this knowledge will help me grow and help my writing in all aspects of my life to come. This class taught intrinsic skills to life. Definitely worth it. Hard but super fun work that you will come to love and miss.",
    "Absolutely. Please, please take this course with Professor Ulrich! Essays are returned with detailed feedback, guiding one greatly in the revision process. Emily's lectures are thrilling, filled with enthusiasm and widespread class engagement. Furthermore, this course will develop skills that will serve one in any profession. It is essential to know how to write well, and this course prepares one in just that way.",
    "If you want to be with a professor who truly cares about your writing, and is so involved that you almost convince yourself that she lived your experiences with you just based on her editorializing, then yes. I would take this course for every remaining semester I have at Yale, if I could.",
    "Everyone should take this course, no matter his or her writing ability. There's no one who won't get something great out of this course.",
    "Absolutely I would recommend this course for those who are trying to get out of their creative comfort zone.",
    "Yes!",
    "YES. I took this as a junior needing a writing credit, and I chose it over a humanities seminar specializing in some specific topic because I wanted to improve my writing. I did improve my writing. I had some trepidation at being thrown in with a bunch of overeager freshmen, and although the freshmen were indeed eager beyond my wildest imagination, our professor (Emily Ulrich) matched their energy every day and maintained a vivid intellectual environment. The readings are fantastic (essays in the vein of all time greatest hits like \"Shooting an Elephant\" or \"A Modest Proposal\"), and the essay writing process is well organized. We write an initial draft, the professor painstakingly annotates it, and then we write a final draft. Being forced to revise a paper is like being forced to go to the gym. It sucks in the moment but it feels great after, and I am proud of the final product.",
    "Yes! This is one of my favorite courses at Yale and has improved me as a writer, a student, and a person.",
    "This is a great course for just about anyone as long as you're committed to it. The readings are super fun and never that long, and class was a fun and comfortable environment to discuss and analyze what makes great writing great. The five papers got progressively more challenging, and handing one in almost every week (either a draft or a revision) made for constant hard work, but I felt constantly supported by Emily and ultimately proud of my papers. This would be a hard course not to put the effort into because of the pace of the work load and the depth of the in-class discussions, but once you do, it is super enjoyable.",
    "Everyone at Yale should take this class. You learn a lot about both yourself and the community around you in the perspectives and points that your peers bring up in reflection to the aptly chosen readings. This class is easily one of the ones that has had the greatest effect on my Yale experience."
