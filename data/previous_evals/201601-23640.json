    "I would 100% recommend this class to a variety of students. The material has real world application and I think everyone can benefit from thinking about crime in a less black and white fashion.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Courtney is incredibly smart, and dedicated to her students, and made the subject material very interesting.",
    "This is a seminar on the history of mental illness in American culture. The readings are all really great and interesting. Courtney is a great professor. The topics covered throughout the semester were often quite disturbing and could make some uncomfortable, despite this Courtney led very informative conversations. This was definitely my favorite class this semester. Courtney is great! 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "A class examining the intersections between mental illness and crime both in reality and in American culture. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone and everyone as it's incredibly interesting.",
    "Very interesting course with a reasonable course load! I would definitely recommend taking it.",
    "It was a really great class that forced us to think criticallya bout the intersection of different parts of the history of mental health. Having had courtney also for Doctors and Patients I can say this course is designed much better.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The material is difficult, but it is extremely helpful to study the history of these topics to better understand how to deal with certain issues plaguing our society today."
