    "Yes, recommend those who are interested in Buddhism",
    "Amazing course; great and interesting topic taught by a phenomenal professor. He really cares about his students and is a fantastic lecturer. Go to a class and if you don't fall in love... (which I can't imagine)... then don't take it... otherwise everyone should! Course work is pretty average but the material and lectures are definitely all very interesting. Professor Quintman breaks down a very complicated and hard to understand topic into lay terms and really helps make everything comprehensible. If ever you wanted to figure out what Buddhism (and especially Tibetan Buddhism and some of its history and culture), this is the time and place to do it. One of my best courses and professor in my 4 years here.",
    "If you are genuinely interested in religious studies, then sure. There is no midterm or final that require you to memorize information or synthesize themes that cut across the course, so it's kind of easy to slip through without learning much.",
    "I wouldn't take it! Shopping period is deceiving--the class isn't necessarily what it promises to be and could do with adding a lot more history or background on Tibetan Buddhism. The reading is fine, but the assignments were horrible because they were all busy work instead of helping the students to better understand the material. Boring, and irritating assignments. Don't take it.",
    "It is a course that goes deeply into Tibetan Buddhism and pretty much nothing else. So if you like that take the course.",
    "Take this class! Professor Quintman is extremely helpful and does a fantastic job of incorporating universal Buddhism concepts, Tibetan history, and analysis of Tantric and Monastic texts. No prior knowledge of the religion, or even the nature of religious studies, is needed at all to feel comfortable. The Vajrasattva visualization ritual is something you will never forget! Plus field trip!",
    "If you are completely new to Tibetan Buddhism, this class is a very good introduction to it: well-paced, interesting, covers all the major ideas etc. For someone who already knows some or most of all that, you might find yourself wanting more lectures on political\/historical\/etc. context and fewer lectures on the principles of Buddhism, but that's alright. Prof. Quintman knows what he's talking about and is a very good lecturer. The readings are good and the assignments not too hard. You'll definitely learn more than you came in knowing about Buddhism. You'll also get to do special things that you couldn't otherwise like see relics at the Rubin Museum in NYC or have a khenpo come speak to you! A good class overall.",
    "Absolutely not. It is a very easy course, but I think I learned less than in any other Yale course I've taken in 3 years. Professor Quintman assigns ponderous readings and rambles aimlessly through lecture. Section was kind of a bright spot actually, the TAs were all really cool people. Regardless, a maddeningly surface yet overly stuffed with useless details survey of what should be an interesting subject.",
    "This class is very interesting if you are genuinely interested in the material. It is easy to \"miss\" the lectures, but the grading on the papers and projects is definitely tougher than I expected. It can be a lot of reading at times, but if you are interested in Tibetan Buddhism (which I found more and more fascinating the deeper I went into the class) it's worth it.",
    "The course covers the historical development of Tibetan Buddhism as a religion primarily but also as a religious philosophy and its impact on the Western and Asian worlds. I would heartily recommend this course to another student.",
    "Material isn't *always* very interesting, but the lectures won't put you to sleep unless you just really don't care. The course is digs deep through the Buddhist religion and encourages you to think and be as creative as you wish. The workload is average,and one can do extremely well if they give sufficient effort.",
    "This course is a great introduction to Tibetan Buddhism and I appreciated that it focused on thought, practice, and historical context. Professor Quintman is a very engaging lecturer.",
    "I would recommend it if you have an interest in Buddhism. The course gives a great overview of the religion from many different perspectives, including that of a scholar, practitioner, historian, and philosopher.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning about Tibetan Buddhism. Do not take this class if all you are interested in is practicing meditation. This class teaches about Buddhist philosophy in a cultural context--it is more focused on cultural elements like rituals and literature (Life of Milarepa and the Life of the Buddha) than meditation practices. Overall, it expanded my perspective and I'm glad that I took it.",
    "Interesting course, not a must take at Yale, but overall a good, medium-work load class.",
    "An enjoyable class because Prof. Quintman is a great lecturer. The material sometimes gets more specialized than you might expect in an introductory course, and the required group work is a bit of a bummer.",
    "Take it. Quintman is great, and you'll learn about something new that will change the way you think about Buddhism\/religion."
