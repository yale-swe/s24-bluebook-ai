   "comments": [
    "This course is, I think, entirely too sensitive to the composition of the class. Prof. Erikson does her best to fill in gaps, but too great a disparity in technical skill (particularly mathematical or programming), or in comfort with confronting the sociological content of networks (as opposed to the methodological) cannot but exact heavy tolls on the quality, and readiness, of the discourse that ensues.",
    "Generally a pretty interesting class, with interesting topics and a very doable workload.",
    "I was a bit disappointed with this class. I came in already knowing a bit about social networks and expected to learn more, especially practical applications to society. Sadly, we read dry articles\/studies and sat through sluggish discussions. I did learn some things, the assignments never took too long, and the final project was both fun to do and interesting to hear about from other students. The assignments were half boring, half interesting (the ones that were applicable to real-life). I feel like this class has more potential because the subject material is so fascinating, the professor is so knowledgeable, and the TAs so helpful. Hopefully it gets better in future years.",
    "Take-it! No matter if you are into sociology or not, this is so helpful in thinking about the world and other disciplines.",
    "Good class! I used it for a requirement for another major and it was pretty painless. I learned a lot and the subject is fascinating. The reading is pretty theoretical, but you don't need to do a lot of it if you're not interested by it. The final project was awesome!",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Erikson is really nice and helpful. She makes the class accessible to students of any level. Even students without any background will be able to discover interesting features of social networking data with the techniques she covers. Mac users be warned, however, that the software is kind of buggy. Either find a CS friend or go to the TA's office hours to get it set up."
