    "Honestly a great course. Problem sets in particular were well-inspired and greatly improved my understanding of the topics offered.",
    "Weaknesses : Should definitely have a next level course. Ex: MIT- 8.421 is followed by 8.422. Strength: Prof. David DeMille is the instructor.",
    "The strengths were that it had a good teacher and covered a lot of relevant material. The weakness was that it covered a lot of material through powerpoint and I don't have as firm of a grasp on much of the material as I would like."

   "comments": [
    "Yes because it is well-taught and interesting.",
    "I would recommend it to those who are interested in AMO physics. This class is extremely useful for this field.",
    "Yes. The best physics course I have taken, everyone should try something like this course to challenge themselves. Furthermore, a lot of the topics taught lend themselves to great generality in quantum physics and beyond atomic physics.",
    "Yes. To learn from a master of this field is already an exiting proposition. Regardless the previous statement, the instructor gave very intuitive pictures to understand many cases which were profound and satisfying for me (refer to the lectures), off course there are additional questions always. The homework is the game-changer. It is exactly what my idealization of homework is and unlike other homeworks in general that I did here in Yale or elsewhere. Still feel awesome about the parity-violation problem in the last homework set. The course structure is also more suited to a graduate student, emphasis is on readings from a variety of sources, the homework presentations and also the final presentation. This course is in my list of favorite courses that I have done till date. I am very happy about the entire course overall. Looking forward to another such course here in Yale and another one by the same instructor.",
    "Yes, very interesting course that's taught well."
