    "Perspectives is worthwhile, if only because you get to know your fellow science majors.",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering is a good course, but only if you lack a specific interest in the sciences. The course provides a good overview of the research opportunities happening on campus. While the lectures are usually interesting, it truly depends on the professor. In addition, the discussion sections tend to be boring and lack substance since they are led by students.I would recommend this course because it is not an overwhelming amount of work (other than the final paper), but the Friday afternoon time slot is definitely a deterrent.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have a general interest in science. If you only like one topic and hate the rest, you will probably find 2\/3 of the lectures pretty boring. In general though the lectures were pretty interesting. The discussion sections are never great, and the quality varies based on your group and the professors leading it. The class is very little work, however, (even the final paper really isn't that bad as long as you don't save it for one day) and then you get full funding for summer research. If you're not at all interested in doing research the class makes less sense, but even so it is still worth considering as an extra half credit that is very little work.",
    "I would suggest PSE for two reasons: 1) I didn't know what kind of science I was interested in before I heard all these lectures, and now I do. And 2) You get money and research opportunities. Good deal.",
    "Meets once a week: one week lecture, one week discussion, alternating. Culminates in a paper and a research opportunity during the summer. The course is not much work, but I would still not recommend it to other students unless they have a very broad interest in science and are very open-minded in that regard. Otherwise, it may be advisable to seek out your own research with fellowships, opportunities for which are incredibly abundant at Yale. I feel as though, if this course were not offered to freshmen, many fewer students would take it just by virtue of the fact that its appeal is primarily the selectivity of the course and the stipend that is offered at the end of it, neither of which should be used as selection criteria in picking courses.",
    "If you're interested in the topics and want the summer research grant at the end, it's worth it. Otherwise, it'll just consume your time and you should drop it.",
    "The problems sets for the class are painful!!! But if you are going to do research over the summer, it is worth it. Any Science Lab at Yale will want a Perspectives student. Take advantage of having Dean Segraves as the Director of the Program. He can give you a lot of useful advice. If you are not doing research over the summer, don't take the class.",
    "Perspectives is a good, easy course. Take it if you get in!",
    "I would recommend it, especially if you have just a general interest in the sciences. The lectures were interesting, if long at times. The material can be dry, but you don't have to do the reading. The final paper is a pain, but it helps you learn about what you are doing in the summer.",
    "PSE is a wonderful way to get acquainted with some of the most interesting research projects happening at Yale. It is also a wonderful way to get to know other students that are interested in research. This is a once in a life time opportunity that should you should take advantage of if you have the chance.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in a science major, are generally in the many different fields of science and wish to get a taste and flavor of all of them. Also good for someone looking to pursue scientific research during their time as an undergraduate.",
    "If you did the first semester of Perspectives, continue. It is worth the summer fellowship. The final paper will take some time.",
    "If you think you're interested in sciences, but you're not sure what, take this class.Do not procrastinate the final paper! I did, and those were the worst few days of my life. Honestly!",
    "Honestly, I did not enjoy this course as much as I'd have liked. The lectures were boring and often confusing. The discussions were dry until our section leaders made an effort to revolutionize them and force everyone to participate. I didn't learn much from the homework problem sets either.",
    "this is a set of lectures and discussions dealing with several areas in new and developing scientific research. it will give you the opportunuty to delve into areas of science you wouldnt otherwise have the chance to do.",
    "If you're interested in science and engineering and see yourself doing research, PSE is definitely the course for you. If you're a person just interested in the sciences, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Do it for the money and the lectures. The course is a nice opportunity to get a survey of many different areas of science research. It did a good job of introducing me to how the scientific research world operates.Section is boring and depends largely on your faculty participate and classmates. Most people in my section were reluctant to answer questions and spent a lot of time on Facebook.But 2\/3rds of the class is good so if you want the money and interesting lectures go ahead. I also think saying you are a perspectives student gives you a foot in the door for some labs.",
    "Perspectives is a great class. It consists of a lecture by a professor on their research one week, and a small group discussion the next week. The work consists of a set of about five questions on the previous week's lecture every other week and a 15 page paper at the end of the year about the topic you'll be researching over the summer. Yes, some of the lectures will be boring. Yes, some of the questions will be annoying, and the final paper is long. But honestly, this is such a unique and rare experience that I wouldn't have traded it for anything. You learn about a ton of cool topics, meet other involved science students in lots of different disciplines AND get a large stipend for summer research. If you're interested in doing research and have an open mind, take this course. You can get involved in other ways, but this makes it easy and gives you a fantastic experience.",
    "If you are a prospective science\/engineering major or pre-med, I highly recommend you take PSE. First, the guaranteed $4200 stipend you receive for summer research is phenomenal for a freshman, well worth the Friday afternoon lectures and discussion sections (many of which are interesting in themselves). Although the final paper can be a hassle during finals weeks (get started on it early!), the bi-weekly homework assignments are easily doable the night before.",
    "Do it if you want the money. Otherwise, the lectures can be interesting, but discussion is a waste of time. The first few discussions will seem interesting, but then you will start discussing the exact same philosophical issues every other week. I'm not using the research money, so I regret taking this course.",
    "Overall, this course is a good choice if you are sure you want to do research the summer after freshman year. However, it is geared towards the life sciences and not the physical sciences (physics, etc.), and the 90 minute discussions are painfully long. Finally, the problem sets are an exercise in BSing to a ridiculous degree, and grading is fairly ambiguous with the excellent\/very good\/satisfactory scale.",
    "Scie 199 is a good course for gaining exposure to the variety of research being performed at Yale. I would only recommend it to a friend who is highly interested in performing research at Yale.",
    "As I told my prefrosh earlier, apply to PSE if you're interested. Then when shopping period comes around, if you find something you'd much rather prefer over PSE, take that over PSE. However, if you have nothing to do Friday afternoons, I would suggest taking PSE, though hesitantly. If you're really not interested at all and only want the money, don't take the class. You'll be miserable. But some of the lectures really are quite interesting and its interesting to hear how different professors\/researchers got to where they are today and what advice they have to offer. Some lectures are a bit watered-down (usually the environmental sciences ones) or over the top (esp. the physics lectures). The majority of the lectures are biology centered, but they do have 1-2 lectures from astronomy, physics, chemistry. The problem with lectures that aren't bio\/chem related is that often during section, most people don't know what they're talking about which can be slightly frustrating. But otherwise, its a fairly good, mildly interesting way to spend Friday afternoon. And you'd be surprised how often random stuff from PSE pops up in random places.",
    "PSE is an excellent course to learn more about all different scientific fields as well as the interfaces at which they meet. It is also a great opportunity to meet Yale's amazing professors as well as to get into research oneself.",
    "Yes! Do it if you are planning to do research here in New Haven for the summer.",
    "Don't take perspectives unless you're seriously into hard science. If you're in the middle and really like liberal arts too- this class can be very frustrating. It also gets to be work, sometimes when you don't want or have time for it.",
    "Yes, the stipend at the end of the year and the interesting information offered in some of the lectures totally make this class worth it. Plus except for the exploration paper at the end of the year it is a very light work load.",
    "Researchers from various fields presenting cutting edge findings, followed by a discussion in a smaller group of the lecture. One big research paper at the end (start early) and money for research the following summer. I would absolutely reccomend this class to anyone interested in science, whether or not they think they like research.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, especially due to the generous summer stipend and the not at all straining workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend Perspectives. It is such a wonderful opportunity for freshman, giving a good background of the amazing science that is going on at Yale. It is interesting and gives each student money for summer research. It does have a paper to write at the end, but all the work pays off."
