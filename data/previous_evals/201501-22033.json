    "Take this class!! Fantastic as a senior english major, and an invaluable opportunity to read some of the most important manuscripts still in existence. This has been truly a highlight of my time at Yale and I know with certainty that when people ask me about my studies at Yale, I will mention this class every time.",
    "403 is an absolutely fascinating course. It was an amazing opportunity to work with Beinecke material every week (including 1000 year old books). The course is an incredibly interesting mix of medieval history, art, literature, and book materiality that makes you question the entire concept of a codex. Professor Brantley is a very good instructor, and I highly recommend the class to anyone!",
    "Medieval Manuscripts is fantastic. I wasn't expecting very much when I went in, but it was one of my favorite classes that I've ever taken at Yale. You get to work with manuscripts in a very hands-on and casual way. It was also very low pressure, because Professor Brantley and Emily (our TF) knew we were all coming in with little to no previous knowledge, so you never had to worry about being wrong or unprepared. The midterm and final projects were really big, but they were also fun to do.",
    "It's okay. Kind of cool to touch manuscripts. Quality really depends on classmates and Brantley has pretty poor time managment."
