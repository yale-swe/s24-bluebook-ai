    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. It is such a cool and interesting class. It is not too demanding, with regards to work, and it is SO rewarding when it comes to how much you actually learn. I have loved every single unit that we did in this class, and I have fallen in love with the jazz avant-garde because of this course! Professor Veal is BRILLIANT and I promise you'll benefit a lot from taking this course.",
    "Weird class don't take it.",
    "I highly recommend this course to students who are unfamiliar with music or musical analysis. It is a great way to learn to write and talk about music in new ways within an academic setting.",
    "Definitely take MUSI 265 if you have any interest in Jazz. Veal is an engaging lecturer and the artists you study are very interesting. Though do know that the course covers stuff from the 60's to the 80's, so when jazz began to offshoot into very avant-garde territories. If you want to learn a lot about swing, this isn't exactly the course for that. If you want to see what kinds of new art and techniques jazz musicians came up with in the 60's to 80's, this is definitely the class for you.",
    "Not an easy class, but worth it. Prof. Veal is a must-have professor, especially as an \"alternative\" voice within the music department. I feel that this class has challenged how I think more than most classes at Yale, since it is such difficult material to tackle. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Great class where you learn a lot of things you wouldn't have ever learned. Note that this class is very modern jazz focused. This isn't the class to take if you want to learn more about classical jazz.",
    "A great class if you're interested about jazz only during this specific time period. Sometimes I wish the class had been a little broader in the scope of time it covered, however a general intro jazz class would require a lot more time and not allow as much depth. Overall, this class was incredibly interesting and perhaps one of my favorite ones at Yale so far. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "AFAM 253 01 is a course that focuses on the jazz world from 1960-1985. The course looks specifically at artists such as John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Steve Lacy, and Cecil Taylor. The course explores the shifts in jazz music during this time and the forces that influenced the changes. If one wants to learn more about jazz I would recommend this course to such a student.",
    "An excellent overview of avant garde jazz in the 60's-80's, taught by a true expert\/practitioner. Prof. Veal was always careful to allow room in class discussion and in essay prompts for students from variable musical backgrounds. In fact, there were no music majors in the class, probably 5-10 serious musicians, and most of the rest had played an instrument at some point at some point (around 35 total). Class had a lot of Af-Am and Am-Stud majors, since it was corss-listed. Prof. Veal has a class lecture style that some object to, so be sure to shop it, if this could be an issue to you."
