    "If you'd like to escape the mind-numbing kindergarten approach to language that the horror of L1 German holds forth, do not need a language credit, and are mainly driven by desire to be able to read German and can wait to learn to speak German later, this class is for you. You will learn the grammar, and read the awesome German authors with a dictionary. You won't have a good vocabulary, however, and you will not learn to speak or write German, which means you will not come out of this class \"knowing German\" in the most comfortable sense. If you are ok with it and think learning grammar systematically before being subjected to \"repeat after me\" is the more dignified way to spend your mornings, as I do, you should take this class.",
    "This course is meant to teach you how to read scholarly German. I am not sure that I would recommend this course to another student, because I feel like with Google Translate and all the other instantaneous translation aids available, it is quickly becoming obsolete. I also felt like I ended the term having not really learned anything, because part of learning a language to the extent where you can actually read it without using the dictionary every other word comes from engaging with the vocabulary and grammatical concepts on a day to day basis, which is what the speaking component of a language helps to reinforce--and obviously this class had none of that extra reinforcement. If I had it to do all over again, I think I would just take German L1. I think I would've learned more.",
    "yes, the course is good at what it needs to you -- prepare you for a translation test.",
    "Unfortunately I do not have many good things to say about the class. I don't feel like I learnt anything and the amount of work put into it certainly did not justify the results. Be sure to seriously evaluate your reasons for taking the class--you will only learn to READ German, and I found it difficult to learn the language without also reinforcing learning with oral and listening exercises. There is a fair amount of work, with weekly quizzes, two translations a week, two midterms, a student presentation, and a final. The textbook is expensive and awful, so beware. Overall, take it if you think you will need to pass a reading\/proficiency exam for graduate school, as you have to suffer through annoying and pretentious humanities and language graduate students in this course.",
    "Fast-paced and challenging intro German reading course. You'll definitely learn how to read some German, but this is not a course to learn how to speak it. I would recommend it.",
    "Sure, if you're good at internalizing grammar. It's rewarding to translate such hard texts so soon. Be warned, though, that you don't learn to produce German at all, not even written German. And you really don't learn basic words like \"chair\" or \"bathroom\". But it's easy to do that on your own.",
    "The course is as advertised: a study of the grammar, with some passages chosen by the class and by the book, which treats German like a dead language. You won't feel like you've mastered it all by the end."
