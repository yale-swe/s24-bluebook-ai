    "This is a great class in which you cover Japanese lit from the start of the Meiji to around 1970. Lots of cool books and great lectures. The readings take awhile to finish in terms of hours, but it's well worth it.",
    "If you are interested in reading many works in Japanese modern fiction and learning about the lives of the authors, then take this class. You won't learn much about Japanese culture, but Professor Treat knows so much about each author you will read. There isn't a lot of time given to discussion (it is primarily a lecture), which is one drawback I saw about the course. Otherwise, the workload isn't too bad (just a lot of reading- about one novel a week) and the two open notes exams were extremely straightforward as long as you kept up with the reading and took good notes in class. There is only one paper (not too long, 8-10 pages)and grading is pretty fair.",
    "Take. This. Course. If you want to be well-read in the Japanese classics, JAPN 250 is a must. John Treat, a well-kept treasure of Yale, really knows this material inside and out, and always picks a fabulous syllabus for his classes. Be forewarned: the grading is a bit tricky and tough. Though he sometimes opts to assign just two term papers, for this class he scheduled two in-class tests and one paper. Given such few chances to establish yourself, make sure you participate in class. He loves to hear students' ideas and likes challenging them even better. I may be biased because he's my advisor, but you should really take the class just to hear his stories. They are diverse, incredible, and often tell a good deal about the material we're reading in class (so force him to tell you stories!). The sequel to this class (251) is also highly, highly recommended.",
    "If you are someone interested in Japan or just a different type of literature then this class is a good one. This course runs from the late 1800s until the 1960s, which in Japan were some of the most pivotal years in its history. In this class you get to look at the Second World War in Japan and Japan during its modernization through the eyes of a writer and not a historian so for me it was pretty cool. It was also a very small class so a good way to get to know a professor who really knows his stuff.",
    "UMMMMM... basically it's a book every two weeks, which is definitely manageable but the books are kinda ehhh until about midterms. You have two exams and a final paper (8-10 pages). The exams are open note but can be quite tricky if you over think things. You can write about whatever you want for the paper which is nice. Yeah, I would say go ahead and take it. I didn't have any background in Japanese and it was still a good class. Professor Treat is really nice and it's always fun to hear his stories about Japan and the authors (many of whom he knows personally)."
