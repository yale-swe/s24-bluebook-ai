   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it, even to people who weren't modernists. I didn't think that I would enjoy studying Abstract Expressionism, but I found that the seminar helped to open up this period a lot for me. I also thought the syllabus was thoughtfully designed and included a lot of material that probably doesn't usually appear on Ab Ex syllabi, like readings on melodrama, the films that we watched, and so on. This made for a different and interesting approach. Beyond the material itself, I think that Professor Nemerov really made the seminar work.",
    "History of Art 733 explored Abstract Expressionism through a cultural history lens, placing the paintings and their painters alongside the topics of neurosis, post-war trauma, Cold War anxieties, gender roles, method acting and melodrama.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to gain higher understanding of abstraction. This class will help art historians develop a new vocabulary for discussing abstract expressionism. The reading list is fantastic and innovative.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to a fellow student. It was a complete departure from the rote readings of Abstract Expressionism that I'd become accustomed to hearing and to making myself."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me a much deeper understanding of American art in the mid-20th century, a period that I have not studied much until now. I'm not sure right now how it'll contribute to my future research.",
    "The course did \"deepen my knowledge of the discipline\" by setting out what it takes to find an intellectual space for new thoughts in a crowd that includes Clement Greenberg and TJ Clark. Professor Nemerov also invited Sarah Rich to give a talk for us, which allowed us hear the experiences of Yale graduates 10 years after completing the program. He also structured our final presentations around a CAA presentation and gave us a chance to discuss presentation methods the week before. There was a certain level of self-consciousness about this course that was very helpful to my thinking; as though the course were asking \"what kind of art historian do you see yourself becoming?\"",
    "This class absolutely contributed to a deeper understanding of 20th century art history. The reading and discussion were helpful in broadening one's understanding of the work and the prevalent criticism, while also encouraging new interpretations. It provided an opportunity to do original research under the guidance of Professor Nemerov. This class is one of the best I have taken at Yale.",
    "To say that this course gave me an entirely new way of looking, wouldn't be an overstatement. It has provided me with a language for pulling an image apart that I didn't possess previously. It allowed me to not only say what I see about a painting, but what I feel and that is a rarity. I hope to keep that eye throughout my research."
