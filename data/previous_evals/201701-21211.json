    "Good class to learn basics about astronomy.",
    "I learned more about star formation and basic astronomy techniques",
    "I learned how to critically think about astronomy through this course. It was material heavy for lectures and problem sets, but even more so it was about applying the knowledge that we learned on the exams.",
    "Analytical skills, proportions and relationships, effective reading skills",
    "This course was a great introductory Astronomy class and really increased my general knowledge about planets, stars, space, and the universe.",
    "Learned literally nothing this class is pretty useless",
    "I learned so much about space, including how stars and planets are formed, and all the calculations that go into measuring the properties of those stars and planets. It was a great intro class to astronomy!",
    "I'm a senior who took this class just because I thought it might be interesting and it was. I'm an applied math major so the quantitative side of the course wasn't challenging at all, but the astronomy portion was new to me and I learned a lot!",
    "insights about the solar system",
    "I really felt like I learned the fundamentals about astronomy and the building blocks of the universe: how the solar system was formed, the life span of planets and stars.",
    "I learned how to juggle conceptual ideas with the practical aspects of physics and math.",
    "A few quantitative abilities, an understanding of planetary\/lunar\/solar evolution, composition, etc.",
    "Knowledge about the how planets and stars form and function; skills of thinking critically about quantitative and logical problems",
    "Overall this was an increadibly interesting class! As a non-astronomy major, I knew very little about the universe so everything was pretty foreign to me. We learned about the physics of the universe and how it relates to different parts of the solar system and universe ar large. We got to learn about creation of both stars planets and moons and how each related to the other. Overall I feel like I finally learned how to apply many of the laws of physics I learned about in high school to real world instances in the universe. Overall a really great class in which I learned a ton of new things I otherwise would not have learned in any other courses at Yale!",
    "I gained a lot of interesting knowledge about the planets in our universe, stars, and the earth and the sun",
    "I learned about how the solar system works and how to measure distances to stars.",
    "I learned how to use the small angle formula",
    "I was able to learn a fair amount about astronomy and a surprising amount of physics.",
    "Awesome basic Astro class",
    "Developed skills in thinking about WHY things are the way they are in the universe \/ in a science field rather than just what something is like.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of astronomy, how astronomical phenomenon are measured through data we can observe, stars, star formation, and the planets in our solar system",
    "A lot of interesting facts about our solar system.",
    "I gained a general knowledge of our universe and how the things in it interact and how they formed.",
    "QR, SC, learning how to synthesize mathematical information and apply it to outer space",
    "I learned a lot about the methods, history, and techniques of measuring distances in space (I had no idea what \"parallax\" was before taking this course). I also learned a good amount about the basic characteristics of both planets and stars, and perhaps more importantly, how we (astronomers) figure out those properties. I learned how the small-angle formula, Kepler's Laws, spectrometry, brightness\/distance modulus could all be used to determine key characteristics of planets and stars. Moreover, I learned how these techniques could be applied to new\/current problems, like the search for life on other planets\/celestial bodies.",
    "I learned about the universe, and the origins of planets and stars",
    "I now have a basic understanding of the science of astronomy. I have developed\/maintained my math skills, and I have learned how to read the night sky.",
    "I realized how many things around me I don't pay attention to that could be explained with astronomy. I also realized how much I enjoy the subject considering I haven't taken an astro class before.",
    "I developed knowledge about the planets and stars.",
    "learned about the stars, planets, nebulae, moon phases, the whole 9 yards",
    "I got a basic grasp of how a lot of physical and mathematical concepts worked, and I learned a lot about how planets and stars form, what differentiates them from each other, and how we can measure these things.",
    "Knowledge of universe, planets, and basic math skills.",
    "You gain a general understanding of the life cycle of stars and planets. I also learned a lot of information about the characteristics of planets in our solar system (what makes them different vs. similar). I learned about recent discoveries and voyages that are taking place today. One of the big themes of this course was parallax -- how the distance of stars was eventually calculated.",
    "Science and QR and about space which i never knew much about",
    "I learned some useful basic astronomy information that I will be able to use anytime I look into the night sky.",
    "I unfortunately didn't learn very much in this class. I feel like I am walking away with some solid trivia knowledge about planets and stars, but other than that, I really didn't grow much from the course."

   "comments": [
    "You don't need to go to class. Just read the textbook. Lecture is not the most engaging thing",
    "I liked how sections were set up as work sessions, Q&A. Lectures were engaging but not always on topic with the set up of the exams. I would have preferred if Professor Faison discussed the textbook material more in addition to making the real-time connections to current astronomy discoveries.",
    "A lot of work. Some redundancies in the problem sets. Instruction was great, though!",
    "The lecture got rather dull and it started to feel like it would be a better use of time not to go. It was convenient that the sections would help with psets.",
    "Good lectures but tough to take notes on some of them. I would either say that the lectures should be recorded or the slides should be a little more explicative. Some of the abstract concepts are difficult to grapple with.",
    "The lectures are really dull so it's hard to motivate yourself to go. The exam grades are not posted online for some reason so you don't have an accurate depiction of your grade when checking Canvas, that's frustrating.",
    "The lectures don't really seem to be very relevant - you need to learn a lot of stuff on your own in the textbook. The psets are very difficult and he does not really teach you how to do them in lecture - just expects that you know how to do it. Had to get a lot of help from the TF's for each pset.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class! Lectures were organized and Professor was always super engaging. And the material was very interesting so that was helpful. Sections were always at an inconvenient time for me, but I guess that can't be helped.",
    "I felt that perhaps the lowest p-set grade could have been dropped.",
    "Problem set and exam questions are poorly written Kind of a boring class Problem sets were due at 11:59 on Fridays this was not conducive to learning or thoroughness and felt cruel",
    "This course is not taught as well as it could be. Lecture should include more of what we will be doing in our assignments. Also late penalties are extremely harsh (understand this is a choice but just a suggestion that maybe proportional scale with time be used rather than a set value when psets are weekly).",
    "This class had a great flow to it. It began by teaching us the basic physics of the universe, such as orbits and solar systems, and then progressed to stars and then planets. Each related to the other so it was a logical course to follow. Also the material Followed closely to the textbook so it was easy to clarify things not well understood. Finally between the many sections and Professor Faison's office hours, there was always a way to get help when needed. Overall a strong strucure with very interesting informaton.",
    "One weakness is that the TAs differ in level of engagement between sections A strength is that there are many grades, which helps your grade.",
    "the lecture was un-engaging and the course was poorly lit, so I had trouble staying awake",
    "The main weakness of this course is that the students were not engaged or particularly enthusiastic, which changed the lecture dynamic. The lectures themselves were also a little boring.",
    "Professor Faison is a definite strength, basic material",
    "The weakness is that it is a lecture course and it is difficult to always know what is important to know. Also, the problem sets were not always really helpful for preparing for the exams. The strength of this course is that the material is not dull.",
    "The planets unit felt a lot more jumbled and less cohesive than the previous 2",
    "The course covers a wide breadth of topics at a level that is understandable to students with no serious scientific background. The course is kind of weak in that mathematical concepts are sometimes glossed over in lectures when they are important for the course overall.",
    "Lectures were dry and Professor Faison jumped all over the place a lot",
    "This is a reasonable course. The exams are not asking too much or too little from you. The PSETs are manageable and there are several resources available to students to do well in them. I did not find lecture particularly engaging and some times I felt certain questions on the psets were unnecessary",
    "The strengths of this class are that it goes beyond \"plug and chug\" the concepts and \"big questions\" were much more important; the course begins with three or four major guiding questions, and these provide a good lens to use with all of the material (it was well organized); and that the problem sets were not \"busy work\" but helpful applications of the material with a good mix of current examples, calculations, and conceptual questions. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes I found lectures on the boring end of the spectrum. Also, I found the final unit on planets to be not as well organized as the others it was less interesting to simply go through each planet in the solar system and list its characteristics. I think a different framework for studying the planets would have been more interesting and rewarding.",
    "This course was very engaging. I think the downside would be section wasn't manditory",
    "I think this course could use more hands-on stuff like learning to read the stars, find the planets, map the surface of the moon, more of the ancient stuff.",
    "The class has a good structure but I didn't always feel like the lectures were helpful, or the slides after hand. They were pretty good about giving opportunities for extra help and Prof. Faison is very interested about the material he is teaching.",
    "This course could be improved by more one-on-one teacher student interaction. It was impersonal. Also, the midterms were too hard for the level that was taught in class.",
    "Honestly there is a lot of attention from instructors; the lectures and helpful and the answers to the problem sets aren't too hard as long as you read. Overall this was an engaging course that I really enjoyed.",
    "Cool, engaging professor and covers a wide breadth of info.",
    "Yo, this class is difficult and I would not call it a gut. You'll learn about a lot of interesting topics, but don't think that it will be a walk in the park.",
    "The course is pretty straight-forward -- if you look over the textbook readings then you should be fine. Some of the math problems on the problem sets can get a little tricky, but the course does a great job of providing resources (especially for people who struggle with the math aspect of the material).",
    "The lectures could be a little more organized",
    "Lectures are incredibly boring and don't provide much useful information for the tests. Class would be more worthwhile if it was interesting and engaging",
    "This is a weak course and I think it is structured to be an easy science credit. It will be the last easy class I take, however, because I do not feel that it has intellectually bettered me, nor was it a class without work. The class was tedious and, though not very informative, took a lot of time to do well in."

   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in the topic, would recommend. It is interesting without being too difficult.",
    "Take this class if you need a science credit and feel comfortable learning from a textbook (not dense or challenging material at all). Going to class actively made me enjoy this class less, so seriously just read the textbook. The astronomy material is fairly interesting if you don't know much about it or physics",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. Going to section was a great way of engaging with TAs.",
    "The observing exercise was super cool. The problem sets are, at times, graded a bit too harshly. I enjoyed the class, though. Highly recommend learning about astronomical concepts.",
    "I would not recommend this class to someone else. I think there are other more interesting classes that one could take unless they are planning on majoring in Astronomy.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student looking to develop a basic knowledge about the universe. For a non-QR\/Science-y person, I thought it was a course that was easy to understand and did not move too fast.",
    "Good for those who aren't well-versed in math or astronomy. Still interesting and engaging without being too easy.",
    "No.",
    "Professor Faison was really nice but super smart and kind of just expected that students understood the material. The psets and tests are fairly difficult. Overall you do learn a lot of cool information though.",
    "This class is super fun and you get to learn so much about space! Problems sets are due every week, which is a bit annoying, but that's made up by the fact that the lecture material is super interesting and Professor Faison is very energetic and engaging.",
    "This course is pretty interesting and not hard. If you want a chill class and think space could be cool then it's a good choice. Professor Faison is also super nice and a great lecturer.",
    "There are definitely easier SC and QR credits out there. If you're good at math and are just looking for a SC though, I'd recommend this class. Workload isn't too bad as long as you pay attention \/ keep up with the work.",
    "Yes, i think it's a good way to fulfill SC and QR credits.",
    "No It's a \"gut\" that is surprisingly difficult, psets poorly written, not well taught, etc.",
    "'Twas a solid course; the subject matter is very interesting, but the homeworks could often seem to get bogged down in the details too much--not in a difficult way, just in a tedious way. But other homework problems were more thought-provoking.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Unless you are an astronomy major, everything you learn in this class was new and exciting and something you would never have learned about throughout your time at Yale. In my opinions space and the universe is always interesting to learn about, and if nothing else it gives you a nice change from your general course of study. It was increadibly interesting, Professor Faison was great and energetic, and it was a truly great class! We also get to do an observation exercise was really cool as we got to see exactly what we were learning about in he classroom. Overall I would highly recommend it!",
    "I'd say you should only take this class if you find the subject matter interesting. It's definitely not a gut, but if you put in the requisite hours into the work, you'll get a good grade. It can be tedious, though, if physics doesn't come easily to you.",
    "No",
    "I think I would recommend it to students with a slight interest in astronomy, but not to people who are just looking for a gut",
    "Definitely",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, presumably someone who is not in a STEM field and looking for the science of QR credit, ONLY if the person feels comfortable with basic physics concepts and doing science. The work seems to require knowing things about physics\/math that if someone is rusty on will need an extra amount of work.",
    "If you're looking for a QR or a science credit and aren't a stem person, this is a great course for that. The material is interesting, and it's not super challenging.",
    "Yes I would it's a very interesting course and a manageable workload.",
    "This course provides a good overview of the science of the universe, but is not the best astronomy course in my opinion, as it is a little difficult and some of the concepts can get a little tricky to grasp, as they don't always build on each other.",
    "This is not an easy QR, abstract astronomical concepts",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning astronomy who isn't a STEM major. However, this course should not be seen as a gut. For me and for many other students this class required a lot more work than I expected and there are so many concepts to keep track of that make it necessary to put in more effort.",
    "If you are looking for a fairly interesting, sometimes fascinating, not-too-challenging science or QR credit, I would recommend this class. The problem sets each week take a good amount of time, but if you start in advance, work with a group, and\/or go to the optional section, they will be fine. Professor Faison is really enthusiastic, so even if his lectures aren't always the most enthralling, he brings good energy to class and cares deeply about the material. Also, he will bring you to the observatory on campus, which is a really cool opportunity. Overall, this won't be your favorite class, but it is a solid choice with a really strong professor.",
    "Absolutley, it was a really interesting course that made you question the existsnce of life itself",
    "I'd recommend this as a good QR; not to much work, a professor who will take the time to get to know you, and fascinating material.",
    "I would recommend but you have to read the text book for sure. Definitely work with a group of people too it makes it easier to study.",
    "I would not, I did not find it interesting. If the student is interested in astronomy, I would recommend it because they might enjoy it.",
    "this course is pretty chill if you're looking for a non-conventional QR. go for it",
    "Yes! If you want a fun interesting science\/QR, go for it--the universe is fascinating, and Professor Faison does a great job of making it accessible to everyone.",
    "Easy QR course, interesting material. Would recommend.",
    "Yo, this class is difficult and I would not call it a gut. You'll learn about a lot of interesting topics, but don't think that it will be a walk in the park.",
    "I know a lot of people thought this class was much harder than what they were expecting. There is a problem set due every week, and it takes about 4 hours to complete it. For a QR course, the math is not too heavy but it still does exist -- if you struggle with math I would suggest trying to go to section where they go over a lot of the math from the pset problems. Everything you need to know for the exams is basically in the textbook\/on the psets.",
    "if you desperately need science or qr",
    "No.",
    "The only reason you are looking at this course is because you want an easy QR and might be interested in space stuff--I was you once; turn and run! This class is not easy and it is not interesting, it is comprised of the driest concepts in astronomy and many many technically difficult equations. They tell you that you don't need to memorize equations for the exam but they are LYING. They will give you the equation, but in a totally unrecognizable form. If you do happen to recognize it, you won't be able to turn it into anything remotely applicable to the question unless you have an advanced understanding of algebra, and if you're reading this course review, you probably don't. Take something else, take anything else, this class is like dragging a cheese grater across your face.",
    "I would not recommend this class. If you really want an easy science credit, so be it. But know that the grading is done terribly (they put pset grades up in installments), and you will not walking away feeling like you learned much at all."
