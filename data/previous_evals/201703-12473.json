    "I had a chance to interact with some of greatest poets in the Russian tradition and found many of our conversations on the role of contemporary academia thought-provoking.",
    "I learned a great deal about the mechanics of poetry which I have not studied before.",
    "I learned quite a lot about poetry and poetic form throughout the semester. I was relatively unfamiliar with the technical aspects of poetry, and we covered those quite well with daily quizzes and discussions. Additionally, I felt that I was also exposed to a significant number of Russian poets, granted there are so many more to read and listen to, however I feel that we productively engaged with an appropriate quantity of work given our time constraints."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the course gave a good overview of the canon. This will help prep students for exams and was greatly needed in the department. Discussion was great. The reading aloud felt useful and the prosody exercises were a good effort! Would be good to take two weeks at the beginning of term to go over the larger form readings in detail for the students who didnt know that material before the course. Maybe even a few short, informal tutorials would help with this for the interested students.",
    "This course was excellently structured to help us pass the relevant exams in our department.",
    "The course achieved what I believe it set out to do: to introduce students to a wide variety of Russian poets and poetry, and to make students familiar and comfortable with studying poetic form. I thought that the reading level was appropriate, with relevant secondary readings assigned every week. I also thought that the poetry selections were particularly interesting and well compiled, especially given the vast quantity of material in existence. I thought class almost always flowed well and I enjoyed the idea of having brief weekly reading responses. Additionally, I thought that writing a conference paper was a very productive experience. Perhaps there could have been some time allotted to discuss poems that were not the discussed in class. I understand that there are time constraints and am not sure if it would be possible to discuss more than one or two poems in depth."

    "Yes. As mentioned, poetry is a requirement for the exams and this course will help prep students for such a task.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I believe it would be useful and interesting to any student of literature, and would be particularly productive to someone who had not previously studied poetry."
