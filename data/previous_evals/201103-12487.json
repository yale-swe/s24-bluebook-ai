   "comments": [
    "I would take it if you have to or want to take higher level math, but it is a great hassle for those who haven't taken multivariable already, and even if you have, it still is. The workload isn't bad, but the grade distribution is insane so don't mess up if you want an A (the tests are easy though).",
    "I have already told friends not to take this class. I told them not to spend an eighth of the quarter of a million dollars their spending on their education on a class that could be better learned in a library.",
    "Be prepared to how boring the course is. If you do not need it as a prerequisite, do not take it.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend the class because it develops a students problem solving skills.",
    "Math 120 is multivariable calculus, which means if you're taking it you probably don't have much choice. The class is fairly well taught and is absolutely doable if you put effort into actually learning the material. Exams are tough if you only partially understand what's going on. Recommended if you need multivariable calc.",
    "I would recommend it if you like math and are willing to put in the time to teach yourself certain concepts.",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to. Really, it was an abysmal experience and I sincerely regret taking it, especially because I didn't have to. A good majority of the kids have already taken multivariable in high school and I felt like I was at a disadvantage. The first midterm is pretty easy and NOT an indication of what the class will be like at all.",
    "Cool material with class experience heavily-dependent on your teacher\/professor. I would take it because calculus is interesting in and of itself.",
    "It was a hard course, but it's worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're truly interested in math. It is difficult and often times hard to comprehend what exactly it is you're trying to solve in a problem, but if you're able to get over that then it can be a good class.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy math, but don't mind memorizing a few equations without actually completely understanding their basis. Also, even if you've already taken multivariate\/vector calculus, unless you are absolutely sure you know every topic, don't be afraid to take this class instead of going on to linear algebra.",
    "Take ENAS 151 instead of this class. The material is covered too quickly in this class and the final is brutally difficult.",
    "It covers the concepts in Multivariable Calculus. It is a good first-semester math course for students that are pretty well-prepared in math. It's not too difficult, but not extremely easy either.",
    "Hard course. Lots of work. The final exam is ridiculously hard. I would recommend it to students that are interested in pursuing a major for which this would help. Don't take it for fun; you won't remember Multivariable Calc in 10 years if you're not majoring in it (or something that uses it).",
    "If you are very interested in math or need the premed requisite then yes, if not, then there is probably a more interesting course out their.",
    "This course covers a lot of ground and requires students to know a lot of background material. Professor Frame is great but the section instructors are hit-or-miss."
