    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a growing field and very important. It actually is very interesting as well.",
    "This class is pretty easy--when was the last time you spent and hour and a half (or less) on a mechE pset? However Ramirez is leaving so it could be anyone's guess as to what it will be like later. Interesting subject material though, I would take it just for that. Solid MENG elective.",
    "Incredible. I hope Yale finds some way to increase offerings in MEMS and material science.",
    "Yup, I recommend it. It's straightforward so it's not challenging to understand, but you actually learn quite a bit and it's refreshingly MODERN stuff you're learning about.",
    "One of the best engineering electives here at Yale - not only do you learn about an exciting interdisciplinary field, but you also get to learn it under an enthusiastic, knowledgeable professor. The workload is manageable, and you have lots of fun doing the final design project.",
    "it's a blooming technology, and if you're going into technology at all you should know about it. the course itself does a pretty good job teaching about MEMS.",
    "A good class to get a handle on the basics of MEMS, which are really cool and relevant to modern technology. Not too difficult and really interesting. Culminates with a neat little project."
