   "comments": [
    "This class was great. Starts with an intro to axioms about choice and then covers various topics like partisanship, media, socialization, etc. Readings are very interesting and manageable, and class discussions were excellent. Professor Bullock is extremely knowledgeable and clearly cares about his students. He is a great section leader and provided a lot of excellent advice about navigating poli sci academia.",
    "I would, with the caveat that you really need to be serious about political science to take this class. This is a graduate seminar, with graduate students, and Prof. Bullock does very little to accomodate undergrads (not in a bad way, he just doesn't dumb it down at all). While I enjoyed it, I could definitely see others who wouldn't. The assignments were also a bit odd and oftentimes had little to do with the rest of the class, which I found a bit frustrating.",
    "This class is difficult - it sometimes feels like it's aimed at graduate students - butvery interesting. Take it only if you feel you understand how to read a political science article and are willing to work hard to do well.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course for students who are interested in decision-making, and its applications to politics."
