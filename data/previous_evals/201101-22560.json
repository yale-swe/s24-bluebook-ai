   "comments": [
    "Yes. The most enjoyable class I've taken at Yale, and still very helpful and informative--will increase your understanding and appreciation of why things are funny, and the care that goes into making them so in performance.",
    "Great way to learn about the philosophical implications of laughter as a social medium. Also great way to learn how to improv and play in new and creative ways. clowning is amazing.",
    "Take it. You'll learn a great deal about yourself and maybe also about comedy.",
    "Yep.",
    "Take it---not for improv fun, not for philosophy of comedy---take it for conquering any lingering discomfort or self-consciousness about being funny and exposed in performance. The whole class is a good time, sometimes unfocused and random work that doesn't necessarily teach you a lesson. Bear with it, and give plenty of time to your assignments.",
    "It's a very fun class and you get to learn a lot about comedy, in terms of history and theory and the actual practice of getting up in front of a class of people and having to entertain them. Very enjoyable, but stressful at times! Not for those who are self-conscious or embarassed easily.",
    "There is a light amount of reading and written work, but you must attend classes. They are fun and worth it. We got to wear clown noses, go out on a campus tour, and play with prefrosh at the bazaar!",
    "Great class. If you're a thst major, you should DEFINITELY take this. If you're not you won't be able to take it anyways. So sorry.",
    "Yes take it take it no question if you can. Its a great alternative to many of the other acting classes offered and is a crucial skill to have as a performer. Really loved it and Daniel is one of the best in the department"
