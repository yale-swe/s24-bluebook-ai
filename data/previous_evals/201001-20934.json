   "comments": [
    "Strongly recommended",
    "It is either a great way to complement your numerical modeling research or a crash course in numerical methods and relevant geophysical problems. The programming is not taught in the class, so having some idea of how programs work would be useful but is not necessary.",
    "I recommend this course to other students in my department because the skills you will acquire in the class is basic for your future research, and this class may diversify you methods in research.",
    "I would recommend it to new students in G&G dept for learning basic idea of geodynamics.",
    "This course gives an overview of important geodynamical concepts. I think it's real strength, though, was in giving each student the opportunity to dive into a research project that interests them. These research projects required a lot of time, and the course will only be worthwhile if you put a lot of effort into it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone in geophysics, or with even a tangential interst in geophysics. We learned all the important basic concepts, and the hands on experience really helped people understand what geodynamics is all about.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody who is interested in learning about mantle models and they want to know how models are constructed and differ from each other."

    "It's very helpful. I learned a lot about fundamental scientific questions and basic tools to solve these problems. This is the crucial part of my PhD thesis. I am so happy to take this course.",
    "I will expand the final project of this course to be my minor discourse.",
    "This course provides various examples of how to use numerical methods to investigate geological issues, which I think gives me an illustration of how to perform my future research.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the place of theoretical modelling and its limitation in improving our knowledge of how Earth operates.",
    "I appreciated the fact that we were allowed a lot of freedom when selecting our term projects, which allowed me to choose a project that was relevant to my research. In that respect, I gained a lot of knowledge that is pertinent to my field of study and that will serve me well in the future.",
    "This course was very helpful for my research, since I am working in geodynamics. Some of the material were things I had learned before, but it is always helpful for me to see important concepts like this again. There were also many things, specific to the Earth, that I had not learned about in a formal class before, such as Earth's thermal budget, and these have been directly important for my research.",
    "I think it will allow me to judge mantle models more accurately and not just take them for granted."
