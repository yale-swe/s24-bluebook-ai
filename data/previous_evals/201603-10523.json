    "Proofs",
    "I learned a lot about cryptography, proofs of security, etc.",
    "I learned basic cryptographic primitives that form the building blocks of secure systems, and the kind of proof-based thought required to prove security of those primitives. I also learned how security in the \"real world\" doesn't necessarily mean breaking these primitives, but finding how to circumvent them.",
    "Learned how to implement cryptographic schemes from private\/public encryption, authentication schemes, digital signatures, encryption mixed networks, multiparty computation, secure sharing schemes, and zero knowledge proofs.",
    "Proofs in the cryptographic domain are very unique, which makes this class definitely worthwhile. I learned about a way of thinking that I probably never would have come across without this course.",
    "My programming skills in python increased a lot, and it was interesting learning networking in this class through the programming assignments."

   "comments": [
    "Hard to know grade, midterm too difficult, no solutions for home works posted or pset help hours other than office hours. Strengths were involvement of professor and level if hw problems",
    "I understand that this is the first time the course is being taught. The material was quite challenging but interesting. Professor Raykova was pretty intimidating, and it was pretty clear that she was disappointed with us. Moreover, some of the lectures (when just ppt) were extremely dry, though it was more engaging when Professor Raykova used the board to show us things. Also, it seemed like there was an expectation of knowing how to do proofs of security, etc. before the midterm, and then we were tested on it. The results showed.",
    "This is the first year the Professor Raykova taught this course, and as a result there were definitely some kinks to be worked out. Certain expectations about the structure of proofs on both homework and midterms may not have been initially clear to students who had not taken CPSC 365 (which covers the kind of hardness reductions common for this class). Some of these expectations were covered after the midterm, but next year perhaps this can be given a quick primer at the beginning of the semester. Our midterm, which was given in a 75 minute class, was more properly scoped for maybe an 5-hour take-home test. After most of the class did poorly on the midterm, professor Raykova allowed students to submit corrected problems to supplement their grade. Still, I think the midterm did a poor job separating students who legitimately did not know how to do security reductions (but could look them up when correcting their midterm) from students who did but simply couldn't figure out the very difficult problems in the time allotted. To rectify this, we were given two days to complete the (also very diffiicult) final exam, except that the questions kept being revised every few hours this made it incredibly stressful, especially for students who had to leave campus early. Perhaps some more time could be put into writing the final, or maybe a TA could take it ahead of time to ensure that there aren't too many changes during the eam.",
    "The material in this class is very interesting. You learn the ins and outs of the various measures that exist to keep digital information private, which is really relevant and really cool. However, I felt pretty lost the entire class. The midterm was brutal. After that, the pace of the class slowed down, and I felt that I could keep up better. I think it came together at the end.",
    "Under the new instructor, the course was disorganized and often inconsistent, causing difficulties for the students. However, I like how the syllabus has been hauled to put more focus on actually writing proofs from scratch.",
    "The class was extremely difficult. Underspecified assignments make for wild and unpredictable grades - the material is interesting but the pedagogy is lacking.",
    "This is the hardest class that I have ever taken. Many of the topics covered in this class were interesting to learn, but they were incredibly difficult or impossible to understand without doing extra readings and work. The prerequisites of CPSC 223 and CPSC 202 are not enough to prepare you for this class. The problem sets were very difficult and the programming assignments all involve threading\/networking in python, which many students were new to. To compare it to CPSC 323, which is notorious for being the hardest CPSC class, the material covered in this class is much harder to grasp and the programming assignments, while taking a LITTLE bit less time, are more difficult. I had previously taken a computer security class and I was familiar with many of the topics covered, but it still felt like I had been thrown into the deep end. It seemed like 75% of students dropped this class throughout the semester, which is really a shame because cryptography is becoming increasingly important. I almost never write this long of reviews, but I do not want other students to make the same mistake as me and take this class underprepared. This might be the hardest class at Yale. This class should be structured like CPSC 323 or CPSC 202 and have student TAs at office hours to help with programming assignments and questions about the class. This is the first negative review that I have ever left on a class, so please listen to this. I have even thought about reaching out to the computer science department to recommend that the class requirements be changed. I felt underprepared and on my own while taking this class, and the teaching was horrible and consisted of lecture slides that did little to nothing to prepare you for the midterm and final. Unfortunately, I think the entire class failed the midterm, and it seemed like only a few people stuck with the class. I would not recommend this class to anyone."

Moreover, some of the lectures (when just ppt) were extremely dry, though it was more engaging when Professor Raykova used the board to show us things. It seemed better towards the end. Also, the class is just hard. The average on the midterm was 40%, and Professor Raykova was very disappointed, so she let us do corrections (1 week). The average on the corrections was 60%.",
    "Cryptography is a really interesting subject, and despite the disorganization of the class I'm still glad I took it. However, if you're only kind of interested in the subject, or are a person that gets really stressed out during a disorganized class, or you care a lot about your grades, this might not be for you. I'm sure the class will be better organized next year (you at least won't get a 75-minute midterm that would take 5 hours to complete) but even after Prof. Raykova allowed students to write up different answers, and made the final a take-home exam, I still feel like there really isn't that strong of a correlation between how well you understand the material and the grades you get. Also, while the material is interesting, Prof. Raykova isn't the most dynamic lecturer, and is clearly so smart that she can't understand why students struggle with some of the material. Regardless, if you're interested in the material, it's really cool stuff, and I'm sure the course will be better next year when the professors work out some of the kinks.",
    "This class is really difficult. It's mostly proofs, so if you don't feel comfortable doing a lot of those, be prepared to go to office hours twice a week. Also, you will be asked to do programming assignments involving networking, however zero class time is spent explaining how to do these things. So learn on your own or go to office hours.",
    "Take this course if you enjoy proofs. Do not take this course as a fifth credit, because you can expect to spend a sizable amount of time solving the psets and preparing for exams (especially if the course continues to stay as disorganized).",
