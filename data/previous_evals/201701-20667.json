    "I learned how to question existing dogma in history and preconceived notions about society and ideas.",
    "In this course, I learned about the history of the relationship between science and religion and the ways in which this relationship has been framed in a variety of historical contexts. The class analyzed this relationship with respect to Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and medieval Chinese religions.",
    "We learned about the complex and evolving relationship between science and religion. We learned about periods of time and different cases in which they were conflicting and in unison. We learned about different religions and how they viewed different developments in science, medicine, and technology.",
    "I hoped to gain a better understanding about the relationship between science and religion."

    "The course is possibly too wide in scope.",
    "This course had incredibly interesting readings assigned for each week. The first few weeks of reading provided a very effective background for the latter seminar sessions. Professor Dal Prete was very engaging and good at generating discussion.",
    "I thought it would be better if the seminar was larger. 9 people did not feel like enough to always fill conversation. I also disliked some of the readings as they felt tedious and not always relevant.",
    "This course provides strong insights into the relationship between science and religion, and I really enjoyed learning about it. I do wish the seminar was a bit more structured. I found the seminar had a lot of awkward pauses, that could have been avoided with a bit more structure."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the readings and topics are fascinating. Especially if someone has an interest in further exploring the relationship between science and religion in different time periods and via the lens of a variety of different religions and tensions, take this class. Professor Dal Prete is also excellent.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to another student interested in the relationship between science and religion. It was a very different and interesting way to study the relationship of said fields."
