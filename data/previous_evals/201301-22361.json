    "If you want to learn Swahili at Yale you don't really have a choice.",
    "More students should take African Language courses. So relevant in the age of globalization and for anyone interested in traveling to East Africa.",
    "I would recommend Kiswahili for any African studies student and anyone who wants a fun and moderately easy language.",
    "Absolutely. Great class.",
    "Mwalimu is still hilarious and great, but second semester was neither as fun and engaging nor as informative. There are two reasons for that: African Skit Night and the lack of conversation in class. We wasted an atrocious amount of time preparing a very basic skit, and half of us either skipped class or were not engaged during much of that time, and we learned next to nothing from the process. Not to mention that very few people stayed for all of Skit Night. Instead of being a pleasure, it was an obligation. Perhaps in the future, the beginning class (with such low capacity for communication) should just be required to come watch and hang out, instead of wasting time in class. It also made it hard for us to solidify any of the topics\/vocab we learned out of that prep time because we were never really primarily focused on what we were learning.Secondly, there really needs to be a greater focus on being able to SPEAK Swahili. Some of us can read and write fairly well, or even understand when we hear, but the ability to speak just isn't there. People definitely can't say sentences with the complication that we write in our homework assignments.Will I take Swahili next year? Yes. Do I wish that several things had been different about this semester, though? Absolutely."
