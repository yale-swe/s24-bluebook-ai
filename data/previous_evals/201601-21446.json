    "A great history class with the opportunity to improve spoken and written German. The material is really interesting and Theresa is an incredible teacher, who goes out of her way to find sources for your final project and is so encouraging. The email exchange with a former East German resident was sometimes annoying but very insightful. I feel like I've gained an extra Grandma in Germany!",
    "A good history course taught in German. Take it if you're relatively comfortable speaking freely in German.",
    "TAKE IT! This course is an excellent overview of the history of East Germany. Take this class if you want to better your knowledge of German history, improve your German, or want to take a class with one of the best professors at this university. The hands on style of the course allows you to experience history through the eyes of those who lived it. It was informative, stress free, and extremely rewarding. The class is heavily weighted towards the final project, but it builds out of the material you learn throughout the semester, so it was very manageable.",
    "It's not too much work BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO THE PROJECT EARLY! I know, we are all masters at procrastinating but still getting stuff done. Don't do it here. Please. Learn from those before you. It sucks. And Theresa is SO SO nice about it but it still sucks. So yea, when she tells you to work on it like a month in advance, listen to her. But besides that the workload is minimal.",
    "IT IS A MUST. EVERYTHING IS GREAT ABOUT THIS CLASS: PROFESSOR, MATERIAL, AND ASSIGNMENTS. Professor Schenker is one of the most amazing Professors at Yale. If you are interested to learn more about contemporary Germany, do not miss this class!",
    "German 160 is a survey course of East Germany in German. We talked about the history, politics, walls, escapes, literature, education systems, reunification, and more. Usually in class Theresa taught a little bit about the topic and we discussed the texts or movies we had watched for the class. The class involves daily reading, emails with someone who lived in East Germany (very cool opportunity), one presentation, and a final project. You'll get much faster at reading and writing during this class.",
    "I would recommend this as a good L5 class. It includes literature, film, history, internet research, and email correspondence with a real, live German. So, overall, the material is diverse and it prevents the course from becoming dull.",
    "I certainly would recommend German 160 to another student. It was interesting and engaging without being overwhelming. The classroom discussion was easy to keep up with and engage with and I enjoyed the classroom environment very much."
