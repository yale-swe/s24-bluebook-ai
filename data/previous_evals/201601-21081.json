   "comments": [
    "Was a cool class in that the concept is pretty cool. Overall the psets were pretty easy, but the class lectures were kinda boring. The final project was an animation which was cool but really really long to make.",
    "I would. The final project made the whole class worth it.",
    "Much more work than you think, but you come out with a semi-useful and very unique skill.",
    "It's a cool class but definitely harder than anticipated",
    "Mixed feelings. Lecture was incredibly dry and boring and I'm not sure what I actually learned. The same material was then repeated again during the lab component. The powerpoints were beyond unhelpful which made exams hard and seem way more detail oriented than I felt comfortable with. Overall, the conceptual part of this course was a flop to me. The actual usage of Maya, however, was quite the contrary. It was exciting becoming adept at using a new software and there was always adequate help given. That said, the psets were challenging and time consuming. If you go to office hours, you will be fine but that is a time commitment you have to make. I do wish the office hours were more accommodating to when students were available rather than the weird times they were. But regardless, the class did feel worth it in the end, especially with the culmination of our final project which is definitely rewarding albeit time consuming. I also really enjoyed the trip to Blue Sky animation studio, super cool seeing the animation\/modeling skills we were learning in action and definitely put the class more into perspective! To summarize, lecture = boring and unhelpful, lab = repetitive but helpful, psets = hard and time consuming but doable with office hours, exams = hard because all conceptual which isn't covered well with lecture, working with Maya = super cool though at times tedious and frustrating but rewarding nonetheless.",
    "I would not recommend this class if you are looking for an easy QR. This class was more challenging than I expected, but I do feel like it allows you to get a handle on what animation is. It is very calculation focused for the most part although you do get some animating experience. The final project especially gives you free reign to test your new found skills. In fact. it is likely you will need to learn more animating techniques on your to make your animation due to the focus on theory in class.",
    "Not incredibly fun. A bit dry. A good way to get your feet wet with animating. More math than I expected -- not difficult, just tricky at times.",
    "A math class with an artistic twist",
    "Looking back, I really liked the course! It was really fun to dig into the 3D modeling and animation software Maya, but I will say that it does take a few weeks for us to actually do so. For most of the class, we focused more on the history and development of digital modeling and animation, as well as the math that goes into the various rendering algorithms. As interesting as that was, the problem sets based on these concepts usually felt like repetitive computation, and this was unfortunately a good portion of the class. Although we do get to use the animation software from the start in the problem sets as well, we don't get to use it a lot. You kind of just have to grab a friend (it's more fun that way) to get through this section of the class to make it to being able to use Maya a lot more towards the end of the class, especially for the final project. Other than that, it was a great class. I learned a lot, and there's an amazing trip at the end of the semester to a real animation studio! Although some of the lectures might get a bit bland, if you're interested at all in animation and modeling, I would definitely take this class. Definitely do the problem sets with friends! It's fun!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You will learn essentials of theoretical computer graphics and 3D modeling. The latter is a very important skill, especially for engineers, artists or designers. After finishing the course you will feel that you can model pretty much anything, using tutorials, forums, etc. The best thing is that no prior knowledge is needed for this course (except a very basic math) and that the pace of the course is just perfect. Even thought you learn a lot, the assignments are manageable and are not intimidating at all. Also the final project is really interesting to work on, and they give you a lot of time for it. Also Prof Dorsey is very nice, her lectures are great and she is very supportive."
