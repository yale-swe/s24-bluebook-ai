    "Yes, though you might want to consider 495, since you will be in lab for many hours a week anyway, you might as well get the intensive degree.",
    "It all depends on which lab you're working in and who your PI is, so choose wisely. Since this fulfills the senior requirement, the work at the end of spring semester is quite a bit (presentation, poster, senior essay\/report), especially if you present in the spring (you could also be assigned to present in the fall).",
    "For any one that wants to get real research experience 485\/486 is the way to go.",
    "Since every student selects their own lab and essentially dictates their level of involvement, this course is very much what you make of it. Look for a lab early - the sooner you get involved, the more you will get out of the experience.",
    "The class is just a pain, for the most part, if you're a student who has already had research experience.",
    "Great, but take 495. You WILL spend more than 12-15 hours in the lab. And make sure to join a lab where you enjoy the social experience of the lab members - it would really make or break the experience.",
    "Only if you need it and want to do a year's worth of research and like what you do.",
    "Definitely, need research experience it can change any misconceptions.",
    "If you want a BS you have to do it. Deal.",
    "If you want to do research, take it. Pick a lab carefully.",
    "If you love research or are thinking about going into research, this is the course for you. Otherwise don't do it. Research takes a lot of time and dedication, and if you lack the interest or commitment to it, it will be a frustrating struggle."
