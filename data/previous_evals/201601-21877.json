    "do intensive if you want to spend a good amount of time in the lab and get a fair amount of results",
    "Lots of time (obviously) but I found it the most meaningful academic experience of my time at Yale.",
    "It's probably not an option if you're looking at this review, but I would definitely recommend doing the intensive 495\/496 option. With more time in the lab, you have the opportunity to have a real impact and do real research. Also--if you have the option, work with Mustafa Khokha--shameless plug but he's amazing and his whole team is wonderful",
    "Every student has to do this. It's a great leaning experience.",
    "Take this class if you want to get good experience with hypothesis-driven experimental biology, writing grant proposals, writing scientific-stylish paper. You have the opportunity to do real science rather than intro labs that teach you methods rather than how to think like a scientist. If you do good work then you can maybe even get published."
