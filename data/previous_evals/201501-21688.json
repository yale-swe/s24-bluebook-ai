    "Yale in London is worth doing just for this class. Wow. It is life-changing. This is one of those rare moments in education that actually work and fuel your self-development. I went in having seen less than a handful of professional productions (theatre is very middle-class), and got to see 15 productions this semester and will remember many of them. I also worried that Sheila wouldnt ever differentiate me from the other Asian American gal with glasses (not the best with names at first), but Sheila is a goddess who should not be doubted. She makes sure to get the big points about the plays across, while allowing us to steer discussion. How we respond to art is highly personal so class often felt like just chat (as Sheila says), and more often than not we soon saw how these works affect us personally and carry life lessons. There are moments where I was so affirmed I felt like I was rising out of my body, where I understood things about my experiences and this society that I thought I would never in my life understand. Of course there were also challenges, Sheila deliberately stirring things up, where it was harder to meet the play\/class. But everything was a learning opportunity and I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Student watch plays of all types of genrees in London from community theatres in East London to West End shows. Students also read important texts of British Drama. There are three assignments not including the final. The assignments include a play review, an essay, and a class presentation. Sheila is great take the course if you can one of the best classes I took at Yale.",
    "Modern British Drama balances the personal and the academic, the theoretical and the practical, as well as a journalistic criticism and theatre history within the United Kingdom. It is definitely recommended to students who haven't had much experience in theatre but has great interest in it; Sheila delivers the class very well - she punctuates information with space for personal sharing and discussion."
