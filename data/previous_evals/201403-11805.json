    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Hands down, the worst class I've taken at Yale. I took this as an English major looking to fulfill the pre-1900 requirement--big mistake. Looking back, there are SO many better ways to fulfill it. The lectures are disorganized and completely uninformative (think large block quotes and info from Enchanted Learning...as in, the site for elementary school kids). This class is designated as a lecture, but Prof. LaFleur is CLEARLY uncomfortable and incompetent at teaching lectures and had only taught this class before as a seminar. This was a fairly small lecture so Prof. LaFleur thought it would be a good idea to turn it into a seminar...except that there were 30 of us and we were in a lecture hall. So class turned into discussion, which was really just Prof. LaFleur asking \"So what did you guys think?\" and people just giving their opinions on the readings. Essays were also graded against a rubric, which as an English major is completely unheard of. Sections are usually awkward silence and the TAs are just as clueless as the professor. Do yourself a favor and take literally ANY other class but this.",
    "If you are someone that enjoys history a lot, I would recommend this class. If you are someone that prefers fiction and poetry, I might not recommend this class because that didn't seem to be what the focus was on.",
    "The professor is extremely knowledgable about this subject area and seems very passionate about teaching it. She is very kind and often funny. She does not assume her students know things that might seem \"basic\" and does a good job of explaining them. She also did a wonderful job of encouraging her students to participate in discussion However, the class is fairly disorganized, especially with assigned readings and due dates (see above comment). The professor asked for professionalism on our part an the beginning of the semester, which I appreciated, but did not display it herself. On many occasions she was not able to screen her powerpoints, her syllabus changed almost every week, and one of her prompts was clearly reused from a previous class.",
    "If you like novels and not other pieces of literature, don't take this class. Uncle Tom's Cabin on the syllabus is not a good enough reason to take the class. The other readings are often dry and difficult to sift through.",
    "AMST 210 is a comprehensive survey of early American literature prior to the Civil War; pre-colonial, colonial, and antebellum American literature all receive in-depth treatment and analysis. The course makes it a point to revisit famous writers like John Winthrop, Thomas Jefferson and Harriet Beecher Stowe, as well as lesser-known writers who, due to their gendered or racially imposed obscurity, are often overlooked. I would recommend this course, especially to prospective (freshman\/sophomore) American Studies majors, as this assortment of writing effectively displays the variety of perspectives to be found in the American literary canon.",
    "Historical approach to early Am Lit--great way for AMST majors to get their pre-Civil-War requirement and Am Lit Survey done in 1 course!",
    "Great survey course of early American literature. You will read both primary and secondary sources, culminating in a visit to the Beinecke. Professor LaFleur is very passionate and approachable. Warning: make sure you keep track of the readings because there are many alterations to the syllabus.",
    "This is an introduction to early american literature. If you are looking at this class as the literature or pre-civil war requirements for American Studies, take another course. It is hardly an American Studies course at all.",
    "A \"whirlwind survey\" of early American literature. Because students must read so many texts in the course, the lectures and sections are not long enough to allow for close reading of each text. Still, I'd recommend the course: it exposes connections between texts, the \"big ideas\" of texts, that might not have been apparent in independent (particularly non-chronological) reading."
