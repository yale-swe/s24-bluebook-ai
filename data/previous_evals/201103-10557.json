    "I would highly recommend it.",
    "Unfortunately the class is only available to Japanese speakers, but anyone with a passing interest in Japanese culture, 20th century history, media studies, or sociology should definitely take the class. Television has played a crucial role in Japanese society, and it is a shame that it is not studied more often. I would recommend this class to anyone with the language ability.",
    "The material is challenging and requires advanced Japanese skills as well as patience in dealing with a variety of arguments\/methodologies from Japanese scholars. I would recommend the course to another graduate student - or responsible undergraduate - who was interested in obtaining a historically based understanding of the stakes for television in postwar Japan."

    "Significantly.",
    "The class was eye-opening. At this point I can't say whether it will factor into my dissertation, but I now know it is a topic I hope to pursue in some form in the future. It has contributed greatly to my knowledge of the discipline by providing a different angle through which I can approach Japanese culture outside of film and literature."
