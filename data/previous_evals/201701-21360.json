   "comments": [
    "My creative writing dramatically improved throughout the duration of this course. I found it extremely interesting.",
    "I learned how to write personal essays, and increased by arsenal of techniques. I read enjoyable essays, learned how to break down some of what authors did in those essays, and then tried to apply it to my own writing. I gained insight into my own mind and habits through writing these essays.",
    "When I say that I learned how to write essays from this class, I truly mean it! I came in thinking that writing was about making poetic statements and fantastical phrases that made people want to snap or clap. I had never experienced the art of the essay. I was able to access parts of myself that I had never really thought existed and used them to write the essays. As the course progressed, I realized that writing can be poetic, or it can be concrete. Essays...well, I still don't fully understand them. But, to me, they're a complex, beautiful mixture of these two ideas. You get to use concrete phrases to present large, sometimes poetic, concepts to your reader. My writing style improved as well, and I will take everything that Ms. Sharlin told me to heart as I go on to writing more essays in my Yale career.",
    "I learned how to read better for hidden author intentions and techniques and how to craft a well-written essay using famous essays as models.",
    "My writing and reading skills improved so much from taking this class.",
    "I didn't think I learned that much about essay-writing and writing in general but in hindsight I did! My writing has become objectively better - perhaps not mindblowingly but still better - and I feel I've taken away more knowledge and awareness from this course.",
    "My appreciation of personal essays and my writing skills greatly improved.",
    "I learned how to write creative nonfiction essays as well as to read others' creative nonfiction essays: to see what worked well as well as what didn't. I learned lots of different techniques and approaches, and I learned how to be helpful to my peers when reading their essays. I developed the skill of writing: coming up with ideas, drafting, and revising, and reaching out to resources for help when I needed it. I got better at each of these things and procrastinated less over time. I got over my fear of writing.",
    "This course greatly improved my writing ability. It also made me a more critical reader, and taught me how to give advice to other writers, even those who are more skilled than myself."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the biggest strength of this course was my professor, Shifra Sharlin. I found it extremely helpful having to do workshops of our essays and write workshop comments for our fellow classmates. I really enjoyed having a writing meet up where professor Sharlin hosted the class at her house and provided us the space to talk about our essays and share feedback.",
    "I loved this class!!!! The workshopping was so helpful, and the essays were so much fun to write. Shifra gives amazing feedback and is so much fun to work with. This class is a gem. It is so good as is. It would be fun to have more external meetups to just write together outside of class, but that also happened pretty naturally within our class.",
    "Very few weaknesses, but I do think that perhaps the specificity of assignments. Sometimes, they were a bit vague and I didn't really understand how to go about things like workshopping or even the ideas of the essay before speaking directly to Ms. Sharlin. But, as I got later into the course, I had a clear understanding of the coursework. So many positives! Besides the wonderful, introspective process that I underwent every time I wrote the essay, Ms. Sharlin made this course wonderful. I loved the selection of the essays because each brought up very personal and intimate perspectives on topics I never really thought that much about in my hectic daily life. I also enjoyed discussions of the essays because I got to add my own input to the whole but mostly because I loved hearing everyone else's ideas concerning the topics of the essay and how they interpreted it.",
    "Strengths: trains you to become a better writer and reader, teaches you how to write personal essays, Shifra was an extremely sweet professor, the class discussions were engaging, the readings were fun to do Weaknesses: people often put in a lot of work for this class and improve as writers but often do not end up getting the grades that they want to since A-'s and A's are reserved for \"excellent\" essays. The professor is a harsh but fair grader in this class.",
    "Strengths - workshopping, professors Weaknesses - workshops could really vary in quality, maybe more emphasis on how to workshop in the beginning",
    "English 120 is really good at getting you to write a lot and makes your writing a lot better. I have no weaknesses to note",
    "The strengths are the essays we read, the topics we write on, the structure, the class size, and the professor. I thought the class was amazing because we got to know each other and be open and honest with each other about the essays we read and the essays we wrote. The workshops were a huge strength of the class as well. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "This was a truly amazing class and I honestly can't think of anything wrong with it. My favorite class I've ever taken",
    "Overall I thought the course was fantastic and clearly well thought-out. The greatest strength of the course was Professor Sharlin's wonderful teaching and the discussions she facilitated. Her one-on-one feedback on our essays was extremely insightful and I felt transformed my writing. The fifth essay felt a bit rushed, but this is unavoidable in the spring semester. I learned something valuable from each unit of the course. The fourth essay, using archival research, felt a little bit unmanageable at times, but in the end I'm glad we did this instead of an interview-based essay like some other 120 classes."

   "comments": [
    "If you take English 120 take it with Professor Sharlin! She is so sweet and brought us food every day to class to make it a little more fun.",
    "I really enjoyed English 120, much more than I thought I would. Shifra was very positive and great at facilitating class discussions. The essays were fun (and a bit frustrating) to write. If you don't like literature and still need a writing credit, or if you just like to write and think about yourself, definitely take 120.",
    "Take this class!!!! It's so much fun, you learn so much about yourself, and the professors are great. I had Shifra, and, beyond being a wonderful human being, she also gave really good comments. She really tries to get to know you as a person. I met with her regularly to talk about essay ideas and feedback, and it was really helpful. This was my favorite class this semester by far, and possibly in my whole time at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who was serious about improving their writing abilities, but also who wants a brief reprieve from the hectic mess that is surviving as a student at Yale University. Many of these essays reflect some of our most inner thoughts and exploring that connection sometimes leads us to discovering truths that we never expected to find.",
    "I would strongly recommend English 120 to other students. The class is a lot of work. You can't expect to have good essays without putting a lot of time into your writing, which I know not everyone has so much time. But you never know how much fun writing is until you try it. I also loved my section. All of us in the class got along well with each other and gave great feedback during workshops. I never expected to experience such strong bonding in a class. It's important to take a seminar, especially English 120 when you can get quite intimate, with people you get good vibes from. I was lucky to have that. Having awesome people in the class ultimately made the experience more pleasant for me; otherwise, I don't think I would've enjoyed it as much. I appreciate Shifra and can see how dedicated she is to teaching, but I was frustrated many times during the semester because of unclear feedback on my essays. I didn't know what she wanted in my revisions because she didn't express herself well during office hours. Bottom line is take English 120, always, because it will be one of the best classes you'll take at Yale. Shop many sections to make sure you like the professor and the people.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend ENGL 120 if you want to improve your writing skills, be engaged in class discussions, and learn to write about yourself (which is an important skill especially in stuff like application essays)",
    "Yes! Whatever your path in life, this is a good course for improving writing skills while doing some self-reflection.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their writing",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend English 120 with Shifra. The class is amazing because of her. It's a great way to get more comfortable with writing, since you have to write basically once a week. Luckily the essays aren't too long so they don't get overwhelming, and you can just have fun with them since you can write about pretty much anything from your life. The class is small, which is always a nice change from lectures and lets you really relax and have fun in class. The workshops are really helpful both as a person getting workshopped and as a commenter on others'. If you get the section with Shifra, TAKE IT. She is amazing and wonderful. She is incredibly helpful and kind.",
    "This class really helped me develop my own writing style and become more comfortable writing personal essays. I absolutely loved the readings and the writings, and you really grow to love the people in your class as well.",
    "Yes! This class helps you grow as a person and a writer. You're missing out by not taking this!!!",
    "English 120 is a fantastic class, especially if you are lucky enough to take it with Prof. Sharlin. She is one of the kindest people you will ever meet and makes class a joy to attend. She also gives fantastic advice about writing because she really gets to know each student's style individually. Would absolutely recommend."
