    "This class was most useful to me as a sort of skills lab in close-reading. The dialogue between English and German readers in the Rilke portion was engaging and encouraged me to home in on German puns and wordplay that I might otherwise have overlooked. I came into the class with some familiarity with each author, but I had never read most of the materials on the syllabus (eg: Yeats' plays)."

   "comments": [
    "I thought this course catered well both to graduate specialists and to undergraduates just trying out this kind of literary interpretation. I would have enjoyed more secondary material - perhaps appended as a recommended bibliography to the syllabus? I also found it a bit difficult knowing where to start reading when we were instructed to read widely in texts not included on the syllabus -- more direction would have been helpful."
