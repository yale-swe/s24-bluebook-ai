   "comments": [
    "Question 10: The instructor was knowledgeable about the subject material, but tried to cover too many subjects in a limited amount of time. Because of this, it was difficult to talk about any topic in depth.Question 11: This course fills a current gap in the curriculum and is an important area of study for many of the current master's students. However, it would be helpful to narrow the focus of this course so that it complements other offerings in design, ecology, and industrial ecology rather than attempting to cover all of these topics simultaneously. Although discussion was difficult due to the large class size (a reflection of interest in the subject), this was further hampered by the fact that there was rarely time after the lecture to engage in an organized conversation about the material.",
    "The course was excellent and I am very happy I had the opportunity to take it!",
    "It would be good to do more hands on exercises in the future, perhaps some visits to designed sites as they connect with science.",
    "I stopped reading about 3 weeks in because we never discussed them, and if they were discussed it was only briefly in passing. They did not help me better understand the material taught during lecture. The date for the field trip should have been concrete from the beginning, but it's hard to schedule that in the spring when so many classes have friday field trips.",
    "I felt the class was not well organized and the class time wasn't budgeted well. The instructor is a great guy, but the class was sort of sloppy and wasn't highly conducive to class participation. I came into the class with high expectations, and then found the assignments relatively essorteric and constraining. I also found Dr. Felson disappointingly uncommunicative through email.",
    "Great class but too much reliance on publications and theory. Theory should be better balanced with application. Too heavy on academic journals and concepts, would be much much better to have more projects and design-oriented activities.",
    "some students in the class were verbose, and able to get us off topic by telling too many anecdotal stories which, if had been kept in check, we might not have run behind and not finished lectures. i realize that there is a fine line between letting people be heard, and cutting them off, but we had a couple of repeat offenders. a couple of the guest speakers were good at stopping people from saying too much when it was related to a future section of the lecture.",
    "Course material was great, but tried to cover too much. Also, too much time was spent on theoretical conflicts as opposed to diving more into the substantive case studies.",
    "I liked this course and really appreciate how hard it is to put together a solid course that covers the topics that this one did. However, I felt too much of the course time was spent discussing the difficulties the field of urban ecology and its practitioners face, and not enough time spent learning ecological concepts and hard skills that would help practitioners think about their sites differently.The readings were useful and carefully chosen, but they weren't discussed comprehensively, and there were no related homeworks to ensure that a majority of the class had read them and thus, the caliber of the discussion dwindled.",
    "this class has so much potential to be an absolute core class at FES. questions the class tried to wrestle with: the urban as part of ecosystems, the barrier between human and natural, landscapes and shaping, design in dynamic systems, etc. are vital fields of knowledge for any environmental professional nowadays. there is just so much material, so much to get through, and so little other addressing of some of the material in other classes here, that i think alex and the TFs tried to jam it all in. the class moved to quickly, the group was too big, and, strong discussions had to be truncated in the interest of time or getting to the readings. taking their time with this class, leaving space for discussions, and spending more time with concepts could have done a world of good. and shrinking down the class size. the class started to click toward the end of the semester.",
    "Prof. Felson is extremely knowledgeable and interesting as person, but the lectures tended to try to encompass way to much material to fit into one class session, so we never got to the end of the slides and had to cut off the discussion without concluding properly. The class would benefit from more organization and a syllabus that didn't change every week.",
    "The final assignment was interesting, but it would have been much better if it had been a semester long project. It was very difficult trying to obtain a scientific and policy background on the issue at hand in order to produce new recommendations\/a way forward and provide the \"designer\" with good material to present in such a short time period with so many other major projects going on as well.",
    "Urban Ecology is a hybrid field and this was a hybrid class that catered to policy wonk students, science students, and design students. It was also the first time the class was taught, and although there were some real issues, the course was awesome and has great potential.A smaller group in the UEDlab would have DRAMATICALLY changed the feel of the course. frontal powerpoints almost every day was tiring, no matter how nicely they were put together. The mix of students was definitely fascinating and I learned a lot fro mthe interdisciplinary nature, especially when we had time to really discuss.The course was too broad, but this sweeping survey was also valuable in its own way as exposure to a huge breadth of readings and ideas that I can now revisit. I would have preferred to go into many of the readings more in depth, but feel so so happy to have the syllabus in my toolkit."

    "Hands on assignment work and class discussion.",
    "The readings for this course provided a good background for such a rapidly evolving field. The guest speakers and design projects discussed in class complimented the readings well.",
    "It was fairly inter-disciplinary in its scope and content. The in-class interaction with students from the Forestry school was productive and insightful.",
    "Although it definitely wasn't what I had expected, I appreciated the designer perspective and the opportunity to interact with the architecture school.",
    "I enjoyed all of the assignments and lectures given. The assignments were extremely meaningful ones that allowed the students to explore their interests fully to promote urban ecology practices. The lectures were always engaging, and the guest lectures also exposed everyone to a wealth of information related to applied urban ecology.",
    "Guest speakers added a lot of great perspective to the class. The reading list was very carefully thought out and comprehensive...this is an emerging and complex topic. Perhaps include more reading responses in future classes?",
    "the \"applied\" element of the course related to learning from professionals in various fields and how they implement 'urban ecology' in to their practices. I got quite a bit out of the first two assignments, but the third could have improved with more time for development. It was rushed by being put at the very end of the semester when it could have been a great semester-long project. I did appreciate being put in to groups where everyone has a different strength.The three sections were a natural transition from one to the next, but the first section was long and unnecessary. There could have been maybe 2 lectures about the history of the subject, but it was unnecessary to learn any more than that. The information as covered too quickly and never came up again so I questioned why I even came to those lectures.",
    "I think Professor Felson is a great guy with interesting stories and a good capacity to lecture. However, I felt there was not enough structure in the class and I felt like ultimately I didn't get a ton out of it. The readings were also rather repetitive, and they didn't generate a lot of class discussion, nor were they brought up much in class, so there wasn't huge incentive to do the readings. (There was also a relatively high reading load, especially as many of the papers were repetitive).",
    "breadth of topics covered, giving a good survey of the different aspects of the course subject..",
    "Subject matter! We need more classes on urban issues at F&ES and this filled a much needed gap. Guest speakers were also fantastic.",
    "The field trips. And the ecological design symposium. I also really enjoyed the project, though, I think more time was needed for it to become more substantive.",
    "The Lab and the last class guest lecturers were AMAZING!Those guests should be invited to kick off the course during the first week.",
    "the class lectures from Prof. Felson and guest lecturers",
    "i think alex is an excellent thinker and a very committed educator. i'd like him to trust that more and have him move away from the powerpoints, into leading dynamic discussions. this started happening more toward the end of the semester. he did a great job at that. perhaps moving the class up to greeley permanently would be a good thing. the readings were great, but there was some redundancy in them. all the material was great. just needs streamlining.",
    "Field trips and exposure to literature",
    "Assignment #3",
    "A couple of guest lecturers were great and the end group project was very interesting subject matter although output was lacking in the end.",
    "The field trips and readings were great.",
    "transcisciplinarity, the subject matter, the emphasis on design and application. guest speakers ROCKED! Assignments were pretty great, sometimes a bit vague."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall, there was very little synthesis of material introduced through readings. While there was an overview of concepts, there wasn't much discussion about how that material is interrelated or how it could be directly applied to real world scenarios. The final assignment would have benefited from having extra time for completion so that we would be able to incorporate interviews with practitioners or research effective strategies for implementation.",
    "Lectures. There isn't really enough factual material on the topic of the course to fill so many lectures, so lectures were heavy on reinforcing concepts that are quite broad and known. For a field so new\/evolving there should perhaps be more class participation: Exploring and perhaps shaping the scope\/nature of subjects studied is a role students should be playing to enrich the exploration of the topic.",
    "This course could be improved by targeting the scope of the class more to allow for student discussion and engagement during class time. A discussion of the tension between academic and applied work is important, but this topic often took over the discussion to the detriment of other points of view. It was difficult to focus on the applied aspects of the course when many of the lectures were theoretical and rushed.",
    "The reading list is a bit too vast. More readings that deal with landscape architecture\/ urbanism will be helpful in understanding the synthesis of science and design in practice.",
    "more discussion, less lecture. sticking to the time constraints of class",
    "I thought the course was great and cannot think of any improvements.",
    "I think reading responses would have helped us integrate the material a bit better.",
    "The different lecture topics focused too much on developing concepts and not enough on specific projects and processes. In the Studying section, the \"Synthesis, What's Missing,& Designed experiments\" lecture on 3\/27--the lecture should have spent more time looking at specific case studies to really understand the experiment process and motivations when including people, rather than just talking about the subject. (i.e, there could have been better readings)I would have liked to have whole lectures hearing about projects Alex has worked on--the whole process from proposal to design, and what setbacks there were\/policy hindrances encountered. He breezed over many projects when the course would have been much more 'applied' if he spent a lecture on each project so that we could see what actually goes in to doing 'urban ecology'.",
    "The structure and time budgeting. More opportunities for self expression in the assignments.",
    "Great class but too much reliance on publications and theory. Theory should be better balanced with application. Too heavy on academic journals and concepts, would be much much better to have more projects and design-oriented activities.",
    "cohesion of topics in moving from one topic to the next. parts were a bit disparate.",
    "Lectures tried to fit in too much and discussion was limited and forced. A much smaller class size and shorter lecturers would be beneficial. Also, more time spent on case studies and specific methods would be helpful to bring focus and depth.",
    "This course wants to be a clinic. Instead of telling the students about the difficulties of being an advocate and a scientist or an ecologist and a designer, I think students need to play that role. Ideally, the class would break up into groups at the very beginning of the semester and be assigned an ecological design problem (ideally with an actual group that is looking for assistance). The lectures would inform how the group brings the project forward all term and the group would learn the hardships of being an environmental consultant through actually acting as one.",
    "I think that the volume of readings was very large. Perhaps it could have been streamlined a bit more. The readings were excellent but could have been reduced a bit.",
    "pace needs to slow. discussions need to be more dominant and powerpoints need to go away (for the most part, particularly ones with huge bullet lists). assignments need to be streamlined. room configuration could be different, encouraging discussion. a greater sense of direction and structure could be built into the syllabus. right now there may be just too much info to feel structured.",
    "Better organization and narrow the scope",
    "Communication of assignments. Also assignment #2 was not very helpful, it was just asking a list of questions pre-determined by the Professor\/TA and did not allow any creativity. I felt like a scrivener and did not see the value in this exercises.",
    "Organizing the syllabus and more effort to stick to the material and time.",
    "I realize that there are so many aspects to cover, but I think the course would run much better if the scope was narrowed by quite a bit. Some of the concepts we discussed are rather fuzzy and highly context specific. It might have been better to go through case studies for a week or two weeks - have a theoretical introduction, talk\/debate through the case study, and discuss options for moving forward either with that case or with similar issues.",
    "Assignment 1 was the most educational for me-- the interview assignment 2 was less useful.",
    "general disorganization regarding field trips resulted in me not going on any really....definite area for improvement.the lectures and slides went too quick...just too much material covered to cursorily."

   "comments": [
    "While I gained an appreciation of the development of the field of urban ecology and knowledge of the different disciplines\/actors that work on professional projects, I was disappointed that we were not able to discuss very many topics in depth.",
    "Yes, to a fair extent.",
    "I'm not sure yet what I learned",
    "Yes, indeed.",
    "Yes. Could have been tied together through a stronger framework, though.",
    "I had high expectations for this course to really get me thinking about including people in science, and science into people places but the course fell very short of this expectation. The material was covered too quickly and there was too much unnecessary information that never came up again and did not contribute to my knowledge of the subject. Alex is the only person pursuing this type of work but the whole class was conceptual when having him as a resource should have been the perfect opportunity to really showcase this burgeoning field! This class has high potential but it needs a lot of adjusting to make it great& a course that I would recommend.",
    "Not really. I feel like I have been exposed to some good information, but it didn't sink in too effectively because of the reasons described above.",
    "yes",
    "Yes and non. More depth would be appreciated and more focus on specific case studies and application of theory would have been beneficial.",
    "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Felson's experience and honest, open teaching style.He is very approachable and creates a very safe, interractive teaching environment.",
    "Yes, I got a broad scope of the topic",
    "yes. i got a lot out of the material and the discussions and am happy i took the class. i only feel there's room to improve. this was the prototype, and i'm sure it will.",
    "No.",
    "yes. it was awesome. things I never even thought of. could have gone DEEPER though. I didn't really develop skills as much of awareness of schools of thought, which is useful....but how to deepen?"

   "question_text": "If yes, what were the advantages and disadvantages of the group work?",
   "comments": [
    "The group work on the final project was very helpful, as an effort was made to bring together students from a variety of backgrounds to work on a single issue. This mirrors the professional environment of people working in the field of urban ecology.",
    "It was interesting working with students from the FE&S. The biggest advantage was looking at design issues through the lens of ecology and the ecological sciences.The disadvantage was the logistical challenge of coordinating group work between the YSOA and FE&S\/ UEDLAB, mostly in terms of distance and schedules.",
    "Working in a group for the final assignment was invaluable to offering a variety of perspectives on an urban issue we wished to solve. I enjoyed learning about the design and policy aspects, related to my scientific background. It was extremely beneficial to have an interdisciplinary team work to solve our complex urban issue, and I am thankful to have been exposed to the design and policy work involved in managing resources, in conjunction with the scientific knowledge that I contributed.",
    "The class was about interdisciplinary collaboration, so this was an important chance to see how these dynamics work in practice.",
    "Being put in to groups where everyone had a different strength made for a more cohesive project.",
    "Good to pool knowledge, not so cool when some people don't put in as much effort as you would hope.",
    "Advantages - exposure to interdisciplinary work, a theme of the course, and getting to know a couple of other students, finding out what they are working on, and what their skills are.disadvantages - coming at the project from different perspectives and with different expectations was a little tough. and different group members expected different things from each other, based on stereotypes of the disciplines. good lessons to learn about working with each other.",
    "Group project at the end was really great. Wish we had more time throughout the semester to build on this.",
    "With a class this diverse, it would have been a lost opportunity to not have group work. The project was unfortunately too short, but at least we got a taste of how differently each of our fields communicates and thinks about environmental problems.",
    "The mixed work groups were VERY beneficial. Combining the architecture and FES students was an amazing experience.",
    "I loved working in a group. I learned a lot from my teammates and enjoyed the experience.",
    "my groups were truly remarkable. there were no drawbacks (for once). as faras advantages, i learned so much from the different positions they brought. i felt a great sense of accomplishment to have conceptualized and designed the projects we did.",
    "Group work was challenging but great experience because we were forced to collaborate with classmates having a variety of backgrounds and skills.",
    "It was a very good collaborative interdisciplinary effort. Assignment #3 was my favorite assignment of the semester because this most simulates how urban ecology is (or should be) since it is a truly interdisciplinary practice.",
    "We thought we were on the same page but one member submitted dissapointing work for the final deliverable.",
    "The group work assignment 3 went very well- having a variety of backgrounds (architecture, ecology, etc) was very beneficial to our final product and embodied the collaborative ethos of the whole course. I genuinely thought that the scientific content was stronger due to the forestry students, but the graphic presentation benefitted immensely from the architects.",
    "My group project turned out great in the end, and i liked the format of social scientist, natural scientist, and designer. unfortunately my group really didn't give a shit \/ slash were too busy to work on until the last minute, which bummed me out. the project came out great though considering this relative lack of engagement from them.",
    "Mix of designers and scientists on teams was very useful. Enabled hands-on learning of a different style of project work."

   "comments": [
    "I would advise them to keep pace with the engaging reading material, and work on projects related to their passions, which was extremely fun to get to do!",
    "Find out if the syllabus has changed since this semester and become more concrete and actually 'applied' before taking it. Alex has a lot to offer but his knowledge and background were underutilized.",
    "Check the syllabus to be sure it has enough design and application opportunities for you. If you want to be an academic or PhD track, that might not be an issue, but if you seek professional skills applying the theory to the real world, double check that the class will deliver that.",
    "know what you want to get out of it, and work with that in mind from the beginning. apply it to a particular project, if you have one, from the start.",
    "One of a kind course at FES that will undoubtedly improve with additional iterations.",
    "I would tell them to take it. It was a new course, and Alex Felson is extremely responsive to student feedback. I feel that my issues with the course will be resolved by the time it's offered again.",
    "Try to get through the readings. There is a long list of literature, but it is all worth while and applies to the lectures very closely.",
    "Very broad scope on urban ecology with many visiting lectures and interesting assignments.",
    "take it. read the material regularly. participate and shape discussions. be sure to find great small groups.",
    "This is not necessarily an applied course. Instead, it is very theoretical. Unless you are extremely interested in city planning theories this may fall short of your expectations.",
    "Do the readings and comment in class",
    "keep up with the reading!",
    "do the reading, even its ifs just glancing at each of the abstracts.use it as an opportunity to really dig into what you are interested.hold the teachers to logistics and field trips ahead of time. provide lots of input and feedback."
