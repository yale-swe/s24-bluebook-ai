    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because it's a great class taught by an even greater professor and you learn so much about medieval art during this class.",
    "Yes definitely take it. This is not easy material though.",
    "An in depth view of images of the body and changing perspectives towards the body during the middle ages. You look at a wide variety of images, from religious to medical, and delve into what people were thinking about flesh and the human body at the time. The religious images often prove the most fascinating - medieval culture had amazing beliefs \/ understandings of the body and what it was that were simultaneously scientific and religious and totally weird. I would highly recommend this class to another student, particularly if they're interested in art, medicine or religion. It's an incredible body of material and set of images, many of which I probably would never have come across had I not taken this course - Professor Jung has a great collection and access to some really unique materials.I would advise you to shop the class before you commit to it - some of the readings are appropriately hefty (though INCREDIBLE, seriously, read them - my favorite readings I've ever been assigned) and the classes are sometimes a bit dry. Professor Jung is still falling into her rhythm as a seminar leader. But I would absolutely recommend it. Not too much work, not to little, really quite a pleasure to participate in."
