   "comments": [
    "This is a fun, relatively easy course and a good way to keep using your Italian.",
    "Excellent course, great one to apply towards the major.",
    "So much fun, not an unbearable amount of work (admittedly, the midterm project was a bit ridiculous), but all in all, very fun. Michael is great, and usually the other italian students are a fun bunch, so you should definitely take it.",
    "Maybe. It was nice to keep up my Italian, and we read some interesting things, but I'm not sure I would recommend it, because the curriculum was scattered, and the workload was sort of sporadic.",
    "The class was a lot of work, but Michael's a really flexible, understanding instructor. Don't expect to be able to slack off, but expect to learn a lot and to talk about really old literature.Seriously, though, it's a foundation that's extremely useful for future Italian studies, and one that's rarely taught in a classroom setting. I would recommend the class.",
    "Ital 151 is a really interesting course. We did a lot of translating of old Italian and learned about different forms of Italian literature. Michael Farina is a great professor and he makes the course interesting and engaging. If you haven't already taken a class with Michael, take this course! It is fun, the work load is very manageable, you learn a lot, and you can get your name in print with an official translation.",
    "a fun way to practice italian",
    "For students looking to keep their language skills sharp before they try a literature course in Italian, this is the course for you. It can be very fun. That said, the point of the exercises (sometimes monotonous or un-fun) is solely to reinforce language skills. I think a student who goes into this class with the right expectations will have a fine time.",
    "Interesting readings of medieval italian literature. Too much emphasis on reading and translating, but a good entry to the world of \"real\" italian literature."
