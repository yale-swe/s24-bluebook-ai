    "LING 224 is a very interesting class. Not much Linguistics is covered in the class, it is mostly mathematical theory and proof. However, the material is very fascinating. The class is incredibly challenging, particularly if you do not have much background in mathematics. Frank is incredibly helpful and supportive as a teacher.",
    "Challenging but very interesting. I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you have any interest in math, computer science, or linguistics. You'll learn some really cool and useful stuff which doesn't normally get talked about that much.",
    "This is a wonderful class if you love math and linguistics and want to see the formalisms that underlie theories about human language. The course is made up of two parts: set theory and automata theory\/grammars. It moves fairly quickly, but if you're a mathy person you should be able to keep up pretty easily. Work with others on the problem sets!",
    "Take this if you're looking for an interesting QR, and you're ready for - not a challenge, per se - a load of work to sieve through.",
    "The first half of the course highlights various mathematical structures of interests to linguists: sets, functions, relations, graphs, trees, groups, etc. with some applications to abstract \"languages.\" The second half of the course is more along the lines of theoretical computer science, in the spirit of some of Chomsky's work: finite state automata, grammars, regular and context-free languages, etc. Coursework takes the form of weekly problem sets, which are fairly manageable. There are take-home midterm and final exams, which can be time-consuming to complete but reasonable in terms of questions asked. No mathematics background is required for the course, but exposure to topics in set theory will certainly assist your ability to internalize definitions and abstractions."
