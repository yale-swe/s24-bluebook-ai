   "comments": [
    "This course started out great and then really took a turn for the worse around week 4-5. Ted needs to give us more study material in the form of practice problems before exams in order for us to really be comfortable with complex material.",
    "I think this class teaches important concepts and is a good foundation for modeling. I think it would be useful to spend more time going over the homework questions or easing us into them more because I felt like sometimes I was lost as to some of the assumptions or needed some clarification on the questions.",
    "Great course to learn about the transmission of disease among population",
    "I really like the class. It's very organized and informative. The labs really helped me understand the concepts learned in class. I'd really love if I could also get a chance to learn how to set up the R codes by myself.",
    "It was a very difficult course. We went through the lectures too quickly without pausing to make sure students grasped concepts. It would be better to take more time on the lectures to make sure that we understand root concepts. Homework was helpful in understanding concepts though.",
    "It will be much better if we can have the answer key for the homework and midterm.",
    "The class was very slow in the beginning and then felt like it got infinitely more complicated after the midterm. I am not sure that an in-class exam would be the best way to evaluate student understanding of the course.",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this course and I learned a lot. I think the course got exponentially more difficult after the midterm, which was unexpected. Perhaps the material could be spaced a little differently, spending less time on some of the early lectures and giving more time for the complex material at the end.",
    "Excellent course, make complicated knowledge much easier to understand",
    "Very useful class, excellently taught.",
    "This is a really interesting course that fundamentally changed the way that I thought about infectious diseases. It's really difficult (particularly after the midterm), but I think it's useful for anyone interested in infectious diseases.",
    "I do not think the lectures prepared us to be able to apply the concepts to different types of homework problems. I would only be able to apply what we learned to the exact same homework problem but not if they were altered in any way. I HATED the class time. It was almost impossible to give full attention to the class that late after a long day of class and work.",
    "The course is excellent in understanding the basics of modeling of infectious diseases.",
    "This course is an amazing introductory course to infectious disease modeling. It builds up nicely from the beginning towards the end. Some concepts can be challenging to grasp, but Dr. Cohen is always willing to take the time to guide us through the thinking process. Some students expressed concerns that the course accelerated quite fast after the spring break. One way to improve this could be done by cutting down the first two intro lectures to one, so there would be more room for the harder topics later in the course. Also, the textbook was only useful at the beginning of the course. It might be useful to assign readings from other textbook (for a more comprehensive, cohesive presentation of the concepts) on host heterogeneity, pathogen heterogeneity, network, and sensitivity and certainty analyses.",
    "It's a lot of work on a weekly basis but you do learn a lot",
    "I think the class is really interesting and provides the basic framework for learning infectious disease modeling. I feel like I learned a lot in the class. However, I do think that the lectures felt rushed. They were unfortunately really late in the evening (most of us had PID II at 8:30 that morning and stay on campus all day) and it was hard to absorb the material. I felt as if even if we hadn't grasped the previous lectures, we always had to charge on into more material. After the first midterm, we stopped going over the homework. Without this review or a hw answer key, it was difficult to learn from our assignments. I can understand how it would be difficult if not impossible for Sara to provide detailed corrections for such large homework packets for that many students, so it is by no means her fault. I would have appreciated a review led by the instructor for the mid-term\/final and to be done with material the week that we have the exam.",
    "Liked it, a lot. Wish there were more opportunities to code in R, though.",
    "This course was a very good introduction to SIR\/infectious disease modeling. Although the learning curve was steep for many in the class, Ted held our hands and walked us through the fundamentals of SIR models. The second half of the class picked up steam quickly and was spent on model manipulations and applications. By the end, everyone seemed to have a good grasp on the basics and a good understanding of the complexities that exist within ID models.",
    "I think this is one of the best-designed classes at YSPH. There is opportunity for both lecture-style instruction as well as hands-on practice. The lab assignments are extremely well planned and are a pleasure to complete. I felt like a really learned a lot from this class, and this was apparent each time I completed one of the assignments and felt a sense of accomplishment. I think the major area of improvement for the course is pacing and support for students. I feel like I had a better handle of the material than a lot of my peers, but I still struggled badly to connect dots on the midterm and final. I felt like the exams were much more difficult than the homework assignments, perhaps because they didn't have as many guiding instructions. My one other suggestion is just to make sure that testing is performed according to the expectations outlined in the syllabus. I had a lot of anxiety going into the final exam without having seen the equation sheet beforehand as was expected. This uncertainty, combined with a lack of practice exams, made studying for the exams very difficult.",
    "The class was great! I really enjoyed it and I learned so much! The biggest suggestion I have for improvement is to make practice exams or at least a list of what to focus on for the exams as there is a lot of information presented and redoing problems that have already been completed is not always helpful in terms of studying for an exam.",
    "Overall I'd say the class was interesting and in terms of knowing how modeling of infectious diseases worked gave me a greater appreciation for the work epidemiologists do with modeling. I cannot say that I am an expert at modeling now but I do have the basic understanding of how it works, which I am grateful. I did wish that we had learned how to use R rather than just copying and pasting the code that was given. I also would have liked the class to go at a slower pace. The beginning was fine but I felt that as the concepts became more complex I needed more time to have the information sink in, which was not given. I also wished that we had an answer key for our homework assignments and midterm. While I understand that by not having answer keys it creates an incentive to seek help from the teaching fellow and the professor, the office hours were not very convenient and also with a packed schedule during first year, it is difficult to make office hours and even make appointments to meet.",
    "I believe the information presented was good, however stronger feedback and review of homework would have provided a better foundation on the steps where the student was going wrong. Perhaps more intuitive walk through of a question as an example would help. (narrated thinking?)",
    "I think the subject is really interesting and that material we were exposed to was really insightful. Having a background in transmission dynamics is an area that many professionals are looking for. I will say that although the subject was great, a lot could use improvement. I felt that the assessments were often really abstract and it was difficult to see whether one really knew the material. The homework was great, but feedback was inconsistent and answers were never clear. We had to really on peer consensus as to what was an adequate answer. Professor and TA lacked communication and trust. Professor did not believe in answer keys for homework and TA seemed lost with respect to which information should be communicated to students. The course fell short with regard to my expectations and needs a lot of work. Perhaps, instead of a lab day, it would be beneficial to have two instruction days a week and a discussion section. or even 1 day for instruction and 1 day for a discussion section. The labs were ineffective and if a lab were to be kept, it should be done in a computer lab where tech issues won't slow the class down."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Ted is brilliant, and it is clear that he wants us to learn the course material.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0I think the professor's knowledge of the topic was good, but I often felt like he assumed that we knew more than we did, especially when it came to homework. I think it would have been helpful if we didn't have to rely on the TF as much to explain things and rather had things explained by the professor. Sara was rather competent, but I think there were one or two times when direct review from Dr. Cohen would have been more useful. Overall, I think Dr. Cohen did a good job of revising the course based on feedback from the previous year and I think he did a good job with the course. Thank you.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Excellent instructor who gave feedback in time.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0One of the smartest people out there--very intelligent person. However, he could be more methodical in his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Ted does an excellent job making sure all the students are engaged in the class and explaining the material very clearly.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Excellent professor",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Excellent Professor. Very knowledgeable, cared about students' understanding of course material a lot.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0I really appreciated Ted's teaching this semester. I think these concepts are really difficult, and he did a good job trying to build them from the ground up. Everything about the class was difficult, but I think that's because I had no prior experience with any of it. I appreciated that Ted was willing to go over questions and repeat himself multiple times and listen to student feedback.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Dr. Cohen was great in that he definitely kept the class engaged and motivated to participate. It was a nice gesture that he learned all of our names within the first couple classes which encouraged me to speak up in class. It is very clear that he is a brilliant man, however I do not think he explained certain concepts very well as they got more complicated. He was not very articulate when explaining more complex things in class and perhaps that was due to the fact that something very intuitive to him is not as intuitive to us.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0I love Tex. He's very patient and caring about the students. I love how he present his lecture.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Ted is sharp, encouraging, and enthusiastic about the material. He learned all of our names within the first few weeks. He is passionate about ID modeling and often incorporates his own work. He encourages people to speak in class even if by cold calling However I think he could be more clear about his explanations. Sometimes he doesn't finish his thoughts. I think the examples he chose (from literature) were not the best to explain a new concept with. We could have used a lot more feedback and review about assignments to do better on the exams too. It was frustrating to not know if homework was correct or not and to have that be my only study guide.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Informative and passionate about his work.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Dr. Cohen was an encouraging and engaging professor. He valued class participation and inquiry, and he made great efforts to ensure that the class understood the material he was teaching. He tried to make class as interactive as possible, and he was evidently passionate about the course material. He was also available and flexible, and took class feedback into account throughout the course. Dr. Cohen ensured class involvement by cold-calling students, which was necessary given the class format, and he was always very kind and flexible when students were unsure or respond with the wrong answers. However, his kindness was almost to a fault: I found it frustrating when students were blatantly wrong, and Ted would respond with something like \"good, you're on the right track,\" which ultimately confused other class members. Also, I appreciated that Ted wanted to give us as much practice as possible on the material, but the workload was too high given the lack of follow-up resources. For example, we were never provided with answer keys and expected to ask the TA on any of the (very numerous) problems that we didn't get to go over in class, which wasn't always possible or helpful. I feel that future classes would benefit from fewer problems with more review of the given material, or at least solutions so that students could review on their own.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Prof. Cohen is one of the best instructors at YSPH! Really pays attention to classroom pedagogy and not just his slides or notes. I think a lot of students found the course content very intimidating, but Prof. Cohen was aware of this and used many different active-learning exercises and group brainstorming activities to set everyone at ease. Really remarkable!",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Dr. Cohen is an awesome teacher and really cares about making sure his students understand the concepts and is really helpful when they don't.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0Ted is enthusiastic and passionate about modeling. He truly wants students to learn and understand the concepts. I did feel that sometimes he went through concepts too quickly and did not take the time to thoroughly or slowly explain certain lectures. Overall I think he is an approachable professor and open for questions if students had any.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Cohen \u00a0I think there was a lot of mistrust in students and even towards the TF, that made communication with the class a nightmare. The professor knew the material well, but didn't know how to engage with students. I felt he interacted with students in a terse manner."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. I would say that you need to be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to grasp the concepts, but the information is interesting.",
    "Great course if you are interested in the transmission of infectious disease.",
    "This course really provides me with opportunity to learn transmission of infectious diseases. However, I do think students need some basic knowledge on infectious diseases.",
    "Good course, has some problems that could be worked out such as how to better evaluate student performance.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Learn skills necessary to develop your own transmission dynamic models.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think that it's difficult, but it will challenge you and teach you a lot about infectious diseases as well as modeling generally. Even if you're not that into modeling or think that you can't be, this class will be interesting and enlightening.",
    "This course is overall very helpful in understanding the modeling of infectious diseases. The lecture is easy to understand.",
    "Things speed up after the spring break, so be prepared for that.",
    "Challenging but informative to modeling infectious disease, learned basic ideas behind using differential equations to model various scenarios.",
    "This course is a fundamental and important introduction to epidemiological modeling. It provides a good basis of what models are and how they can be applied in the public health world. In terms of format, there was a good mix of labs and lectures, applications and practice opportunities. I left the course with a much better understanding of modeling than when I came in, and I would absolutely recommend the course to other students. A scheduling comment: other students and I felt it would be helpful for this course to be in the fall, and Ginny's Quant Methods class in the spring, as we felt this course set a nice precedent to Ginny's, and not the other way around. If the scheduling change isn't feasible, it would be helpful if this course sequence was at least advised to students before enrolling.",
    "This course is pretty hard but is so worthwhile. Definitely one of the unique offerings in the department! Prof. Cohen is at the top of his field, and (thankfully) he is also a really great classroom instructor. You will learn a lot about disease modeling over the semester and also gain some practice in R. There are weekly problem sets: these can be real brain-teasers, but they are all really well designed and will make you feel accomplished when you finish them. The exams are quite hard so you will want to make sure you study for them (they may or may not kill your GPA). Otherwise, this is a great course with lots of variety and fun active-learning exercises int eh classroom. Wish there were more classes like this at YSPH!",
    "Yes! This course was awesome",
    "I would recommend it only if you are interested in how modeling works. Overall I would say I had fun collaborating with friends and working through the homework assignments together, feeling lost together, and solving problems together. It is a lot of homework assignments (weekly problem sets with 2 review papers) but I think it is worth it. Again, I would say it's worth it only if you like modeling and math.",
    "I recommend the subject of the course, but perhaps if the course structure and teaching style were different."
