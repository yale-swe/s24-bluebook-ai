    "I loved this course! The creation of a South African persona was a very wonderful way to get more engaged in Zulu culture. I think it is an excellent course syllabus overall. Thisha is wonderful! I have no complaints. She has a fantastic grasp of individualized education, which is excellent for our small group. She helped everyone work on pronunciation, and drilled us on vocab and grammar on a regular basis. I feel bad for not adhering to the \"zulu only for the first 15 minutes\" rule, which I think was an excellent attempt at creating an immersive experience that I Just wasn't ready for.",
    "Zulu L2 is a great space to learn to learn to communicate in a different language without the usual stress of most language classes at Yale. I learned a lot. The exercises or projects we had as homework improved my skills and it was not just homework because homework needed to be given. The Professor is kind and approachable, and we learn a lot about both past and contemporary South African societies."
