    "Don't have a choice in taking it, but overall it isn't bad at all. Just put in the effort and you should get a good grade.",
    "Professor Papademetris is wonderful at critiquing student work in a very constructive manner, so go to him if you have any questions on your final paper. He'll happily walk you through exactly what you need to change and help you be a better scientific writer. The course itself is a series of guest lectures--most will be on imaging, but it's fairly enjoyable. There are two short papers on these guest lectures, a group presentation (short paper on this too), and a final paper which is broken down into manageable steps. Aside from the timeslot, this class is really not too bad for a required class.",
    "Listen to two guest lectures every week, write 3 2-page papers and 1 5-page \"postdoc fellowship proposal\", and practice presentation skills. I found the class helpful in improving my scientific writing and presenting skills, and most of the lectures were interesting. The two hour class does get rather tiring, especially as it's at the end of the day.",
    "Well, you have to take it... The course itself is essentially a lot of ungraded (but mandatory) assignments starting with powerpoint presentations and including submitting questions for presenters and writing rough drafts of papers. All in all these are worthwhile exercises, but it's a shame that none of it factors into your grade, and instead, 60% of your grade is based on TA evaluations of 2-page (read, 4 pages formatted to squeeze into 2 pages) papers, and 40% is based on a final paper evaluated by the professor. Needless to say, these assessments can be somewhat arbitrary. The bulk of the class consists of watching BME professors present their research, which can sometimes be informative and interesting and other times dull and perfunctory. It would have been nice to see these presentations back in junior year when students are looking for research opportunities. On the other hand, the papers (and final paper especially) favor students who are currently performing research and can write more easily on their own research.",
    "This class is unfortunately required for all BME majors. It's nice to get to see\/meet everyone in the major, but don't underestimate the amount of work. It requires a ton of work to do well on the papers, let alone to write them at all.",
    "You have to take it. Be prepared for boring lectures and lots of work to write your proposal. Professor Papademetris is so nice though and has a great sense of humor.",
    "Assignments felt a bit like busywork at times, though this class is totally doable.",
    "If you're taking this course it is because you are a BME major. Not much more to say. Be prepared to write about science.",
    "If you're taking it, it's a mandatory course. But it's really not that bad. The workload isn't unmanageable, and the final paper actually gives you a chance to propose research of your own. Unfortunately, the lectures can get unnecessarily long, given they are two one-hour lectures back-to-back. But, although the lectures were imaging-heavy, some are very interesting. Although Professor Papademetris doesn't actually lead the classes, given the guest seminar series setup of the class, he's accessible, engaging, and cares about his students.",
    "less of a seminar and more of a guest lecture series; lots of writing",
    "In general, this course was a guest lecture series punctuated by seminar-like meetings outside of class (for presentations, peer reviews, etc.). I enjoyed the material covered in the guest lectures, but it was sometimes difficult to focus for two hours. The peer reviews were also enlightening, and I believe that they helped improve my writing. This course is mandatory for BME majors. Be careful to follow all of the recommendations for formatting and content for the three small papers (60% of the grade) and for the final paper (40% of the grade).",
    "Need to take it for major. It can be more work than expected, but the class is actually quite helpful in building writing and presentation skills",
    "You have to take this class. It's a lot of writing. Have fun. I'm sure you will not. But on the plus side, Prof Papademetris is incredibly kind and understanding. So there's that.",
    "I hated this class. You're probably only taking this class because it's required, but be prepared for it to suck. The grading was arbitrary and there was no feedback given on how to improve your papers (which are 100% of Your grade - everything else is \"negative credit\"). I had papers where nothing would be written in the body of the paper and there would just be a grade with one sentence of notes at the back often just saying \"this paper was short.\" Also, the instructions given were incredibly confusing and said in the most complicated way possible - this class was supposed to teach You how to effectively communicate in presentations and papers, but none of the teaching staff could effectively communicate.",
    "Each week 2 hour-long presentations are given on topics in BME by doctors from the med school, BME professors, etc. Students are provided with reading related to the presentations prior to the presentation dates. 3 or 4 times during the semester each student has to turn in questions for the presenters before their presentations and is required to participate in the question-answer session after each presentation. At the beginning of the semester students put together oral presentations on a topic of their choosing and write a single-spaced 2 page scientific review paper on the topic. 2 other similar papers are written during the semester and a final, longer paper is written at the end of the semester.",
    "Lecture series + Group projects + several short papers."
