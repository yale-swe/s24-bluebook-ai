   "comments": [
    "Literally nothing. I learned some basic neurobio by doing the readings outside of class, but lecture was an abomination and 100% not worth the time. This is easily one of the top three worst classes I've taken at Yale, and that's saying a lot, considering I went through all the terrible introductory courses required for pre-meds. I actually felt like this class diminished my interest in science, and I'm on the MCDB Neurobiology track currently working in a Neurobiology lab, and potentially applying for a masters in Neuroscience. I learned no new skills, and the only insight I gained was how disappointing it was that even in my senior year, I am forced to take classes this poorly taught.",
    "A rigorous appreciation of the molecular, cellular and systems-level mechanisms underlying nervous system function. A fascination toward the evolutionary wonder that is our brains and minds.",
    "This class taught me so much about neurobiology, from the cellular to the systems wide level. Having taken this class, I feel like I have a solid foundation for learning more about clinical neuroscience, psychopharmacology, and other specific interests.",
    "I learned a LOT about the nervous system. Especially those topics that didn't get covered on the exams.",
    "This class is divided into two parts. In the first part, I learned a lot about the electrophysiology of the neuron and the molecular\/electrophysiological ways that action potentials work. This section of the class is about the first third of the course and is taught by Professor Forscher. The last two thirds of the class, taught by Professor Keshishian, still deals largely with the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which different neural signals are sent. I gained a fair amount of specific knowledge about different neural circuits and though these specific examples, I gained a better grasp on the general mechanisms by which the nervous system functions (e.g. disinhibition, spatial and temporal synchronicity, potentiation).",
    "Because I'm interested in the field of neuroscience, this course was extremely valuable to me. I gained a wealth of knowledge on how the human brain works. I hope to use this knowledge in my current research and perhaps even in the future after Yale.",
    "This course taught me how the brain uses electrical activity to generate signals and the properties of this electrophysiology, as well as how different circuits are wired to produce sensations and explain how the brain makes us function. Through learning about specific sensory modalities, I understand the principles of how the brain is wired to produce function from structure.",
    "Basic neuroanatomy and -physiology. Understanding of electrically active cells and circuits in the brain as they relate to functions like memory, learning, visual processing, and motion.",
    "You are presented with a good overview of the central nervous system and some of its mechanisms of action.",
    "Good general overview of neurobiology. Extremely detailed lessons on the visual system and memory systems.",
    "I think I learned the most about the mathematical and chemical principles that are responsible for neuronal function. Before I took this course, I didn't understand the importance of conductance in generating the membrane potential. If you just look at the Nernst equation or the Goldman equation without understanding the underlying assumptions, conductance doesn't show up anywhere. I didn't know about membrane capacitance. Previously, I had a rough, general understanding of how an action potential was created--but in this class, I learned, both qualitatively and quantitatively, how action potentials really work. In the second and third parts of the course, I learned the basics of neuronal circuitry (oscillators, facilitation, potentiation, etc.) and then applied them to understand larger systems in the human nervous system. Several weeks after my final, I recall those basics pretty well, and some of the systems we discussed in great detail (muscle contraction, the visual system, etc.) I don't think I ever really quite sorted out the inner anatomy of the brain, though, which is starting to fade a bit faster.",
    "I developed knowledge about how the nervous system communicates to control all of the voluntary, and many involuntary, processes in the human body.",
    "I was exposed to a huge amount of information about every scale of neurobiology imaginable, and was truly amazed by the field and the complexity of the brain and nervous system. Personally, I realized that I found all of the information interesting, but did not enjoy the first half of the course as much-which was physics\/electricity\/circuit based."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Basically everything about this course is a weakness. The only positive is that the textbook is well-written. Both professors were terrible lecturers and only taught to aural learners, including very few visual aids. The class felt non-linear, even though there was a syllabus, and the exams seemed to reflect very little of the information covered in the course. Improve it by replacing the professors, throwing out the current syllabus, and finding someone who knows how to teach. Also teach the TAs how to grade exams with some kind of rubric instead of just randomly assigning scores on test questions.",
    "A poorly taught class. Needs weekly assessments. Instructors lazily just assign exams. Needs more work to better reinforce material. Also Haig is too technical in his lecturing--hard to understand what he's trying to actually teach us.",
    "I thought that the first part of the course, taught by Prof. Forscher, was very well organized and unified in its theme, starting with the properties of excitable membranes and adding levels of complexity from there. However, once we started talking about more general neural systems, some of this coherence began to fall apart, and it sometimes felt as if we were just flitting from pathway to pathway (vision to motor to somatosensation), with little relation between them.",
    "It can be improved by the professors actually finishing on time. I think out of all the lectures, we only got out on time three times. It was extremely frustrating to see professors disregard our time like that. At least Professor Forscher seemed genuinely apologetic and tried to rush to finish on time. However Professor Haig did not seem to care at all. Clearly some material of the course needs to be cut if the professors can't finish on time in the allotted 50 minutes. Also, their 1 hour exam policy seems like it shouldn't be allowed as the class is only designed for 50 minutes. Many students have classes on main campus right after and I think it's unfair to design an exam longer than the length of class. I think the class could also incorporate low stakes quizzes or something so people have a better idea of how they're performing in the class before the midterms. Also, I think there should be consistency in that practice questions should be provided for section 2 as they were provided for section 1.",
    "can go into relatively good detail, sufficient level of intellectual sophistication",
    "Please give us more practice psets, especially for the second midterm. They would have been really helpful for us to get a feel for the types of questions that would be asked, and get us in the right mindset for how to answer those questions.",
    "It is very dense, and pretty hard. But super informative and very comprehensive. It is perhaps a necessary evil, but the text is a slog.",
    "This class is very poorly taught. There is very little structure to each of the lectures. The material is talked about at a rather high level so you sort of follow the lectures as they go along, but youre really only understanding it at a superficial level. When you go back over the material, you have to teach it to yourself all over again. This could be remedied by the teachers preparing a lesson plan that is well structured. Heres what I mean. At the beginning of each lecture, the instructors would say what general theme theyre going to be talking about, briefly state the 2-4 examples that illustrate this general concept, and then go into each example, one at a time. As theyre explaining each example, they should relate it back to the general theme at the end. This is pretty basic advicethe only reason Im giving it is because coherence was shamefully lacking to the extent that relatively basic concepts appeared opaque. At the end of the last lecture, Professor Keshishian talked about some general concepts that were themes throughout neurobiology. This should be the sort of thing that frames each lecture, not just the whole class. Additionally, a lot of different specific mechanisms related to one another. By relating the specific examples to larger concepts, the professors would make it much easier for students to understand the relationships between the myriad intricate mechanisms. Also, the only grades you get are for exams. THIS SHOULD CHANGE. PLEASE ASSIGN HOMEWORK. I have no idea how this class is curved. The average score on the midterms was around a 67. Im assuming thatll be brought up to a B or B+, so assigning homework may not change the grade you get. But what it will do is give you an idea of the kinds of questions you can expect to get on exams and keep students accountable to the material in the ways the professors want them to be accountable to the material. Without psets, you show up to class, absorb some of the material, study for the test a couple days to a week before the test, not really sure what to focus on, and then you get a test that may or may not have corresponded to what you thought you should know for the test. Its rather stressful and doesnt facilitate the kind of learning or studying that would be optimal for the course. Please please please at psets. It would also give more structure to the course. The strength of the class is that its about a cool subject. Its hard to make neurobiology dull. Oftentimes this class manages to do itThere were times when I was reading the textbook, and I was thinking, Wow, this stuff is really cool! Wait a minutewhy am I not always this excited about neuro? Oh yeah, its because the instruction obfuscates the material to a frustrating extent! You do learn a good amount about the molecular\/cellular level of neurobiology, but its through your own efforts not to fail the exams more than it is through the lectures. And studying is no guarantee of not failing",
    "The material was extremely interesting, and for the most part, the course was pretty well organized. I think there are some possible areas of improvement: -Offering more in-person support for students, such as office hours or review sessions before tests (aside from the \"sections\" held by TAs) -Making it more clear what knowledge we need to have for the test, perhaps by making more problem sets such as for the first unit",
    "The course teaches an immense amount of information which at times can be overwhelming. I thought the discussion sections were effective in reviewing the material from lectures and in going over important concepts.",
    "The course attempts to cover a large amount of material with highly sophisticated, complex details despite having poor organization. While lectures are clear and have engaging content, though they consistently went over time, I would have appreciated ungraded or graded p-sets or practice exams being assigned to help reinforce\/review the material on a weekly basis. The textbook sections assigned for studying each lecture on the syllabus were too long (often +60 pages) to be useful or feasible. Moreover, it would be easier to study for exams if lectures were formatted using power-points or if the lecturers took notes as they were speaking during lecture (particularly in the second session of the course). Though the summary hand-outs were very good for each lecture, there were an insufficient study resource for a difficult class. The addition of problem sets would also help taken some weight from the exams.",
    "The course failed to be structured properly. The second professor taught by mere talking. He rarely provided slides and put notes on the board. The class became about how quickly you could type\/write to write down the words the professor spoke. This isn't a good way to teach students. It would have been nice if the second professor provided practice exams or problem sets like the first professor that make the class more interactive. The first professor also wrote good notes on the board. Overall, I find the material so interesting that I enjoyed the class. However, the class itself has a lot of flaws. It was by the worst class I have taken at Yale with regard to support for students. I recommend the TAs have sections and teach the entire semester as opposed to just one third of the semester. I would also require TAs to actually go to the class.",
    "I thought the grading was harsh and sometimes the test questions were unclear (example: the archery question). Also the one hour tests felt very rushed for the level of detail we were expected to provide.",
    "Yale college students should not be placed in the same course as graduate students. Again, Yale college students SHOULD NOT be placed in the same course as graduate students who have been exposed to numerous neurobiology courses in the past in order to even be accepted into a Yale graduate program. I believe, after speaking to other undergrad students, that our performance and understanding of the material was significantly impacted by the inability to obtain adequate resource to master our first exposure of the material.",
    "I did not feel like the final exam represented the material we learned in the class. I loved the material, and enjoyed engaging with lectures and readings but I felt like there was little preparation available for the exams. It would have been extremely helpful to have problem sets or something similar to balance out grades for the class as well as to provide practice.",
    "This course was very disorganized. Both professors were hard to follow, but specifically the second half of the class was very difficult to follow. It was difficult to grasp the important concepts and figure out how to prepare for exams because few resources were given. The material was super interesting but there really weren't that many outside resources to get help if you need. Some of the TFs were helpful, but the one hour per week section was not enough to re-teach all of the confusing topics from lecture. The averages for the tests were in the 60s, which clearly shows that most of the class did not grasp the material (or that it wasn't taught effectively). This is a very interesting class though. The material was intriguing and I definitely learned a good amount of knowledge about difference parts of neurobiology.",
    "Neurobiology has the potential to be one of the best classes--if not the best class--in MCDB. The lectures were excellent. The professors are incredibly knowledgeable, explain concepts well, and are happy to answer questions after class. This is one of the few courses where the professors still write on the chalkboard, and especially in the first section of the course (with its I-V plots) it really takes the class to another level. Writing on the chalkboard slowed the professors down just enough so that they were easy to follow even as they explained highly technical concepts. Also, it requires a certain depth of knowledge about the subject to be able to draw everything on the blackboard off-the-cuff, without the aid of a PowerPoint. PowerPoints may be, however, a useful tool for some of the later lectures that are less quantitative and have more material to memorize (i.e. everything after oscillators\/facilitation). For example, Prof. Vonhoff's lecture on development was wonderful and made very good use of a PowerPoint presentation. Unfortunately, the excellent lectures were somewhat let down by the absence of supplementary material. The textbook was good, but was no substitute for the lecture material. There were no regular problem sets or quizzes. Only the first midterm had practice problems, while the second midterm and the final did not. The professors did not hold office hours, although they often stayed after class and were available for one-on-one meetings if you sent them an e-mail. Sections were useful, but we had three (or four?) different TAs, with a range of teaching abilities. The lecture handouts were greatly appreciated (and were by far the best available study tool), but could be improved somewhat. For Prof. Forscher's part of the course, the material was well organized, but all of the plots were at the end of the handout, without context, titles, or axis labels. It would be helpful if they were put in context, within the bullet point section of the handout. For Prof. Keshishian's part of the course, the diagrams were all clearly labeled but the material itself was somewhat long and difficult to get through. It might help if everything were in bullet points, as in Prof. Forscher's half of the course. The problem sets provided for the first midterm were a big help, and it would be good to have practice problems for the second midterm and final. I am not sure if you reuse exam problems from year-to-year, but if not, I have always found it helpful to have access to practice problems from previous years' exams. Alternatively, you could assign regular homework, again possibly using problems from past exams, to make sure that students keep up with the material. (Note: In general, I don't think it's a good idea to reuse exam problems, although I do not know of anyone in the class who looked up previous exams. On a similar note, when I looked at the keys I noticed that the second midterm and its make-up were ~80% identical, which is probably not ideal.) Graders in future years should also give more feedback when correcting exams, especially on the second midterm. I received absolutely no written feedback beyond the number of points I had scored on each question. The exam key answers were often very detailed, and when I compared my test to the exam key it was often difficult to figure out exactly where I went wrong, or what crucial piece of information I had left out. I know I've left a lot of suggestions, but I do want to emphasize that the core of the class--the lecture material--was superb, and I have no regrets whatsoever about taking the course.",
    "The course could be improved by adding more resources to understand and practice applying the information. Practice problem sets were provided for the first part of the course, which was helpful. Practice problems for the second part and for the final would have been helpful in knowing how exams would be structured and what material was most important.",
    "The lectures were pretty poorly organized and usually did not parallel the assigned textbook readings. That being said, the material was very interesting and so lectures were still sometimes enjoyable even if it was a struggle to keep up.",
    "The course presents a huge amount of information, which is tough to keep up with. I would definitely recommend some sort of assignments throughout the course to check for understanding and for students to receive feedback. I didn't think it was very fair or a good measure of our understanding that we were only graded on two exams. I also think practice problems should have been presented to allow us to become comfortable answering questions about the material. I found it hard to do well on the exams without knowing if I was understanding things at the level that I should be. Without feedback on that level, I then found it difficult to apply the information to other questions and hypothetical situations such as those presented in exam problems. Overall, I wish the course consisted of more than just lectures to facilitate learning."

    "Absolutely not. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU HATE YOURSELF.

The subject is interesting, but the teaching is the worst I've experienced here. I learned some basic neurobio by doing the readings outside of class, but lecture was an abomination and 100% not worth the time.

    "AAAA. Okay. The course is pretty pointless since it's just \"read a book\" and then \"take tests\". That model of a course, despite its historical predecent, doesn't work well at all. Haig is also not a great lecturer--his lecturing isn't conducive to note-taking efforts. Paul is better here, though. Overall it's a lot of information taught very poorly. Paul Forscher 8\/10. Haig Keshishian 2\/10.",
    "I thought this was a pretty good course, and it will definitely satisfy anyone with a pre-existing interest in neurobiology. However, if you don't have such an interest, I wouldn't expect this course to convince you otherwise.",
    "If you have to take it, there's no way around it. But if you have the option of taking another class, take the other class!",
    "Yes! Go ahead and take it if you think you 1\/ have sufficient background in electrical circuits, biochemical signal transduction pathways, and understanding of genetics\/proteomics; or, 2\/ if you think you are capable of picking up a good understanding of these ideas. You will come out with an elucidation of how systems generate behaviors, mental states and behaviors through properties at various levels.",
    "If you have a strong interest in neuroscience\/neurobiology and are willing to put in a good amount of work\/time then absolutely take this course. The lectures and material are really interesting, and this class lays a solid foundation with which you can understand more nuanced fields of neuroscience. But the tricky part of this course is the vast amounts of information that you're required to understand deeply enough to apply them on the tests (more than just regurgitating your memorized facts onto the paper). This class also has no problem sets to make sure you keep up with the material, so it's all too easy to fall behind. So just make sure you're ready for the time commitment (reviewing course material for 5-6 hours\/week on average, then cramming before the midterms) and the discipline\/motivation to self study the material regularly without psets or deadlines. Highly recommend it though.",
    "Take it if you want to learn, but consider Cr\/D to start. You may not be as prepared as you suspect.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Neurobiology is one of the most fascinating areas of study. This course manages to make it terribly tedious and frustrating. On the plus side, you do learn a good amount about the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind neural activity. Which is cool when you step back or are applying this knowledge to other areas in biology. There are some experiments that are discussed that relate to behavior, but most of the studies look at molecular and cellular workings. You get a decent amount of knowledge about specific circuits and general trends, but most of that knowledge is gained not through lecture but through studying really hard for the exams so you dont fail them. There are no grades besides psets, so you neither know how youre doing in the class nor what exactly you should be studying. For the last 2\/3 of the course, this basically means memorizing everything that was in lecture. The lectures themselves lack basic organization, and the teachers assume a high level of knowledge. Professor Keshishian never invites questions during lectures, so often material is discussed and most of the students dont really absorb the information beyond a superficial comprehension. If you study hard in this class, you shouldnt do too bad. I think. No way to know until you get your final score. If youre looking for an in-depth, molecular\/cellular understanding of representative elements of the nervous system and youre willing to put up with appalling instruction, youll get something out of this course. If youre not required to take it, Id suggest choosing another class. In retrospect, I gained a fair amount of information, but I wouldnt want to go through this course again.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in the subject. You will definitely learn a ton.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested and committed to learning about the biology and electrophysiology behind the nervous system. The course requires consistent dedication to review lecture notes and the discussion sections are helpful in reviewing material from class. The material is interesting but also challenging at times. Having a good physics background would be helpful for the first part of the class.",
    "Yale offers no other options for learning neurobiology, so interested students must take this course. However, be prepared for difficult exams and disorganization. The course requires considerable study time. Even as a student committed to pursuing graduate programs in neuroscience and working in a neuroscience lab, I was frustrated. However, lectures are engaging, enjoyable, and rigorous.",
    "If you are considering a future in neuroscience or are strongly interested then yes, take the course, but otherwise don't kill yourself with the workload, stress, and worry that comes with this course.",
    "Until Yale decides to separate this course into one course strictly for undergraduates and one course for graduate students, I would not recommend taking this course for a letter grade. There were absolutely no additional resources for undergraduates whose first exposure into the field of neurobiology was probably this course. The grad students were very evidently favored. The material was incredibly interesting, however, and it was probably one of the most intellectually rewarding courses I have taken based on the sheer amount of material covered.",
    "If you are interested in learning about neurobiology then absolutely take this class. However, be warned that it is EXTREMELY difficult. Do not get behind in textbook reading and take every chance you can to speak with the professors. The exams were very challenging and there were no other assignments for the course.",
    "If you don't have to take this class, don't! Take a neuroscience class in the psych department. Many of them are much more organized. If you have to take this for MCDB neuro, it's not too bad but be prepared to do most of the learning on your own and go into tests having no idea what the structure will be...",
    "Neurobiology is a pretty good course - the material is fascinating, and well-taught. The lectures are excellent. Prof. Forscher and Prof. Keshishian both have different teaching styles (Prof. Forscher is more energetic while Prof. Keshishian is a little more reserved) but they're both very nice people who are passionate and extremely knowledgable about the subject. There was also one supplementary lecture by Prof. Vonhoff, who also did an excellent job. The first part of this class is very quantitative, focusing on electrophysiology. It involves a lot of math and physics, and partially because I like math and physics, was probably my favorite part of the course. If you've taken physics before and remember some RC circuits (i.e. V = IR, C = Q\/V, I = dQ\/dt, resistors, and capacitors) you should be completely fine. If not, you might have to do a little extra work at the beginning, but I've heard that the textbook has some good material and I'm sure Prof. Forscher will be happy to help you out. If you took intro bio or cell bio and you feel like you didn't fully understand action potentials, you will after you take this course. The second part of the course, taught by Prof. Keshishian, applies the stuff you learned in electrophysiology to study various neurological systems. Again, the lectures are quite good, although they become a little more focused on memorization. This is more like a typical biology course, and you don't need so much math and physics. The one issue with this class is that beyond the lectures, there isn't much else. Your entire grade depends on two midterms and a final. Although the material is difficult, this class isn't much actual work, since there is no homework. However, you MUST go to class, because there are no slides (the professors write on the chalkboard for the most part), no homework, few practice problems, and the textbook definitely doesn't cover anything. Go to class and pay attention while you're there. There is a section once a week, which is your best chance to review the material. Try to keep up with everything because the exams are quite hard and you can't just learn the material two days before the test. Also, I strongly recommend taking the lab at the same time. It really strengthened my understanding of the class material and gave me an opportunity to apply my knowledge outside of class. Prof. Keshishian teaches the lab as well, so it's a good opportunity to ask him questions.",
    "It's a difficult course with a lot of material covered quickly, but you leave learning a lot.",
    "Only if you're willing to put in the work. Cramming for exams doesn't cut it for this course - you need to study as you go, well ahead of time, and get help right away if necessary.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is willing to put in a lot of time to fully understanding the material. You cover a huge amount of material in this class, but it is interesting to learn, so take this course if you are prepared to commit to it all.",
    "As much as I enjoy this subject and the material, this course felt like too much information, presented too quickly, without a means of learning it well, so I would not highly recommend it. The professors also said you could take it without taking physics at Yale, but I would not necessarily recommend that."
