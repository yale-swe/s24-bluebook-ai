    "If you want to learn how to translate and practice doing translations this is the class for you, low workload but great at learning a skill that only improves with practice.",
    "It was really good, and the conversations were really interesting, but it was definitely a bit disorganized. The constantly changing syllabus allowed us to talk about the aspects of translation that interested us as we encountered them. That worked well for most of the semester, but the reading week confusion over whether or not a term paper was assigned (she never mentioned it in class and then told us to write one the Tuesday of reading week) was upsetting and a bit overwhelming. Clarity is important, and there was just no clarity in this class. However, the class itself was interesting."
