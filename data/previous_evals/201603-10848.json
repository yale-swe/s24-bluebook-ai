    "I learned how to effectively digest long readings in short periods of time, conduct research for a long paper, and hold myself responsible for doing my assignments.",
    "Learned a ton about the history of Haiti and why it struggles today.",
    "I learned how to write a research paper.",
    "This course helped me improve my research skills.",
    "I developed my writing skills, and learned how to lead a class discussion.",
    "I developed my writing skills and learned a lot about Haiti, especially sustainable development in small island states.",
    "We learned about the history of Hait, its culture, and a little about its government and politics. All of this information we tied back to how Haiti was developing and what improvements could be done with NGOs help.",
    "I have much better research skills after taking this class. I especially gained an understanding of the resources available to me as a Yale student when completing independent research projects and I now feel comfortable navigating the library systems on my own.",
    "I learned a great deal about development and life in Haiti, and expanded my worldview on the development of other nations.",
    "I learned a lot about Haiti and the struggles it faces caused by its government and the government of foreign powers. This course helped me to improve my public speaking skills."

   "comments": [
    "Having classes more run by Professor Geballe would strengthen this course.",
    "I wish there had been somewhat of a lecture component from the professor.",
    "The name of the course is misleading because rarely did discussions actually focus on sustainability. The class is really a Haitian history and culture class that touches tangentially on sustainability and the beginning of the semester. I wish discussions had related more to actual developmental policy, although I did enjoy learning about Haiti's history, because that is what I had expected from the class. The course could be improved with a name change in order to avoid this sense of false advertising. I do think, however, that the course does a good job exposing freshman to the process of academic inquiry and research.",
    "I would have liked for Prof. Geballe to have led more of the classes. It would have been great to learn a little bit more from him.",
    "The course's strength was its focus, since sustainable development is very important, and the small seminar setup since that allowed for lots of interaction.",
    "I wish that the professor had taken a more active role in facilitating discussions. I think that some amount of student-initiated discussion is useful, but I would have liked to have a little more direction fro the professor, since I found that the productivity of class meetings varied widely depending on which students were responsible for facilitating the discussion.",
    "I thought this course was well planned and had very few weaknesses.",
    "I think everything in this course ran smoothly."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course, it was one of my favorite classes this semester. I enjoyed how the class revolved mostly around student lead discussions as it was interesting to learn what classmates thought about each day's topic. The content is very interesting and is very broad, covering sustainability\/history\/NGO's\/natural disasters\/politics\/culture and more.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student only if they were willing to hold themselves accountable for completing reading assignments.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot through writing the final paper.",
    "How the course is largely depends on the people in your class. For each class, we had a discussion leader and a set of readings (never very heavy) preselected by Professor Geballe. A few people consistently did the readings and had interesting discussion, but most of the class seemed unengaged.",
    "I am hesitant to recommend this course to another student simply because the majority of the semester, up until the final research paper, was unfulfilling. The assigned readings seem rather arbitrary, and the syllabus has not been properly updated to include more relevant issues in Haiti. Additionally, the class does not really cover sustainable development. However, the class might be worth taking if a student is interested in learning about Haitian history and wants to improve his ability to produce scholarly research. The final paper, although intensive, certainly helped me produce important academic work at the start of my Yale career. I also think Professor Geballe is a strong reason to consider this class. He is a genuinely caring instructor who wants to help students improve their academic writing technique.",
    "Yes professor Geballe is amazing",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, definitely. The workload was very doable, especially if you don't leave the few papers to the last minute and the class environment was very enjoyable.",
    "This course is very very interesting and is a good introduction of you are looking into Caribbean studies or are intrigued by the region in general.",
    "Yes. This class was a great way to learn all about Haiti and to also develop your discussion and writing skills. Professor Geballe is one of the nicest people I have met so far at Yale, which makes coming to class each day enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I not only have a better understanding of Haiti, but my worldview has been broadened in a wider sense. I value many of the discussions that took place throughout the semester and I especially enjoyed listening to the thoughts of my fellow students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot about Haiti and enjoyed the class.",
    "Yes! This course was excellent! Students ran discussion and were able to speak to one another and our research paper could be on any topic that interested us."
