   "comments": [
    "ECON 122 with Michael Peters (MP) was an extension of the introductory macroeconomics narrative, complete with German-accented narrator. This class is accompanied by a below-average amount of work, easy-to-average difficulty tests, and interesting sections. MP is a very articulate and competent economics professor, and don't let previous reviews tell you otherwise. He spends a lot of time making picture perfect slides, and he connects the dots of macroeconomic theory nicely. We read a conversational textbook by Charles Jones, but even so the main lessons were valuable. You learn basic macroeconomic growth models (Solow and Romer), production models, inflation theory, the IS-MP and AS-AD frameworks, basic monetary policy theory, some tidbits about business cycles and economic history, and finally theories of consumption, investment, and international trade. MP was great throughout it all.",
    "dont take it with Peters",
    "A discussion about the economics of the US and the world, with a tiny bit of math thrown in there.",
    "Interesting course that more non-Econ majors should take, especially with Peters.",
    "Great class. Intermediate lecture classes can be rough, but Peters does a great job of making it enjoyable and also making sure you learn a lot. I would highly highly recommend taking intermediate macro (or anything else) with him.",
    "Yes, this is so much better than intermediate micro. Prof Peters is amazing and he really cares about being there for his students. It's not just cut and dry theory, but he ties it to relevant macro issues happening every day. The material can be hard if you do not get the models from the beginning since they build up, so make sure to learn them as they come.",
    "For most students in this class -- taking Intermediate Macro is a requirement. However, I really found the class to be much more than simply checking off a box to complete a major. Professor Peters is wonderful. His lectures are engaging, and his problem sets and exams are actually interesting to work through! The TAs were a great resource for this course, and really helped me understand the material when I was having trouble.",
    "This course covers Intro Macro concepts in detail using math. The problem sets are manageable if you start them early. Keep up with lecture and the textbook and study early for the exams.",
    "Take this course!",
    "More than likely, if you're in this course, you're an economics major and you have to take it. That being said, Michael Peters was a good professor. With 10 psets, a midterm, and a final, the course is not too bad of a workload, although with the final worth 50% of the final grade, it's tough to ever know where you really stand in the course. If you find yourself having to take this course, take it with Michael Peters.",
    "Different from other core Econ courses in that you actually learn a LOT about how the world works. Lectures are clear and organized, and the frameworks you study provide really useful context for understanding global events. Peters is a very clear lecturer and a very nice man too. His exams can tend to be pretty difficult but study hard, ask questions, try and absorb as much as possible, and you will be okay.",
    "the material is sometimes dull, but Michael Peters made it an interesting\/not boring class! Take it with Michael Peters!!",
    "I understand that the course may have some unfavorable reviews from when it was last taught in the fall. However, having taken this course (and having shopped many of Prof. Nordhaus' lectures last spring), I do not believe one is at a disadvantage in taking the course with Peters, and one may even be at an advantage for doing so (it seems that most of those concerns were logistical and have since been addressed). Prof. Peters is approachable and fairly engaging in lecture, though has the tendency to digress into current events for much of class time, and the accompanying lecture slides are very detailed and helpful if one needs to skip a lecture or two. Problem sets are definitely quantitative, but are nowhere near Intermediate Micro in terms of difficulty (the computation is fairly straightforward, though intuition can be tricky). They are graded check-check plus, so ultimately most weight goes on the midterm on the final. These are of moderate difficulty (the hardest are the true-false questions on exams), but the curves appear reasonable. If you go to sections, go to Fabian's if he is still a TF for the course, as he was generally fairly helpful. Overall, Intermediate Macro with Prof. Peters is a good course in the econ core sequence that one should consider taking over the spring version.",
    "Necessary for the major. Very boring. Go to class if you want to get that grade. To know if you are interested in the content look at the book, it covers the same stuff.",
    "I would recommend the class to people considering Econ and whoever is interested in understanding more deeply the field of Macroeconomics and its applications.",
    "Good class that covers the main topics of intro macro with a bit more depth.",
    "ECON 122 is interesting and provides a foundation for a better understanding of the macroeconomic trends that we read about in the news. Through this class, students will begin to develop an economics way of thinking that allows them to gain significantly more than a superficial look at a country's federal reserve decisions, international trade, and much more.",
    "Yes!",
    "It is a course you must take for the major but be prepared for a lot of algebra.",
    "Good course, definitely important as a major requirement",
    "Most Econ majors have to take it, and it is valuable in the long run, since the material itself is quite applicable. But the lectures are slow and long and the exams are extremely challenging - and there is fair warning for that. It ended up being a hard course and I don't know how I could've done it differently.",
    "Necessary course to learn if you are interested in econ.",
    "Intermediate macro is a more mathematical and advanced approach to the topics studied in introductory macro. The model-building approach is very useful and the real life applications provided complement the class material very well. Professor Peters is a very clear lecturer and he draws examples of real policies, economic principles and finance applications from real life. I am glad that I continued my economics studies into the intermediate level, because economic model-building can be applied to many areas in our lives.",
    "It's quite interesting and classes are helpful to understanding how theories work in real life scenarios.",
    "intermediate macroeconomics course",
    "It was not my favorite of the core classes and the grading was very hard. However, the actual material had interesting applications as could be seen in the problem sets.",
    "It's a good course that I thoroughly enjoyed, most likely because I really enjoyed Prof Peters' lectures. It's a bit nit-picky in the sense that it was hard to answer short questions precisely the way that was apparently wanted and if whatever you said gave any indication in the least that maybe there is something else, not related to the question except through also being subject to macroeconomics, that you might have misunderstood, you got points taken off - quite frustrating. I really feel like I've learnt a lot though!",
    "would recommend",
    "Its an ECON major requirement, grind through it and move on."
