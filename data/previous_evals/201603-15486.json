    "Having no prior biology lab experience, this course was great. Learned basic lab skills as well as how science is actually conducted. Unlike other lab courses, we didn't just follow a list of instructions, we got to actually understand how things worked and why we were doing different procedures.",
    "I learned to a degree how to make a hypothesis, test it, show the data in a compelling way and then I also learned a lot about bacteriophage and how that field operates.",
    "I gained valuable experience, as well as experience in experimental design (particularly related to evolutionary experiments). I also learned a good bit about viruses themselves."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very good overall, switching to a twice a week, 1 credit lab\/lecture combo will be a good idea.",
    "I think for a new class this class did a good job at teaching us enough background on phage and phage experimental techniques so that we could then do a project on the phage. The professors and TF definitely put a ton of time into making our projects work out, which was nice. The weakness is that it is definitely as much work as a full credit, and the expectations were sometimes unclear. At times the pre-lab lecture went on a little too long and then we had to stay late or come in the next day to finish lab work which was at times stressful. Overall it was a good course, though.",
    "Strengths: teacher commitment\/patience, student involvement in all aspects allows for a lot of learning, really interesting Weaknesses: only 0.5 credits for a lot of work, schedule a little rushed at times (but probably mostly because first instance of course)"

    "Take this course!! Having no prior biology lab experience, this course was great. Learned basic lab skills as well as how science is actually conducted. Unlike other lab courses, we didn't just follow a list of instructions, we got to actually understand how things worked and why we were doing different procedures. No busywork unlike other labs, every assignment you do has a reason behind it. Plus viruses are really cool!",
    "I would definitely recommend it if a student wants to get involved in ecology research. It's a great introduction to the steps of scientific method and definitely a relevant subject. At times, though, it seemed to require some previous knowledge (e.g. how to do a lab report and what to include) that I think you should watch out for.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about lab procedure, experimental design, evolution, and viruses. I would warn that it involves a fair amount of work for only half a credit. But then again, I hear that is frequently the case with lab classes."
