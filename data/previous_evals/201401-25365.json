    "I would recommend the course, yes, but find a good book beforehand. I went through Stein and Shakarchi's book and did the exercises, which was good for the first half of the course, but really no further. Try, maybe, Hermandez and Weiss's intro to wavelets. In the end the raw utility of wavelet theory in modern applied mathematics is astounding and taking the course is worth it for realizing that alone."
