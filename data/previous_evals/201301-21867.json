    "Great course but be prepared to spend everyday working on your workbook and weekly compositions",
    "The French department here is not fun at all. The teachers are nice and class can be enjoyable, but you stumble through the weeks without much of an idea of what's actually going on. I did not enjoy my time in French.",
    "About the same amount of work as 110, which is a lot. There are about 20 exercises in the workbook each day, compositions every week, and vocab from the video that you have to know for the test. It's a lot of work, but a great class. Definitely worth it.",
    "daily homework, weekly exams on monday nights.",
    "French 120 is a continuation of French 110; the material of 120 is the material of 110 but more in depth. More nuances are explained and other tenses are taught. A lot of material is covered and sometimes things are not taught to the depth they should be but everything is gone over. This course is heavy on the oral speaking and it helps in terms of teaching the language. Foss was a good instructor. He is very approachable and friendly. He goes the extra mile to show his class some interesting things about France or the French language. He is enthusiastic and knows the material well. He sometimes doesn't teach enough to the test but still he does plenty to help students learn the language.",
    "Colin is really helpful and I really enjoyed his section. He is very helpful and teaches very well",
    "Take it. Work needs to be consistent, but that is necessarily true for any language class that does its job. The TAs are really nice.",
    "I recommend French if you actually care to learn it. It is a lot of work."
