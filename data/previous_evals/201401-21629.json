   "comments": [
    "You learn simultaneously ethnographic theories and apply them to empirical cases of political life. I really enjoyed it but felt like we got a little too theoretical towards the end of the class.",
    "Not great, I wouldn't recommend.",
    "The theoretical readings were very difficult to interpret on your own. Professor Mahler was very nice. But sometimes, I felt like it was a lot of him telling us what the theorists meant, rather than us having good discussions about the text. I think I understand the nature of political life a lot more. The midterm and final papers were very challenging and confusing.",
    "The class was interesting! I had never taken anything in Ethnography before. Professor Mahler was a really nice guy. The empirical readings (autobiographies, biographies) were all really interesting. The theoretical readings were pretty rough and hard to understand. Way too dense. Six papers, a midterm, and a final so eight papers in total. The midterm essay question was really vague and sort of hard to answer. Class discussion was hard to follow a lot of the time.",
    "A meh political science seminar.",
    "This course was amazing. It gave me a real insight into the lives of politicians and really expanded my own views about politics. I would definitely recommend this class to a student who is interested in politics and would like greater insight into how political actors make decisions. I used this course as a Research Design credit for Global Affairs, but would recommend the class to anyone interested in politics. Professor Mahler is very knowledgable about the subject (he worked on a bunch of campaigns himself) and is passionate about the material.",
    "Yes, if you know what you're getting yourself into. You cannot take other reading heavy classes, this class takes a lot of time To do the reading, not to mention to understand it. But the subject Matter is highly interesting.",
    "Not strongly, no. I used it to filled a GLBL requirement and wouldn't have taken it otherwise. It was pretty chill in terms of the \"research design\" requirement (no clue how it related to that, but whatever) as opposed to more stats-heavy or compsci-based courses that I've heard are pointless\/unnecessarily confusing. But otherwise might look for something else.",
    "The class was alright. Professor Mahler has a habit of talking for most of the seminar, and often gets carried away with his own talking. That being said, he often knows a ton about what he's talking about, and often listening to him talk is better than listening to other students BS their way through the class. It could be improved with more political science readings, and less of a sociology focus, but I'm a political science major, so that might just be me. Professor Mahler was great and had a lot of useful commentary on his readings, but often I didn't understand what was going on in class. I felt like most students in the class didn't understand what was going on, but Professor Mahler didn't realize that and kept going forward. Perhaps with a little more explanation on why each reading was relevant (especially the sociology ones) the students would have been more on the same page."
