   "comments": [
    "Yes - although the course has its disadvantages as detailed above, it does what it set out to achieve. It gives a firm foundation for further study of literature.",
    "A good introduction to the \"urgent works\" of the canon of the Western literature",
    "This class is an introduction to literature in the Western canon from ancient Greece to the Middle Ages. I would recommend this class to anyone, regardless of major. This class gives a good comprehensive overview of important literary works from that time period.",
    "Directed Studies Lit was always my favorite section, probably because it was the most cohesive of the three classes. Professor Moudarres is the best-kept secret of DS: she runs an amazing section, and is VERY fair with her grading. She's incredibly passionate about teaching each and every work, but when you get to Dante, she's absolutely incredible; she makes you fall in love with her and the class. I always looked forward to section (she even brought food towards the end of the semester), and always left class with a million things to think about. If you have the opportunity to take Christiana's section, DO IT.",
    "Yes, if they were aware of the reading workload and intensity of the class.",
    "I would recommend this course. I'd describe it as a seminar course about some of the greatest works in Western literature, up to medieval times. It's fast-paced but very exciting. It's especially useful for tracing greater themes throughout history. I'd recommend this course to someone who likes literature. Note: I think that students who have had some sort of background in classical antiquity, have studied Latin or Greek, and\/or have read some of these works have a distinct advantage, especially considering the fast pace of the course. So I'd recommend this class to someone who has some background in the content.",
    "Lots of work, but you know that--you're doing DS. Yes, I would. It is invaluable to be exposed to all the material that DS covers.",
    "The texts read in this class gave myself and my section the opportunity to explore ideas closest to the heart of the human condition. My classmates and Professor Moudarres and I became very close. The texts read in this class gave us the opportunity to see each into each other's experiences, each other's feelings.",
    "Overview of western literature Homer to Dante. Would recommend yes.",
    "Yes. To anyone interested in literature, it's a valuable survey.",
    "Directed Studies with Christiana Purdy-Moudarres was the highlight of my first semester. You'll learn about literature, about culture, and about yourself through Professor Purdy-Moudarres' tremendous teaching style. She'll lead you through the material with a deft touch, shaping conversations that reach a fervor of intellectual passions and eventually reaching some sort of realization about the nature of the books you'll read. You'll develop a passion for the readings, and really, truly care about the fall of Hector on a visceral level. Take her class. You'll love it and care deeply about the foundations of the West.",
    "Literature was, at least for me, the most well-constructed and engaging of the DS courses. The horror stories about the amount of reading are true, so if you're not comfortable plowing through great books in very short amounts of time, DS might not be for you. For me, though, there was something really satisfying about reading Homer, Virgil and Dante in quick succession. I would've liked the opportunity for deeper analysis, but witnessing the way great authors reacted to each other throughout the history of literature was powerful. I don't quite understand the idea behind reading such small excerpts of the Bible - as a non-religious person, I don't know it very well, and I feel like we didn't read enough to be able to discuss it in a substantive way. Purgatorio and Paradiso weren't given much space in the syllabus, which sucks, because they're as packed with meaning as the Inferno. Still, reservations notwithstanding, the course was an effective introduction to the western literary tradition, and the summary knowledge it provides helps you decide what you'd like to study in more depth later on. You get to read and discuss some really awesome books that most people don't get around to reading on their own (I certainly wouldn't have), and that experience is worth it.",
    "I would recommend DS lit to a classmate.",
    "Professor Purdy Moudarres passionate, kind, and extremely encouraging for us to voice our opinions. The sections felt warm and safe. Especially Dante was a blast with her. Towards the end of the semester, she improved in keeping the discussion focused on the topic."
