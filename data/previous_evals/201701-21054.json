A lot of the reading mentioned key philosophers like Hegel, Kierkegaard, etc. and it was difficult to understand what they were trying to say without having at least a base knowledge of the context of these other thinkers. It would be nice at least to have a cheat sheet outlining what all of these thinkers believed, just so that in our readings we had more guidance."
