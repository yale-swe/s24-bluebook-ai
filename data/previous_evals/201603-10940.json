    "This course really improved my grammar, writing, speaking, and listening comprehension abilities. Plus the material was all really interesting and well chosen for the class.",
    "My German reading skills, writing skills, and literary analytical faculties improved drastically throughout this course.",
    "I learned how to use German in an academic context, to read complicated German texts with increasing speed and ease and to confidently approach writing an analytic text in German. I also developed a knowledge base of academic literature analysis and German language literature, especially its major figures and common themes.",
    "My vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing and speaking skills definitely improved. I also came away with a glimpse of German literature and some knowledge of different German literary styles.",
    "improved my german reading skills, especially skimming. helped practice composition with longer essays."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very well structured and did not really have any weaknesses. The reading selections and class discussions were an interesting blend of literary analysis that often tied the contexts of the books we read into history or contemporary society.",
    "Stengths: Highly interactive class format, engaging pedagogy; fascinating texts; well thought-out and researched introductions to the texts. Suggested improvements: shorter chunks of readings perhaps would allow students to more consistently come to class ready to discuss the texts; spaced out homework assignments (video diary due Monday, discussion question due Wednesday, for example) to encourage more focus on each; a different approach to acquiring new vocab",
    "In order to improve our writing, it may have been helpful to have more small graded assignments rather than a few longer essays.",
    "weaknesses: I found the many weekly assignments on Canvas to be frustrating and sometimes counter-productive for me. Personally, reading long german texts is quite a bit of work that requires a mental focus that was interrupted by the internet assignments."

    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their holistic German ability.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would recommend this course without hesitation. The reading selections were challenging but extremely rewarding and class discussion was engaging. The course focuses primarily on German reading and writing skills, so you don't have to be a literary genius to get the most out of the course. Regina is a fantastic instructor!",
    "A truly engaging and intellectually stimulating course that left me a lot more comfortable with the language, ready to discuss literature and excited to read more German-language authors!",
    "This is a great course for improving reading and writing skills, and also for speaking and understanding. It's also a very fun introduction to German novellas. Overall, a great way to improve your German and also an enjoyable class."
