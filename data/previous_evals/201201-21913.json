   "comments": [
    "If you are a naive undergrad like me: stay away! This class covers very interesting material, but it is truly a grad-level course. Will make you feel like a total loser unless you really know this stuff already.",
    "Do not take this class. I cannot be more clear on this point. Do not take this class.If you decide to shop this course, you may think that the first couple of lectures are interesting and you'll stick around because it seems like it could be useful stuff to learn for a future career. I know I did. But I was fooled, and the course got much more confusing as the semester went on, with very little area for improvement. The schedule of covered topics was ridiculous, and I don't feel like I learned very much all things considered. The course is majority grad students and it seems like some of the professors don't actually care about making sure you know what is going on in the course. Please do yourself a favor and do not take this class.If you read all that and don't want to heed my warnings, I have some advice for you. The quizzes will sneak up on you and be far more difficult than you expect. Even if you are only taking the MBB side of the course and not the CS side, be prepared for programming questions that you will likely not know how to do. I would suggest a background in linear algebra for the second half of the course in particular even though that is not one of the math requirements. The biological knowledge required for the course is minimal. You will likely not know where you stand in terms of grades throughout the semester. In fact, at the end of the semester, I still have absolutely no idea where I stand. I can only hope that my reviews will help improve the class in the future.But, please, do not take this class.",
    "This class covers a lot of really cool material, especially if you are interested in pursuing bioinformatics in the future. However, the class is pretty disorganized, so I wouldn't take this class if you just need an MBB elective. Not much work, but definitely challenging and fascinating material.",
    "The lecturers were consistently good (which is rare). The homework is pretty simple, but the quizzes (4 in total) can be tricky. Don't expect to be working with actual data, unless you're in the CBB\/CPSC course.In conclusion, yes, I would recommend."
