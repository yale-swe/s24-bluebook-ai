   "comments": [
    "Music 211 is the continuation of the 205\/210 sequence. More music theory. The quality of the course depends highly on the professor. The material may not be practically useful, but I found the exercises and content to be interesting and relevant to my other music activities. I would highly recommend it, if taught by Elizabeth.",
    "Good class. I didn't like it as much as I liked 210, probably because we did less composition here. The course material was very interesting and the lectures were well organized. I enjoyed doing the homework assignments, except I wish we had more opportunities to practice analyzing chromatic music and imitate the harmonic progressions in our own compositions. I didn't feel completely comfortable with the final analysis project.",
    "MUSI211 is a course that explores romantic music in detail, analyzing harmonic structure and compositional methods of the 19th century. I would highly recommend it for being a fun class and very informative.",
    "I know now that this was Elizabeth's last class at Yale. This means I can never again guarantee that you will have as good of an experience as I did in this class. Needless to say, it is a really fun and interesting course, if you like music theory. Elizabeth made it something special, though, and I will be grateful for that.",
    "A good overview of early 19th century tonal harmony and close study of Schubert's Winterreise. Coursework was one assignment per week, not an unreasonable amount of work by any standard. Art song composition was a fun assignment and we held a concert of all of the student compositions at the end of the semester. Personally, I'd say it's worth taking to continue getting lessons for free."
