    "This course is a fun and engaging course that has a rather light course load. If you enjoy talking about technology and legal issues regarding technology, you will definitely enjoy this course. The lecturers are really funny and will entertain you.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. Don't let the first fun lecture about Facebook fool you. The rest of the course is not fun. Don't take it. The grading system is outrageous, the readings are dense and confusing (especially if you have no background in law), and going to class is both frustrating and pointless.",
    "This is a good introductory level course to discovering out about law and current events in technology at the same time. If you have any interest in either you should take it, but don't expect it to be a gut.",
    "I'd recommend this class. It is generally quite interesting, the readings are usually manageable and often interesting as well. The workload is pretty small (4 reading responses and 1 blog response, all about 3 pages long, takehome midterm and takehome final) and you basically get to choose when and on what you write your responses. The takehome midterm was a bit of a bitch though. They gave us a 3500 word limit (they put emphasis on this being a limit and not a goal) but the questions included super specific scenarios which we had to pick apart, detailing who was guilty of what and why, what society's views probably were, and how all the legal parties related to each other etc.",
    "Take this class for the readings, not for lecture. Lecture is generally a waste of time, but you can learn a lot from the readings. The midterm was actually fun to do.",
    "What a great class! Truly enjoyed almost every lecture. Fascinating material + knowledgeable and funny professors + light workload = excellent class. If you like the internet and\/or lulz, take this class. Amazing guest speakers (like m00t and the founder of reddit)...",
    "I would summarize this course as a little bit scattered, a lot of YouTube videos, a lot of information about your imprint on the Internet, and overall an interesting look into specific niches of law. I may recommend this course to those who are technologically-oriented, because the legal aspect is not that heavy. Overall I thought it was a fun course, but the grading system was on a 1-5 scale with the grades meaning very little, so it was hard to tell if you were taking it Cr\/D\/F or wanted to drop it how you were doing. I would shop this course certainly, and if you can adapt well to the teaching style and like the material, it is probably worth it.",
    "I loved the readings for the class and found the topic very interesting and engaging. Grading is composed of reading responses, a take-home midterm (that echoes bar exam questions), and a take-home final\/final project. If you're interested in the legal and privacy issues which arise from technology, I'd recommend this class. One word of warning, though: the course does tend to have a clique-y feel to it between some of the students (the computer science oriented ones) and the professors. While non-computer science majors will find the material interesting, it is a bit more intimidating to speak in class as a result.",
    "This class is awesome. The course material is really interesting, whether you are into computers or not. You should probably take this class, especially now in the technology age. I had very little computer knowledge and now I feel much more educated on the larger ideas of the effects of Internet and computer on society. The reading responses are kind of strictly graded--I felt like I didn't improve and did not even have a chance to improve. I pretty much got different criticism each time and there was always something I did wrong. But the class was worth it. Probably take it cred\/d\/fail",
    "Take it if you are OK with loose course structure and requirements.",
    "Interesting class about the intersection of law and technology. Learn about P2P law, privacy, copyright, DMCA, etc. Basically technology grows faster than the law--which is generally a good thing--and legal guys are too dumb to know how to legislate it without the help of Jonathan Zittran and folk. At least that's the impression I got.Anyway the readings are often very good, and the work isn't much. But a few warnings:1. the midterm and final (if you take it) are graded kind of hard. they expect you to know shit that wasn't covered in class, like fine-grained distinctions between civil\/criminal liability (this gets confusing when both are involved), what makes a case more\/less likely to succeed or even be brought up, etc.2. going to class won't necessarily help. in fact you're probably better off taking a nap. because all you do is watch videos. Seriously: one day we watched like 10 different news clips about the first computer virus. It was different news programs interviewing the same guys, who were saying the same things. I honestly do not know what the professors were thinking other than Gee I'd like to waste time. This class is the opposite of productive. Even discussions of readings are superficial and don't impart any more understanding than the initial read-through. And the professors often go on tangents, either because one student wants to show off by asking about something obscure and techy (or law-y), or the professors want to show off by demonstrating their knowledge about an unrelated matter. Usually both.",
    "Yes! take this class as a fifth - it's not so much work and it's enjoyable. You'll get enough out of it if you're a complete newbie that you'll have a basic understanding about the issues of law (emphasis on basic) and the lectures are entertaining. Don't underestimate thereading for the midterm though - you have to do it. After the midterm, you can choose to take the final or do a project and if you do the project you're homefree with regards to reading. BUT the lectures become more enjoyable if you've done the reading, and Brad gave out cookies to people who answered questions so that's an incentive right there. A good grade is not guaranteed because different TAs grade your reading response papers each time, but if you want a relaxing class, it's worth trying out.",
    "This is the best class that I have ever taken at Yale. While in the computer science department, the class teaches you just as much, if not more, about law than it does about technology. The class seems at first like a gut, but do not be fooled - it can be pretty difficult (especially the reading response papers). Brad is one of the best lecturers at Yale, and certainly the most entertaining. The class offers great guest lecturers, and an enjoyable hour and fifteen minute session twice a week. Take this class!",
    "Great course! Disorganized, though -- the readings are decided only a few days in advance, and often the topic of conversation strays from the reading material. However, the readings are relevant (often including articles written that same week or month) and we read and discuss court cases. Another point of slight annoyance for me was that the professors treated the lecture like a seminar, calling on students to answer questions. However, it made for an easy participation grade, and they often provided food incentives for answering their questions :) Overall, if you're interested in the Internet, this is a great course.It's useful, applicable, and fun. Showing up to lecture isn't really necessary to do well in the course, but it's probably the most fun you'll ever have in a class, so just go!",
    "Take it take it take it! AWESOME professors, interesting topic and readings, fair workload\/grading. Brad is fantastic. He's an engaging lecturer who really knows his stuff, even if he sometimes comes across as disorganized, and he's fun to have in class. Elizabeth is equally as good of a lecturer as Brad, although she didn't make it to as many classes. When they lecture together it's hilarious (great dynamic between the two of them). She's kind of a know-it-all, but she really does know it all, so it's usually okay. There is absolutely NO REASON not to take this class, because thethemes are relevant to you no matter what your major, and the class itself is fun. You might want to take it credit\/d though, since they do expect a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need to fulfill a Social Science credit.",
    "This is a cool course- you'll talk about and read lots of interesting, relevant material (check it out at yalelawtech.org). The \"professors\" are really cool, chill people, and they bring in AWESOME guest speakers. This year, we had m00t (founder of 4chan), kashmir hill (forbes blogger), an \"above the law\" blogger, the founder of reddit, a former Obama administration \"internet czar,\" and Jonathan Zittrain (Harvard Law). Basically, this was better than a semester's worth of master's teas.Problems with the course:1) they often assign more reading than they really expect you to do, and they may or may not actually discuss it2) the TFs are Law School students with a nitpicky style; they will probably focus on style issues, and3) It is impossible to gauge how your grade is- it's basically a check minus - check - check plus system deliberately not mapped to grades for the four reading responses and blog post, and the midterm wasn't scored until after the Credit\/D deadline.",
    "internet meme class. It's fun and interesting, but you'll come away with more knowledge of 4chan posts than of the law that applies to 4chan. Great guest speakers though.",
    "I thought the material in the course was absolutely fascinating. Otherwise, I absolutely regret taking this course. The instructors were all over the place, one of them barely attending class. The most consistent instructor was too obsessed with watching youtube videos in class to teach us anything, making attendance unnecessary unless you wanted to catch up on some internet memes you might have missed. The class is not difficult, however, so I would recommend it to someone who wants an easy class and doesn't want to be engaged at all. If you're actually interested in the material, though, don't expect much in terms of instruction besides exposure to those topics.",
    "A rather straightforward course that plays around a bit with case law but generally focuses more on technology. Anyone can follow along, though if you aren't really into computers you'll miss a fair few of the jokes. Grading of the reading responses can be pretty arbitrary, so be careful. A decent enough fifth class, though.",
    "This is such a fun course. It's not difficult, but the material is varied and interesting. The tests are doable and feel like solving a puzzle, which is great. The weakness of the course is Brad Rosen's ADHD style of teaching. While I like fast paced classes, the tangents often had nothing to do with class and were very distracting. I was often annoyed at having my train of thought disrupted by some silly video that added nothing to what was said. That aside, the course is great. I really recommend it.",
    "This class got the reputation of a gut (unbeknownst to me, a freshman) and its enrollment swelled. I think it lived up to its reputation, although the grading scheme is a little mysterious so I don't know yet how I did. It features little work (except reading that few students probably do) and take-home exams. The teachers (especially Brad) don't take things too seriously. This class has nothing to do with computer science. You might find the material interesting (look at the old syllabus at yalelawtech.org) or you might know it already. Maybe take this if you need an easy class for a hard semester. Otherwise, just remember that you will only get out what you put in, even if you can get away with doing very little.",
    "This class is amazing and anyone who can should definitely take it. The material is interesting and relevant and the professors are wonderful. Brad and Elizabeth are young, brilliant, and hilarious. Especially Brad. However, do not think of this class as a gut. There are not a ton of assignments (four reading response papers, one blog post, a midterm take home exam and a final take home exam - or a project), but they are not easy nor are they graded leniently. You should definitely have an interest in the internet, technology, and law if you are considering taking this class. I looked forward to doing the reading (which is all online, and all made up of ebook chapters, recent news articles, and blog posts), and I was eager to get to class every Monday and Wednesday afternoon. Also, Brad and Elizabeth are very well connected in their industry and they invite a lot of guest speakers. The guest speakers are amazing. Take it!",
    "Manageable and you learn a lot about law and technology. Both professors are really smart and know what they are talking about. Very little computer knowledge is required, but sometimes they speak over you head if you are not a computer expert.",
    "This is an interesting class that explores a lot of the issues having to do with the internet like freedom of speech, bullying, privacy, copyright, etc. The class is pretty poorly organized. The professors seem to prepare on the train ride from New York to New Haven, readings are posted at the last minute, grading can be really unclear, and assignments are never explained. The professors lead the class as kind of a discussion-based class, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't since there are about 80-100 people in the class. On the other hand though, the material is really interesting and you will learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I struggled a little because I don't really have a comp sci background but having said that I learnt a lot of new things. I even started enjoy reading the tech section of NYT after this class.",
    "The course is fun and yet the form of involvement it asks for is not one that is all that active. In other courses, the prof may ask for a student's point of view or insight or argument; here even where there was room for qualitative discussion, mostly what takes the stage is the stuff of tech and tech + law. As a result class time often has more tech commentary than law education or tech perspective-gaining. It's also a course better for underclassmen than for seniors who may find the bulk of the several but small requirements more for the sake of requirement than meaningful exercises. 2-page reaction papers and blog entries under necessarily subjective grading might engage underclassmen better than seniors or juniors used to more in-depth learning.",
    "Very interesting, take it if you have a free spot.",
    "This is a class that introduces basic concepts of the law and applies the concepts to the realm of the internet. Topics such as net security, privacy, anonymity etc. are covered in this course. I would definitely recommend this class to all students! It is extremely pertinent information with the internet boom that has occurred and is also very interesting.",
    "This class is exactly what it sounds like: an introduction to technology and law. If you're a computer geek or thinking about law school, by all means take it. If neither of those sound like you, you'll probably be pretty lost and bored. We covered online privacy, electronic searches, defamation, copyright, onion routers, etc. You don't need to be interested in computer science AND law, just one interest is enough to get you through the class. (I'm pre-law, and know very little about computers but I did just fine and enjoyed it).",
    "Recommend. Definitely.",
    "Overall, I thought this was the mostrelevant and universally necessary course that I've taken in my eight semesters as a Yale student. Brad and Elizabeth are very knowledgeable and entertaining as well as flexible to the interests of their students. My only two criticisms would be1) The course at times lacked structure, both in its architecture and the day-to-day lecture. The readings and important class dates were often not posted very far in advance. Because the lectures were often very anecdotal, anything I was somewhat unfamiliar with, I had a hard time weening out the take home point.2) Occasionally, I thought there might have been a slight bias in terms of how information was presented. I often felt like the side of issues that was presented most strongly was from the strongly generative, internet as a frontier with limited government side of the spectrum. And while the internet and our culture as a whole might ultimately benefit from that side winning out, I would have been interested to read more well-written and well thought out arguments from academics in the opposition when they were available. Apparently they weren't.Other than that, the general feel of the lectures is very welcoming and inviting for discussion, and the topics and assignments were all relevant and worth doing.",
    "Pretty easy, pretty interesting, don't need to know a lot about computer science to get a lot out of the class. great fifth credit.",
    "definitely take this class. it teaches you about the legal wold through the lens of technology, something we all know closely yet many have not thought about the legal side of it all.",
    "Definitely take this course. It is one of the few at Yale that is taught like a law school class (some cold-calling [although you know beforehand what days this may happen], situation-based exams requiring analysis of the details of cases, etc). Brad is an excellent professor, as is Elizabeth (although she was not there every class period this semester). I definitely recommend getting engaged with the class, talking a lot, and getting to know the professors. This class is a great one to interact with other students and professors and build both connections and friendships. Take it.",
    "The subject matter is fascinating but the class is EXTREMELY informal in its approach.",
    "This was probably one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. You have no idea where you stand grade-wise the entire semester. Also you are expected to know and understand a great deal of legal information that is not fully or adequately explained in class. he only redeeming quality was the funny videos in the beginning of class, but save yourself a lot of trouble and surf Youtube outside of this class. ONLY take this if you plan on taking it credit\/d and not going to class. In that respect it is not bad since it's only take home midterm and final and four reading responses and a blog post.....all easy to BS for credit."
