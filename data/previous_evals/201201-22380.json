    "MUSI 210 covers a lot of the same material as MUSI 205; I'd say half the course is review. However, you do get to do more counterpoint writing, 4-part writing, and two real composition assignments. It's a highly analytical course, and voice-writing and composing can often seem more like a logic puzzle than a creative exercise. However, I think the fun comes from crafting a beautiful melody that still satisfies all the voice-leading rules and fits conventional structures you learn about. Also, analyzing pieces of tonal music is fun because you get to appreciate the genius of past composers and their mastery of traditional forms. Work is very regular (there's something due everyclass), but it usually doesn't take more than 2 hours per class. The most important thing is to take this class with a teacher you like. Shop several sections and choose your favorite teacher.",
    "This course definitely requires a lot of patience and attention to detail unless you have a really great instinct for partwriting, etc. Megan is extremely enthusiastic and energetic, which is definitely a plus, and she is definitely a good teacher who explains things clearly. However, she is a bit of a harsh grader, so assignments must be completed at a very high standard, making them a bit of a time sink. Don't underestimate the difficulty of this course if you're taking it with Megan--it's less an issue of tough subject matter, and more an issue of just having to make sure you never make mistakes, which can be tedious and time consuming. Positive experience overall, though, Megan definitely makes the classroom time fun.",
    "If you are debating between this class and music 205, the main difference is that this class involves two model compositions. 210 also involves more of a study of form. There are homeworks for each class that generally take about 2 to 3 hours each - usually partwriting - and two composition projects that will require considerably more time. If you don't have to take this class for lessons or for the music major, and you're not interested in composition, I would probably take a music history course instead.",
    "This course felt quite laborious most of the time. It was mostly a review of what was taught in MUSI 205, and almost every class was a review of what we had just read in the textbook. Each homework assignment took about 2 or 3 hours to complete, but the grading was quite harsh. Megan is a nice person, but she comes across as a little inexperienced and is very strict in some respects (e.g. lateness)."
