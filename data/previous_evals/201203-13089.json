   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. The work is not difficult, it is just a decent amount of work. May of the homework's were actually pretty fun, while the exams are fair.",
    "A great overview of geology. A very good intro course. I think it gave me a different way to look at the Earth, which is cool.",
    "I am a non-science major interested in Earth processes, and I thought this was a generally interesting class. It wasn't a breeze for me, but compared to tougher science classes it was the perfect amount of work. Lectures aren't wonderful, but they aren't awful either. The class is well-organized. I would recommend G&G 110 if you liked Earth science in high school and are looking for a class that won't require an absurd amount of work.",
    "Take this as your science credit! Lecture is really great to just sit and listen (it's actually fairly interesting) - no need to take notes because the slides are really thorough and follow the textbook clearly. Midterm and final questions are released to you beforehand, AND there was a fall break trip to Canada.",
    "Survey of geology topics. Take it if you have any interest in learning how our planter works.",
    "Take it if you are REALLY interested in taking a survey geology class or have to. If not, the upper levels are much more interesting and better taught!",
    "Do not do it. This class is terrible. The lectures are long and incredibly boring and assume way too much prior knowledge. It's also very disorganized and you dont get anything back throughout the whole term. We had three p sets in total - one during shopping period and the last two during the last two weeks of class, it was frustrating. The professors are really nice though - that's the only good thing. Also you get the questions on the midterm and final (like 45 each with incredibly detailed responses you have to memorize which sounds easy but is very painful, trust me) so no one goes to class. It's not worth it, you wont learn anything.",
    "If you do not already understand Earth processes, you must take this or another class like it before you finish college. That said, the grading structure makes it difficult to get a high grade, since there are no papers to turn in.",
    "I would recommend it if you are planning to major in geology. You get a good background of geology vocabulary. Otherwise, I would recommend taking another geology course.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. It's boring. It isn't worth the walk to science hill. Unless you like learning about minerals and can stand that for half a semester AVOID.",
    "Very interesting material. Pretty good lecture. Almost no outside work except studying for the exams, but I learned a ton. I LOVED it!",
    "While sometimes frustratingly oversimplified or unrealistically detailed, this class provides an interesting overview of most of earth science. It is accessible to non-science majors but still fascinating for someone like me who plans to major in G&G. It did not help me figure out what area of G&G I am most interested in; rather, it just made everything seem more interesting! Lectures can sometimes be dry, but if you pay attention everything starts to come together in a very exciting way. The workload was not evenly distributed according to the syllabus; after 1 p-set the first week of class, there were no formal assignments until the 3 p-sets in the last 3 weeks. However, Dave and Danny are pretty responsive to the class, so it's probably on us that people didn't bring up our lack of grades until the end of the semester.",
    "You get the final and midterm questions a week before the test. But the curve is not very nice since everyone does well.",
    "Take it if you like nature and want to know about its scientific explanation for its formation. But don't take it if you don't want to remember new terms and learn about many uncertain (unproved) theories.",
    "Take this class even if you don't want to major in geology--does a great job of teaching you about the world.",
    "This class is a good introduction to the principles of geology, on both a large and small scale. This class is a good course to take to fulfill a science credit; the workload is manageable and the exams are very fair.",
    "This is an excellent course for any major to take, and you will get out of it what you put in. I had taken intro physics, and still found some of the concepts challenging, and all of them fascinating. Non-science majors in the class had more difficulty when we did fractures, deformations, and mineralogy, but the book and lectures explain really well what concepts you need to know. This course involved a lot of fact-learning, which was not difficult if you could link everything together in your head, but if you have the wrong attitude, some would call it \"memorizing.\" Take the lab! It corresponds well to the course, and is lots of fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is complements the lab very well and has provided me with a true love for geology that I never knew I had.",
    "Big 'ol survey of Geology. Some complex concepts, definitely not a breeze. The course is worth taking because everyone should have some understanding of these topics since they inform our everyday understanding of the world around us (climate, weather, land forms, etc.). However if you're not a prospective G&G major and just want a brief experience with geology, I recommend Atmospheres, Oceans,& Environmental Change with Ron Smith over this course.",
    "Great course! I liked it, although others found it boring. Maybe its because I'm a nature freak and I love the great outdoors. Totally reworked how I understnad the world around me. Great for understanding systems and change. Think of it as a history course for the world. Evans is great! He is patient and very friendly. Its worth majoring in geo just to have him as your advisor. Some of the classes are taught by Prof Rye, though, and he comes across as more removed from the student body. His classes are dryer. Make sure to take it with the lab! Fun field trip! It can be a bit of a shlep to science hill but hopefully you'll get used to it, science majors. Would recommend for a filler science course. No math and very little outside science required. Not sure if going to class is so worth it though, as most things can probably be learned from the slides and the book. But its nice to say hello to Professor Evans: read: Majestic D. Check out his profile on Wikipedia.",
    "This course is a great class for both students who would consider majoring in geology and non majors. I thought that as a non-major it was approachable particularly because the professors provided help and let you know what to expect and what you needed to learn. Geology is also cool, so I'd certainly recommend it for students who'd like to challenge themselves beyond the \"non-major\" science courses.",
    "Yes, great overview of every aspect of geology."
