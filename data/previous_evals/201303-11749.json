   "comments": [
    "This class is enjoyable because instead of just teaching the basics of quantum, Prof. Schoelkopf teaches the highlights. While the subject is inherently difficult, Prof. Schoelkopf is very good at teaching. One negative this semester was that Prof. Schoelkopf was out of town quite a bit and needed to get a substitute lecturer. This was bad for my understanding of those concepts, but it made me really appreciate how much better of a teacher Prof. Schoelkopf is.",
    "This class is HARD in every way, but if you are genuinely interested in the material and willing to work for the credit, it's worth it. You fly through a lot of material very fast--the problem sets aren't too bad (some are lengthy, others doable). The tests are probably the most difficult I've taken at Yale.",
    "PHYS 439 is very math-y. I suppose its hard to come up with very physics-based examples for an introductory quantum mechanics course. I think I learned more linear algebra in this class than I did in Linear Algebra. We go through a lot and if you manage to absorb at least the basic concepts of what you're learning, I'd say you learned a lot. The exams are challenging but fair. Problem sets are not bad at all. Try really hard to keep up with the material, because class is quite frustrating if you don't understand what's going on. Overall, a good class.",
    "This class was very well-taught and interesting. You probably expect that the material is difficult. It is. But if you're a physics major, you likely have to take quantum, and I personally think that this course is a good alternative to the 440\/441 route. Expect to devote at least 10 hours to this course if you want to do well.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this class, it's probably because you have to. That being said, I actually highly recommend it even if it's not required. You need a pretty good grounding in math (ideally up through linear algebra, though I wasn't the only one who wasn't familiar with it beforehand), but you can pick up a fair amount of it during the course. This course gives you a good overview of quantum mechanics without being overwhelming. Highly recommended!",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend PHYS 439. A great one-semester introduction to quantum. We covered Griffiths chapters 1 - 6, and 9. Problem sets were all taken from Griffiths. The midterms and final were reasonable too. Also, Schoelkopf is a great lecturer, really nice person, extremely knowledgeable and good at explaining things.",
    "It is a basic intro to quantum mechanics. Weekly problem sets, 2 midterms, and a final. Standard workload. Take it with Schoelkopf.",
    "I thought this class was very challenging and sometimes frustrating to do problem sets, but I learned a lot. I recommend this class to someone who has an aptitude for physics and is up for a challenge.",
    "Schoelkopf is very smart and very personable, but he is not the most attentive teacher. I think it is because his time is in high demand from his research, but he wasn't able to put nearly as much time into the class as would be ideal and it showed. Also don't make problem sets due on the same day as a midterm. But otherwise he was very nice, understanding, and fun to talk to for what could have been otherwise dry material. This course is super mathy (no surprises there). It's quite hard to wrap your head around as well. Make sure you've taken Linear Algebra and Differential equations beforehand. Above all, if you want to really understand the material, budget extra time to read the textbook each week. If you do, you'll really get it. If you don't, it's still manageable, just tough (hint: I didn't).",
    "Problem sets are long, but far apart -- Professor Schoelkopf was busy this semester and didn't have all that much time to assign psets, which made this course pretty irregular. Lectures are good, but Schoelkopf goes very fast. Do not hesitate to ask him to slow down or repeat points, as he really seems to care that everyone is on the same page before we move forward. That said, it is very easy to fall very far behind in lectures (like, missing entire concepts, not just a few lines of algebra). Go to class, keep up with the reading, and quantum will be doable (maybe even fun!).",
    "Hard. Go to the TA sessions and read the textbook. It's a fun culmination of physics - the math is really elegant. My main suggestion would be to have linear algebra. Not a formal pre-req, but having linear and diff-eq was a huge advantage for me. Some of the underclassmen who took it without as much math struggled. No rush on taking this; wait until you have alight semester and can devote the time. It's worth it!",
    "It's quantum for people who want to be \"conversant\" in quantum physics, as Prof. Schoelkopf would put it. I'm sure this class would have been a lot better if it would have been as small as it used to be, but because there were so many more people than usual, I don't think it was that great. Prof. Schoelkopf isn't a lecturer, and that's fine because he hasn't been used to doing that. This was a lot more difficult since there were students who just wanted to get out of 440 who could have done well in that class. So yes, Schoelkopf is great in a small class and you'll learn a lot. If there are a ton of people... get ready and study a lot on your own. This is quantum. It's not for the weak of heart.",
    "Physics 439 is a great intro QM course. If you can take it instead of 440, do it.",
    "I think the lectures could have been improved by better laying out the structure and direction the lecture would take before lauching into equations on the board. It would have been helpful (at least for me!) to know a bit more about what we were solving for and how we were planning to get there before launching right in to the math. Midterms and final were, on the whole, fair though. Material is pretty challenging but it's rewarding once you get through the semester."
