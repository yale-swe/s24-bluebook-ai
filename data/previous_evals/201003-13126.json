    "Take this course if you have a serious interest in Graphics. From what I've heard about 478 this was far less time, but you still get an interesting flavor for some of the topics and how to create computer graphics. By the way, here's a hint: it's all math.",
    "This is a good course if you are interested in graphics. You will learn about various concepts in graphics and apply some of these to projects \/ assignments.",
    "This is a pretty challenging and time-consuming class. It covers interesting material, and you leave the class knowing a lot more about graphics.",
    "Yes! Interesting and inspiring course. Teaches you an overview of computer graphics and the methods and techniques. Not so much how to implement them but I think that is what the other computer graphics class is for. You read a lot of papers and then take it in turns to present one of them each week. Also a few exercises to do and 2 projects. Very different to other programming intensive classes. Deff a great elective and contrast.",
    "If you're comfortable with computer graphics, I would definitely recommend 479. Although you don't really have to code anything except some simple scripts if you have no previous experience in graphics, I wouldn't really recommend the course to newcomers simply because you don't really learn anything about implementation."
