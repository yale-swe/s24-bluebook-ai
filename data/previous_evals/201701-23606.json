Finally, have one class day to do all the trainings -- bring in the trainers and get all the certifications in one class time.",

    "The instructors for the course are fun and energetic but they felt very absent from the course and I wish I could have learned more from them. They came, talked for 15 minutes and then let Thomas take over. When I had problems with certain issues, I wasn't able to approach the professors and had to go directly to one of the TAs who were not very helpful. I really wish the profs were more accessible and present in this course. It felt like we were not a very high priority. I wanted to comment on Thomas who was the other TA in the course. He basically ran the course so it's weird that there was no rating for him. I found him to be condescending and inflexible. When I would ask him questions, he would treat me like I was stupid and make me feel bad for asking the question instead of helping me understand the material. When I would approach him with requests or issues, he was completely inflexible and made things a lot harder than they needed to be. I felt uncomfortable working with him and am very disappointed with the way he ran the class. Paul and Julie need to take more of a present stand in the class and be available for the students instead of passing it on to Thomas because he is not approachable or helpful in most situations."

    "Some of the course requirements and processes seemed arbitrary and rushed, and the feedback provided by instructors was not always clear or helpful. Give more time to work on the final design project.",
    "The final project needs more time, felt really cramped towards the end",
    "It's hard to criticize this, since the course covered so many technologies and skills, but I did feel as though the tutorials on those various systems (onshape, makerbot etc) could have been more instructive and thorough. This is of course however in the context of the great ambition of the class to cover such a broad subject matter.",
    "Too much in too little time. One project over the whole semester would have been better. You emphasize trying and failing and reiteration but there really isn't time for all of that unfortunately AND learning all the different programs. Wish I could have spent more time learning CAD and Arduino. Feel like I was introduced but none of it stuck.",
    "We should focus on fewer things in more detail. The course tried to cover too much. Arduino could have been dropped in order to better understand CADfor instance or even to just help us work on our projects. Arduino was pretty unnecessary."

    "At the end the team came together as one but there were definitely some challenges on the way. A lot of it came down to personalities clashing which I thought was an interesting conclusion.",
    "The midterm could have been less intensive, which would have allowed for more time to complete the final projects. The group dynamics were at times great and at times trying - so while I think it is the best way to do the class, I think having the same groups throughout and allowing some student preference in group making might give greater cohesion to the teams created.",
    "Advantages: learning my weaknesses Disadvantages: takes more time having to hash out everyone's ideas",
