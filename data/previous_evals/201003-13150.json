    "I would say that a student taking Art 138 should be prepared to work hard, but by doing so will improve greatly and reap the rewards for so doing. I highly recommend the course to other students.",
    "I'd recommend it for sure. You learn a lot of tecnical skill about digital photo and you get a ton of freedom with what you want to do.",
    "The class consist of weekly shooting which we edit in class. Every few weeks we have a critique in which we print out around ten photos and the class talks about them. Sometimes during class we go to look at prints in the various libraries and galleries.",
    "I love this course - totally recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who even has a remote interest in photography. If you already like photography\/ have some experience, you'll still learn a lot from Sasha's lectures and critiques (though maybe less from the Photoshop instruction). If you've never taken photography before (like me), it's a great introduction to the medium. Challenging, but not so much work that it feels overwhelming. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class. It's hard work, but worth the time and effort.",
    "YES. It is an amazing intro to photography. I love it.",
    "i would recommend this class to a student with both the interest in pursuing the subject matter and devoting the time needed for this course",
    "yeah. great class. true it's lots of work, but Sasha's really great",
    "Take this class!!! You learn the basics of Photoshop, but about half of the classes are spent actually looking at other photographers' work. We had visiting artists come speak and we went on field trips to A&A (where they have the thesis portfolios of every Yale graduate photographer, many of whom are quite famous), the YUAG, and the Whitney in NYC. Sasha is awesome. She'll look through everything you shoot each week and help you come into your own as a photograper. If you can get in, you'd be a fool not to take this class."
