    "I learned SO much about Japan and about general ideas such as Westernization, globalization, modernity, and how to challenge these ideas or view them differently.",
    "This course was extremely informative and insightful towards a more realistic depiction of Japan. As someone who came in with a very generalized view of what is considered \"Japanese\" I can honestly say I have learned to be more skeptical towards what the media portrays.",
    "I learned all of the things that I should have known before\/during studying abroad in Japan! I learned a lot more about what life is like for people in Japan, what kind of social\/cultural structures they live within, the big social issues there, and how everything relates to the practice of anthropology and thus our own lives. Skills- this is kind of the class that made me realize why citations are valuable! And how to do them without just using easybib. Although this class only has 3 writing assignments, the guidance offered for writing was really great.",
    "Being my first anthropology class, I learned a lot about how to study and frame anthropological work. Learned tons about Japan, naturally."

   "comments": [
    "Amazing course, not much to change I think. The readings were sometimes a bit overwhelming though.",
    "Strengths: -thought-provoking discussions. -professor made keeping up with the readings absolutely mandatory, which was great! Keeping up with readings is always extremely hard if you fall into the trap of \"I'll be less busy next week and catch up.\" You can't fall into that trap in this class due to weekly quizzes and reading responses. Weaknesses: -We got a little behind towards the end of the semester and started to discuss in class readings that where due a week ago. -The quizzes could be made better for testing if students did the readings. I think even very short responses (one sentence responses) might be a better way to test if someone read the reading or not.",
    "Super super interesting classes. Some readings are dry, some are fantastic. Overall, great course."

   "comments": [
    "100% yes. Absolutely amazing course and Prof. von Baeyer is incredible.",
    "Yes! It was one of the best credits I could have engaged in.",
    "Highly recommend this class to everyone, whether you are a student that know a ton about Japan and want to solidify their knowledge\/learn more or a student who has no knowledge about the country. Also a great intro to socio-cultral anthropology.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you do not have a strong understanding of postwar and modern Japan and are interested in learning about it through an anthropological lens.",
    "I definitely would, especially to another student interested in East Asian Studies. This class taught me the basics of anthropology through the lens of an area I am deeply interested in, modern Japanese culture. It is also a writing credit, which was great as it allowed me to develop my writing skills both creatively and academically."
