   "comments": [
    "This is a course of keen insight and wonderful execution in teaching. Professor Stearns has a great depth of knowledge about the subject and communicates that very well. This course makes one actually think about medical principles and brings diseases from the realm of \"phenomena\" to definite processes with proximate and ultimate causes. A must-have course for any student with a remote interest in medicine.",
    "Really thought-provoking course. You also get very good at reading scientific papers, which is a valuable skill most biology courses won't teach you.",
    "This class was surprisingly difficult. Other people didn't have as hard of a time understanding the concepts, so I guess it was just especially difficult for me. I had a very difficult time trying to really grasp the concepts, even though I did practically all the readings and studied thoroughly for exams. The concepts just didn't sink in to the point at which I could answer Professor Stearns' though-provoking questions on exams. Professor Stearns and the TA were also very harsh graders.A few serious weaknesses and problems with the class:I hated having graduate students in the class. The class would have been much better without their high-level questions that most of the class didn't pay attention to. Their presence was very annoying.I absolutely hated the Friday readings of scientific journal articles. Other people liked them, though, so, again I guess it was just me.Although this class was not work intensive (there were lots of readings, but only two midterms and a final paper -- no final) and didn't require loads of rote memorization (like other biology classes), it was extremely difficult and I really wouldn't recommend it to another student. I took MCDB 205 Cell Biology last semester and did very well, so it's not that I'm \"not a science person.\" This class just demands that you think in a very high level way, that I just wasn't used to.",
    "It's a great course for those interested in evolutionary biology and its applications in medicine today. It covers the latest scholarship on the topic and is very infrequently uninteresting. Highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I find evolutionary biology to be really cool, though, so if you're really into the molecular side of biology, you might not like it as much. You cover a lot of topics in medicine that tie into evolution, such as antibiotic resistance, cancer, and the hygiene hypothesis.I took E&EB 122, which I think made it pretty easy for me to understand the course. It wasn't too much work. You take two midterms, write a 15-20 page paper, and discuss scientific papers every week (which can sometimes be long or difficult).",
    "Yes. You will learn fascinating material, and you definitely do not have to be a science major to take this class. It makes reading the research papers easier, for sure, I think, but if you're willing to put some extra time in, the knowledge you gain is well worth it. Professor Stearns is amazing. He knows pretty much everything about evolution and medicine. And if he doesn't, he knows the person that does! High recommended, this class makes me want to be an E&EB major. (You also only really need to do the textbook reading to supplement things that you didn't understand in lecture.) The paper at the end is long but well worth it. You get out of it what you put in. If you choose a topic you'll genuinely interested in, you'regoing to have tons of fun writing the paper.",
    "Take it if you're genuinely excited about the subject matter and are up for a challenge. You will learn a great deal, but you will work hard outside of the classroom.",
    "Very interesting subject material, extremely relevant. However, it is not accessible to non-science majors. The tests are very challenging and you have to write a 15 page paper at the end. I would recommend this class ONLY to junior\/senior biology majors.",
    "If you're a science major looking for some fluffy class to fulfill a requirement, look elsewhere. If you're a non science major looking for an interesting but not too difficult class in science, also look elsewhere. If you're taking this class credit\/d, I guess you could, but a 15 page paper really is a lot of work, so you might want to look elsewhere too."
