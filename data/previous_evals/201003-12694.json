    "YES. Amazing course, a tremendous, tremendous opportunity. I'm not going to add anything profound that reviews from past few years haven't mentioned (last year I think it got 18\/18 \"excellent\" -- there's a reason for this), but nonetheless a couple relevant, if redundant, thoughts: 1) JBS is probably the best pedagogue at Yale, he cares very deeply for his students, he knows the field extremely well (and is a world-renowned China expert to boot). 2) As wonderful as JBS is, the classmates make the class -- they're great, some of the best Yale has. 3) It's a lot of work, and very rewarding. Between the term paper and weekly writing assignments (which I got pretty into), I probably ended up writing 35 pages. And then there's a 150-200 pg. weekly coursebook .pdf (which translates to a 250-315 pg. book), which you'll read because you need to if you're not to flounder in weekly study group and seminar. In sum, PLSC 240\/260 will eat a lot of your time. But you know what? You won't care. Because the class is that good, it's that interesting, and everyone's pulling their weight together. But as if all this is not enough, the JBS end-of-term dinner at Scoozi's is delicious and promises much mirth and you'll get to see JBS (along with other classmates) a little sloshed.",
    "AMAZING. Take it if you can get in!",
    "You've seen it from the other reviews, and you'll see it from mine: this is a must-take class. JBS (Professor Starr) does a great job of picking people for the class, and he sets up every week around a case study that he puts together himself. The class sessions themselves are different from any other seminar you'll take (most likely), because instead of just having a large group discussion the whole time, he splits the class time up into various small-group activities for most of the class session. This means that you actually get to know everyone in the class--I actually knew everyone's name, unlike in every other seminar I've been in. Yes, it's a lot of work (you actually have to do all of the reading and you have to submit a 500-word reading response every week), but I was taking five classes this term and I survived, so you probably can too. The mandatory study groups, in my opinion, were not at all a drag; my study group became really close over the course of the semester and we had a lot of fun at our weekly meetings. Basically, you really just need to take this class.",
    "I could not recommend this class more strongly. Professor Starr is one of the best instructors I have had at any level. His dedication to the class is unparalleled in any other class I've taken at Yale. The class is structured through weekly case studies and different issues of public school governance in various parts of the country. Some might say that this class is only good if you are very interested in education and politics. I disagree. Reading about the successes and failures that are made in the management, politics and overall leadership of public schools is a valuable lesson for anyone who hopes to be involved with any kind of leadership, whether is education, political, business or academia.",
    "If you can get in, take it. This is by far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. You will not only learn a lot about the politics of education reform, but will also share the experience with a dedicated and thoughtful community of learners.",
    "I'm sure I echo the other reviews, but this class is a true gem. JBS's dedication to teaching is truly unmatched at Yale College. Throughout the semester I was consistently impressed with his commitment to the study of best practices in teaching, learning, lesson plans, class structure, reading assignments - it's all pretty remarkable. Do not be intimidated to apply (you may very well get in, the seminar is larger than most others), and do not be intimidated by the workload. It is very manageable once you get into the swing of it. Take this class!",
    "This is an absolutely fantastic course. I came into the course knowing little about education politics. I've not only learned about education but hadthe opportunity to think through \"big questions\" about government and democracy. Professor Starr is the best teacher I've had at Yale.",
    "PLSC 260 is an amazing course, although it is a tremendous amount of work--so I would recommend that your other course are less demanding. Students also learn a lot about and from each other, which is very cool and unique.",
    "If you can get in to the course, you should absolutely take it. It is the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Hands down one of the top two courses I've taken at Yale. If you get in, you should take the class and put in the work that he demands. I left the course probably having more questions about public education than answers, but I am also more able to evaluate what is going on in public education.John Bryan Starr fosters a fantastic learning community in his seminar and you leave knowing a lot more great members of the Yale community than you started with.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale, hands down. The work load is serious but not as overwhelming as I thought it would be, and if you care enough to take this class, you should care enough to do the reading, because that's the only way you'll get anything out of it. JBS is freaking amazing.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. If you can get into this class and know you will have the time and energy to do the work, take it. This class is incredible. JBS is a stellar guy.",
    "Take it! Hands down, JBS crafts the best seminar experiences at Yale. I learned an incredible amount in a short period of time and never felt like any of the class time was a waste."
