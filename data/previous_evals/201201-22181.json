   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're choosing between this and Math 120. It's definitely easier and more straightforward.",
    "It's definitely a course that can be challenging. You have to work through all the problem sets and put a decent amount of effort into the course, however, this effort is very rewarding.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in engineering because it has such an applications-focused curriculum. I found the mathematical topics we covered very interesting because there was such an emphasis on their practical applications. Smooke is a great lecturer, but it helps a lot if the class is talkative from the beginning, because when you ask questions, he will help you out, and the whole class will probably understand things better. The p-sets and tests were very reasonable, especially if you go to lecture and watch the professor explain the topics in person. If you are deciding between this and MATH 120, take this. Especially with Smooke. You will find it so much more engaging and enjoyable.",
    "Much better than Math 120. Go for it!!",
    "Essentially Math 120, but with more application. I shopped both and felt that the ENAS was better taught and more interesting. Smooke is engaging, friendly, and clear.",
    "It's much easier than MATH 120 from what I hear. Also more applicable for certain majors. Btut it's also at 9am and is much more boring. But at least Smooke speaks English. So there are trade-offs here and there, but overall I would still recommend it over 120 just for the relative ease of the class, which I think outweighs everything else.",
    "I would recommend this course to engineers who need to fulfill a math requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone as an alternate to math 120. Same material, but better teaching and a more interesting class.",
    "If you have to take multi, take ENAS 151 for sure over math 120. The professor was not a graduate student, and the book was really helpful.",
    "Yes if you want to be an engineer",
    "The class is too complicated to be at 9 am - good luck showing up and staying awake! But it's not excruciating as long as you do your homework ahead of time and study for the tests.",
    "This class is exactly what it calls itself -- it teaches you the math that you will need to actually solve problems and do things without weighing you down with the proofs and theory. Smooke also strives to make his tests very fair, not have trick questions, and not require memorization of most formulas.",
    "Solid education of Multivariable Calc, sticks to book chapter by chapter.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a standard problem set a week. The material does get more difficult at the end, but it is manageable.",
    "Most of the students face the dilemma of Math 120 vs. ENAS 151. Based on my experience and tons of things I've heard from my friends that took Math 120, the answer is clearly ENAS 151. It is just better taught in general; the curve is better and the professor is more capable.",
    "This class was great! Probably the best math class I've ever taken, and one of my favorite ones at Yale this semester (despite the fact that it was at 9 a.m., and I'm not a morning person). All the relevant information was available in the textbook, but the material was reinforced well and made so much more accessible by lecture. If you can, definitely take with Prof. Smooke! He was a really good lecturer, explained the material well, showed genuine interest in it, was always approachable and encouraged us to ask questions, had a sense of humor, was pretty fair with grades and willing to help you improve if you seek help, and made you feel like you were getting exposure to engineering (which is really cool when you're just starting out in the engineering program). I also spoke with him in office hours specifically about what to do with my major and career, and he was really knowledgeable, helpful, supportive and truthful (even though he's in MechE and I'm thinking about BME and ChemE). The problem sets had a lot of problems but they did not take too much time, and the abundance of problems also provided the chance to get plenty of practice with problems. I felt as though the class was not overly challenging, yet still required work to understand the material and to gain facility in doing problems.I shopped Math 120 at the beginning of the semester and it was no comparison to this course. I took Math 115, and it felt like the none of the professors were really interested in the material and like we were just supposed to suffer through learning it because we had to. I started to get the same vibe from 120. ENAS 151 had a totally different atmosphere - it felt like the people there were actually interested in it, and the professor was also interested in the material and how it relates to engineering. You that question everyone asks in math, how am I ever going to use this in life? Well this class is all about how useful the info. is to engineering! I really enjoyed it, the problems, lectures, and even exams. It's also really helpful to find a study buddy to go over psets with - made a huge difference in the class (actually I'd recommend this for all math\/science courses). So glad I took this class!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has to take 120 and is not a math major. Better taught, more useful psets.",
    "I would recommend this class if the student is interested in learning about applications of multivariable calculus, but not if they are interested in understanding the theorems and theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENAS 151 to a fellow student. I shopped both ENAS 151 and MATH 120, and found ENAS 151 to be better taught and more interesting. The problems sets and midterms are fairly straight-forward and Professor Smooke was always very willing to answer questions. There are not many proofs and there are a fair number of applications based examples, but you definitely don't need to be a prospective engineer to enjoy this class. I found learning about the applications helpful in understanding the math better."
