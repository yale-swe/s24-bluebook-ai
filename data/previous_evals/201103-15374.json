    "Probably one of the better L1 language courses. There are six tests and some relatively light homework and if you get a good instructor it can be really enjoyable. German is a hard language, but the department here seems to teach is very well. There also isn't a formal final which is nice during finals period.",
    "If you want to take German and don't have time to take intensive, then (obviously) you should take the class. It is a good class. The text book is fine, the teachers are pretty good, and the work load is not too much. It felt more like a 1 credit course than a 1.5 credit course. The syllabus is really odd, however, and you will find that there are strangely concentrated periods of intense work. Generally, though, it's fine.",
    "Certainly, if the fellow student wants to learn German.",
    "Obviously, take this if you want to start German. Workload is pretty light compared to what I've heard about most other intro language classes (except the online exercises can be rather annoying and take anything up to 3 hours if you leave them to the night before). Only thing is instructors can be of uneven quality and some will insist on speaking almost entirely German from day one, so you can get a little lost - make good use of shopping period to check out each section.",
    "German 110 is an excellent introduction to the language. You won't get a ton of speaking practice, but all the major grammar forms are covered, and the vocabulary covered is extensive. Unfortunately, Anne probably won't be teaching it again, and this is a tragedy, because she is beyond wonderful. If you ever have the chance to take anything with her, jump at it. In any case, it's a great introduction, and I will certainly be continuing on to 120.",
    "I would recommend the course, though I would assume it varies quite a bit based on who the instructor is. The course materials are helpful and provide a good grounding in the basics of the language. Those who wish the class had covered even more material can always do outside study on their own."
