    "great class, easy to do well. one big group project that you work on over the course of the semester. small homework assignments occasionally. two quizzes that aren't hard. learned a lot of things that are applicable to the real-world, which was nice.",
    "YES. TAKE IT. YOU GET OUT OF IT WHATEVER YOU PUT INTO IT. FOR ME IT WAS VERY USEFUL MATERIAL. TEACHES YOU HOW TO THINK CREATIVELY.",
    "It is easy and the lectures themselves are quite boring at times. However, the end result is really impressive. The final products produced by my classmates were well thought out and creative and I definitely finished the class having a much better understanding of product creation\/development.",
    "Great. Class.",
    "ENAS 323 will teach you how to come up with a product that solves one of your daily problems (e.g., your coffee gets cold quickly or it's hard to move boxes) and then you'll make a full business plan surrounding your product.It's a relatively easy class, the quizzes are straightforward, and the homework is super quick. That being said, expect to work a lot at the end of the semester, as you have to have a fully-functioning, well-designed, well-made prototype, business plan, presentation, and video.",
    "ENAS 323 is basically a class where you make a new product in a group. I would recommend this class to another student if you enjoy group work. The majority of the work comes from making a new product in a group of 4 to 6 people. There are weekly group assignments, as well as a final project and presentation that you do together. Aside from that, there are individual homework assignments and 2 tests.",
    "You simulate the product design process. It's basically a long group project, so if you like your team and project, you'll like the class. If you don't, you'll have a really hard time.",
    "take it. it's a lovely course -- prof. bolanos is a jolly man, and the workload is so light, it's a little ridiculous. HOWEVER, i did get some insight into what it takes to create and market a product, so there is something to be learned here, despite what you'll probably read in other reviews. also: prepare to work A LOT toward the end of the semester for your final presentation.",
    "This is a really easy course. Everyone I know got an A. Basically you are a member of a team that develops a product and creates a marketing, financial, distribution, etc plan for your product. Most of your grade is based off of a final presentation, but there are also two easy quizzes throughout the semester. I was frustrated though because I felt like this could have been a really neat opportunity to actually learn a lot about product development, but instead everything was a joke. The course packet had pages that were photocopied incorrectly. It was 200+ pages miles long but I never read any of it. The book that we had to buy had grammar mistakes and clip art \u00e2\u0080\u0093 written by the professor. No one paid attention in class because there was no point. The professor knew a lot about this field 20 or 30 years ago, but now all of his information is out of date. I felt like I pay a lot of money for tuition at Yale and this was a waste of that money.",
    "Awesome! Must take!",
    "This class is basically an overview of the process by which products are created, developed, and brought to market. It is very practical information, but this information is not always presented in the best way. Nevertheless, there is not much homework, and the tests were not difficult. The most work was done at the end of the semester, when we finalized our product and compiled a final report. It can be stressful if one puts everything off until the end. Other than that, this class is smooth sailing.",
    "If you're not a senior you have to email waaaaay in advance, like the year before, to get into this class. It is probably the easiest A in all of Yale in terms of time required, which makes it quite popular.You get out of it what you put into it...some people come out with crappy products and others come out with products that the outside \"judges\" want to buy. If you take the class just make sure you're in a good group."
