    "A great class to learn how to write like a modern essayist.",
    "This course made my semester, and Professor Shirkhani is a wonderful ray of sunshine. The class includes five drafts, five completed essays, and several shorter writing assignments, which is to say that the workoad was significant. I never felt overwhelmed or overworked, though, because the readings, essays, and teaching were so top-notch. If you take this class, take it with Professor Shirkhani--you will learn so much from her and her well-planned syllabus. She is brilliant, easily accessible, understanding, and helpful. (My writing improved greatly in her class.)",
    "All students should take this course! Great skills! Does require consistent writing, however.",
    "Engl 120 is a great course. I was afraid to take it as a freshman and as a sophomore because I don't have much background in writing, but it is taught in a way that is productive for students regardless, and if you are ok with getting a b+, the workload can be completed with very little stress.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 - it is a fantastic course and a great introduction to the English Department at Yale. It is a tough class - the grading is challenging - but you analyze a lot of excellent professional writers (David Foster Wallace, David Sedaris, etc.) and have a chance to learn how to craft your own non-fiction writing style. I am very thankful that I took this course.",
    "A good WR only if you have a lot of time.",
    "English 120 is perfect for students hoping to get better at writing mainly personal essays because that's all you read and write in the class!!",
    "A wonderful course for anyone interested in improving their writing and for anyone who wants to read great pieces. Professor Shirkhani is an amazing teacher who is so nice and reasonable. A lot more creative than I expected in terms of the style of writing",
    "Yes, I wholeheartedly taking ENGL 120 with Professor Shirkhani. If there is anything about the syllabus or the classroom that you find lacking, speak with her directly and she will--with munificence and care--mould your experience to best match your needs as a writer.",
    "Its a creative nonfiction writing course with a broad subject matter. The readings are interesting, and writing and evaluating workshop essays is thought provoking. The class definitely gave me a whole new appreciation for the craft of writing, and made me better at it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to write."
