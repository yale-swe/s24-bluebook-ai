    "Thorough overview on the three philosophers, and engaging discussions about several related topics, such as political engagement, agency, religion, morality, sexuality, ethics, human psyche, etc.",
    "A broad familiarity with the three thinkers named in the course title and a general understanding of the history of intellectual suspicion. The course successfully accomplished what its given syllabus goals were.",
    "The course involved invaluable readings and discussions",
    "Improved my analytic skills when reading convoluted philosophy. Improved my writing, Prof. Campe's comments on the midterm paper was very insightful and helpful.",
    "This course gave me a great space for me to advanced my wealth of information on central figures in Western for Philosophy, and was one of the direly needed but few continentental courses at yale",
    "I learned a little bit more about"

   "comments": [
    "Great readings, very kind and accommodating professor. Seminar could get a tad bit monotonous at times.",
    "Perhaps a little more structure, but largest issue was a too little enthusiasm on the students themselves",
    "Excellent course if you have any interest at all in philosophy. Great opportunity to look at three very complex and different thinkers with a lot of depth. Only disclaimer is that you may want to take the course when the rest of your load isnt terribly heavy, so as to give the readings the proper attention.",
    "I am not sure how it was like for other semesters, but for this one, Professor Campe was generally pretty flexible in discussion topics depending on the questions raised in class. He had outlines planned but the classes were generally quite malleable in that sense. Which can be good or bad depending on your classmates. Professor Campe replied my reading responses every week, which I found wonderful and very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great Humanities credit course. The topics are quite engaging for anyone who's interested in Philosophy, and the workload is not overwhelming at all.",
    "Assuming the student had interests in this area, yes. This class does not serve students unfamiliar with philosophy well. It requires a working knowledge of Kant and Hegel to achieve its aims. That being said, most Yale students in the humanities, having taken introductory coursework in philosophy would find it profitable.",
    "Yes, absolutely",
    "If Marx, Nietzsche, and\/or Freud interests you in the slightest, you should take this course.",
    "If they wish to advance further in key German literature, modern philosophy, and general lebenphilosophie,I would recommend",
    "Would absolutely recommend. Discussions are lively, professor Campe is incredibly knowledgeable, and you will be able to pursue a single line of reasoning in the two papers which makes the course feel much more unified than most seminars."
