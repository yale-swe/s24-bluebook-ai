Problem sets were an effective skill-building tool that helped me gain familiarity with the application of physics concepts to the technologies in question. Really useful class overall."

    "Strengths: well organized, comprehensive syntheses of all the renewable energy technologies as well as the shifting global energy mix; clear communications around problem sets, exams, and other assignments; great lecture slides and supplementary materials Weaknesses: some lectures got a bit side-tracked and weren't as relevant as others; could have had more time in class spent on the problem-solving applications of the lecture concepts"

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in energy, definitely take this class. It is important to gain such valuable knowledge.",
    "If this is not a physics course, do not take a large amount of time calculating physics. Many slides were preceded by the phase \"this isn't a advanced physics course but...\" and then spent far more time on equations compared to the concepts.",
    "this is a great class to learn about different kinds of renewable technology",
    "If you want an overview of the engineering design, generation properties and formulas, and applications of various types of turbines, solar cells, etc. then def take this class. You don't need to be an engineer or have that background or even focus - I'm an energy policy guy",
    "If you are at all interested in gaining a better understanding of how renewable energy technologies and systems work, I'd recommend this class; the professors were engaging and very knowledgable about the material and it was a comprehensive overview of the world's energy mix."
