   "comments": [
    "Great course. Prof. Lalli is one of the best and kindest Professors I have had in my 4 years at Yale.We even composed our own song and had a professional soprano perform them!At times the HW felt long and tedious however",
    "Take it, but be prepared to work",
    "Music 110 varies greatly by section - for the most part its a gut, but if you take it with Lalli, you'll actually have to work at the ear training.There are readings from a textbook and accompanying busy-work assignments; this theory is supplemented (at least in Lalli's class) with a lot of ear training, music performances where the group has to sing in harmony, and two basic compositions.I would definitely recommend this class for students with any interest in music - its a pretty comprehensive, but manageable introduction to the subject.",
    "Music 110 is a very good class for those with some musical background (by some I mean very little). Complete beginners will be fine, but should expect more work than those who, for example, sang in high school. Ear training is difficult, and requires work outside of class. Homework assignments and amount of work depend on the section, but Professor Lalli provided a good amount of work that helped with the material a lot.",
    "Anyone who plays an instrument that has not taken music theory before should definitely take this class! It's a nice break in the day from the more traditional subjects and is extremely helpful for songwriting.",
    "Fun, informative, important if you were ever curious about the theory of music.",
    "This class will be easy to follow for any student who has limited experience with music theory.",
    "Wonderful wonderful class - definitely recommend. You will learn a great deal about music, the material is really interesting. Professor Lalli is wonderful."
