    "This is a great course to take to improve your language skills. L4 is an akward level because you aren't quite fluent but you lack a ton of vocab and there is still a need to solidify grammar. If your instructor is good, the topics you discuss are enjoyable enough, so the class as a whole will be pretty good.",
    "Ich w\u00c3\u00bcrde Deutsch 140 empfehlen. The workload is manageable-there are lots of smaller tests and assignments, but they're pretty well spread out. My German speech and reading skills have improved a lot. Fiona is a good teacher.",
    "German 140 is a great next step in the German language learning process. I would recommend it to any student who wants to further their knowledge of and comfort in the language. It's a lot of work, but most of it is constant daily work throughout the semester."
