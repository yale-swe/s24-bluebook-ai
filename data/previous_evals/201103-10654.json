    "Great course, highly recommended. Undergraduates interested in pharmacology and drug discovery should definitely be encouraged to take this course. You will learn a lot of material from a great diversity of professors in the Pharmacology department. Exams are long (3 hours, and most people in the class didn't find this out until the day of the first exam), but very reasonable. One of my favorite courses at Yale thus far.",
    "I would summarize it as a way to understand mechanism by which current therapies treat disease and areas\/weaknesses to think about in the development of new drugs. I would recommend it to another student, particularly those interested in pursuing an industry position.",
    "Yes, interesting class. Good professors.",
    "I would. But I'd say you have to be independent and expect little from the format of the class."
