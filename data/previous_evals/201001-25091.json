   "comments": [
    "PHYS 151 is not a course worth taking; however, if you're reading this, you're likely a pre-med student or an MCDB major, in which case you don't have a choice.",
    "only if you have to. Sucks.",
    "No. Such a painful class. Even thinking about it gives me shivers.",
    "You probably have to take this class anyway. The curve is hard. Instead of a normal bell curve, it's like the top half of bell curve; most people score close to a 100 and have probably taken Physics before, which makes life hard for newbies. People who are new to Physics will have to work extra hard. The textbook is great though. Zeller is a very nice person but his board notes can be hard to follow.",
    "This class is terrible. Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Electricity and Magnetism is a lot harder than the first semester stuff.",
    "Only takes this class if you absolutely have to. Otherwise it's a waste of time.",
    "don't take it unless you have to for premed requirements.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who does not need it for a major requirement. The lectures are boring and useless and the material is not interesting.",
    "WORST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. HORRIBLE TEACHER!!!",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Don't be alarmed if you aren't getting 100s on all of the tests because the people that do shouldn't be in the class to begin with. The professor takes that into account. It's not the most exciting class, but you can learn a lot if you put the work in.",
    "Physics is an overview of electricity, waves, and a brief intro into quantum mechanics.",
    "You're probably taking this class because you have to. Everyone is pre-med and the curve is awful. This was definitely my worst classroom experience at Yale.",
    "Pretty easy conceptually... the class is totally standard, exactly what you'd expect for intro physics. Zeller's lectures aren't always awesome... if i hadn't basically taken this class in high school, it might have been hard to understand what's going on. But he does want to be helpful. If you have questions, ask him after class and he'll explain it until you understand.",
    "No unless you have to take it.",
    "Most pre-meds are gaming the system by taking 150\/151--most get an easy A even though they should be in 180\/181. That means that students with less background in physics or who really want to learn it, are stuck with people who shouldn't be in the class and don't get much out of the course.",
    "No. The teacher is extremely disorganized.",
    "Well, if you are premed you have to take it! Zeller is really funny and engaging and has great demos (when they work).",
    "This class sucks. The teacher is horrible and the tests are long and hard.",
    "dont take this unless you are premed.",
    "Not as easy as PHYS 150, but still simple enough that it's mostly plug and chug.",
    "learn the material from the book. too much to learn just from lecture. don't get mad at Zeller for this.",
    "I would recommend this class, though physics is not my favorite subject... It gave a nice overview of electricity and magnetism in a comprehensible way. The professor could be clearer, but he tried his hardest to make the hard concepts understandable. The problem sets and tests were reasonable and followed the format of the book. The book was very clear as well. I would recommend attending the weekly help sessions--they replace sections and really help clear up confusing topics. Perhaps the lectures could be more in line timewise with the lab class (be ahead a week) so that they would prepare you for lab. The concepts were harder than mechanics and took some time getting used to.If you are pre-med\/have not had much physics background, this is the level for you.",
    "A waste of your time--take it only if it is required for your major or if you're pre-med. There are a ton of people in the class who should be in a higher level physics class but are taking the class because it's an easy A for them. This does two things: it messes up the curve for students who haven't taken physics before and it gives the physics department the false impression that the class is actually doing a good job of teaching students the material. I would have dropped it if I wasn't required to take it for my major.",
    "Professor Zeller obviously cares about the students and is always willing to meet separately to discuss any problems with the students and re-explain any of the material. I thought the beginning of the course was a little better taught though, as we rushed through the end. I think the students would benefit more from practice problems done in class rather than just going through derivations.The course went very quickly at the end after going much more slowly at the beginning. I felt like we didn't have very much time at the end and had to rush through the last bit. The beginning was much better understood. Overall, I thought the course was a good introduction to E and M.",
    "Take this course if you want of general overview of physics that does not require calculus. The workload is very manageable and there are only 2 midterms per semester (plus a final).",
    "If you have to",
    "No, it is actually horrible. Taken only if you have to.",
    "Its simplified physics: E&M, optics, and a little bit of quantum. If you want to learn some basic physics without really working too hard its not a bad choice. The problem sets are relatively short and Zeller makes class entertaining.",
    "Dont take unless you absolutely have to and even then i suggest doing it over the summer.",
    "If you need to take a physics, I guess take it, don't have high hopes for the class and be prepared to learn a lot on your own",
    "Physics is not impossible! As long as you do the problem sets&check them at the tutor, and do some extra problems per chapter, you'll be fine. Just read the book, keep up with class, go tothe tutor, you'll be fine.",
    "If you have to take it...",
    "Pretty easy. Good for premed physics.",
    "bah. humbug. a class filled with premeds who don't want to work and should be in a higher level. not as horribly taught as it used to be; still not great though. will not teach you to love physics.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class for pleasure, but the chances are that you are required to take it for medical schools.",
    "You're a premed so you're taking this class. I'm sorry. It's going to suck. You really should reconsider your life choices anyway before you decide to suffer through a class like this.",
    "It's a good class. Not too intense, to too hard to keep up with. Professor Zeller cares about the students and wants to make sure everyone learns the material.",
    "It is a good class if you want to a-learn physics from a really general, theoretical standpoint and\/or b- need to fulfill pre-med requirements. If you have taken AP, you might want to take the advanced physics because this is essentially the same class as AP.",
    "A standard introduction to physics.",
    "It sucks that you have to take this course, but aren't you used to horrible Yale science courses by now? This course is HORRENDOUSLY taught, but luckily the book is very clear so you can self-learn the entire course. Problem sets every week that are pretty challenging, tests that are also pretty challenging (they don't really reflect the problem sets too much... you'd be better off studying by understanding concepts by reading the book, but also by doing problems), and grading that i'll be able to tell you about in 35 seconds. Going to class has never been a more complete waste of time, except that he MAKES you go by making attendance 5% of your grade... well that sucks. there are worse science classes at yale, but there aren't many that are taught worse than this.",
    "If you are reading this you probably have to take this. Second semester is much harder than first semester. DO WELL on the first test because it is the easiest, and it's hard to come back if you dig yourself a hole. For the final, make a really complete review sheet - and focus on the last part of the class, as that is the focus.",
    "I would say that this class shows you how the items that we use everyday work, and I think it's amazing to know what drives novel everyday tasks. Others would say take it if you need it (pre-meds).",
    "take it ONLY if you must (premed)",
    "Physics 151 is a class for those students\/pre-meds who do not really like calculus, but need\/want to do physics. It is exactly what you expect and does not really rely on what you learn in Physics 150. Study hall was very helpful and helped to clarify things well.",
    "Not the most riveting course and sometimes, it can get pretty boring (for me), but it's doable. Just keep a positive attitude about it.",
    "This class was one I had to take; I would not recommend it but if you need to take physics and haven't taken multi-variable calculus, this is a better choice than physics 181.",
    "i would recommend phys 180 \/ 181. This course tries to not use calculus so hard that it ends up confusing basic concepts and makes it harder than it needs to. Also, on a midterm, the median was once around 95%, so take it if you think you can beat the curve.",
    "NO.",
    "it's a very poorly taught physics class, don't take it with Zeller if you have the choice",
    "If you are a PreMed- you have no choice!",
    "It's a premed requirement you can only escape if you feel confident enough to take 180. I would only recommend it to someone, like me, who never took physics before in high school.",
    "Take the course if you have to for a requirement",
    "Only take the course if you need to fulfill a requirement for graduate school and\/or a major. Not an enjoyable quantitative reasoning credit if you aren't taking it with a purpose.",
    "i would reccomend 180 because there are probably more people learning the material for the first time. but take 150 is you're amazing at physics or if you have the time to dedicate to learning the material",
    "Only take it if you have to. Not a great class"
