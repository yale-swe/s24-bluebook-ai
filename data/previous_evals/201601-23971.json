    "The course instructors were very hands-off, and the class was mostly structured and organized by the TA. Individual classes were generally led by visiting lecturers.",
    "Professors Spalding and Terrell didn't really teach -- the class was all based on guest lectures (some in person, many over Skype).",
    "This was the first time FES offered such a course. I think Elliott did a wonderful job of making it happen. However, it should have more administrative support. I pulled information from the class and speakers, but wonder how well other students appreciated the topics. It was good to get exposure to the modeling software used by timber manager, but I feel like we had to cover a lot in a sort time, with limited isntruction.",
    "Not quite fair to judge this course on same scale as others, considering we came up with it and designed it rather haphazardly. Kudos to elliott for stringing this together with little help. FES needs more exposure to growth and yield modeling. it's embarrassing that we needed to create this course."

    "This was a pilot course so understandably a little disorganized. It would have helped to adjust the structure a little - sometimes someone talking through spreadsheets over Skype was not very helpful. Would have been great to get to use Woodstock and not just FVS. Also would have been good to discuss sustainable G&Y principles alongside the financials, a couple of speakers seemed quite removed from sustainability, did not seem to really care about conservation.",
    "The course didn't have the resources that it needed to be truly successful. None of the instructors had enough experience with the material and programs used to clearly instruct students in their use. There were a lot of technical hiccups throughout the course, as a result.",
    "Instruction on the tools the class was supposed to use. It was difficult to work with and integrate FVS and Excel etc. with no prior experience and under the constraints of such a short period of time. Also, the course could benefit from more clearly linking the guest lectures together and trying to bring the lecturers into New Haven instead of doing things over Skype.",
    "Deborah Spalding is a wonderful person and incredible teacher WHEN SHE HAS TIME. Given her other career obligations, she SHOULD NOT be teaching. I feel very strongly that giving her teaching responsibilities is robbing students of a learning opportunity. She is not nearly as available as effective as she is capable of being as a teacher.",
    "Designated faculty who knows what theyre doing in G&Y models. earlier coordination with guest speakers."
