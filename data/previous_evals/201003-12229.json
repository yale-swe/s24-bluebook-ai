   "comments": [
    "This class is a look at 19th-century decorative arts and architecture. Though Professor Cooke is a great teacher, I would not recommend this course because it is quite boring and the material is unexciting.",
    "Excellent course if the topic interests you. Cooke gives interesting, in-depth lectures, and everything sort of ties together. Can sometimes be a little repetitive, and some of the talks about spoons and pitchers are a bore, but I would still recommend it overall",
    "If you are even vaguely interested in the nineteenth century, decorative arts or household architecture, this is a wonderful class. If you're not, you might find it unbearable. I thought the class had a good balance of focusing on objects like silver, glass and ceramics, and using the topic as a vehicle as explore theory on the mindset of America, class and consumer economics. That being said, the 9 a.m. start time was brutal. I found it hard to attend every lecture because it happened in a basement classroom and could be really boring. The object study sessions in the art gallery and furniture center were invaluable \u0097 the class was worth taking just to handle the objects in that setting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Ned is a great professor who makes the material interesting. He teaches so much more than objects, I learned a lot about history, social movements and technological advances. This class was great.",
    "Make sure you are interested in the subject matter before taking the class. If pots, pans, forks, knives, desks, and tables aren't really your thing, than this class probably isn't for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, yes. It is a course that attempts to understand the culture (political, social, etc.) of the 19th Century by looking at the material objects that were produced during that time.",
    "Close and careful study of vestiges of American material culture in the nineteenth century! Lots of furniture, domestic items (vases, silverware), and architecture. Manageable slide memorization. Final paper provides opportunity for independent study, which is pretty exciting. One midterm, one final. An awesome class that lets you explore a different side of art history. Take it if you're into seriously investigating material goods.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in art history and decorative art more than architecture. It could really use more architectural history, but the way it is treated (in the same vein as the decorative art objects) makes the building analysis interesting. I enjoyed the course, and you don't really need to do the readings. Go to lectures because Ned is spectacular and it's the easiest way to pick up the material. Not too much work for a lot of knowledge.",
    "I would recommend any course taught by Professor Cooke, whose lectures are some of the best prepared at Yale, but I really think this class was especially good. I would encourage all art history majors to think about taking a class about the decorative arts even if you really don't think it's your thing, because I've found that it really has enriched the way in which I think about visual culture. Thinking about the \"fine\" arts is much more interesting now that I know more about the visual world of everyday life. I think the 19th century class is a really good choice for people who want to take an art history class as something totally different, because the scope is broad enough that you are bound to find something that interests you. There is the added benefit of object study sessions, where you get to handle many of the objects that are discussed in the lecture. Obviously, if you really despise memorizing slides then you probably will not enjoy studying for the midterm and final for this course (although honestly, you will memorize an equal number, if not more, for most survey classes), but really, you will learn so much that it is worth the work.",
    "Take this course! The material is completely fascinating and the workload is easily manageable (short paper, long paper, midterm, and final). Professor Cooke is also amazing, and it's worth taking the course just to hear his lectures! I know that \"decorative arts and domestic architecture\" may not seem super interesting, but I promise that you will not regret taking this course!",
    "The class is like learning American History through the lens of decorative arts. This definitely isn't a course for everyone, but if you're at all interested in the material, it will give you a new appreciation for the decorative arts and architecture and a new perspective on history in general. take it.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, if they are interested in art\/art history. It is not a huge amount of work, but you learn a lot and it is pretty cool.",
    "This is a great class for those who are interested in American History, and who want to pursue that interest in a different and specialized way. That said, the class, while cross listed in Art History, really feels very different from a traditional Art History class--it has a much broader scope, in the sense that the objects we studied are applied to wider cultural movements and themes, as opposed to necessarily being studied for their own inherent aesthetic value. That can be very rewarding, and certainly brings a fresh and new perspective to the study of American History. Just be aware that this is not a typical art history class, and in fact doesn't really feel much like one at all. Because it is about use objects, you will get to handle the objects in 3 hands-on \"object study sessions,\" which really gives great perspective. But don't go into the class expecting a traditional art history class, because that's not what this is. It IS, however, a great opportunity to study American History from the point of view of the objects people actually used, and there is no better person to teach that than Professor Cooke. He is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and passionate about his subject, so if you're interested in this, you should absolutely take advantage of this incredible resource.",
    "I totally recommend this class!!!",
    "A nicely integrated survey of a huge number of fields: furniture, ceramics, silver, glass, and architecture. I found much of the material fascinating, particularly that on the architecture.There is a lot of information in each lecture, which can make note-taking very rushed. The tests require you to identify 40-60 objects and terms from lecture, but it is hard to know which these will be, making you have to take detailed notes on everything. Hand cramps are the one sour spot in an otherwise great class.",
    "Amazing class, Prof Cooke is awesome!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Through the lens of decorative arts and architecture, you learn 19th century American history--art, social, economic, political, etc. histories--as never before. Because of this lens, you learn parts of history that often weren't\/aren't recorded, especially in the realm of Americans' daily lives. The art\/architecture history is also fascinating.It is also relevant to life today. You gain the ability to interpret the world around you. The class teaches you not only to understand 19th century architecture\/dec arts, but also how to ask questions and analyze the built environment and interior decor."
