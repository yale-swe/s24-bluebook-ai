   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Probably the best TA I've ever had! Emmanuel had a deep understanding of the topics, most of which were outside his own areas of interest and study. I was so impressed with him and so were my classmates. He will be a great professor someday. Yale is lucky to have him.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0It is clear that Emmanuel has a bright future ahead of him. We were very lucky to have him. He showed that he has mastered the readings and scholarship of the topics. Yet, he was very down to earth and patient, clarifying our questions or misconceptions on the topics. We were just unlucky not to have him in all the sessions due to family situations, but that's life and he needed to excuse himself--no problem. Wishing him the best.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0I really respect and appreciate Emmanuel Lachaud as a scholar and as an instructor. He is exploring largely untouched subjects in his own studies, and this helps students to explore the subjects at hand with similar passion. We had excellent discussions in our sections, and his ability to frame both questions and responses as he moderated discussions helped us to grow from one another's passionate inquiry very effectively. He remained highly professional during a time of great family crisis, and that was impressive.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel was personable and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Strengths: Such enthusiasm for the material! Brought the material alive and communicated passion. Very intelligent. Smart and interesting \"takes\" on the learning. Weaknesses: In full class presentations, tried to pack too much in. The relationship between slides and speaking was often not there, meaning one had to either listen or look, but couldn't really do both. Overall, as noted for Professor, guidelines on assignments were rather confusing, and study guide was late enough to cause significant stress, so that's a general weakness for the teaching team.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel was enthusiastic about the course material and facilitating discussions. My section was one of the best I have had here at YDS. There was never a 'right' perspective . We were given tools to make our own assessments. Emmanuel (and Tommaso when he led our section) both encouraged a multitude of perspectives and were excellent at facilitating discussions. Emmanuel was ALWAYS available for discussion and welcomed opportunities to help us think through papers, theses, etc. It was a fantastic learning opportunity. I am deeply grateful for it.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Strengths: - Was always well-prepared for section and organized - Engaged students in conversations - Made himself available and took the time to meet regarding thoughts, concerns and ideas I had with my work\/papers. WEAKNESSES: - Needs to end section on time. I was consistently running late for a section that met directly after this one.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel was far more organized than Professor Gordon, but still lacked in clarity occasionally. He was particularly unclear with the instructions for the first Document Analysis assignment. The set of criteria provided for the assignment was not at all the criteria by which we were graded.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0In some ways, we as a section did not always get very far beyond the basics of the text, though this got better later in the semester. I am not typically the fan of splitting into small groups during section, I would prefer to discuss things as a section, but then again we had a big section. The best section was when we talked about \"Women on the Margins\", we stayed as a big group and got past the basics into a more intense discussion of the themes. Emmanuel showed good flexibility for this section. Finally, there were a few students that dominated the conversation. It would have been helpful if Emmanuel had done more to make the conversation more even among students.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0He knew his stuff but the conversation didn't flow well until the last section",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmaneul was able to facilitate helpful classroom discussions, draw me into a meaningful engagement with the readings, and to illuminate important patterns and perspectives in the historical analysis. His enthusiasm was also very helpful. He gave an excellent feedback on assignments and was always available to meet for discussion.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel was a great TF. He read all the reading assignments plus extra material to ensure he could lead discussions well. He was helpful with advice for assignments and for preparation for the exam.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel was highly personable, which made interactions easy and fruitful. He knew the material well enough to be a resource, and he was good at encouraging group conversation without allowing any given student to monopolize discussion. We were able to use the section time fruitfully and as a major part of the class -- moreso than other TFs I have had. Very glad I had him as my TF.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel was very knowledgeable about the material. In section, he tried to facilitate conversation around the readings and lecture content that made it applicable. The structure and objectives for our sections could have been a little stronger\/tighter.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0good tf",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel was great. He was super well-prepared, well-organized and supplemented the lectures very well. I don't have any concerns re his instruction.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel always made himself available to us as students. He was professional, on time, and always led our section meetings with professionalism and openness. Trans Mo. was the best section that I have had in my 2 years at YDS so far.",
    "Instructor: Emmanuel Lachaud \u00a0Emmanuel came very prepared to our sections and helped fill out and review weekly course material. He was able to facilitate discussion and questions as they arose and and carried discussion when conversation or questions were lacking. He began each section with incredibly rich and useful questions to guide our thought and discussion.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tomasso was a fun and informative teacher.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso was very open to discussion and questions and very supportive of students. I think I wish we had been able to go even deeper into reflections, especially given the quality of the materials we were given as readings -- but I understand we only had one hour per week. Also, the pace (even though the class was at 8:30) could have been faster, I think. But I understand the concern of the TA to make sure everybody was on board.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso seemed shy leading section but was otherwise very receptive and open as a section leader. His paper comments were helpful and he clearly knows the material. Greater confidence in his own leadership of the section (which is there and possible!) would be nice in helping students be more comfortable and open, though this was also affected by the class material\/structure more broadly.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Strengths: Knowledge and passion for the material. Very intelligent. Smart and interesting \"takes\" on the learning. A gifted \"question asker.\" Organized and thoughtful on how to work through class material with participants. Weaknesses:. Overall, as noted for Professor, guidelines on assignments were rather confusing, and study guide was late enough to cause significant stress, so that's a general weakness for the teaching team. Tommaso has a pronounced accent, which is not a problem as long as he slows down and speaks up when presenting. In general he did this, but there were a few times when he became inaudible or difficult to follow.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0My teaching fellow made himself available to assist me when I had difficulty relating to some of the material",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0hard to understand at times but very competent and extremely accessible and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Well organized, friendly, available and approachable! I'm not sure if this is up to Tommasco or Prof. Gordon, but there needs to be more clarity about expectations for assignments well in advance to the assignments being due.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso was very kind and led section discussion well. He welcomed and encouraged everyone to participate. He was very willing to help with assignments, and had regular hours of availability, which was much appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso was very helpful in terms of helping and guiding when I met with him to discuss my paper topics.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso's sections were interactive and highly informational. He provided enough didactic material to set the stage for the group discussion which were always lively and well focused. Tommaso was always well prepared and he is very knowledgeable in history of Christianity which was a great asset to the group discussions. Tommaso was very humble about his challenge with English as a second language but this was never an issue in class. He was always on target with the topics to be discussed and everyone appreciated his strong command of the topics under study and we looked forward to his sections every week. In addition, Tommaso was very proficient in his paper critiques making the students feel motivated to improve their performance and work hard on their progress through the semester. We really appreciate having Tommaso as our section leader.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso has a great manner in section - open to comments and clearly really engaged. I appreciated that we had a time at the beginning of the section for getting out information - dates and context. As the semester went on, instructions for assignments became clearer, which was good. Thanks.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso showed a lot of growth in his comfort in the section classroom. He became better at setting a pathway for us to follow and managing time (sometimes we were given more time in small groups that could have been spent in the sharing and discussion that synthesized \/ shared the small group work). He will grow into a very good teacher. He cares about his students and relates well with just about everyone from what I could see. His accent was hard to understand at times, but he was very truly approachable about repeating as needed. He was not defensive or troubled by this need. He made himself very available to students outside of class and the conferences were truly helpful in helping me to grow as an academic writer through this course. However, at times the \"get to know you\" section of the conference was a little long and we could have gotten into the \"meat\" of our discussion more quickly and made slightly better use of the limited time we all have to get our work done. But, that being said, Tommaso is personable and seems to genuinely care about you as a human and your work for the course.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Weak organization. No plan for class. Poor section leader. Poordiscussion prompts.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0I think Tommaso could have been more confident in directing the section, but that could also be the way the section was structured. For the most part, the questions being asked had very obvious answers, so it was hard to get a discussion going around them.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0The teacher presents the material in a very interesting and understandable way. The teacher is available for conversation and questions. The teacher has a very kind and respectful approach to students. The teacher understand the challenges of international students when it comes to language etc. and is open to give advices and help.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Warm, engaging and funny, with an interesting and insightful grasp of the material covered.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso is a very strong discussion leader. He was always willing to engage the students and incorporate different viewpoints into discussion.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tomasso was well prepared for section and asked thought provoking questions. He always allowed us to engage in the material in an interesting and meaningful way.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0I really appreciate how approachable Tommaso is. He consistently made himself available to help with papers and questions about the coursework. I also appreciated his detailed comments for my papers. My main suggestion for Tommaso is that at times he would talk down to the class, explaining basic concepts that everyone in class already seemed to understand or asking questions that had one direct answer that did not lead to very full discussions.",
    "Instructor: Tommaso Stefini \u00a0Tommaso did a nice job as an instructor. I found discussion sections to be helpful in making clear the material, and in facilitating critical thinking about various aspects of the material. He was quick to respond to emails, and quick to grade our assignments."
