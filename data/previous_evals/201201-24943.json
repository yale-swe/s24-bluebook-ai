    "Very good summary of ethical issues faced in epi research. The guest lecturers were well-chosen and the topics were relevant.",
    "Fabulous ethics course, great to listen to Chris, as always.",
    "Helpful course",
    "Strengths: Practical information about the research process that I haven't formally received in other courses\/seminars. Some of the seminars made me think hard about ethical issues -- especially the lecture by Dr. Khoshnood.Areas for improvement: I think most of us already knew everything covered in the IRB lecture, so it would have been nice to have a more applied lecture - thinking more about potential problems that may arise and how we would go about dealing with those situations (as opposed to an overview of the IRB as an organization).",
    "Great overview of ethics topics - much more interesting than I expected.",
    "It was a great time to learn about research ethics.",
    "I enjoyed this course because I initially feared that it would be a rehash of other required ethics classes that I have taken. This wasn't really the case as we touched upon various topics related to ethics that we may come across as doctoral students. I would make the class a little more discussion based rather than lecture format.",
    "This course had the potential to be very interesting, but I thought some of the guest lecturers (despite the tremendous amount of experience they had) were quite boring.",
    "Good",
    "for an ethics class at 9 am , i thought it was great! Guest lecturers were at the top of their field and Dr. Tschudi's lectures were informative and interesting",
    "A good opportunity to think proactively about issues we may encounter as researchers.",
    "The topics are carefully chosen and it is critically important for every graduate student doing research.",
    "The topics discussed were all very useful. I especially appreciated the discussion on reviewing manuscripts and grant applications.",
    "excellent"
