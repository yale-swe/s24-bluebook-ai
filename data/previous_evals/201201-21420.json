   "comments": [
    "Take 111 just to enhance your basic knowledge of economics. I may never take another econ class, but I'm glad I know something about global markets.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Sigga was a great teacher and kept the course constantly interesting with her sense of humor and inclusion of relevant current events in each lecture.",
    "Yes, do it because you learn, be a nerd!",
    "Absolutely take this course. The seminar is so much better than the lecture because you get to engage with your professor and learn so much more.",
    "If a student has interest in economics, then I recommend this course. It's a great overview of introductory marco and the small, seminar setting is a great way to learn.",
    "This class is a good way to take intro macroeconomics. I think the curve is a bit tougher than the lecture and the problems are a little bit tougher as well, but I think overall the class was more enjoyable than what some of my friends experienced in the lecture. I would recommend taking this class over the lecture.",
    "I would not take this class just for the heck of it. It is not like Micro. Although it is not a QR credit, there is a lot of math and it is difficult. However, if you are interested in growth, the effects of fiscal and monetary policy and\/or financial systems, I would recommend it.",
    "If Sigga comes back to Yale, take this over the lecture. Even though I took the lecture last semester and had no background in macro, I didn't feel unprepared compared to my classmates at all. You'll look back at the end of the semester and be amazed how much you learned in the class. Take it, take it, take it.",
    "Since Sigga is leaving this year, you probably should be careful in taking this class next year--choose on whether or not the professor is good. Sigga was excellent at explaining things. Overall, the class was much more quickly paced than the lecture. You do way more math than in micro! Also, be prepared to have classmates who already know a substantial amount of econ.",
    "This was a great class but honestly, with Sigga leaving, it's hard to evaluate how good it'll be in the future, since there's apparently a huge difference in teaching ability between her and Alonso. It was great to learn this in seminar style because it meant we could go on tangents in class and talk in depth about some of the economic policy debates and important events of the recent financial crisis in depth. The problem sets are manageable and only take a couple hours each week. The material isn't too hard to master also and it's fairly cumulative in how you study the economic models because the book is laid out well, so it's not too hard to review for the final. But the reason that I really loved this class was because of Sigga and her efficient, yet interesting lecturing style and the fact that I feel like I learned way more about real world economics than simply the models in the textbook. Either way, intro macro seminar is a solid class, but it's unfortunate that you can't have Sigga.",
    "Take the lecture for an easier grade.",
    "I would, without question, recommend Economics 111. It is a great intro to macro econ and is in credibly relevant.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you want to take macro, take the seminar over the lecture. If you want to major in Econ, which a lot of the students in the class do, you should take the seminar. Having taken the micro lecture in the fall, the seminar format of the class is better. There is a pset every week with a midterm and a final. Sigga is leaving and won't be teaching it next year, so I don't know if it'll be as good. She was great.",
    "Covered lots of topics quickly. Definitely read the book!!! I didn't until the night before the exam, and realized that the book was really concise and well structured; right to the point. The lecture slides are good if you understand them fluently; most times it took me longer to linger on a concept in the lecture slides than to actually read the book, which provides just enough info for you to understand the concept, but not more.",
    "SO MUCH BETTER THAN LECTURE. The grading is tough, though",
    "I would recommend this course for someone pursuing the major. The course is very theoretical, and for me, much harder than microeconomics."
