   "comments": [
    "Animal studies! But she uses animals to help you get into your body kinetically and leave behind all the heady thoughts that often impair acting.",
    "It's a fun class. You may get frustrated, but that's to be expected. All acting classes come with their fault lines. Let the earthquake be your physical body's improvement.",
    "Polina is a kind and committed teacher, but don't ask too many questions or she will go off on long tangents. The class is not too much work and will help you get into your body. However, I recommend you do scene study instead of animal work as some of the exercises can get repetitive.",
    "Only take it if you are a very serious actor and want to spend a semester sifting through a lot of ridiculousness to find the helpful tools Polina can provide you with. You have to be patient and have to crave the help from her and then you will get something out of it. It's a class that actors should take and everyone else should avoid. Also there's hardly and work at all which is pretty nice. That being said, your experience in the class will be benefited by you putting in the extra time that is not necessarily seen to supplement your experience. I didn't put in enough of this time and I regret it",
    "This class is a complete gamble: the \"spirit animal\/kinetic mind\" methodology is a crazy one. Going through (and sometimes trudging through) animal work certainly provides a few moments of great illumination, but there were also plenty of days where we wasted huge amounts of time talking, and getting very little useful material out of it. Everyone I know has mixed feeling about this class - a lot of struggle and frustration for a few valuable gems of wisdom and personal knowledge. Polina can be a very polarizing figure: if you don't find her at least fascinating on the first day, don't stick with the class. Her disorganization is paramount."
