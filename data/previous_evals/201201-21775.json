    "You'll be a fool not to take it. It was the epitome of my Yale experience. Simply life-changing.",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale by far. The short stories that we read were great, and class discussions were interesting and engaging. Professor Cunningham is incredible, truly dedicated and very interested in helping his students. Take this class if you get in.",
    "You spend the first portion of the semester reading and analyzing stories before moving into a workshop. Both are rewarding. It's a solid class. Take it.",
    "Reading Fiction for Craft is amazing, and fun. I learned a lot about the ways in which fiction writers' minds work, and I learned to apply that to my own writing. I wish there had been more time for me to work on my story, but that's the end of the semester crunch for you. This class is a super way to start figuring out short stories and your own personal style of writing with a group of fantastic people and with a very experienced, hilarious, super helpful professor. Take it if you get the chance, because it is an opportunity you absolutely should not pass up.",
    "It's a wonderful class, one of my favorites at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. go super early during shopping period, and raise your hand AND TALK. honestly, speak up. that is so critical. if you are unsure, then get the hell outta the way and let some desperate kid experience the kind and guiding hands of Michael Cunningham, who will change your life.",
    "If you really want to write, consider classes that have you write more.",
    "This is a great course if you are just beginning to think of writing fiction. The workload isn't all that much; the writing responses every week take like 2-8 hours, and the reading is great. I really became a much better reader and writer after taking this course - MC forces you to consider each word you put down on paper. And at the end of it, I had my first short story!",
    "Summary: Read several pieces a week. Complete a writing exercise each week.Recommended? Yes! Obviously, take writing courses while you're at Yale. Within that, try to take a fiction course, because it will make you respect your imagination and observations and the craft of writing in new and exciting ways. Cunningham's class is great for fostering a community around this pursuit and for stretching each student's writing abilities.",
    "Great, well structured class. Professor Cunningham spends the first half of the semester going over the main components of fiction. You have weekly exercises, short writing assignments in which you apply the things you've learned. The second half of the semester is a workshop--each student gets one story workshopped. I really feel like my writing improved because of the theoretical grounding Prof. Cunningham gave us in the first half of the class.",
    "its the best class ever. cunningham is amazing and approachable"
