   "comments": [
    "While seminar size, this runs like a rambling lecture. The material is slim but interesting. Definitely sparked some excellent debates with my friends. The professor responds well to requests for help. The writing is a unique (think terse, personal, and out of the box) type of response that helps you grow as a writer. Very interesting class, would recommend to anyone who enjoys philosophy, arguing, computers, or generally thinking",
    "Great course, but difficult. Fantastic topic, fascinating reading, and great, in-depth discussion; invaluable training on how to write well. Topics revolve around the philosophy of the mind, and where (if) computers fit in. Superbly taught! Prof Gelernter says all the right things, in the best, clearest way. Workload is well designed - lots of time and effort spent on writing small pieces well: 4 short papers, 300 words each, and a 1500 word final, and minimal reading; but meeting stylistic expectations requires a lot of time and effort (worth it, though). Grades reflect this. Prof Gelernter is pleasant and witty; great class environment.",
    "Light work: ~4 readings total, four 300 word essays, one 1500 word final. However, NOT an easy A, as Gelernter grades mercilessly for \"clear\", concise, unabashed writing. Still, the topic (can we build software minds?) is interesting, and you get to think deeply about it thanks to the class's plodding pace. Gelernter is intelligent and makes good points, but he tends to dominate the discussion, rarely soliciting input except to confirm his own views. He also goes on tangents about his political views, which I found utterly amusing. Take it as you will.",
    "I recommend the class",
    "I think it was a good course in the philosophy of the mind. It taught me how to be a much better, concise writer. I loved the themes we went over in class, although we might have spent a little too much time on some concepts. Also, this class teaches better writing by fear, and although it somewhat worked for me, it doesn't always work for all students. Instead of scaring them with a C on their first paper, I believe a better method is to force people to turn in drafts and proofread those (by the professor). This way, we don't get, what I felt was, somewhat arbitrary grading on our papers. I would recommend this class IF you're already a good writer. I took this class to become a better writer, but my way of learning is not through being threatened with a failing grade. IF you're not a good writer and wouldn't mind a drop in your GPA or would like to see some really low grades on your papers, sure, go ahead and take this class. Nevertheless, the subject matter IS really good. I spent about 10+ hours per paper on this class, and still got low scores on them..."
