   "comments": [
    "the content is very interesting but the evaluations do not necessarily reflect how you understand these topics. i would probably still take it, though.",
    "This is an okay-good course take it if you have some particular interest in Africa otherwise give something else a try.",
    "I recommend this class to any student interested in learning about Sub Saharian Africa. The lectures are enjoyable and the assigned books are really good.",
    "It's an interesting class regardless of whether or not you are interested in a future in African politics. It's a thought provoking class that widens one's global perspective on politics around the world, with Africa as the focus in this case",
    "Good course that gives you a solid foundation of trends in African politics since the end of colonization. midterm + final + take-home exam. If you want an intro to the issues, take this course. No prior background necessary.",
    "Great class! I highly recommend taking it. I didn't know anything about African politics beforehand, and this class provided a great overview. Professor Carlson is an engaging lecturer and has a great sense of humor. The workload mainly consists of reading the books assigned, which unlike in most of my other classes are actually extremely interesting and easy to get through. There's one midterm (all IDs) and a final (part IDs, part take-home paper).",
    "If you want to have a general view of African Politics, take this class.",
    "Very good class with the exception of the take-home final. I think the take home was unnecessary and easily could have been replaced with an in class short answer test. Small class size makes it more of a \"leminar\" but that made class more interactive. Did not get much out of section.",
    "Political Science 385 is a great overview of African politics; it gives a historical context to the current situation in African politics with a discussion of colonialism and major events in African politics history but it also focuses on current trends within African politics. I would recommend this to another student because I think that it is a political science class that some people might overlook but is definitely something that is VERY important to know about. In addition, the readings are very interesting and I looked forward to doing the reading every week because they were memoirs and journalists' accounts of certain events.",
    "It was a good course. I do recommend this class.",
    "I really enjoyed Intro to African Politics. Professor Carlson is knowledgeable and passionate about the class and it shows daily. Her powerpoint presentations are thorough, useful and it's awesome that she puts them online. The class is straightforward, with an ID midterm, an ID in-class final and another final essay due sometime during finals period. She gives you the IDs for the midterm and in-class final a few days before the tests and the IDs come directly from the powerpoints. There's a good amount of reading, but the books are enjoyable and actually very much related to what we learn in class. If you're looking for a great class that investigates various problems and triumphs in variety of African countries, take this class.",
    "I would recommend this if you're interested in Africa at all. This continent is often ignored and considered primitive and corrupt when it comes to politics. This class lets us know how much that belief is true and why this area is the way it is. Although it's difficult to study an entire continent inone semester, it was great to get this little bit of an overview of the region and section and lecture are interesting too."
