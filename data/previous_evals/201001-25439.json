   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It's more laid-back since it's not meant for art majors, so it's definitely a great chance to refine and\/or develop an artistic eye.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. The outside work was not too great, and if you are interested in expanding your ability to draw, it is really helpful.",
    "yes, definitely! i wish i had taken more art classes. great change of pace from other yale courses",
    "Sam's basic drawing class is wonderful. Unlike many of the other drawing sections, his approach is very laid back and non intimidating. You don't need to worry about being \"good\" at drawing, since he recognizes that people have different styles of mark making and different levels of natural talent. There isn't really an emphasis on making completed projects, so you basically work on your drawing for the day and start fresh the next class, which keeps everything low pressure. Sam also emphasizes drawing in class as the best way to improve, so the at-home assignments are kept to a minimum. It's a really fun break in the day, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone! I'm not entirely sure how the class will be graded, but I feel like most people take it Cr\/D anyway, even though honestly it really doesn't seem like it is necessary to do so because it's honestly not much work at all.",
    "I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS CLASS. if i could make that any bigger font, i would. ive never ever taken a drawing class before, only took one art class in high school, and have never considered myself an artist in any way. Sam messer was UNREAL and the class is so pressure free. i went into the class so intimidated because i assumed everyone else was going to be a stellar artist but that wasn't the case at all. sam really looks to help you develop your skills, at your own pace, and recognizes that there isn't just one way to do things- he wants everyone to figure out their own style instead of implimenting his own, which was so nice. he was always constructive in his criticism and never once did i feel like i was being attacked or judge for my (lack of?) skills. i improved so much- this class ultimately brought the artist out of me and by the end i was always surprising myself with how good my drawings turned out. its also almost no work outside of class at all- you just go, chill out for 2 hours in class, get a nice break from the normal grind of things, and then go on with your day afterwards. i never even had to go in and work on my drawings after class was done",
    "Basic Drawing with Sam is pretty laid back, but youlearn a lot about how to draw. You're expected to work hard in class, but don't have too much work outside of class (the final project is the biggest assignment). I definitely recommend it. You start with simple things like eggs and circles and move on to draw models and portraits. It's a lot of fun and a great change in pace from other classes. You also get to look at more professional pieces on slides and in the art gallery and learn a lot from that. I definitely feel like I look at art differently now and have improved as an artist. Be prepared to buy lots of extra materials (pencils, paper, charcoal, etc.) though.",
    "Fun, and very little work. Take it if you want to draw for credit.",
    "Yes! If you're thinking about taking basic drawing, you should definitely consider taking it with Sam. It is something different than Robert Reed's boot camp, but it's a really enjoyable and incredibly rewarding class. You might be confused as a Yale student by the lack of emphasize on concrete assignments but just roll with it! You'll learn to draw immensely better.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to anyone. No drawing experience is necessary, and you certainly improve a lot. Also, it is a nice class to have as it is different from most of the classes we take and it's a good escape from stress and written work and reading. We barely had homework. For the most part, it was coming to class, drawing and leaving. And Sam is absolutely great.",
    "Absolutely take this class before you graduate.",
    "It had a very relaxed atmosphere and was very encouraging. I definitely recommend it.",
    "Take this class with sam! Loved it!!",
    "Do it, but only with Messer, because I hear otherwise it's a lot of work.",
    "Yes, especially with Sam. He makes the course painless, and personally, art is very relaxing."
