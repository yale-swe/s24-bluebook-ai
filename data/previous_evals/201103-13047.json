   "comments": [
    "If you need a research methods requirement that fulfills the neuroscience track requirement and are looking for a good hands on course, this is a good option but be prepared for a good amount of time commitment however the workload itself is quite manageable.",
    "Yes, please. If you are a psych major and have the opportunity to take this course, do so. Professor Wagner is incredible and the material is interesting. In addition, you get a rat for the entire semester which you get to train every week. It is not very time demanding but very fruitfull.",
    "A research methods class - the actual content of the class is pretty dry and the whole first half of the class isn't very applicable to much. It's pretty interesting to know, but it's mostly just dry, abstract learning theory stuff. Working with the rats is a lot of fun, although it sucks up a lot of your time. Professor Wagner isn't teaching it next year, though, so the lectures may be different.",
    "Really interesting. Some of the concepts at the beginning of the class are hard to understand, but if you keep at it you'll eventually get them. Also, working with the lab rats was a rewarding experience and gave me a taste of what working in Psych lab settings is like.",
    "Only consider this if you're a Psych major, because otherwise you'll get annoyed with all the extra work this class requires. It's a good class overall, if only because it gives exposure to a the behaviorism approach which is not often explored at Yale. Though associative learning and behaviorism are not really my thing, it was good to get perspective on how the thinking goes and to have a very systematic approach to the questions posed (which is often overlooked, in favor of producing 'popular psychology' books).Wagner is very intelligent, but he can come across as a jerk in a lot of ways and turns a lot of students off because of things he says. HOWEVER, he is a kind man, it just takes a little patience and attention to try to understand what he's teaching. Besides, the whole field is based on him, so it's definitely worth it.Also, if you feel conflicted about your lab rat at the end of the semester... http:\/\/www.ratfanclub.org\/adopt.html",
    "Take this course if you have an interest in animal conditioning and learning. Be aware that it will be largely focused on behaviorism, and don't expect this to have a low workload. You're responsible for your rat's feeding and testing throughout the semester pretty much daily. In addition, the lecture material requires some extra studying.",
    "Class is really a lecture one day (with professor Wagner talking) and a lab review the next day with the TA giving instructions. The actual material is not difficult to understand except for the whole Rescola-Wagner formula. Keeping up with the lab and feeding the rat can cause some last minute panic attacks for the less organizationally minded, especially as the exact requirements are not online--you have to be vigilant in class! Professor Wagner reminded me of a wise, kindly, and extremely vital Grandfather. He clearly cares a lot about the field (he was a pioneer after all!).",
    "It's confusing and difficult to understand. Working with the rats is a lot of fun though.",
    "This is probably the best Research Methods class to take. The material can be difficult but it's interesting. Not too much work. Rat training is a cool procedure and you get to do a class experiment with your rats at the end.",
    "If you want to work with animals in the future then I would definitely recommend this course. However, Professor Wagner was very unapproachable. When I approached him with questions, his responses were condescending and unhelpful. I found him to be very pompous and mean. Thank God he is retiring.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Unfortunately for you all, Professor Wagner is retiring after this semester and you will never be able to take Rat Lab with the guy who pretty much invented everything it is that you'll be learning. Unless you go to wherever Rescorla teaches. But you don't. You go to Yale. So too bad for you. Okay, but still. This class is AMAZING. The rats are SOCUTE and you get a chance to adopt them at the end (though they can't live in your dorm so you should think about that in advance otherwise they are going to be KILLED). There are two exams and a final lab report as well as some labs you have to do for the class. The first exam was really hard but the second was quite easy. The lab report seems intimidating at first but it's pretty much a culmination of what you have been spending the last 3 months doing, so when it comes down to actually writing it, it goes by really quickly. Plus the methods section was written out for us by the amaaaazing Stephanie Maddox (TF). You have to feed your rats every weekday but that's fun!"
