   "comments": [
    "I don't really know how I would describe the class to another student. But I would recommend it to other students.",
    "The course was very good. Instead of focusing on small details and losing focus, it challenged us to make sure that our answers to our research problems actually made sense in the context of a cellular environment.",
    "I would say that it provides a lot of useful information that we should know for qualifying exams, but not to take it simultaneously with any other classes that require a lot of work because it takes a significant amount of time.",
    "Lectures and discussions on macromolecular structures\/interactions, and biophysical techniques used to study them.",
    "As I experienced it, I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. If the powerpoints were remade and a distinct effort to clarify the overall and daily goals of the course and what we are expected to be learning\/gaining I might recommend it as I think the overall message of the course is an important one.",
    "I would highly recommend the class to another student as it greatly help my perspective on the biological world.",
    "There's a lot of information, but it comes at you a little helter-skelter, which may work for some but maybe not for others.Much might be able to be learned from group interactions - and I think it works for some people - but it kind of destroyed some of the momentum of the lecture and things seemed to hold together kind of loosely.Nevertheless, what you'll learn at the start of the class and the end is what you should take the course for. That much is good."

   "comments": [
    "All important things to know, especially knowing the various size calibration points and things to consider for molecular interactions",
    "We learned a lot about protein-protein interactions and how to evaluate the quality of the literature depicting these interactions. This is an invaluable tool going forward.",
    "It helped me to learn a lot of basic things that no one really thinks to teach us in the first year of grad school. I think it will be valuable for qualifying exams.",
    "Good review of fundamental concepts of thermodynamics and macromolecular interactions",
    "I'm not sure as I do not really know what I learned from this course other than how to make a network, which may be useful.",
    "The class will be very useful when thinking about all aspects of my research just to have a general handle on what sizes and concentrations seem to \"make sense\".",
    "Knowledge of available techniques, Reynolds number, and thinking about biological scale.Like most of these evaluations, my answers are a little contradictory - even though it may not have been my favorite course, it was useful, and I am glad that I took it. I just wonder if I could have done better or have been more engaged."
