   "comments": [
    "If you enjoy studying language for the sake of studying languages (that's me), take SPAN 243. If you don't but you still want to perfect your Spanish, still take SPAN 243. Either way you won't regret it. You review a lot of essential grammar and learn new stuff on top of it. I feel like my Spanish improved a lot in this class. And of course, Profesora Sybil Alexandrov is a marvelous person. Take it with her!",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it if you want to solidify your spanish grammar skills. If you're interested in taking higher level spanish literature courses, this is good class to take beforehand.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! There's a lot of homework, but it's a consistent amount each class and usually not too difficult. Profesora Alexandrov is funny and engaging, and I was surprised by how much my speaking and writing improved. The grammar is definitely a step up from high school Spanish classes, but the class moves at a good, manageable pace.",
    "This course is a lot of work. Be prepared to do many hours of homework per week. This class is only worth it if you would really like to perfect your grammar in a demanding environment. If you can, take the class with Alexandrov!",
    "If you're into the details, then absolutely. It's not necessarily a light workload, but it's fairly rewarding and as long as you put in the effort, you should do well. In the end, you will have really solidified your grammar\/writing skills. I have no regrets about taking this course!!",
    "SPAN 243 is a rewarding course if you put in the necessary amount of work. I highly recommend it to students considering going abroad or those who want to improve the technical quality of their writing (be warned that this is not a writing course).",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is an intensive study of the mechanics of the Spanish language. It is a rigorous course, even by Yale's standards. You should expect around 9-10 hours of outside work for this course every week. Taking this course will help youimmensely if you are looking to become fluent in Spanish. But it will be demand a lot of your time and it will take persistent effort on your part. I think what I learned in this course is invaluable, but that's just me. You will need to look at the syllabus and then decide for yourself whether you can commit to this course. A helpful tip: If you do choose to take this course, take it in a term when you are only taking four classes, otherwise, you might burn out. Still, worth it. Especially if you take the course with Prof. Alexandrov.",
    "A pretty big pain, but you learn things you need to know if you actually want to know Spanish. The homework is less cerebral than all the other classes I was taking, which sometimes was annoying because it felt like a waste of a class but other times was a huge relief. If you are very self-motivated, you are probably better off reading the book on your own.",
    "Well-organized and well-taught, but it's an unrelenting stream of work. The class requires around 60-90 minutes of homework, three times a week, which isn't actually that bad but I got sick of it by the end of the semester. I do think my Spanish improved, although it didn't help much with my now-hilarous inability to hold a conversation, now that Advanced Conversational Spanish is a year and a half in the past.It's overall a very good class though, and Sybil Alexandrov is the perfect instructor. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their Spanish (particularly for eventually taking Spanish literature classes), pays attention to details, and is willing to put in the work."
