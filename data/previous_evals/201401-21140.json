   "comments": [
    "I do recommend this course strongly whether it's taught by Prof. Gordon or Eire. The reading materials are very interesting and the discussions are quite enjoyable.",
    "If you're interested in the topic, take this class. Workload isn't bad--two 5 page papers, midterm, and final, and a short response each week for section. The readings are mostly primary sources and they're usually fairly short and interesting. Prof. Gordon is a really nice guy and his lectures are very clear and organized. You learn about the Reformation from different perspectives beyond just Luther and Calvin, so the class was really informative and interesting. The second paper is on either a book from the Beinecke or a painting from the art gallery, so you can have fun with it. Overall the class is pretty low-stress and laid back. All parts of the course (2 papers, midterm, final, and section) are each 20% of your final grade so there isn't too much pressure to do really well on just one thing, which takes the stress off as well. This is a good class, and definitely worth taking if you want to learn more about the subject.",
    "For anyone interested in the relationship between religion and politics, especially during such a fascinating period in history, this course is excellent. The workload is quite manageable (two 5-page papers, a midterm, and a final), and Professor Gordon does a great job of highlighting what's important to know and understand. Also, there are two fun trips to the Beinecke and the Art Gallery. I highly recommend this course.",
    "A course about the Protestant Reformation that touches on reformers such as Calvin and Luther, so-called \u201cradical\u201d reformers such as the Anabaptists and Puritans, as well as the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Although it is a course about religion, it isn\u2019t a religion course per-se. You learn the huge impact this movement had on history and how Europe was influenced by such changes. The workload is definitely manageable\u2014the readings are primary sources intended to supplement the lectures. I actually enjoyed writing both papers and taking both the midterm and final as I felt like they did a good and fair job of reflecting the material covered in the course. I am Catholic, but felt that my opinions and views were highly valued and I felt like it was super interesting to learn about other churches and the Catholic response to the Reformation. I would definitely recommend this course especially to a student interested in majoring in history who is not afraid of having grad students in a course with him\/her.",
    "This is a great survey-ish course of the 16th century. It achieved a great balance of themes, primary sources, exploration of historiography, and straight up facts. I would highly recommend this class. I had never studied the Reformation with this sort of depth and it was interesting from both a religious and historical point of view. It would up being a really great class with a reasonable workload (all the work was interesting and related to the course, the essay prompts were really fun). I felt like the course lost focus a little bit in the second half, but part of that was reflective of how varied the effects of the reformation actually were, so I'm not sure thats a fair criticism of the course.",
    "Great class. Not too much work, some of the readings were a bit irrelevant but overall a lot of fun and very interesting."
