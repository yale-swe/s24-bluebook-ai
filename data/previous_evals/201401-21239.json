    "All Yalies should take this class, not just NROTC midshipmen. It was a great way to think about leadership and to learn about some of the techniques and challenges that many of us will face, whether in the Navy or not.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone if they do not have to take it. It's fairly elementary and the coursework is not worth it for not receiving any credit.",
    "If you are not in Navy ROTC, do not take this class...I don't know why you would because you don't even get credit for it. If you are in Navy ROTC, be smart and schedule a mandatory class during this class so you do not have to sit through the ridicuousness of it. I can tell you right now all you'll learn from this class: the only leaders you should care about is Chuck Norris and some dude who was represented in a piece of British art a long long time ago.",
    "If you are not in NROTC, I recommend that you do not take this course. Look instead for courses through the Jackson Institute if you want to study leadership.",
    "I would say that L&M is a class you shouldn't take unless you have to. In other words, its workload doesn't merit Yale credit and should not attempt to enroll civilian students who contribute little but platitudes and generalizations to discussion.",
    "A great overview of Leadership and Management skills, not just specific to the Navy, but to any workplace. Leadership isn't just something that people pick up. Leadership as both an art and a science, so learning these skills was extremely useful"
