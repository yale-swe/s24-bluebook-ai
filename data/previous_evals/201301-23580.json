Learning about the indigenous communities and their appreciation for nature was very humbling. After taking this course, I learned the importance of slash burn systems that were previously thought to be linked to environmental degradation.",

    "The topic of indigenous silviculture is largely ignored in academia, and I feel extremely grateful to have been able to take a course that helps me appreciate indigenous peoples and their extraordinary knowledge bases. Dr. Peter's teaching style is different from many other teachers at FES, and I found this really refreshing. He speaks extremely candidly about his experiences and opinions, which I thought was fascinating. He's extremely open to student participation, which greatly helped my learning process. His lectures have an ideal mix of large concepts and actual examples in the field, many of which are his own personal experiences."

Learning about local knowledge and their ability to work with nature is important prior to doing any conservation and development and management works.",

I am interested in sustainable forestry in Latin America, and this course gave me a much need view on the indigenous practices that have long existed in this region and how development activities have and may continue to threaten these activities. Having taken this course, I will go forward in my career with a much greater sensitivity and appreciation for local knowledge and practices."

He's brilliant, and really into the subject, but just doesn't make the kind of dynamic connection between students and the material that you would want.",
