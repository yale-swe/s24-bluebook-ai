    "An excellent continuation to conducting for those with experience. It is at once challenging and enlightening. Take it, I say!",
    "Great course if you are interested in more conducting.",
    "If you took introductory, then you know what you're in for: a few lectures on techniques, score study, rehearsing, etc., and then 10-20 minutes of podium time every few weeks with the class ensemble, depending on the class size. You play great repertoire and gain experience in a low-stress, workshop environment.",
    "Easy music elective if you're looking for one, good opportunity to practice on the podium if you're looking for that. Can be as much or as little work as you want it to be."
