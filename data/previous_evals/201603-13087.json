    "I learned about the relationship between objects' materiality and their cultural, historical, and social meanings. The first half of the course was all theory (Marx, Alexander, Burke, Benjamin, Miller, etc), and the second half was all empirical studies of topics such as nature, taste, gender, branding, architecture, music. I gained an understanding of how objects become meaningful to people, how the physical, sensuous surfaces of objects present those meanings, and how objects and their meanings help people to make sense of the world (iconic consciousness). It was a very interesting course and allowed me to delve deeply into topics that interested me. I have a better understanding of how people and objects relate in the world!",
    "I gained insight into the formation of icons and the function of iconic consciousness in everyday experiences.",
    "I learned a new way of thinking about the world: in terms of iconic consciousness and power, and the way we use material forms to feel emotions, convey cultural and societal norms, etc."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus is absolutely phenomenal. Make sure you stay on top of the readings for the first half of the class because they're absolutely critical for understanding anything at all. Honestly, I would want to read everyone else's papers. I gained a lot of respect for the other students in the class and their styles of thinking. I would have enjoyed seeing how other people were taking their ideas on paper. I was also excited and proud of my own ideas and I would have liked to share them. Even if we didn't share the papers, it would have been nice to have an opportunity to go around the table one day and share what we were writing about (like 2 min spiels) and have commentary from the other students. The one piece of critical feedback I have is that for such a heady class, I think late afternoon on a Thursday is kind of a rough time. By the end of the day, people were often pretty droopy and less engaged.",
    "Disorganized. The fact that the TF graded all our work but didn't come to seminar was annoying, although I thought both she and the professor were great. Anne Marie gives really precise and detailed feedback. Nevertheless, the content of the class was really interesting and challenging, and it enabled me to think in new ways about a lot of things.",
    "There's a lot of reading, and some of it is a little hard to read (lots of sociological jargon) but most of it is very interesting, especially when you get to the second half of the course when you look at empirical studies (applications to the real world). The seminars themselves often felt long and a little disorganized, and the discussion depends on how willing people are to participate. Prof Alexander has a good sense of humor though. I loved that everyone in the class came from different backgrounds and majors, so they brought different perspectives. Our TF, Anne Marie Champagne, was wonderful and gave great feedback on our weekly reading responses and papers. Office hours with Anne Marie and Prof Alexander were extremely helpful!!! The class really allows you to explore the aspects of the course material that interest you, so how enjoyable it is will be based on how much effort you put into learning and how much you engage with the material. The course could be improved in a few ways: beginning class by clarifying theorists' ideas and definitions of terms (sometimes the readings were confusing, so having a firm grasp on the subject matter would aid in writing clearer papers and having focused discussions), giving background information on the readings and guiding questions for us to examine while we do the readings so we are more prepared for the discussion, and using slides and visuals during discussions to make it more engaging. Discussing relevant applications to our lives was always the highlight of the discussions.",
    "I think that slightly more emphasis on student-led discussions would be beneficial later in the semester. Overall, reading responses were useful and seminar discussions were well-organized and fluid.",
    "There were a lot of fascinating readings in this class and I enjoyed writing the weekly responses. Discussions got better as the semester went along, and though everyone in class certainly could have put in more effort to contribute ideas, I would have appreciated more effort on part of the professor to create a more warm and open learning environment in the first place. This class was sadly more enjoyable on paper than in person. I'm not sure why this class has a TA, given that it's a discussion seminar and that the TA was not actually present herself in class. It was strange to get no direct feedback on any written assignments from Professor Alexander.",
    "It is great. Perhaps if Professor Alexander wrote down our names earlier in the year, we would have all participated more (he did this a few classes in). I also wish Professor Champagne could have been more involved! The course itself as well as the professors were terrific, though!"

    "Yes! I really enjoyed this class. Even as a student with no background in sociology, I definitely felt that I was able to engage critically with the ideas in the class, though it was challenging. The beginning of the class is a bit intimidating and theory-heavy, but it's all really cool stuff and Alexander explains why it's relevant to the thought-vein we develop in the class. And the ideas become even more clear and vivid as you take them through the various case studies in the second half of the class-- it would have been nice if Alexander had told us that though. There's also a ton of intellectual freedom. Once you've grasped the theoretical foundations of iconic consciousness, this is one of those classes that follows you into your day-to-day life. For the papers, you have a lot of freedom to bring in whatever it is that you happen to be thinking about, and explore how iconic consciousness is relevant.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the class because it will show you how to think in new and surprising ways about stuff that you encounter avery day (or that you don't, but that you think of as a piece of furniture in our culture). There's definitely a lot of reading, and weekly reading responses, but if you're interested in the material and the theory it's worth it. Your interest might sort of ebb and flow from week to week, because in the second half of the course they are each a disparate topic that are related by theory stuff. Professor Alexander is really smart--he's not going to be your friend but he'll challenge you intellectually (and sometimes he's pretty funny!). He also appreciates being challenged right back, which is more rare than you might expect at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it because you gain a better understanding of the world and EVERYTHING around you.",
    "Yes, it is very instructive for other studies in sociology and other humanities disciplines.",
    "Yes. No matter what field you enter, what you cover in this course is invaluable because it's all about the world around us and how people subconsciously interact with it. Especially if you want to do any kind of marketing\/advertising, or just pull off a certain look with clothes, posture, appearance in general, etc., then this course is such an eye-opener. That is all I will say; the rest is a surprise for you! Now, the class is a pretty small seminar so make sure to pay attention; you might be cold-called, but the professor is very nice and the environment is really relaxed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to an architecture student, because it is very interesting to treat design as the making of iconic objects and analyze them from an aesthetic perspective."
