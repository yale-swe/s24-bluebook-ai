   "comments": [
    "Great introduction to the Civil War Literature as promised. Interesting class discussions. Even if you're not a Political Science major you should be able to find something you like in this course though it may make you feel a little over your head with all the statistical methodologies we critique throughout the course. This should not dissuade you though,the professor makes himself very available if you need help with understanding these more technical aspects of the papers we read. Well designed course and good readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was thorough, entertaining, and at times thought-provoking. Also, the heavy use of quantitative methods provided a nice look at a side of political science that one does not really see in intro courses.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Definitely! Underclassmen thinking about being political science majors should seriously consider taking a class like this - especially one taught by Nils.As a senior, I still learned a lot. Political science is kind of lacking in a clear method, but this class was a good intro to various methods I wish I had had more time to explore."
