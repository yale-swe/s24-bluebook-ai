    "Math 112 is the most basic calculus you can receive here, and it really does fit that criteria. The attention paid to this class was significantly smaller than any of my other classes, and the strictness of the syllabus was rather flexible. That being said, it really depends on where your skill level is for calculus from high school, and this class will be helpful if you need some of the overarching theoretical concepts taught to you.",
    "Take it if you need an easy QR and took Calc in high school. Get a tutor.",
    "Not at all. People think this class is easy going in, and then you get dealt with a horrible professor who will throw incredibly hard exams at you. Particularly the second midterm in the class, some people walked out because of how hard it was. All in all a very poor course, if it's taught with another professor then perhaps consider it, but if its with Orszag don't even waste your time. There will be a ton of jerks who have taken Calculus and should be in Math 120 or higher, but are taking the lowest level math class to make themselves feel better about the fact that they are too scared to take another class. I felt like I wasted a credit taking this course, but you live and learn I guess.",
    "It is a good overview of limits and derivatives.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU NEED IT FOR ECON OR SOME OTHER MAJOR",
    "I don't really understand the demographic that takes Math112 but I'll hazard a guess. After spending a semester in this class, it seems that a third of the people are athletes (some smart, many dumb), a third are washed-out econ majors looking to fulfill a requirement without much work (me!) and the rest are horribly misguided freshman taking this class for the QR.Let me be clear. This is not a bad class. I actually enjoyed the exams (that's right, they turned out to be interesting, the questions really stressed conceptional material and the grading was extremely fair), and outside of the two midterms and finals, you really don't need to do much else in this class besides breathe to get an A. There is virtually no homework.To the poor freshman who take this class though, please please please do yourselves a favor and take a QR that is more interesting (like micro or astro!). While the instructors do their best to keep the class moving, a significant amount of the time is spent fielding questions like \"how do you divide dy by dx--I don't know how to solve something with that many variables\" (no joke). You don't want to put up with this nonsense.If you need to take this class, don't worry. It will be incredibly easy (the curve is ridiculous, sacrifice a goat to the Yale admissions committee when the curve on the first exam puts the A range between 70 and 100 percent) and the material is taught in such a way that even if you've already taken Calc BC you'll learn something new. Worst case, you'll get an excellent refresher in the math you breezed through three years ago.Contrary to CW, the class is actually taught well (e.g. everyone lecturing speaks excellent English). I don't think there was a single bad teacher the year I took it but YMMV, shop around (Ivan Ip was excellent).",
    "nope.",
    "There is no hand-holding in math 112. Homework is not due weekly, but right before each test. If you have little math motivation, like I do, you will fall behind. Classes are not interesting and it's easy to get bored. But most importantly, the tests are NOT easy! Luckily the mean is so low that no one does that badly, but is there not something wrong when the mean of your final is a 53? Take this course with caution!",
    "If you're not a math person and you can avoid taking then, then find another class to fulfill your QR requirement. The TAs skip many steps when they teach and the level of questions given on tests make the textbook useless as a studying tool.",
    "It is an easy QR credit class. If you have taken AP AB you will be fine.",
    "Math 112 is a boring college introductory calculus course. You will not enjoy it the slightest. I would not recommend it unless it were a requirement.",
    "I dislike math, but if you want or have to do it, go for it.",
    "It is a challenging course of mathematics, but if you work hard and study the material you can find success in the course. It is best to take the course if you like calculus, not just for a QR requirement. Mostly because there are a lot of problems to do each week, both online and written problem sets.",
    "Take it if you want to get a QR and you arent particularly amazing at math",
    "Well. If you have to do a math requirement for a major, I'd start with this class. The course, even if you've taken Calc before, will prove to be difficult (only on the tests, which is worth 90% of your grade).",
    "Yes. I really do not like or enjoy math but if you need to take a math this is the class to take.",
    "Only take it if it's absolutely necessary. I wouldn't recommend it if you can help not taking it simply because the exams will be very bad (the questions could be addressed better in class).",
    "Math 112 was exactly what I expected. It was a good overview of the first half of calculus. I don't think this is a course for people who excel at mathematics, but for those who need to finish a requirement or are interested in the basics of calculus, this course is great.",
    "I think Math112 is a good review for those have forgotten their basic calculus skills. However, the tests were nothing like the homework, and so be sure to pay close attention to the practice tests. Make sure to put enough time into them. They'll really help you out during the actual test.",
    "I would recommend Math 112 to another student if they have little to no background in Calculus or they need to refresh on derivatives.",
    "Take it only to fulfill a requirement.",
    "The material is not difficult in this course, but the evaluations are way beyond the difficulty that they should be. I would not recommend Math 112 to another student if they could help avoiding it.",
    "This course was fast paced and difficult. Prior knowledge of the subject matter may make the course relatively simple. But the tests are difficult for anyone not completely proficient in the course material (i.e. someone who should not be in the course to begin with). I would not suggest this course to anyone intending on keeping their GPA high."
