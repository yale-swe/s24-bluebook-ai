    "I now understand the central tenets of American Progressivism, along with the debates surrounding them and criticisms of them. I am very familiar with the challenges that Progressives faced in practice at the turn of the 20th Century, in the New Deal era, in the 1960s, and today. I think I'm at least a marginally better writer; students wrote more than 30 pages.",
    "This course's reading was some of the most complex I have ever completed; I learned to think critically about and tie together various strands of Progressive thinking in new ways. The course taught me a ton about Progressive theory and history, and it provides a lot of useful resources as I think about the challenges Progressivism faces going forward.",
    "I learned a great deal about American history, politics and political thought - most of which I had little experience with before this course. I was introduced to figures and philosophers that I had never encountered before, and I read a lot.",
    "I gained a lot of insight into the development of progressivism throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. It's a very convoluted theory that changed in practice and evolved with the Industrial Revolution and the Civil Rights Movement."

   "comments": [
    "Engagement with Progressivism's critics came more than a month after we read seminal Progressive texts. It seems as if a student of the course would need to \"do it all over again,\" in order to better evaluate Progressivism on its merits. The course is strong in that the readings are engaging, and you really learn what is at stake in the philosophy and politics of American government by the time the semester is over.",
    "The strengths of this course included the variety and depth of the readings we completed, as well as Professor Skowronek's vast well of knowledge and experience with the topics. I especially appreciated his mini-lectures at the beginning of each class to unravel difficult readings and frame the issues for discussion. Discussion, on the other hand, was often slow. Perhaps due to the sheer complexity of the issues at hand, I don't think we really dug into the material as much as possible. I would have appreciated a tad more guidance\/active discussion-leading from Professor Skowronek.",
    "I really enjoyed the reading material in this class. The volume was high, but manageable. I liked that the weeks were grouped into clear themes too. One of the things I struggled with was the structure of grading. It felt like so much effort had to go into getting the reading done, and yet, none of that counted much in the end, seeing as grading was so heavily weighted to the final. I would have like to be graded throughout the semester - maybe through weekly reading responses.",
    "Professor Skowronek is very knowledgeable and the structure of the course allows you to learn about progressive theory first and then see its weaknesses in application. Discussions were pretty weak though and I often left the class feeling like I gained little more than what the readings provided."

    "I took this course Credit\/D\/Fail in a six-credit semester, and emerge saying that I enjoyed it. I concede there is a lot of assigned reading that I often got to the point of skimming. The midterm was not daunting, but my spring break was so busy that I didn't put in the best effort. The final exam (there's also a \"paper track\" that I didn't do) feels like a lot, but answering three prompts of approximately 8 pages each felt \"easier\" than what would have been the longest paper I've ever written (on the \"paper track\"). At least he releases both sets of prompts earlier than he originally intended, too. As a participant during class, it's hard to figure out what Skowronek wants. Persuading him of new ideas is also difficult, meaning that I felt that asking questions was the easiest way to be an active participant. Still, I didn't talk that much.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in the origins and evolution of progressivism. I found it very useful to gain a strong theoretical understanding.. You should do the paper route rather than the exam route, because the exam route requires 3 10 page papers at the end whereas the paper route only requires a single 25 page one. It's easier to create content for one paper than it is for 3. If you're a conservative, I also recommend this class. It's less political and more intellectual, so you'll find that it's not really about left or right as much as it is about democracy and science. Prof Skowronek is a friendly guy and gives great overviews of the readings (there are a lot).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Its reading was voluminous (often 500 pages per week) and the themes, at times, difficult to unwind, but I feel like I know so much more about Progressivism--both as a theory and in practice. Professor Skowronek has an incredible amount of knowledge in the field, and he pushes students to develop their ideas and their writing.",
    "I recommend this course to a student with significant background in American Politics, who feels very comfortable with a heavy reading load, very comfortable speaking in class, and very comfortable with his or her ideas being challenged in a group setting.",
    "Yes. I found this course very challenging and stimulating, and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have to give a class their all.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in American history and political theory."
