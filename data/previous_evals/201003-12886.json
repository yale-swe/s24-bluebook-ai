    "A great way to learn conversational Persian for anybody who is interested. Would recommend this over the less intimate Arabic track. Work can be a bit overwhelming and teacher's demands are very high, but a beautiful language to try out.",
    "Good course in a unique language. Moves very fast, especially when the professor gets excited. Sometimes too fast. But it was enjoyable and I learned a lot of Persian.",
    "This class was very good despite being early in the morning. You talk a lot and get close with your class, which makes it a lot of fun. You learn very quickly, and feel like you have a decent grasp of the language after the first semester. The professor is very caring and does her best to make sure that every student understands what's going on, and will make sure to meet with you if you fall behind. The only problems is that class isn't always organized, so it's hard to stay on top of the vocabulary, especially for tests. Khanom is a very understanding grader though, so it won't hurt you too badly, and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Yes, take this class!",
    "Yes, Farsi is a beautiful language and relatively easy to learn. Once you grasp the basic rules of the grammar, regular homework keeps one up with the class. Taught quite well."
