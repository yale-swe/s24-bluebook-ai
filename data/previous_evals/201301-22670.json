   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Spanish 130, but it is very fast paced--so anyone looking for a starting point should be a pretty high level speaker and writer to begin with level three.",
    "I would say it's an easy A-, and if you put the extra time into it getting an A wouldn't be so hard either. Participation is important. Overall it was nice having a relatively easy class in such a busy schedule, but I don't really feel like my Spanish has improved much, if at all, between now and when I took the class.",
    "Be warned that L3 is a TON of work. It is difficult not to complain about 1+ hour of Spanish homework every night after being accustomed to 10 minutes in L1 and L2. L3 grammar is tough, and because of that, it is rewarding. It is not easy to get a good grade in this course, especially because Prof. Leon is a very tough grader. She's a sweetheart at heart and wants every student to do well, but at L3, Spanish is far from the gut it used to be. Make sure you talk a lot in her class; a lot of weight is placed on participation.",
    "This is atypical intermediate Spanish course. You will focus mostly on grammar, less on vocab. Lots of writing, both of quizzes and exams. Take with Profesora Leon if possible. She was excellent.Tons of homework, beware. There are assignments to be turned in every day AS WELL AS classroom preparation exercises or readings (easily 30-40 mins).Grading is typical of the Spanish department -- fairly difficult.",
    "Good class. Lots of grammar but you learn it well. Material is not too difficult but the grading can make it very challenging to do very well. The professor is good at explaining and throws in music and videos to keep things interesting.",
    "Spanish 130 is just a more in-depth overview of grammatical concepts and an introduction to more vocabulary. There are less exams and compositions than in L2 but a lot of homework and preparation. Professor Leon is very nice and helpful, but Spanish 130 does seem to be graded harder than other levels.",
    "Exactly what you would expect for an L3 language class. Definitely recommend it for anybody trying to improve their spanish skills or earn a Lang credit",
    "If my fellow student wanted to be fluent in Spanish, yes I would recommend the course."
