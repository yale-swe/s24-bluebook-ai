    "Not like any course I have ever taken.",
    "An excellent course. I think the approach of reflecting on what historians of political thought are actually doing is very valuable in understanding how it is that we should approach important texts. I think at times seminar discussion was a bit unfocused, and it might have been valuable to spend some time critically evaluating various figures' historical interpretations, rather than simply reconstructing them. Counter-intuitively, classroom discussion also was slow at times in part because most of the grad students never contributed. That said, I think the class was very well conceived and executed, and I came away with a different perspective on political theory than I have from the other classes I've taken on the topic. Professor Nakhimovsky is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, especially in office hours. His advice pointed me in many directions that not only helped with papers in his class, but were invaluable in thinking through my senior thesis and other future academic projects.",
    "This is fantastic seminar! Class discussions can delve in some fascinating questions and Nakhimovsky is very helpful re. final papers. The course does require a background in western political thought.",
    "I would summarize it as a loose comparative history of the histories of political though in Western Europe. These histories seemed consistently to be in service of a larger moral or political project. The course really seems to be a history of critique and attempts to unveil ideology, especially those aimed toward liberalism insofar as liberalism was the prevailing political ideology of modernity and was therefore responsible for the major conflicts in Europe and American from the 18th to the 20th century and beyond. As a relative new comer to political philosophy and the history of ideas it was an excellent, if at times overwhelming, introduction to political though as well."

   "comments": [
    "I found the course readings to be profoundly effective in helping to contextualize my other studies in my discipline. This discipline is so specialized that it was difficult to integrate it into class discussions, but I was happy for the exchange to be one way however. The research and paper I wrote for the course ended up being, not surprisingly, a helpful and fluid continuation of research\/work I was already engaged in."
