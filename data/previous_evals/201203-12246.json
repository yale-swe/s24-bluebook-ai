   "comments": [
    "You'd be surprised to know how much we end up knowing about Latin at the end of the course! An absolutely fabulous course, and perfect for a student who always wanted to try Latin but never had the chance!",
    "In essence, the class provides a solid foundation for future Latin and understanding the basics of the language. I would recommend the course to another student seeking to gain a better understanding of classical texts or the English language in general. Latin is a good choice to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who has any interest in the subject, enjoys history, or is wary of taking a modern language (which involves speaking and listening comprehension!). The department is small and really friendly, class is fun, and reading ancient authors is very rewarding. This was my favorite class of the semester, and I looked forward to going every day.",
    "If you put a higher-than-average amount of work into this course, it will be easy and rewarding. Many people mention the vocabulary as part of the workload. However, you will recognize the majority of the words you see, especially if you know a Romance language. You'll get into the mindset of committing forms to memory very quickly; then, there are so many parallels to be made with other languages that it's hardly any pure memorization in the end. Weekly quizzes are very superficial in content. Homework is not multi-media like in some languages; it's just doing exercises from a textbook. Maybe this is a good summary: it's like alinguistics course disguised as a language course!",
    "yes. latin is such a beautiful language and this course will definitely allows one to love it even more.",
    "As advertised, Latin 110 was a thorough introduction to the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of the language. There was a significant amount of memorization involved, but not an unreasonable amount for a beginning language class. By the 8th week, you'll be reading real Latin--Caesar, Virgil, Ovid, Catullus, and more. You will also gain a broad overview of Roman history and culture, which I particularly enjoyed. Note that because it is a dead language, you won't learn conversational Latin, so while you don't have to worry much about your pronunciation, you will spend that time learning even more grammar. This was my favorite class; you have to keep on top of the material, but will feel accomplished by the end of the term.",
    "The course is an excellent introduction course that would help students with no prior knowledge of the language to achieve an adequate level of understanding Latin at the end. Workload is heavy but not too demanding to be met. On the whole one of the best language courses I have been in."
