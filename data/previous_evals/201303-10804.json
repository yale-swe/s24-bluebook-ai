   "comments": [
    "Good for practicing and using advanced Chinese. You have to write a few essays.",
    "I recommend it for those wanting an intro to Chinese literature, not for those looking to improve their language skills.",
    "Chinese 164 is, primarily, a reading class. Very new novel excerpts are read, discussed in class, and written about. It's not too hard of a course, and the combination of the modern novels and Su laoshi's stories adds a cultural component to the class, in that the novels reflect eastern attitudes of family, relationships, etc. It's a good once-over for that kind of stuff, as well as Chinese literature.",
    "This is a fascinating class. The readings are of the highest quality--Mo Yan, Nobel Prize winner, is an author of one of the readings. This class lets you access such high levels of Chinese culture that would be absolutely impossible on your own, at least at my Chinese level. While Su Laoshi has high expectations, you have all the resources you need to succeed and will never feel left behind or utterly lost. Absolutely take this class!",
    "Yes, if you can handle it! This class was too hard for me, but if I had been at a better level I think I would have gotten a lot out of it. Su Laoshi is really fun and very, very kind. The readings are fun (though I found them frustratingly difficult - again, I probably should not have taken this course, but maybe YOU should!), and the essays are very chill and fun to write. Be aware that you don't spend a lot of time in class going over vocabulary and especially grammar\/sentence structure things - that was another aspect that I found tricky.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student seeking challenges in Chinese at the highest level. This class is very challenging, but if you absorb all the material, you will be much more confident in your applications with the Chinese language.",
    "It is a great class if you are looking for a deeper understanding of Chinese literature. We read great texts, and learn very interesting parts of Chinese society and culture. However, we didn't get to speak much in this class. If you are looking to improve your reading and writing skills, this is a great course for you.",
    "If you have a strong chinese background, I would only recommend this as an easy fifth class. If you are really looking to improve your chinese skills in a quantifiable way (ie: reading\/writing or speaking), this is probably not the best class for you. It offers an interesting look at traditional Chinese attitudes towards family and gender, and as such is a good class for cultural enrichment, but it's not particularly challenging and probably wont provide you with a whole lot more information than you already possessed prior to taking the class.",
    "The strengths of this course are that you get to read a lot of the famous Chinese post-Cultural Revolution literature in a pretty relaxed environment. It's a good course to introduce you to the field, and Su Laoshi has can supplement the readings with interesting stories, cultural notes, and his really strong understanding of language's intricacies.The weakness is that I'm not really sure what it makes you better at. My reading improved for literature, but my practical character recognition declined. My vocabulary didn't increase because there wasn't regular quizzes. My speaking definitely got worse because there's almost no opportunity to talk in class. The one thing that definitely did get better, however, was my writing. Su Laoshi has good general essay critique, if his personal feedback is lacking.Overall, it's a pretty low stress class that gets better as the year goes on. Su Laoshi could ramble less and be more open to discussion\/close reading of the text, but the absence of that does mean that you pretty much get to sit down and listen to someone smart talk about Chinese culture for an hour and fifteen minutes twice a week, which really isn't the worse thing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was sometimes a bit disorganized, and I felt as though I didn't always know the due dates, expectations for certain assignments, etc. My grammar\/vocabulary also didn't improve dramatically, but I did gain a much deeper appreciation for Chinese fiction and how beautiful it can be.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a relaxed Chinese class. The reading is really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class."
