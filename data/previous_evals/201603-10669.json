   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Case studies on issues of educational leadership and change.",
    "I learned a lot about leadership principles and the real-world implications of education policy. I think my skills as a communicator and group member improved, as well.",
    "I developed the skill of analyzing my own leadership skills and behavior, and I extensively increased my knowledge of the complexities of educational challenges of today. I also learned how to effectively contribute to discussions.",
    "This class was great - learned a lot about how people work in units as large as an entire city to as small as just myself. Gained a lot of insights that are very applicable to my everyday life and also going forward into the real world. Learned a lot about how a system can come to be broken and how it takes more than just being a good person or having good intentions to get something accomplished. Truly a thought-provoking class.",
    "learned a lot about the public education system and the different big issues that are affecting it. Also learned a lot about team work and leadership more generally.",
    "I learned to interrogate my assumptions\/ frames of perception as I approach new readings. I also learned, critically, that my reading skills can use some improvement, for I found that details about readings discussed in class would sometimes slip by me.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class and I learned so much. I learned a lot about educational policy and practices, not as much as a course that is focused solely on policy and practice, but I really enjoyed the way I learned it in this class. I learned so much about real and concrete leadership skills and I got to practice them as well.",
    "I learned new ways to look at both school reforms and my own leadership. Though I was skeptical of the leadership focus of the course at first, it turned out to be one of the areas which most changed my thinking.",
    "I learned to think about leadership, change, and improvement in education but also in myself. I liked this aspect of the course because it's so different from other education style classes.",
    "I developed a real understanding of excellence in pedagogy and teamwork through the wonderful teaching and well-planned group activities in this course. I also learned a variety of strategies for analyzing problems and creating action plans to solve them.",
    "It was a really interesting course structured to connect the readings, primarily theories in education, to real case studies. The case study method was interesting and a nice break and more practical policy examination of many issues in education.",
    "Improving education is one of the most complex issues of our day, but this class not only gives the student an approach that makes more sense of the complexity of the problems but also starts proposing some ways to begin thinking about potential solutions. The course is heavily dependent on conversation, building off of the perspectives of our readings and the students in the class. For this reason, the course offered multiple moments rich with learning from these conversations. On top of having the chance to talk about education, we also had time to meditate on our own leadership and how we can improve it to improve systems like education.",
    "I became more aware of my leadership potential and areas where I could grow as a leader. I applied the leadership lessons I learned in class in the context of the group project, where I developed stronger communication and organization skills. I became more comfortable discussing controversial opinions and defending my viewpoints, even when they were unpopular. And finally, I developed a greater appreciation for the complexity of education policy issues. No reform is perfect and no solution is without consequences. This class gave me a taste of what a career in education policy would be like, which is exactly what I had hoped to learn."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Really interesting case studies. Professor is very knowledgeable and is good at connecting cases to relevant experiences and local happenings. Improvement: I did not feel like I received much feedback on my thinking\/writing.",
    "Strengths: exciting, fast-paced environment that asks students to try new things each week, great instructor, case study model, feedback on writing each week Weaknesses: too many students, memos were not rigorously graded and could be completed without much effort, too much reading\/ material to discuss in one seminar session",
    "The course was very well-structured--I enjoyed the case method and the use of small group and large group discussions in the course. The semester project was a fantastic experience where I learned a lot. On the other hand, I did not think the fish-bowl discussion model used for one class was a good use of time. A more efficient discussion would have allowed any student to jump in and build upon their colleagues' ideas at any time.",
    "Strengths: EVERYTHING Weaknesses: NOTHING",
    "There were a couple of weaknesses in that it sometimes felt like we might be hearing a one-sided view of certain topics, but for the most part it felt very all-encompassing. So many strengths - course had a good mix of full class discussion and small group exercises, and we moved through various topics in class at a good pace so it never felt like a drag to get through the 2-hr seminar. A good class vibe was established right from the start, which made it easier to maintain throughout the rest of the semester.",
    "Class was well organized and there was a high all round level of student engagement. Really liked that there was a presentation to education leaders at the end. Seminar was very high energy and interesting, I'm glad it didn't fall into the trap of students just trying to say smart things to the professor. I'm also glad that there was lots of small group and large group work. This was good because it kept people awake (even though the class was late in the afternoon on a thursday). Readings were generally interesting, like that you varied the medium (e.g. podcasts and the attempted video). I think the expectations for the final project could have been clearer going forward. Also, the final required quite a lot of work in quite a short period of time. Obviously this was ultimately adjusted, but for next time, letting us know what is required of us individually and as teams would have avoided the need to reschedule in this way. You also could have made more of an effort to get to know us all individually. I know in other classes, professors have asked everyone to meet them at least once, but preferably more than once, at office hours. By the end of the class, I felt that i knew my classmates better, but not necessarily the professor.",
    "Loved the case method! Please continue it. Making the course a bit longer would make the analyses even more enriching and fruitful.",
    "This class was amazing, every day was engaging because there was a mix of group work, and then class discussion, videos, memos, and other engaging material. Maybe we can get some more time in between the due dates of the various pieces of the semester long project so that we can conduct more research. The close due dates made research a little superficial and rushed.",
    "Surprisingly, the large size of this class wasn't a problem. Professor Lemons did the best job I've ever seen of managing a large discussion. (I guess that's what years of practice will do for you.) The final project needed somewhat clearer explanations about the purpose of the different stages at the outset. My group wasn't clear about when we were supposed to start backing up assertions with research. I would have loved to hear Rachel's reflections about how our class worked! The norms barometer wasn't a great success. It either needs student sponsors who are more focused on doing something with the results or a shift to a more informal way of gathering information, like spending a few minutes every month to talk about how we're doing on norms.",
    "No improvement necessary. Perfect as is.",
    "I think that since this was the first time the course was offered, there were definitely some speed bumps along the way but overall, this is a great course. A strength would be the format of the course, which is case studies. In this way, the course moves very rapidly and covers a broad range of topics without going too in-depth on one particular topic (a good point for some but bad for others). In the same vein, another strength would be the semester-long project that allows students to focus in one particular topic within education that they find interesting, which contrasts the broader, surface-level understanding that the case studies provide. A weakness, however, would be the size of the course: I felt like the course, 25 or so students, was in an awkward space between being a small seminar and a large lecture. I would have enjoyed the course more if it was capped at 15 or so.",
    "Strengths: * Very engaging and knowledgable instructor (Dr. Richard Lemons) * Opportunity to work on a semester-long project of your choice that actually gets presented to education professionals * Weekly case studies focusing on a different challenge in the field of education * Never a dull class moment, as we often had different activities and engaged in both large and small group discussions Weaknesses: * Although a seminar, in the fall of 2016, the class was not capped, which meant that it was hard to engage in large group discussions * As with any final group project, if you're not in one where everyone is doing their part, it can amount to a lot of work, especially at the end of the semester",
    "Fewer people. Honestly, the conversation was good, but there was just too many of us. Too many voices and ideas in the room made it difficult to run with the desired design. Would have been nicer to have a normal cap.",
    "This was an engaging and well-organized class, especially in light of the fact that it was the first time it has ever been taught. Most new classes struggle in the first round, but I felt like I learned\/grew more throughout this course than I have in others that have been taught for multiple years. I have two small suggestions: First, cap the course. This class was too big, and with the reviews I expect it will receive, the demand will only grow. The dynamic of the group was sometimes stressful because it was so large. I sometimes did not feel comfortable sharing my thoughts because I knew I wouldnt have enough time to flesh them out fully, and because I knew if I made a mistake I would be called out in front of so many people. Thats okay, because it turned out to be a leadership challenge and helped me confront some of my fears in speaking my mind and asserting my point of view, but this class would be less stressful for students if it were smaller. People would feel more comfortable and capable of sharing their ideas in-depth. A second, small suggestion would be to change the name of this class to be more clear about the material it covers. Maybe Leadership and Change in Education Policy or Leadership and Education Reform. Something that includes the two main objectives of the course developing leadership skills and learning how to apply them to education policy. Overall, EDST 290 was a great class and Im glad I took it! The project was an especially awesome experience. I'm grateful to Professor Lemons for organizing such an effective course and giving us the opportunity to learn from leaders in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Unless you're not at all interested in the topics, definitely! Case studies are really interesting and give you an interesting academic vs. experiential perspective on issues.",
    "Such an interesting way to learn about education through case studies. Unlike other classes where you just talk about problems and feel demoralized at having a lack of solutions, you have a lot of discussions about solving real issues in education right now.",
    "Definitely take this course for a chance to test out real-world solutions. You really shouldn't pass this up, especially if you are in Education Studies or intend to go into education in some way.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Dr. Lemons brings a lot of practical experience and knowledge into the classroom, and I felt that I emerged with a deeper knowledge of education policy and reform, as well as an appreciation for the complexity of educational change. I felt that the two hour seminar flew by every week. A gem.",
    "YES YES YES if you want to open your eyes to the systemic problems with the American education system, TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you're not interested in education, YOU WILL BE.",
    "Absolutely take this course! You'll learn a lot about the education system and how many different parts of it are broken, not just one, and how they came to be that way and why it's so hard to change them. Moreover, many of the concepts you learn in this class can be applied to other real-world institutions or even daily life problems. Class is structured well so you have a good mix of small and large group discussion, and even though the seminar was huge (25 ppl or so), I actually felt like I'd managed to get to know everyone in the class by the end of the semester.",
    "So much fun!! Really engaging seminar, which is really high energy and discusses very interesting topics in education. no need to be an expert. but there are lots of opportunities to learn more about leadership and teamwork, as well as what it realistically takes to cause change in a huge complex system like education",
    "TAKE IT! Dr. Lemons is one of the most phenomenal human beings I have ever met--his ability to maintain attention in a room is jawdropping. This was the liveliest, most thought provoking seminar I have ever taken. Please take it.",
    "I really really really recommend this course to students interested in education. This class is engaging and you will learn so much and have fun in 2 hours.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The case studies and applied final project pushed my understanding of the cultural dimensions of education reform, and our readings and discussions consistently rearranged the ways I think about leadership.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking to gain a broad understanding of education policy issues and looking to improve your own leadership on the side. This course would be great after having taken EDST 110 Foundations of Education Studies. However, if you're looking to delve deeply into one topic the entire course, perhaps this course wouldn't be the best choice. Additionally, if you're looking for a very intimate seminar, this course is open-enrollment and uncapped, so keep that in mind. My semester, there were about 25-ish students, and the same voices were heard every time.",
    "Absolutely recommend. This is probably the best course I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Lemons is an outstanding educator, and this course will really inspire you to work for educational improvement. I think this course made me a better and more self-reflective leader, and it was a ton of fun.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to someone who has taken EDST 110 or has an equivalent basic understanding of the state of education in the US, and is interested not only in learning more about the challenges that educators currently face but also in devising practical and responsible solutions.",
    "Absolutely. The readings and work is manageable, but always connects to the week. The case study method is engaging and the professor really cares about the class and content material. Easily one of the best courses in the Ed. Studies department as well as at Yale that I have taken. It is also the most practical policy-related course that I have been able to find despite it being an interest of mine. While we discussed relatively few policy decisions specifically, examining the cases made it almost necessary to consider the policies and realities at work. Additionally, the project that we worked on throughout the semester was really different and interesting. The end presentation was great as the professor brought in a number of education experts from the state.",
    "I think the second time it is taught it will be better. This first time, the workload and expectations were insane, but the guidelines for the work were weak. Maybe next year, it will be better structured though, because it would have been taught already.",
    "If you are even slightly interested about education and how to improve it, please take this course. You touch on a lot of important and interesting topics on the subject and are tasked to address some of the most challenging questions, and you do it in a space where it truly feels like a collaborative effort to find answers. It is not a very heavy workload course, but you should be doing as much as you can to prepare for the class to get the most from each week. Professor Lemons, who himself has so much experience approaching the subjects of each week's class, does an excellent job of creating a learning environment by constantly providing feedback and evaluating our learning. The culminating project of the course gave students the opportunity to present and receive feedback from leaders in CT's public school system--definitely one of the highlights of my academic career at Yale. You will be asked to think critically, but you will learn so much.",
    "EDST 290 is designed to be a pretty low-key yet engaging class. The workload is extremely manageable and the readings are usually easy to do since theyre so interesting. Class meetings are engaging and go by quickly Professor Lemons sets it up so youre constantly moving (like literally getting up out of your chair and talking to people), which makes the time just fly by. Over the course of the semester you will learn so much about both education policy and leadership skills. Im usually skeptical of classes that teach leadership, but I was very surprised to realize how much I grew as a leader throughout this course. The private insights I made about my leadership potential during class were put to work in the context of the semester-long group project, which culminates in a final presentation in front of real education policy experts. The project was pretty low-key throughout the semester and is set up so that you make gradual and consistent progress over the weeks. I really appreciated this Professor Lemons makes it clear that hes not out to get you and that this isnt one of those classes where you need to feel that your grade is always at stake. He really wants his students to enjoy the experience, but that being said, youll get a lot more out of the class if you really engage with the material. It seemed like the majority of students in the class did most of the reading and came prepared to class, which made discussions really interesting. The only time this class felt stressful was in the week before the project was due, and on the day of the presentation, but honestly it was worth it. Completing the project felt like a huge accomplishment, and was a great way to finish off the semester. My only warning to students who take this class would be to choose your group carefully. If you have to choose between a topic you love or people you vibe with, choose the people. It will make the project much more enjoyable, even if youre not in love with the topic (on the flip side, you could choose a topic you liked but gradually lose interest because of negative dynamics in your group). Just make sure you dont choose your group solely based on the fact that theyre your friends try to join a group of people you know youll work well with. Other than that, Leadership and Change was a solid and relatively un-stressful course that prompts both academic and personal growth over the course of the semester. If you love education or if you want to learn more about it, this class is a great way to go!"
