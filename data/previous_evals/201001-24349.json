    "EEB 225 is fine. Both Professors Turner and Townsend are solid lecturers and very nice people, the material's cool, and the textbook is fantastic. Having a solid EEB background helps - basic concepts from Genetics, Ecology, and EEB 122 are all assumed - but the material is still fairly approachable. The format this year was a lecture every Tuesday (on 2-3 chapters of reading, one chapter of which you'll be quizzed on) and a \"discussion\" on 2-3 scientific papers (one recent - usually one of Turner's or Townsend's - and one historical), with two midterms and a final paper. Totally manageable, though \"discussion\"s with 30 people take some getting used to. It's not an \"omg-you-have-to-take-this-class\" class, but it's definitely a good experience.",
    "I would recommend it for science majors and warn non-science majors that it is in fact a real science class. You read lots of primary literature.",
    "Again, think all MCDB majors should take this course-otherwise they'll only know the \"mechanics\" of biology, not the larger macro-questions.",
    "Take it for the major, some of the topics are really interesting, but it is not SUPER great.",
    "I would recommend it not only because it is a requirement for E&EB majors but also because it was interesting and well-taught.",
    "I definitely recommend the class. It is a big challenge having not taken 122 but completely manageable if you put in the time and very interesting!",
    "Not worth it if you have taken intro e&eb unless you are required to take it. Not difficult but almost frustratingly simple.",
    "While the material was interesting, the course design was rather outrageous. With two meeting times per week, the Tuesday class was lecture-based and included a weekly quiz, and the Thursday class was a \u0091graded\u0092 discussion of assigned scientific papers. While weekly quizzes are applauded as a great idea in courses such as Cell Biology, those quizzes constitute a large portion of a student\u0092s semester grade and are based on material covered in the previous week\u0092s lectures in order to help students to progress through a large volume of material in a timely manner. However, the quizzes in this course were based on the reading assignments due on the day of the quizzes, and were confessed to be designed to \u0091check to see if the students are keeping up with the reading.\u0092 Pardon my colloquialism, but SERIOUSLY??? Oh come on! In case this fact has been overlooked, we are college students, if we are incapable of completing our chapter or two of assigned reading and asking questions about material we find confusing, it is our own fault. It is not like a weekly reading quiz is going to instill radically novel and efficient study habits in those unfortunate slackers. Furthermore, these quizzes simply insult and pain the rest of us; they lead us to resent the class. Since these quizzes broadly draw on the material from the assigned reading, the following lectures either outline the exact reading we just completed, including examples and figures from the textbook, or completely deviate from the book material entirely, catering to tangents on little pet topics. For example, in one lecture, a good 30 minutes was devoted to covering the definition and symptoms of nearly every known human aneuploidy, despite only a brief textbook reference pertaining to speciation. It felt like we had been zapped back to high school biology, except in high school we had touched on Mary Lyon\u0092s description of barr bodies and their relation to sex chromosomeabnormalities. It should be a goal to really teach students, and not just trap them in less than beneficial lectures with pesky required quizzes. Perhaps \u0091trap\u0092 is the wrong word. I for one love going to class and learning; however, if I vomit or have severe menstrual cramps I am not going to go trudging across science hill to take the 8th of 12 semester quizzes or try to discuss evolution while wondering how close the nearest bathroom is in case I need to make a break for it. While the syllabus does state that a dean\u0092s excuse will eliminate a missed quiz from factoring into your grade, it is outlined in the Yale College Programs of Study that \u0091the basic responsibility for permitting postponement of work during the term is the instructor\u0092s.\u0092 Not to mention the dean\u0092s excuse is not relevant for course work missed due to graduate school or job interviews, which directly affect the lives of graduating seniors. After the Tuesday lecture class, Thursday is discussion-based, and while a portion of the \u0091graded\u0092 discussions focused on interesting research, the remaining discussion classes were centered on papers concerning very narrow portions of the broad subject of evolution, and largely authored by the professors. I support exposure to not only scientific writing in the form of journal publications, but also the content of landmark papers, such as the Gould& Lewontin, and Axelrod& Hamilton papers. A summer MCDB120 course executed this nearly perfectly, covering Meselson& Stahl, and Watson& Crick, among others. However, please, Please, PLEASE remember: this discussion should not be about you and all of the papers you have ever published...(exceeds word limit for response box)...I generally prescribe to science as my religion of choice, but frankly, this course has even beaten this evolutionary biologist into saying \u0091Oh sweet Jesus, God help next year\u0092s students.\u0092",
    "Can be a lot of work with weekly quizzes, two midterms and a final paper. An interesting subject, but the lectures could definitely be improved.",
    "I am not sure whether I would recommend Evolutionary Biology. While the discussions are often quite good, the lectures are a repeat of EEB 122 with Professor Stearns, who often explained things more clearly and fully. The class has its good points, but it occasionally feels repetitive.",
    "This is a solid intermediate course in evolutionary biology. Previous experience in the subject would be helpful, but probably isn't necessary. Class consists of lectures (decent) and class discussions of scientific literature (lacking, but with lots of potential). Required for majors; worth shopping for those interested in the subject.",
    "Two midterms, weekly quizzes and a final paper (8 single-spaced page max.).First midterm was legit and tested appropriate things.Second midterm was much harder and covered Chapter 18 even though it was never quizzed or lectured on. READ IT. I realize that its assigned at the end of the term when you'll have an outline for the paper and other assignments in your other classes, but READ IT before the midterm. It was like... 20% of the test.Weekly quizzes aren't challenging if you've done the reading. The reading is interesting and provides relevant examples. Start reading on Sunday and you'll have it done by Tuesday in class. Plus, they're really helpful because you don't just cram before tests. You've read it before!Final paper was kind of confusing. The way it was presented, you would think it didn't require much original thought. You just update a focal paper with three other papers from the scientific literature. I haven't gotten my grade back on it yet, but my paper was pretty dense... they give you a limited selection of topics, most of which you won't be very interested in if you're not a math\/stats person. If you choose a topic that isn't math-heavy, be prepared to sift through a LOT of theory papers. I found my topic interesting, but the papers I had to read for it were DENSE.All in all, its not very repetitive to E&EB 122. However, if you had to choose between the two for a fun science class... take 122. This class is not as well taught, partially because its sort of new. They're still trying to tweak it. The professors ARE really accessible and friendly, though.",
    "This course has a lot of overlap with EEB 122, even though they try to change it up a bit with the primary literature discussions on Thursday instead of lecture. I felt that the discussions were not necessarily that useful as the class was too big, and discussion didn't go very deep. Instead, we stuck to summarizing papers during those sessions. The material is almost exactly the same as EEB 122; I wish there were more in-depth discussion on some of the topics, and maybe more mathematical modelling or computational biology discussion, since those seem to be big in evo bio. Reading the papers and understanding them are also critical to doing well on the exams. Also, the paper was treated as an afterthought in the class, even though it was worth 30% of the grade. I felt that everyone just wrote it during finals week because no one had received any instructions on it at the end. In sum, if you're an evo bio major that needs to take this class, then there's no choice and you have to take it. If you're considering taking the class, and have taken EEB 122, don't take it. If you're just curious about evo bio, and haven't taken it before, it's a decent class.",
    "It's a good class. I took it without taking the prerequisite (Intro to EEB), and I did well. Learning about evolution is interesting, and I didn't mind doing the textbook readings. Although it wasn't my favorite class, I did enjoy it and would recommend it to you if you find evolution interesting.A warning: if you do the reading (which you need to because of the weekly reading quizzes), then a noteworthy amount of the material covered in class is redundant, simply a restatement of the textbook. The professors do discuss some of their own research, though.",
    "I would recommend the class if a student is interested in evolutionary biology. You do have to work to do well as the tests\/quizzes may appear easy but necessitate studying. Also there is no curve so your raw grade is the grade.",
    "This is a recap of all major principles of evolutionary analysis. If one period of class time each week is devoted to \"discussion,\" attend one of these discussions before making your decision regarding whether or not to take this course. You should know what you are getting into.",
    "I thought it was a great class. It would recommend it to anyone who is interested in evolutionary biology. It wasn't very much work either.",
    "Decent. Liked the material but be prepared to overlearn easy concepts to get an A."
