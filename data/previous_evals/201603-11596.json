    "This course taught me how to analyze American history from a new perspective of religious narrativization and gave me the tools to learn about similar trends in other cultures. The writing responsibilities of the class were well placed over the course of the semester to help me develop as a writer and thinker.",
    "In depth knowledge about the power of religion in American conflicts. Learn how to think about the idea of civil religion in American society, how it applied to the past and how it applies today. Hugely insightful course in terms of seeing American history since the Puritan era as a development of religion.",
    "This course really changed my view on my country. That's a hefty task from an American History major. Eye-opening through and through, from the very first reading on civil religion to the last on the War on Terror. I have sent Robert Bellah's essay \"American Civil Religion\" to more than a dozen friends on campus, from home, and abroad. The content is just that good, and certainly that infectious. It is hard to imagine taking this course and not having your worldview shaped, irrevocably, even in a minor way.",
    "This course was very helpful in that if provided a solid historical framework through which I can now contexualize what I see in the news about religion in politics. It gave me a deeper understanding of civil religion.",
    "Strong writing skills and knowledge of the subject matter.",
    "I learned how to incorporate ideas into history. This course gave me a language and framework for understanding how religion has functioned in American society.",
    "I learned a comprehensive overview of religion in American life through the lenses of every major war. We read major religious texts and followed the religious lives of many important politicians in U.S. history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Huge amount of discussion and sharing of ideas between students and professor. A lot of really interesting knowledge being passed around that applies to everything from the 1600s to today. However, I would change how students present the information. Each week, a student will speak about the readings and then a discussion will start from what is said from the reading. As much as I think the readings should be an integral part of the discussion, I think better discussion could have been had from talking more about the idea of religion within a particular conflict instead of the reading's perception of it.",
    "Weaknesses: only met once a week. Honestly, I would have loved to do a research paper, given how fascinating these topics are, but the reading-synthesis assignment made sense and was a good pick too. Strength: everything. The reading list. Professor Stout. The other students. The pace. Such a good class, it's hard to adequately articulate.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it drew from primary sources since the colonial period. Reading a selection of the speeches and sermons of each generation covered in the course confronted me with the nuances and rhetoric so often employed in public discourse.",
    "Professor Stout is friendly and makes class fun. His feedback on papers was always timely and helpful.",
    "The only weakness was that our class time always felt too short to cover the amount of fascinating material we were reading every week.",
    "The strengths of the course was that the readings and discussion were always incredibly interesting, and I loved hearing the professor share his research and knowledge on historical events and figures. A weakness would be that uneven prior knowledge among students in the seminar made discussion difficult at points for students who had less prior knowledge."

    "Going in, I thought this class would be one of the more boring courses of the semester. In the end, it was my best course of the yearcertainly one of the best classes I've ever taken. An absolute must-take if you're interested in America, religion, violence, or having your worldview irreversibly changed. This course has really changed my view on our country. That's a hefty task from an American History major. Eye-opening through and through, from the very first reading on civil religion to the last on the War on Terror. Admittedly, I have sent Robert Bellah's essay \"American Civil Religion,\" a keystone of the course that sets the tone for everything after, to more than a dozen friends on campus, from home, and abroad. The content is just that good, and certainly that infectious. It is hard to imagine taking this course and not having your sense of nation shaped forever, even in a minor way. Re: workload, very very very manageable. One reading response a week, and you can choose to respond to a variety of texts, which is ideal. You don't need to do all the reading, but you'll probably want to because it's just so interesting. Two short papers (5 pages) and a final synthesis paper (15-20) on readings from the semester. Graded incredibly fairly, even generously, and totally doable in every sense. Last, a good word for Professor Stout, who truly made my semester. He is a gem in every sense: compassionate, funny, kind, charismatic, warm, intelligent, patient, and all-around one of the best professors I've had at Yale. tl;dr: take this take this take this take this take this",
    "Absolutely take it. If you do all the readings and engage in the discussions, you will gain important insights into how the US works.",
    "Absolutely. Highly recommended for anyone interested in American history, especially politics and religion",
    "Yes!",
    "This was probably the best course I've taken at Yale - which I wasn't expecting when I decided to take it at the beginning of the semester. Professor Stout is insanely knowledgeable, and guides class discussion really well without dominating it. The readings every week were enlightening and intriguing, and I often found myself talking about them outside of class. The seminar itself felt more like a discussion or book club than a class, which I personally really enjoyed. The topic is fascinating as well-you probably won't encounter the course material in any other class, which is all the more reason to take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because religion is a critical part of American history and life and has shaped American society since the Puritans."
