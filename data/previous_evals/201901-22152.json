   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot how hegemonic\/subordinated masculinities, the co production of sex and gender (@travesti readings), about the role of masculinity in gender liberation efforts, race, different methods for studying men\/masculinity",
    "This course was a wonderful addition to the coursework I've done in WGSS (although I'm not a major). I've taken a lot of courses about womanhood and gender from the perspective of non-hegemonic actors, but it was really interesting to take the perspective of masculinity studies. The readings were consistently eye-opening and different, and the course discussions were great almost every week. Under the umbrella of \"masculinity studies\" we were able to touch on topics such as gender, sexuality, power, bodies, empire, modernity, borders, race, class, media representation, etc. Professor Dowe put together an exciting syllabus that engaged all these different topics and wove them together under a particular analytical lens.",
    "In this class we learned to think critically about various academic approaches to masculinity studies, especially cultural criticism, ethnography, and some pretty heavy gender theory. We also learned how to lead a class discussion and extrapolate our own theoretical approach from the readings.",
    "I learned all about the field of masculinity studies. It was something I had never even heard of before taking this class, and now I think I know a considerable amount about hegemonic and subordinated masculinities, female masculinity, and how queer people and POC fit into the patriarchy. I also learned a lot about anthropology, and how we should examine sources that may or may not be biased."

   "comments": [
    "I liked student presentations, but the format did become redundant. I also would have liked to read a more diverse range of materials-- fiction seems like it could be esp well suited to this class as well. I thinking about how Gender and Transgender is taught, and how this class might borrow from that syllabus",
    "The readings are good and extensive and cover the topics extensively. The professor knows a lot but does not speak as much in the class. The class could be improved by the professor speaking more and directing the conversation to where he wants it go\/outline what he wants the students to get out of it",
    "This course was mostly so great. The weekly discussions were wonderful, the way the assignments worked (6 short reading responses, one final paper, and one in-class presentation) allowed us to develop a bunch of different skills. In particular, the 2-page reading responses were really great for pushing us to stay up-to-date with readings and practice doing true reflection -- because the expectations were that it would be open-ended and somewhat creative, I felt like I was really able to practice writing my real thoughts without having to filter what I said to meet the expectations of a paper. The only thing I might change is the in-class workshops. I didn't get much out of the final paper workshop personally. I don't think very many people in the class were very far along on their projects (which is our fault) and that made it not super useful to talk through ideas with each other. I personally would have preferred one more wee of readings\/discussion, which is what I enjoyed most about the class throughout the semester.",
    "Weaknesses - the course readings were good in general but they would benefit from more theorists that are not from the US",
    "This is the only course of its kind really at Yale, and does a pretty good job introducing you to the material - but organization of the syllabus, and class discussion could definitely be improved. Prof. Dowe takes a hands-off approach to moderating discussion, which can sometimes be good, but frequently the discussion went off topic and revolved around just a few students in the class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Masculinity is understudied and often reduced to a monolith of toxic masculinity. this gave me a whole new tool kit for thinking about how gender operates and 'studying up' doesn't happen enough in the inter-disciplines at Yale",
    "Yes. You learn a lot about manhood and masculinity - from a variety of authors. The type of students in your class will determine how well it goes since the professor lets students do most of the discussion leading and talking.",
    "Definitely!!! This subject is so essential, to understanding gender and power, but also helps us learn more skills about how to recognize and encounter different forms of masculinity in our lives. I think all college students should graduate with the ability to speak about and analyze masculinity in a critical way.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is a really thorough exploration of gender theory and masculinity studies that is challenging but accessible. Prof. Dowe is amazing!",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. It was engaging, interesting, and powerful. I learned a lot, not only from the readings and discussions, but from the experiences of my classmates. Professor Dowe is lovely, and the course itself illuminates the experiences that I, as a man, have had so many times."
