   "comments": [
    "Very interesting material with a friendly and approachable professor, though not the most interactive seminar.",
    "I would say that the course was a lot of reading without much real discussion, but I would recommend it to anyone with a genuine interest in the subject. However, I would specify to them that they will be learning about movements, not necessarily beliefs.",
    "Apocalyptic Religion was an interesting premise, which is why I signed up for it. The beginning of the course is a little slowreading the books of Daniel and Revelation and a few other bits from the Bible. And then we read about the Mayans. We then went through case studies of apocalyptic movements, which was when the course actually started to pick up. The South African Cattle-Killing, Aum Shinrikyo, Peoples Templethose were all interesting. One thing about this courseeven though its a seminar, it really runs more like a lecture, with the professor just going on a review of the reading for that week and asking a few questions that confirm weve done it. Theres not much discussion. As for work, its a lot of reading, and two six page papers and a final fifteen page paper.",
    "This class is low workload and interesting. Lots of reading, but only three papers, very manageable.",
    "RLST 110 is an introductory course to Apocalyptic Religions. There is a fair bit of reading each week, and a lot of the material is similar to anthropological studies. The different cultures that are discussed are never treated like one is better than the others. I would recommend this course to my peers, because even though I am not planning on majoring in Religious Studies, I learned about many different cultures and the forces that drive people, and this information can be applied to my further studies."
