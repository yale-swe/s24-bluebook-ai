   "comments": [
    "I took this class as an MCDB senior, so I've taken many MCDB classes. Dellaporta is the worst MCDB prof I've ever had...he simply reads off his slides without explaining what they mean. On the other hand, Gendron did an awesome job! The class should be completely taught by Gendron! The class has a great structure. The sections take place every two weeks during the lecture time.",
    "Pretty good course with good professors. Not a ton of new material from intro genetics, but still interesting",
    "Do not take this class unless you are required to, especially not if you want to go into genetics.",
    "you learn genetics and everything it encompases and then read discussion papers relating to genetics",
    "What you would expect. It is kinda hard to know where you stand in the class though.",
    "Dellaporta is awful and just use the textbook for his quizzes. Gendron is fantastic!",
    "Meh. Required course for most and feels like it. Quizzes aren't hard and they drop one, since you were asking. Dellaporta is like your uncle from Rhode Island that you can hear from across the room when he arrives at parties and makes you want to go hide in the coat closet so he'll stop talking to you about codominance. Gendron is your cool uncle from San Diego who you'll find already hiding in there.",
    "Solid course that gives a good overview of classical genetics as well as more modern discoveries. The papers we're assigned to read and discuss can be challenging, but it's immensely rewarding when you finally get it!",
    "If you like genetics, this class really isn't that bad. It has a bad reputation, but if you work hard and are genuinely interested in this material, you'll make it through and do just fine! After every 3 lectures, you meet for a \"special Tuesday,\" during which you take a quiz and then discuss a research paper. The mix of lecture of research keeps things interesting, and it's awfully convenient that you don't have to meet for an additional section outside of normal lecture time. As long as you're prepared to be diligent about going to class and working through the problem sets, take this!",
    "I would recommend MCDB 202 to any student interested in learning more about Genetics from knowledgeable Professors. The course offers students the ability to see how what we learn in a classroom setting is applied to real-life research projects, and all of the topics, from allelic and gene interactions to population studies to DNA damage repair and developmental genetics, are interesting and informative.",
    "You probably have to take it if you are MCDB, but I thought it was better than Cell and BioChem in terms of manageability. Genetics is also the future of medicine.",
    "This is a really nice class for those interest in knowing more about classical and modern genetics. The classes are interesting and help us to learn new concepts and techniques about genetics.",
    "This is a very average course. One bad professor, one good one; mostly boring lectures with some interesting ones; didn't learn that much beyond what was taught in BIOL 103. Professor Gendron is awesome, and if he is teaching again, you are in good hands. Quizzes every other week generally help you keep up on the material, and in-class paper discussions are not particularly insightful or meaningful in the greater scope of the class. It's not too hard, but also not that interesting. Hopefully they find a way to vamp this class up in the next couple of years. If you have to take it, don't worry, it's fine; if you don't have to take it, find something more interesting.",
    "I AM NOT AN MCDB OR E&EB MAJOR. I'm a psych major on the neuroscience track, so I always have to explain to people why I took Genetics. As a neuro major, you do have to take upper level bio courses, but it doesn't make me a bio major in any respect. If you're like me (that is, biology is not your strong point but you need to take a bio course), I would recommend this course. I did enjoy the material, and the professors are really nice. It doesn't assume too much prior knowledge, but enough that I would definitely say you should take the Intro Bio sequence before tackling this course.",
    "MCDB 202 is an introductory course to genetics that covers a breadth of information concerning everything from single gene inheritance to mutation repair mechanisms. This semester, the class was taught by two professors - Prof Dellaporta covered the first four modules (single gene inheritance, chromosomal mutations, population genetics, linkage\/recombination, etc.) while Prof Gendron covered the last three modules (mutations, repair mechanisms, developmental genetics and epigenetics). Both professors are very strong; however, they have different teaching styles that students should adjust to. Instead of exams, the class offers fortnightly quizzes as the means of assessment after each module (7 quizzes in total with 1 freebie drop). Although this method of evaluation is a little different from that of other STEM courses, it's a nice change from midterms and in some ways, a little less stressful because for each quiz, students are only responsible for the previous three lectures. Quizzes count for 50% of the grade so try to do your best on them! Also, on quiz days, students have discussion sections where they discuss papers during class time instead of actually attending lecture. The papers are decently interesting but sometimes difficult to understand...and that's where the TAs come in! In regards to choosing between genetics and molecular biology, both are decent courses - genetics may be a good choice if you don't want to take midterms\/are better at taking multiple choice quizzes. I feel like genetics was better organized this year in comparison to other years (from what I've heard from previous students).",
    "I enjoyed it. If you're an MCDB major, you really should take this class. It's pretty easy and you learn a lot about genetics.",
    "I would recommend this class, because it is a fairly well-taught course and genetics is a very important scientific subject. In the class, you are introduced to a lot of different material, but you actually remember it (some of it) because there are short quizzes every two weeks that help you learn the material in digestible amounts.",
    "Take the class. Put in the work and it actually is enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend Genetics. This was generally a very good course. The professors clearly cared a lot about both the subject and their students and clearly put a lot of time and care into thinking about how best to teach their material. They were both very friendly, engaging and accessible. They also responded very well to questions. I thought that the material was presented very well, and I learned a lot of interesting material this semester. My TA, Christine, was also pretty awesome (and it seemed like most of the other ones were as well). The one downside is that sometimes the course could have been a bit more rigorous and expected more of us so that we could have learned even more of this interesting material.",
    "This was a well-run class that provides a good and broad background to genetics. You could take it without having any background in genetics if you are willing to put in a little extra time at the beginning to cover basic topics by reading the textbook.",
    "Genetics was a really interesting course, and most of the quizzes were fair. Lectures were not that organized, especially in the first half.",
    "The pace of this course was very fast for the majority of it making it so that some of the concepts are difficult to grasp. Reading of the book is the main source of information with the slides presented mostly as a review. The sections were a little lacking and didn't have much bearing with the course material other than showing how it could be used practically in a lab. The information is interesting but somewhat difficult to grasp at times. This is a prereq class for the MCDB major so if you have to take it, you have to take it. I probably wouldn't take this for fun.",
    "This class is chock-full of pre-meds. As an EEB major looking to go into field ecology, I found this a little frustrating. (TA: since all of you are going to be doctors...) But otherwise it's really well taught. Both Dellaporta and Gendron had stimulating lectures, and the material was covered thoroughly.",
    "Unfortunately not as interesting as Bio 103. Relatively easy the whole semester but at the end, as you're studying for the final, you realize there is SO MUCH material. Start studying early.",
    "A very solid and well-taught intermediate-level course in MCDB. The quiz format works wonders. I was initially scared by the bad reviews of this class in past years, but Professors Dellaporta and Gendron really cared about this class and ran it like a well-oiled machine. Highly recommended for any MCDB major instead of the alternative requirement of Molecular Biology!",
