    "SPAN 110 is a great class - very straightforward, easy to put in the work necessary to do well and learn a lot of Spanish very quickly, and not too demanding on your time. Lourdes Sabe especially is a great instructor. I started off this semester shopping two different sections of 110 and Lourdes' energy, enthusiasm, and personal preparation for classes (which was clear through her individual powerpoints and exercises for us to practice in class) won me over.",
    "Good intro course, but doesn't go deep enough to give you a strong foundation in Spanish."
