    "A general study of some Lorca poems and plays, with some other fun stuff mixed in (like watching movies). Everyone writes two little papers, one final paper, and has a presentation where they have to memorize a poem. I was really nervous for mine but it turned out fine, and I think everyone liked the presentation part of the class.",
    "!REGISTRATE! Probablemente los otros estudiantes aprendieron espanol antes de ingles. Asi es la vida en Yale. Siempre va a ser los que saben mas que tu. La oportunidad de aprender espanol, y especialmente Lorca con la Profesora Valis vale mucha pena.",
    "Although I enjoyed listening to Professor Valis teach, I was highly intimidated in the class setting. Although the majority of class was non-native speaker, the native Spanish speakers clearly dominated conversation, many speaking at breakneck speed, thereby excluding over half of the class from the discussion. I got a 5 on my Spanish AP, and I understood most of what the Professor was saying, but I still felt a disparity between what the natives probably got out of the class and what I did.",
    "Great class! Professor Valis is enthusiastic and knows a great deal about the subject. The class had a wide variety of levels in terms of Spanish-speaking ability, but Professor Valis encouraged everyone to participate.",
    "Yes, it will make almost anyone like poetry.",
    "This is a good class. Professor Valis is great, she really enjoys the material she teaches and makes learning it a lot better. This is largely a discussion-based class, which was difficult for me because there were about 6 fluent spanish-speakers in my class and I am NOT fluent, so I didn't participate a ton. The plays were interesting, I didn't like the poetry as much. Three small papers, a midterm, and a final paper, so it wasn't an overwhelming amount of work. There was also a small project where you had to memorize and recite a poem, so that was difficult, but you can pick a short poem. Overall a good class, this was a good way for me to finish my language requirements.",
    "Definitely! It's not too much work at all and it's a genuinely fun and interesting class. I loved taking it.",
    "An interesting course. It won't necessarily improve your spoken language but you will have the opportunity to write 4 papers in spanish which isn't as difficult as it sounds. Lorca is an incredibly interesting person but be warned that the themes are quite repetitive and this class in mainly a poetry and play analysis class.Don't worry if you can't understand everything she says or is in the book. Only the large concepts matter adn the specificscan be worked out when you write your paper. Not too harshly graded and intriguing.Recommended.",
    "I enjoyed Spanish 324 and would recommend it to any students interested in Lorca's work. It did take me a while to warm up to some of his work, especially his poems, but by the end of the semester, I cameto appreciate them more, and I enjoyed his many plays. The teacher is also great and very enthusiastic about Lorca. Overall, I would recommend this course. Interesting material with a great teacher.",
    "YES. Excellent course for someone who has an advanced Spanish level and is interested in poetry, Spain, or FGL.",
    "Spanish 324 is a great class for fluent speakers who are looking for an in depth spanish literature analysis course. I would not recommend it to anyone who lacks confidence in their reading and vocabulary abilities, as that renders the reading overwhelming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I wasn't expecting to love this course as much as I ended up loving it. It's not a gut, but it's definitely manageable if you keep up with the readings (which are not that much!).",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Lorca's works are fascinating, and it had enough native Spanish speakers to make discussion relatively in-depth and fast-paced. The requirements of the class are substantial but not overwhelming. Prof. Valis, too, is great. She obviously loves Lorca, and she cares a ton about the class. Take it!"
