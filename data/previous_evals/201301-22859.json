    "Good class. Too much reading. Billings is an excellent professor, who gives good guidance on essays.",
    "While doing DS, I didn't love it. In fact, there were many days when I hated it. Because I didn't have time to read all of the works, I felt that I didn't get as much out of the coursework as I should have. I also felt that the constant heavy workload was contributing more to my stress than to my knowledge. However, if you know that you will do your absolute best to read everything, and are truly committed to doing all of the work, it's definitely worth it.Knowing what I know now, I'm not sure that I would take DS again, if given the chance. It's definitely the right choice for some people; definitely not for others.Most importantly, don't be afraid to shop it and go for something else, or to drop it after first semester if you feel like it's not your thing.P.S.- I only discovered the peer writing tutors at the end of second semester, but use them! They are wonderful!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course and this professor! If you have Billings, prepare to be incredibly intimidated by his brilliance and to work really hard, but you will find that it pays off. At the very least, I feel so much more comfortable analyzing passages and framing them within a larger theme, something I'm sure will be of great use even outside of the humanities. Furthermore, he really forced us to dig into the language and the philosophical significance of each work, which I appreciated. The readings were fantastic and Professor Billings takes you through them very skillfully, analyzing the most significant passages closely and maintaining the perfect balance between guidance and freedom. In addition, go to office hours! He may seem intimidating in class, but he is nice, erudite and positively charming during office hours!",
    "I woud absolutely recommend all of DS.",
    "Take this class. Just do it. It's amazing and you will not regret it.",
    "DS literature spring semester is a wonderful class and one of the best loved among DSers. You get to explore some classics of modern world literature, many of which will feel fresher and more familiar than first-semester texts (e.g. novels, short stories, etc.). Josh Billings is a great instructor, and I would encourage students assigned to his section to stay put. That said, our class was a bit divided about his method of teaching: some loved it, others found it stiff or difficult. He will push you to analyze the texts on a deep level (not just say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI loved this part!\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and he is not normally going to pat you on the back. Note: the reading will take you longer this semester than last. Almost all of it is super interesting, but it takes time. Do what reading you can over breaks; trust me, it will make the school year much saner.",
    "Yes.",
    "Professor Billings is a very hardworking professor who always has a plan for every class and gets all our papers backin an extremely timely fashion. He arranges for paper meetings before and after all the papers, and he really cares. Sometimes class can get boring, but it is always a good mix of close reading and making larger connections; a good mix of discussing and teaching. Billings makes us do two weekly discussion questions, the first one telling each student to provide a close reading question and the second one about a general question. His paper topics are interesting, and he gradually gives you more and more freedom in the papers. I recommend this course with Billings, who really does justice to some of the greatest works of western literature.",
    "Again, I love the course and the texts. Especially War and Peace!",
    "I would highly recommend Directed Studies, especially the literature branch, to anyone. I've heard - and agree with - the characterization that classes and books independently are all 'hats' without a hatrack, which DS provides.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has enjoyed first semester DS and even to those who mildly enjoyed first semester yet is hopeful for the better half of the year. I was told that one pushes through first semester DS lit to get to the second, and that proved to be accurate!",
    "This is a really fantastic class, and Professor Billings does a really really fantastic job teaching it.The first semester reading list certainly coheres better than the second semester reading list does, but the books you will read second semester are extraordinary, and (I think) their connections to the philosophy and sometimes even h&p you are reading simultaneously, far more fruitful and interesting to discuss. Especially if you're in Professor Billings' section, DS lit can teach you how to think philosophically and abstractly about books (while still doing lots of close readings!) in really exciting ways.This section is also so so good. Professor Billings is really really good at helping you improve your writing, and the way he leads class discussion and asks you to prepare for them can really improve your ability to close read (when you're doing the reading on your own) as well. He will give you the tools not just to read the books and to draw interesting conclusions fromthem, but also to think about the kinds of reading you do in DS, and other possible ways of engaging with the text.So on the whole, I would super strongly recommend this class and especially especially this particular section of it."
