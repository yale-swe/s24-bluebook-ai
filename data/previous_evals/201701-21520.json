    "I learned how to collaborate with my peers to produce music together.",
    "Amazing class!! I got to play chamber music with my quintet and we learned a ton throughout the year.",
    "Continually, chamber music hones the ability to work with others, which is always something that can be improved.",
    "Improved my ensemble skills, learned new repertoire.",
    "This class was excellent for improving skills in working as a group, and responding to feedback from coaches. The comment system in class times also helped my group improve when we all thought about things to work on with others.",
    "This course teaches students the fundamentals of communicating with other musicians through music. The course touches on both musical and technical aspects of achieving this goal, although different coaches certainly focus on different things.",
    "Learned some chamber music! Improved on clarinet.",
    "Get to spend a semester learning 1 piece of chamber music in its entirety. It's a lovely experience (and you get credit for it!).",
    "I improved my abilities as a chamber musician, and particularly as a duo player.",
    "I improved my musicianship skills and learned to collaborate in a chamber music setting."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are the performance opportunities and ability to work with other musicians in a more intimate setting. Getting coached by the faculty and the quartet in residence was also an incredibly enjoyable experience. Weaknesses included having engagement during studio class.",
    "I'm very happy with how the class is run.",
    "This course is different in that it offers an opportunity for people in different class years to engage with each other in a more intimate and meaningful way. One of the biggest strengths I think is that there are few other courses in which you would enter into a project with complete strangers and come out with such close friends.",
    "Structured well. It's nice to have a weekly coaching -- it keeps you accountable for rehearsing, learning music, etc. And it's fun to meet every other week and hear your friends!",
    "I think that Wendy should try to switch up the groups more.",
    "This class is excellent for improving chamber music skills! There are many resources for getting better, including two coaches, class time for listening, class time for performing, and rehearsals. All of the coaches are very supportive and engaging, and everyone in the class is so supportive when commenting and listening.",
    "Strengths: Really amazing coaches, effective course structure (weekly coaching + studio class every 2-3 weeks). Weakness: Lack of flexibility in choice of repertoire (coaches are very reluctant to let students play anything but the most standard of repertoire).",
    "Great course! Good coaching. Wish the argue quarter was around more. Otherwise, no complaints.",
    "This class is pretty well figured-out. The biggest strength is that the musicians and coaches are excellent, and class critiques are helpful and fun. Weaknesses: I would have appreciated more input on repertoire selection.",
    "It's a great course! I can't think of any improvements. The coaches are really helpful, as is feedback from the class. I do wish it was a full credit, because with rehearsals and coachings, it can be a big time commitment."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. However, it takes constant engagement and commitment. With mutual respect for your peers, this class has the potential to be an excellent experience.",
    "Yes!! If you're a musician and interested at all in chamber music, do it!! It's such an awesome experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any seriously interested in music - it offers an opportunity for structured chamber music coaching and performance that facilitates progress in music but also in group enterprises, which is always a valuable skill.",
    "Yes, take chamber! I really enjoyed my experiences.",
    "Chamber music is fun! Take it -- you'll play music with your friends, with guidance by coaches.",
    "This is an amazing class and I would recommend it to any musician.",
    "Absolutely - take this course if you're serious musician and you get into this class. The coaches are excellent, and your peers will be too. This course is one of those unique offerings that makes Yale special - it's one of the core components of the exceptionally strong classical music scene we have here. Don't miss out on the chance to incorporate quality chamber music into your liberal arts education. You'll learn a ton and make really good friends while doing so!",
    "Absolutely! Such a gem in the music department for classical instrumentalists.",
    "Great course for musicians. If you get in, I'd recommend it.",
    "YES",
    "Absolutely! This class is one of my favorite things at Yale. It lets you play chamber music at a really high level. Most of the work is self-scheduled, and the studentsand coachesare consistently top notch.",
    "Yes! This is an excellent way to play chamber music at a high level."
