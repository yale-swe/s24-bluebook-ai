    "Take it and credit\/D it. The readings are great, I would encourage history majors to take it to broaden their thinking.",
    "The readings for this class are amazing, and force you to look for the concepts of the frontier and of colonialism in texts where you would otherwise never look for them. However, discussion was often slow and Aaron wasn't always prepared with questions to jog conversation, and so class wasn't always the most productive. If you're looking for history of the frontier, this is also not the class for you. It felt more abstract than that, which is fun but also perhaps a failing of the class - we looked for frontiers everywhere and in a million ways, so it's difficult to put a finger on what the class taught beyond perspective (which is valuable, just a difficult thing to explain in a \"what I learned in this class is...\" type of way).",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I was hesitant when I saw that only five students were taking the class but I definitely did not regret my decision. The readings\/films were interesting and Aaron is an amazing discussion leader and person. This course was definitely the highlight of my schedule this semester. As long as you are prepared, seminars are super interesting\/fun."
