    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you want to write a play, take this class--as Deb says, ideas arise to serve passions, and desire and talent are the same thing. In other words, whether or not you are experienced, as long as you want to be there, you will succeed in this class. We sit in the floor, answering questions about ourselves, our plays, and our characters, usually followed by some sort of automatic writing and scene sharing. The class gets to know each other pretty well and it truly feels like a community of artists, each embarking on a project. You will need to devote time, energy, and love to this class but if you feel like you can and want to then definitely go for it.",
    "If you love writing plays, or want to learn to, please take this class. It truly is such a gift, and so is Deb, who gives all that she can to make a space for us to create and find our voices and find ourselves, without judgement and without fear. I learned so much from her and from my classmates, and as she always says, this is just the beginning of our lives making theater together. It was such an honor to be part of this class, and it's a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun, and it was very easily my favorite part of the semester! 3"
