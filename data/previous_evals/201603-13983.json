    "I learned about an entire word of scholarship on disability studies that I had not considered before. The syllabus takes a strong intersectional feminist approach to disability studies that incorporates race theory, poetry, performance art, and academic texts.",

    "Absolutely! This will change your way of thinking about disability, even if you are familiar with it, because this course believes that critical disability knowledge can affect all knowledges.",
    "YES! This was a wonderful class. I really hope that Yale takes the hint and invests in more professors who teach critical disability studies. It is an important vein of literature (both inside and outside of WGSS) and definitely has a place within our academic discourse. The material taught in this class not only provided me with a better understanding of critical disability studies but also of the various other theoretical frameworks it interacts with such as critical race theory, women of color feminism and post colonial theory. This is an integral knowledge source for disabled people or non-disabled people. Another wonderful thing about this class is that it is not just theory, but also action based. The emphasis on the final project was really to figure out how we could alter and contribute larger conversations with what we learned in the classroom. I don't think there has been another class I have taken at Yale that has as susinctly added to my own thought process and method of analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, for the exceptional opportunity of working with T.L. and the very relevant and clarifying ways of learning and seeing and interrogating that you come away with after participating in her class!",
    "Yes definitely! The subject matter is really important, and taking a class with Prof. Cowan is a real treat.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! Such a great opportunity to be part of a learning community and to read and discuss fabulous texts and be intellectually creative."
