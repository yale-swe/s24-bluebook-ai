   "comments": [
    "Great Class given the dry subject matter. Hard, but necessary for the major. Prof Brisman is a caring and hardworking teacher. Could be more flexible about opening up class to more discussion between students.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who doesn't have to take it for the English major. It's not easy by any means, and often resulted in frustration after section because the material was not made accessible or easily comprehendible. Professor Brisman is clearly very intelligent, but his class can be difficult if you don't connect with him.",
    "The main benefit of the class is improvement in writing ability. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A great course, and a great professor. I'm an English major, so taking it for the requirement, but I definitely enjoyed ENGL 125 and am really looking forward to 126. LESLIE BRISMAN IS HILARIOUS. He's old and goofy and has no qualms about telling really inappropriate jokes and funny personal anecdotes to supplement (and, often surprisingly, contribute to) our education. His style might not be for everyone, and class could move a little on the slower side, but I got a lot out of the material and Prof. Brisman is great. And as of this semester (Fall 2014) he cut back to four papers per semester, like most other instructors had done a while ago.",
    "English 123 is a survey of some super cool early English poets which focuses a lot more on making observations about the works than on drawing conclusions. I think it has the potential to be a great class, as long as you pick the right professor.",
    "A good class, a good curriculum--if you're considering ENGL 125 you probably know what it is. What I can do is try to convince you to take it with Leslie Brisman. Professor Brisman is the most passionate and involved professor I have ever had, and that is a good thing. He loves all the poets (possibly some more than others) he loves ENGL 125--and his enthusiasm is contagious. He is also incredibly smart. Every week Professor Brisman comes to class with anecdotes, often experienced over the weekend, that relate, sometimes tangentially, to the material of the day. There are reflections on current events, tales from his family, and more, and they are always charming and wonderful. Take the class for a chance to study with somebody who lives literature and who will do everything he can to help you live it, too."
