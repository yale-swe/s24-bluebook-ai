    "Lectures can be a little hard to follow.",
    "Strengths: learned a lot Weaknesses: homework and exams always graded super late. Going into the second midterm, we hadnt gotten the last two homeworks back. Sahand just posted the solutions. Thats not nearly as helpful as having our own grades work and understanding what concepts we need to work on. Same for the final; two homeworks not graded and the second exam given back like 3 days before the final. Also, this is the only class at Yale that made me actively consider whether my life had positive or negative value and whether it was worth continuing to live. Not Sahands fault, of course. If anything this is probably a compliment that he doesnt water down his course material.",
    "The course is very challenging. If you understand the lectures and materials, it will be very rewarding. Stochastic processes are directly applicable to many fields in Computer Science (my major), including computer vision, biostatistics, etc.",
    "Class focused too much on certain topics, especially when spending several lectures on one specific proof (Recurrence properties and Gaussian random vectors). Otherwise, good overview of the concepts."

   "comments": [
    "This class is difficult. Expect it to be aimed at an advanced undergraduate\/beginning graduate level. You won't see many of the applications of the things you're learning, but problem sets are fair and help to cement your understanding of the various stochastic processes taught in class. We only ever had a few of the problem sets returned, so it was difficult to know where we went wrong and improve accordingly. Take this class if you really like statistics and have a solid mathematical background.",
    "Yes. If Sahand teaches the course again, I'd recommend that you do all the readings before going to lectures, because they can be quite fast sometimes and you don't want to miss anything.",
    "This was a decent course. Turns out not too many undergrads so be wary of that."
