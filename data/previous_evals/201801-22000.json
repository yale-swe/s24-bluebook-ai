    "All Spanish skills",
    "This course taught me so much Spanish in the span of just one semester it is amazing! The course is really fast pace so we learned preterite\/imperfect, future, subjunctive, imperative, past participle and much more!",
    "My Spanish ability has definitely grown during my time in this course.",
    "In Spanish 120, I continued to learn how to read, write, listen and speak in the Spanish Language, and I developed some additional grammatical and vocabulary skills. I learned a lot more about Spanish European and Latin American culture and gained some conversational skills and personal insights as well.",
    "I learned so much more spanish than I knew when I started",
    "I gained knowledge about basic Spanish; both about the culture and the grammar itself.",
    "I strengthened my Spanish skills, especially in the spoken language.",
    "I improved the breadth of my Spanish grammar.",
    "I learned further grammar and vocabulary in spanish as one would expect. I learned how to hold more fluent conversations.",
    "Spanish listening and speaking skills improved",
    "I learned how to speak, write, listen, and comprehend Spanish on a higher level. Additionally, I was able to learn a lot more new grammatical structures.",
    "Conversational Spanish.",
    "I built on my knowledge of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. I also learned a lot about Spanish culture and improved my ability to read and write in Spanish. I also learned to value participating and speaking in Spanish more to improve my overall learning."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Well-organized and intense Weaknesses: Not enough self-study materials. The assigned book and film were not that representative of Hispanic culture.",
    "The course is very fast paced so it might be a challenge catching up at the start. It is also entirely in Spanish, which is both a strength and a weakness because you can't learn if you don't understand but eventually you will so it is a great practice for understanding Spanish in real life.",
    "The learning plan is very well structured, but sometimes the pace of the coursework is a little bit inconsistent. It could maybe be improved by balancing the homework amount more so there are fewer occasions where students go from having a few assignments one night to a large amount the following.",
    "They really help you practice speaking and writing. Some assignments like watching the movie weren't very good though",
    "Major strength was my teacher, Juliana Ramos Ruano. She made coming to class fun and enjoyable, which was why I was engaged.",
    "The strength of this course is that they vary the activities a lot to try to tie in culture as well as grammar; however, a weakness is that the class sometimes spends too much time on culture stuff and not enough time just doing grammar activities in class, a situation which results in poor performance on the grammar sections of the test. Another weakness of the course is that the workload is incredibly inconsistent. Some nights you will have a few supersite activities that take about 20 minutes and other nights you will have to watch a whole movie and answer five pages of questions on it. This course could be improved by evening out the workload by removing some of the cultural activities, which don't have that much depth. Additionally, rather than taking a two-week break after chapter 15 to do a bunch of unrelated activities before rushing chapter 16 in before the final test, we should have finished 15 and 16, taken a test, and then done the movie and book and have a separate quiz on that.",
    "This could be improved with more fair grading among the sections. One new teacher had no regards for the rules or syllabus and enabled her students to have higher test and quiz scores.",
    "More practice on listening and speaking.",
    "I think a strength of this course is its variety -- from grammar and vocabulary to oral presentations to activities and readings. The course focused on different aspects of Spanish which strengthened the overall course. It was also well organized and thought out. A weakness is that it could sometimes be boring or not as engaging."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Spanish and the culture of the Spanish-speaking world! You will learn a lot and be pushed to practice everyday, so by the end you can read small books\/speak in Spanish.",
    "This a good course to take, just be prepared for a little more work than L1. It's much more in-depth and the pace is a lot quicker, so if you have other heavy work courses you may want to do some advance preparation over the weekends so you still have time for other stuff. It's definitely possible to do well though if you put the work in. Overall, a very fun and interactive class. You do a lot of activities and really get to know the teacher and other students. Vocab and grammar also become more important. Good class to take though if you're interested in learning more about Spanish and Spanish-speaking cultures.",
    "It's not very much fun at all but you will improve in Spanish",
    "I would say to really put in the time to try to learn Spanish. Don't take short cuts.",
    "Yes. Spanish is a very useful language to know and the instructor was great.",
    "I mean if you plan on taking Spanish you kind of have to take this class. I would strongly suggest not taking it in the morning because 9:25 am five days a week can get to be pretty draining.",
    "This is a very useful course and spanish is a very useful language to know. You learn a lot and if you engage with the class you will come away knowing quite a bit of spanish.",
    "Yes but with a different teacher",
    "Its so much work if one wants to do it just for fun, considering the hectic schedules of college kids. Otherwise, it really helps improve ones Spanish skills.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, if you need this course to fulfill the language requirement, then I definitely recommend it. It is a good, deeper introduction to Spanish."
