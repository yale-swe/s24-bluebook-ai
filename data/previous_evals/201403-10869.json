    "I strongly recommend students in relevant area to select it. But it is also really time-consuming. You should consider the time you can devote.",

    "It is a fantastic course to code numerical methods. The professor is incredibly talented and caring, however, the problem sets do take a considerable amount of time to debug and may have tedious hand calculations. It is worth the effort if your research in involving systems of equations of numerical approximations.",
    "It is a course that teaches computer based numerical approximations. I would recommend it to another student because the information taught in the class is useful in a number of different fields of study.",
    "A lot of work but one gets a lot out of it. Support by professor and TAs is incredible so is feedback on problem sets."
