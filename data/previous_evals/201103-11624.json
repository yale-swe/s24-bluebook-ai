   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you have to... But if you have even the slightest inclination to want to challenge yourself, take the other PChem course. This course is really straightforward, which is great and you do learn throughout the semester. However, the course could use a more animated professor and lecture-style. Psets are also very manageable.",
    "I would not recommend this to a fellow student. But you are most likely taking this class as a requirement. It seems like the class is going to be graded on an A\/B curve, but be careful because we had a class of approximately 25 MB&B and Chem majors. I personally did not like the class because new concepts were not explained clearly. Many students in the class had taken other advanced classes and had learned many of the concepts already. In addition, Professor Yan and the TAs are not great at explaining and thus there is really no one to go to when you are confused about the topic.",
    "take it only if you need it for the major, one of the worst science classes i've ever taken",
    "Most people who are considering taking this course have to take it for the major and are probably choosing between this and the other course (333). So you have to take one of them; if you want to understand the material thoroughly, I would recommend 333. This course does teach a lot, but I felt like I left with a superficial understanding of the material that was not too much more like AP Chem",
    "Take it if you want a fun pchem class!!",
    "I would recommend that people not take this class and take the other P.Chem class instead since this isn't a well-taught course. The professor basically spent lecture rewriting the textbook.",
    "Honestly, Yale's Chem Department should be ashamed for allowing this course to be such a mess. Lectures were frequently incomprehensible, exams and problem sets were not representative of what was taught in lecture, and the class doesn't actually have much information about biological applications of pchem. It's hard to write this because Prof Yan is a very nice woman, but I want to be clear about how disappointed I was by this course. Do NOT take this class unless you are required to.",
    "I would not recommend Chemistry 328 to another student. Although I hear the physical chemistry for chemistry majors is harder, I also think they learn a lot more.",
    "Yes, because you probably have to take it if you are even reading this. But be prepared for the final. It's really hard.",
    "Not many biological applications, but not an incredibly difficult course as compared to others by the chemistry department. Take this class if you have to for your major or if you are really, REALLY, interested in chemistry. Otherwise not worth your time.",
    "Not difficult, but the class is incredibly full of premeds so it's actually tougher to get a good grade than if the class was more difficult. Obviously no one takes this except MB&B majors.",
    "If you are an MB&B major, then there's no escaping. I just hope you don't get Prof. Yan. Here is what to watch out for if you do get her:1. She is terrible at explaining concepts. If you are not familiar with what's being discussed in class, don't get behind! Watch the MIT lectures on kinetics and thermodynamics.2. She has notes on the chapter on pdf. They are a replica from the textbook. Both sources are awful and a waste of time. Maybe the textbook is okay if you are well versed in the material.3. The TA's did not do a good job either. Section was dumb b\/c they would just re-derive the formulas she derived in class. It would be like attending the same class twice. I would end up with two copies of the notes.4. Most of the problem sets come from the textbook, and Prof. Yan seems to expect you to get the solutions manual for the textbook, so do so! The solutions manual is also terribly written and littered with mistakes, so the homework will still be a pain.5. The midterms aren't bad. There are 3, and one of them gets dropped. This year, she made two of them easy and one tough. The final was impossibly hard... sorry.Watch out for these things and good luck.",
    "It's not bad at all until the final, but that exam was legitimately the hardest test I have ever taken. You probably have to take the class for your major, so just don't get psyched out ahead of time. It's relevant information, presented in a generally manageable manner.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 332 over this pchem course because their class has homework every week, ensuring that you keep up with the material.",
    "Oh P-Chem...I still can't decide if this class was easy or hard. Not much \"work\" at all, just a few problem sets due on exam days. The exams aren't a joke, and the final was actually quite difficult. The teaching leaves a lot to be desired, and sometimes it didn't feel like heading up to science hill at 9am for lecture was worth it. This class will be much easier than CHEM 332, but the other class will give you a more rigorous understanding of p-chem. Here you learn the fundamentals, with a little bit of application to biology. Overall, no real reason to take it if you don't have to, but if you need to take it you'll be fine and have a decent time.",
    "Broad, textbook survey of thermo, kinetics, colligative properties. Very easy material, so exams are made harder by either being far too long or depending on algebraic manipulations that take forever. Nearly the entire class can be gleaned from the professor's excellent, thorough posted lecture notes.",
    "cold hard class. material is not the most interesting, the way it is taught doesn't make it any better.",
    "No. Professor mumbled, you have to teach yourself, problem sets are due of the day of the exam and every once in a while a question from the problem set (on which you've received no feedback) shows up on the exam. Midterms are pretty easy, but the final is ridiculously hard.",
    "No. It is not taught well.",
    "Only take it for your major, possibly one of the worst taught classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it only if you need to take it for your major. Otherwise chem 118 is a really good intro coursefor physical chemistry.",
    "CHEM 328 is physical chemistry with applications in the biological sciences, and it does a good job of incorporating biological applications. The lectures can be dry, as Professor Yan usually follows the book fairly closely. Professor Yan's special topics are the best lectures of the semester, though, and are really interesting!",
    "This class is ok. That it's at 9am is brutal. The prof. teaches from the book, and going to class doesnt necessarily help with understanding the material.",
    "I was required to take Chem 328 for MBB, and I probably wouldn't have taken it besides the requirement. I did find the class interesting and not too much work. The lectures were dry and early in the morning.",
    "If you are an MB&B major, I would highly recommend shopping the other p-chem class before deciding which one to take. I didn't do that because I assumed this class would be more manageable (and I am more on the biochemistry than biophysics side of the major), but I have heard better things about the other class.Unfortunately, this class was a tough and frustrating experience for me. It's not that material is difficult per se, but the class is not well-structured (e.g. psets due the day of each exam), and the difficulty level of the exams was EXTREMELY inconsistent.If the class does not change much from this year, be prepared for an extremely tough final. I also might recommend buying a different textbook because the required text isn't great."
