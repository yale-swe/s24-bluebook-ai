   "comments": [
    "The course would be stronger if there were a greater focus on conversation. The textbook is much more vocabulary-based than it is dialogue-based; I think a focus on practical, everyday dialogues (and a stronger level of attention to tones and accurate pronunciation) would improve outcomes.",
    "The strengths of the course is the size and the repetitiveness of the exercises, really drilling into you a new language. The openness of the instructor fostered a welcoming and supportive environment. The weaknesses of this course primarily dealt with organization -- from the textbook to the structure of the class. The textbook was not organized in a clear manner and thus made the class activities a little confusing."

    "Such a fun class to take! Professor Quang is an excellent teacher and engages us with all sorts of material to ensure that we are developing good written, listening and speaking skills. The class also tends to be smaller in size, which means that each student gets a lot of attention.",
    "It is a nice way to learn Vietnamese, however you feel at a disadvantage if you come completely without any knowledge of any of the cultural differences or language conceptions."
