    "I learned how to be conscious about my acting choices - not always to go for the first idea, but to challenge myself to go beyond.",
    "Comfort and familiarity with some of the basic theories of acting. Exercises and new approaches to scenework and monologues. A sense of confidence in and commitment to my creative impulses",
    "This course put the skill of acting into context, rather than making it a realm of connecting with abstract feelings. I learned how to read a script for a character - to identify motivations, actions, etc. and just to have fun with performance through practical skills and exercises I can take with me for future work."

   "comments": [
    "I think the organization of each class period could improve. Watching other students' performances and the critiques that Hal gave were interesting in the beginning, but after awhile, it just got to be boring. Hal didn't really encourage students to give feedback as he was giving it, so we didn't really exercise looking at a piece critically. I think that there should also be more games in general. That being said, I think that this course was really, really effective overall. I loved taking it.",
    "Strengths: A great variety of exercises and ways of learning involving practical exercises, improv, prepared pieces, films, plays, writing exercises, etc. Weaknesses: Some of the exercises could benefit from a discussion about how they relate to the course ideas we are learning about.",
    "I wish the performance concepts had included more overtly different theories than just Stanislavsky and Hagen (which in many ways is just Stanislavsky again).",
    "A strength was that we would work on the same scenes for weeks at a time. Rather than trying to sweep across an emotional range, we worked on the technique of reaching an emotional pitch in acting that we could apply to future scenes. We were pushed to work creatively as individuals at home and work actively with partners in class. The reading responses didn't seem very helpful. Weekly readings were helpful, though we could have discussed them less in class and performed more and having the chapters farther in advance would have been helpful (as would having digital copies available). I would have liked to have been more welcome to contribute to feedback on performances, as Professor Brooks usually was the only one to provide feedback after students performed a scene, and after each variation of the scene."
