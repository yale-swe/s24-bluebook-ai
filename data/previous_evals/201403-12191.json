    "Yes.",
    "Lit's hard, but it's definitely worth it. There's a reason these books are classics. Even as a STEM pre-med major, I found Hill's class completely manageable and interesting. While not directly applicable to my life after DS, it's still definitely worth it.",
    "I would say it is like a crash course in all the great works of Western literature up until Dante's Divine Comedy. There are some interesting thematic threads that weave their way throughout, but you shouldn't expect to delve as deeply as one ought to into any of the works you read.",
    "Take literature with Professor Hill if you have the chance! He brought his political background to literature, and the resulting fusion of the two disciplines was fascinating. Prof Hill's many idiosyncratic anecdotes brought color and variety to our literature discussion. If you take this class, just remember: start at the beginning!",
    "A fantastic course - in my opinion, the best of the three DS courses. The works you read are, for the most part, incredibly interesting and not ones you really have to slog through. Professor Hill is an incredibly knowledgeable instructor who strikes a good balance between sharing his own insights and allowing the section to discuss on their own and reach their own conclusions.",
    "It was a really interesting course and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "You'll get something out of DS Lit if you take it, but it may not be what you want. If you're interested in literature more than in the other two disciplines, be warned that, although you will be in a seminar format and thus have close access to a professor, your professor may not be the kind you would want; DS is one of the few programs (if not the only program) at Yale where professors teach in disciplines that are not their own. This CAN be goodreally, I've heard great things about some such casesbut it also can be really, really bad."
