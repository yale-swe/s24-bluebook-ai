   "comments": [
    "I'm a Christian and took this course because I think I want to major in religious studies and I loved my DS philosophy course. After DS, it was disappointing to only get 50 minutes in section with a TA per week in order to try to understand all the material instead of 150 minutes per week with a professor. The readings were dense, but the lectures were really good. John Hare is a wonderful professor. I only wish that we'd had more time to really explore the material. The workload is good, too - readings, a total of two 5-page papers, best 3 out of 4 quizzes, and a final.",
    "Take it if you're curious about religion. It's not that time-consuming but very rewarding.",
    "Yes! I had never taken a philosophy course before, and this really opened my eyes to many different aspects of an unfamiliar subject. I am also not a very religious person (or I guess I just didn't know much about religion) and this class really helped shape my beliefs.",
    "This class is fantastic for people who enjoy philosophy and find themselves wondering about the core questions of the class: what are the arguments for the existence of God? How can there be a good God with so much evil in the world? etc. If those questions don't fascinate you though, I would try a different class.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the meta-stuff of religion, whether you're religious or not.",
    "Amazing class, professor Hare is insirational. The material could have been a little bit more balanced but none the less a great philosophy class.",
    "If you even marginally like religion, take this class. It'll get you thinking about your own views, whatever they are, in a whole new light that I feel is necessary for one to continue believing what it is they believe. take it.",
    "Very interesting class, had me thinking long into the night at times. workload not bad.",
    "Expect breadth, not depth. It's a survey, not so bad, but you have only two essays (five pages) and four ridiculous quizzes (you drop one) where you're trying to prove that you've done the reading. Hare's great, but he mostly talks about the reading, and my section wasn't thrilling. There's also a final.",
    "This is a great course in a subject that is extremely important for philosophy (especially up until the modern age). Considerations of religion come up everywhere, and this class gets at key issues that will be interesting to almost anyone.",
    "I would recommend this class because there ARE a surprising number of interesting arguments in this topic beyond what one might initially imagine. However, I would warn people that, unlike most philosophy classes, this one necessitates a ton of \"busy work,\" that is, remembering who said which piece of minutiae.",
    "It's a pretty entertaining class without a lot of work. If you've read anything or given two thoughts to the nature of reality and religion, it won't be much you haven't already considered. Nonetheless, there are some interesting niche discussions. If you can tolerate fifty minutes of inane discussion sections with the illiterate halfwits who are supposedly your peers, you'll probably like it.",
    "Take it. I did as an elective. The readings are all very interesting. Lecture is great. Work not too bad.",
    "This is a fantastic class. It probably won't change your views, but it will definitely change the way you view the topic. Definitely take this if you have even the remotest interest in the topic-it will almost certainly change your life. It's a decent amount of work, but nothing out of the ordinary.",
    "This is a great course to take as a Yale student. This class gives you good arguments for all sides of interpreting religion. Professor Hare is amazing.",
    "I would definitely recommend Philosophy of Religion to another student. Even if you haven't thought about religion much, this is a great course for just expanding your critical thinking skills. If you are interested in religion or think that you'd like to explore it more, this is a great way to do so. The course allows you to think hard about a variety of issues related to religion and exposes you to some of the classic philosophical arguments in religion. Truly a great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anybody- religious or not. I came in as an atheist who had never really thought about philosophical arguments for and against religion, and I felt that this class really broadened my horizons. It was engaging and interesting, and I actually think I want to be a Philosophy major after taking it.",
    "Great course. If you're religious, you should take it so that you know what's out there and think about some of the issues intrinsic to religion which you may not have thought about yet. If you're not religious, you should take it so that you see that people do have well-thought-out reasons for believing religion.",
    "This is a very interesting overview course to the philosophy of religion, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone wanting to think through all of the various issues regarding religion. I took it Cr\/D\/Fail and found that I was fine just going to the lectures and not doing readings, since the lectures largely just cover the readings.",
    "Best course I've taken at Yale. You cover all the major arguments for and against God, and the readings are extremely stimulating. Professor Hare is awesome. I would strongly recommend doing the reading before lecture because you take away a lot more that way.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course, especially as a Cr\/D\/F.",
    "I would highly highly recommend taking Philosophy of Religion, especially with John Hare!! This course will expose you to the different subject areas in Philosophy of Religion, challenge you with analytically rigorous material, and force you to reflect on your own faith - regardless of what that might be. This is a survey course, and as such, you will walk away with a better understanding of arguments for and against God, as well as arguments for how to conceptualize religion. The point of the class is not to help you believe in God or not believe in God, but rather expose you to different arguments to get you to think in a different way about religion itself (in addition to finding the arguments that most appeal to you).Also, I wouldn't worry about not being a philosophy major. It might help to have taken a couple other philosophy courses so you are familiar with reading analytical philosophy as well as writing philosophy papers, but there are many non-philosophy majors in the class. Start the course on credit and see how you do on the first quiz and the first paper - that will be a good indication of how you will do because the rest is similar (the final is like the quizzes and papers combined). Disclaimer: I am an econ major who has taken 3 other philosophy courses.What really makes this course unbelievable is Professor Hare. His lectures are simply brilliant: he elucidates the material very clearly and at the proper pace so as to allow students to absorb everything. Moreover, he always adds his own opinion, which provides balance to the given argument. He is very respectful of other faiths, and he is always clear when he provides his own analysis.My TA, Julia Von Bodelschwingh, was awesome. She gives great feedback about papers and section is a nice complement to the course.If you use this course as a way to really think about your own religious background (or lack thereof) it will be very meaningful and rewarding.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're looking for the background to discuss issues regarding religion in general.Gives a good foundation in some major schools of thought and to some major issues (problem of evil, religious pluralism,etc.) that I had wrestled with personally before this class, and I felt much better equipped to continue doing so going forward.",
    "Take it if you'be ever thought seriously or even semi-seriously about the questions of religion. Hare is very thorough in going through the readings and his explanations are often far more interesting than the readings themselves."
