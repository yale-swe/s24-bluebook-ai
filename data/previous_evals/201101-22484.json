    "You learn to read Middle English poetry. I learned a lot about the origins of words, and how they add to the interpretation of the text. You learn to find scholarly articles and use them in papers, good skills to have in any major.Make sure you're interested in Chaucer - I don't think I was interested in Chaucer enough to put in the effort to completely read and understand a lot of the works like Troilus and Criseyde, the Book of the Duchess, and the Parliament of the Fowls. Canterbury Tales is always fun to read and I think because we had to read criticism on them, it was more enriching that the first time around in English 125. There are a lot of papers, andinterest in the subject will go a long way in motivating you to work on them and think of a creative argument. That said, there are better-taught English classes, with more experienced, dynamic professors.",
    "English 169 provides an overview of the poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer and a simultaneous look at a fascinating period in the English tradition of writing about love, desire, and marriage. Questions of etymology and questions of gender theory are all relevant. If you enjoy early English poetry and\/or thinking about the way writers theorize love, I recommend the class. Prof. Cornelius draws the theme and the texts together beautifully, and in addition is very helpful when it comes to drafting and writing papers.If you are looking for an in-depth linguistic study, look elsewhere for that, but consider this class anyway. The term I took it, this class did not have an especially strong discussion dynamic -- but if you and others take it with the intention of coming to class prepared to comment on the readings, that can change."
