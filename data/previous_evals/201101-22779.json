   "comments": [
    "I found this semester of H\/P more immediately engaging than the first. Prof. Mantena is an excellent section leader, even if her section was a bit sleepy at 9AM.",
    "History and Politics is a great introduction course for someone interested in political philosophy, great books and western cannon. I wholeheartedly enjoyed HP and felt that I've explored some of the books in depth when I wrote the papers about them. I cannot imagine my freshman year without Directed Studies.",
    "RECOMMENDED. AND DO ALL OF THE READING. Seriously this is the juiciest part of directed studies. Our world is based on what you read in second semester H&P. You cannot understand the world we live in without having read all of these authors (and more!)",
    "If you liked DS History and Politics fall term, you will probably really enjoy this class. I found the spring term texts much more engaging.You are lucky if you get Professor Mantena. She is smart and clear. She asks interesting questions during discussion. Her essay questions are very straightforward and you will be in great shape for the final exam.Be warned, though: there is an almost impossible amount of reading. Some of the bi-weekly assignments took me 5 hours to read, much less take notes or process the info.",
    "I found it DS History& Politics spring semester much harder than fall semester, but just that much more rewarding. The works may not be as entertaining as those of fall semester, but they are much more cohesive when considered in tandem (from Machiavelli to Arendt) and as you read them you realize why modernpolitical thought is contingent upon them. The reading you have every week sometimes seems inhumanely possible, but if you work hard to get through it, you will emerge not only with a great deal of knowledge in political thought, but also with a more critical, informed way of thinking, because this course emphasizes the importance of considering each work you read here in light of the other works you read here.",
    "History and Politics is an enormous amount of reading, and you have to be prepared for that going into the class. That being said, everything we read second semester is extremely significant in history, so even though the reading is hard to get through it's still interesting concepts. The lectures, however, were very hit-or-miss, sometimes being really helpful and interesting and at other times very convoluted or rushed."
