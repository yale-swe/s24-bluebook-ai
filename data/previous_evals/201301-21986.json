    "Awesome class, DEFINITELY TAKE IT IF YOU CAN",
    "If you love film, and really understanding all its subtleties, this course is for you",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, whether you are new to Hitchcock or have been watching his movies all your life. It would be a great introduction to his films, watching 16 of his bests. The readings are very theoretical, but it's rewarding when you are truly able to understand them.",
    "Yes. Great class, interesting papers. Good discussion.",
    "If you've never taken a film course, this is a great one to take. You watch great movies and discuss them well. Take it.",
    "This class is a lot of fun: an engaging but low-key seminar with a straightforward syllabus - watch a survey of Hitchcock's films chronologically, covering different themes and perspectives each week from the criticism on his work. Screenings and readings are great, and retain their interest even if you come into the class knowing Hitchcock's films fairly well. Professor Peucker is extremely knowledgeable about Hitchcock's work and leads discussions that are lively and productive.",
    "Alfred Hitchcock is a wonderful director, and this course is the perfect way to grow better accustomed to him. I would recommend this course, particularly as a fifth course."
