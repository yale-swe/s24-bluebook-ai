    "I am glad we took such a broad look at Greek drama. Most of the time, the one opportunity to read Greek drama comes in a Directed Studies or theater survey course setting. As a result, you only read the Oresteia and the Medea or the Bacchae, for example. The opportunity to delve into less-read texts provided an opportunity for a much needed profound understanding of each of the playwrights' styles, and a sense of Greek society in general.Professor Robinson always gave good background information ranging from historical and cultural information about Greece and insights into Greek words and grammar in the text. Such background was always useful for a better understanding of the texts and always provided the material from which I would begin my own thinking in class papers.I recommend the class for those with a variety of interests. For humanities folks, these are necessary for anybody who wants to be well-read and understand ancient Greece. For theater folks, this is a look at where it all began. And for the rest, it certainly cannot hurt to take a look at the ancient world, as you might be pleasantly surprised at the relevance and relatability of Greek culture-- whether the dark psychological depths of tragedy or the vulgar wit of comedy.",
    "This course is a great for anyone looking to build a solid foundation of Greek drama and become familiar with the famous plays of the ancient Greeks. Professor Robinson is a great professor and very passionate about the subject. This was a great discussion class and the workload was definitely manageable.",
    "Drama& Demos is an interesting class. Though there is a LOT of reading (two plays per week, for a total of 26), there are only three papers, so the class does not feel like a lot of work. Professor Robinson can only be described as a brilliant sweetheart - he is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to the classics, but he doesn't let that stand in the way of being a kind and thoughtful professor. Though I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who is looking for a lot of literary analysis, if you're interested in the classics or Greek history, this would be an enjoyable, not overly-demanding class.",
    "Yes. This is a fun course. Professor Robinson is quirky and has the greatest, most corny sense of humor that you'll love once you get used to it. The grading isn't tough and you get to read some great ancient plays. Every seminar will not hold you in rapt attention, but this is a really good course overall.",
    "Good, interesting course for the readings and discussions."
