    "This course is a valuable opportunity to gain lab experience if you want to guage your interest in research. The experience varies from lab to lab, but I have generally found it to be a rewarding and fun way to work closely with graduate students doing exciting research.",
    "This is a way to fulfill the passion for research that everyone in cognitive science should have while simultaneously earning yourself a credit and a being able to interact with absolutely brilliant professors. I cannot imagine why anyone who was truly interested in cognitive science wouldn't want to take this course. That said, I've done more work for this course than any other directed study or any other class for that matter...still its worth it to take this and drop some other class."
