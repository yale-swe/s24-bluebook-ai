   "comments": [
    "Overall, the class is quite intensive, but helpful in learning how to collect and interpret data, and what the biological ramifications of that data are. I would recommend it for that reason.",
    "I would not recommend this to another student, but that doesn't matter all that much because it is a required class. I wish it were more biophysics oriented and taught us the general things we need to know instead of going into so much detail for things that I don't need to know for my research. If I wanted to know everything about crystallography I would take the workshop in the spring.",
    "It was easily the most difficult class that I have taken to date, but the knowledge I learned was invaluable and the material is simply difficult, so the only way to ever understand it is throw yourself in and keep trying until something clicks. For anybody interested in structural biology, I think it's a crucial class, but be prepared for a hard semester.",
    "Extremely hard. Only take it if you are doing NMR or crystallography in your lifetime",
    "This class is tough and time consuming, but necessary. If there are any aspects of molecular biophysics that aren't in your background, this course will definitely get you into a place where you can at least discuss the topics, but I would definitely recommend working together with the class as often as possible.",
    "good class learned alot, could be less busy work with the hw assignments",
    "I would recommend that somebody audit the class because the subject material is very interesting and useful. However, the problemsets and exams are unpredictable and hard.",
    "Some material is helpful other could be improved.",
    "It is a very difficult class with a lot of work, but you will take a lot away from the class. I definitely recommend it because even though it was brutal during the semester, I feel like I took a lot away from it.",
    "It's a great class where you learn a lot of techniques but a lot of work has to be put on it.",
    "Yes. Very useful and will be indispensable to my future career. Would definitely recommend.",
    "It is a great course. Despite the difficulty, this course deepens my scientific knowledge and would definitely be really helpful for my future in grad school. Definitely would recommend this course.",
    "Yes. Good and helpful course.",
    "This course is a great survey course on the topics and methods in the field of structural biology. The instructors are clear experts in the topics they cover, and present course material in a clear and well-organized way. This is a great course for the first-year graduate student or a student new to the discipline.",
    "Yes, overall a very nice and useful course.",
    "good course! require a lot of work.",
    "The course is an excellent overview of the structural techniques used to study biological system. I would absolutely recommend it to someone interested in structure determination or someone who is curious about the field."

   "comments": [
    "We covered topics that will be helpful for me to do biochemical and biophysical research but, again, I felt like the emphasis was not put on the most useful parts of each topic.",
    "I am sure I will use one of the techniques we studied in my own research, but even if I end up not using anything, I need to be able to critically examine others work using these methods. The beginning of the course was a great way to make sure we knew a lot of basic numbers and facts about biochemistry that were forgotten since college or fell between the gaps. I feel much more confident in my ability to pursue my own research in the coming years.",
    "This was my first structure class, so I easily learned more about structure than I did in all of undergrad.",
    "I learned a little bit about the theory behind many techniques I will likely use such as crystallography and mass spec.",
    "I enjoyed learning about crystallography. I am considering joining a structural lab.",
    "I learned a lot of techniques that may or may not be applicable in my future research. Even if only one of them is useful though, I would say that the course was more than worth it.",
    "I learned a lot in terms of how Mass Spec and NMR can help test kinetic problems. The NMR section was very helpful as I plan on working on an anti-thesis project regarding NMR.",
    "Yes, unequivocally. Coming from a small liberal arts college, I felt that my background knowledge in biochemical and biophysical techniques was specific, but lacking in breadth. I felt like I got the broad education that I sought coming to Yale through Macro.",
    "This course provided me with a good foundation in the field of structural biology. Undoubtedly, I will build upon the concepts learned in this course in my research and career.",
    "This course provides us both the basics and also the tools that could be used in our research."
