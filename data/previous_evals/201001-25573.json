    "The work load is fair, and it's worth taking. Koundi is a really good teacher.",

    "Yes it is a good way to speak and read french.",
    "Take the class for the readings. They are the best part of the class and make up for dreary French grammar.",
    "A course that is not worth taking due to its ridiculous work expectations and unfair tests. But if they had to take it, make sure its with Koundi.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course, especially with Mme Koundi. French 130 is a course that allows students to improve their french speaking, writing, and reading abilities. That being said, the course is worthwhile only if you are motivated to improve and complete all of the work. Most (if not all) students take the course because they had to satisfy their language requirement. If you treat it as merely a requirement, you will miss out on the opportunity of reaping the benefits of a great language program. If you take it seriously, you will be surprised by the progress you have made by the end of the semester!"
