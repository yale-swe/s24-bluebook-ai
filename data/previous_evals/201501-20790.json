    "Beginning with 12th century troubadour poetry, we surveyed traditions of medieval song from France to England. Yes, I would recommend the course for medievalists and modernists alike.",
    "This class has looked at lyrics from a wide variety of perspectives, from genre to performance and transmission. We looked at music and manuscripts, at plays and short poems. I would highly recommend this class because it has been so varied, and the work we have done has clearly been relevant to students from several periods and disciplines.",
    "A survey of the \"lyric\" in the Medieval period in England and France, focusing on multi-dimensional aspects of the lyric (text, song, image, manuscript). A knowledge of Old French would be beneficial, though without it, the texts can be read in translation. I would recommend this course to another student! I learned more in this course about the value of questioning genre and preconceptions of literature than I ever considered beforehand. It was illuminating and downright fun!"

   "comments": [
    "Good experience of speaking across period and discipline divides.",
    "This course has taught me to challenge a lot of the assumptions that can be made regarding genre and regarding manuscript studies, which I hope will influence my thinking from now on. The texts themselves have been a pleasure to read and I was glad to have been introduced to them. I also think that the weekly blogging has given me experience in writing shorter responses.",
    "To put it plainly, I had no idea that this aspect of Medieval studies even existed--I hadn't given it thought before. I absolutely loved every single bit of this course and the material and I am seriously considering many facets of this course in my future research and in my study of medieval literature. So much remains untapped in this incredible niche! I hope to do much more work on it in the future."
