   "comments": [
    "LEARNED SO MUCH CALCULUS IN PHYSICS, as well as applications of the material I had somewhat learned before.",
    "All the physics",
    "I learned a lot about mechanics in Physics this semester.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of physics and how to think through college level physics problems.",
    "Using mathematical (algebra) manipulations to derive relationships that are not immediately obvious, but when more closely observed, reveal subtle but interesting consequences in physics.",
    "Great understanding of physics.",
    "I developed my problem solving and critical thinking skills by engaging in physics problems in a deeper and more technical way than I ever had before.",
    "I learned a lot about physics, and it was very interesting. This class has little to nothing to do with my major, and I was pretty angry being compelled to take it, but it could have been worse. It could have been boring, which it was not.",
    "A completely better comprehension of physics and the skills needed to solve physics problems.",
    "Discipline about getting the homework done and starting to study for the test early, as well as skills about how to approach different types of problems. I learned how to manipulate equations that were much more complex than what I was used to and how to take a small amount of information given in a problem to extrapolate important conclusions.",
    "Kinematics (force, torque, energy), how to struggle during a pset but not give up!",
    "The course provides an overview of different topics in mechanics (forces, torques, energy, etc). It also helps develop problem-solving skills and apply math concepts learned elsewhere to a practical scenario.",
    "Having never taking a physics course before in my life, professor Steinacker taught me how to think critically about the nature of physics and movement (kinematics, rotational motion, collisions, forces, torque, gravity, angular, and simple-harmonic motion, to name a few). She teaches you how to figure out a problem based on what you know and gives you a more intuitive understanding of physics.",
    "I learned how to do integration by parts :\/",
    "I gained the knowledge to apply theoretical concepts derived in physical formulas to insightful problems.",
    "I learned fundamental physics on the college level to the point where my span of logical thinking has improved.",
    "Introductory mechanics knowledge",
    "I gained a deep understanding of introductory mechanics.",
    "I learned a lot about kinematics, rotational kinematics, forces, energy, etc",
    "I learned a lot about taking theoretical concepts we learned and applying it to real life situations.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about how different systems in the universe operate in terms of kinematics, moving pendulums, rotational motion (among others).",
    "In this semester of physics, we learned about linear kinematics, relative motion, circular motion kinematics, forces, energy and work, collisions\/momentum\/momentum conservation, center of mass and momentum, \"rocket\" problems, moments of inertia, rotational kinematics, torque and rotational dynamics, angular momentum and energy, gravity, orbits, and simple harmonic oscillation. We also touched on waves but will be carrying that topic over into the next semester. In terms of skills, Professor Steinacker was amazing at challenging us yet also providing the help that we needed via office hours (10 hours\/week) and study halls (12 hours\/week), so I learned a lot about how to approach new problems with the provided formulas. She taught us how to extract information from word problems, how to draw diagrams to better illustrate the problem, and tips for solving equations algebraically. Some pset questions also included an \"explain the answer\" which helped drill in the conceptual idea of the problem.",
    "Physics",
    "So much in classical physics! Linear and Rotational Kinematics, Inertial Frames of Reference, Circular Motion (uniform and non-uniform), Forces, Torque, Angular Momentum, Energy Conservation and Work-Energy-Theorem, Gravity Laws, Harmonic Motion, and a bit of Waves, and more. Mostly a new way to approach problems, with an intuitive understanding (built over time and lectures) of how objects interact with one another and in time and space, so that by the end formulas never needed to be memorized, just understood and applied.",
    "How to solve problems methodically and think critically Kinetics, mechanics, simple harmonic motion, gravity, waves",
    "I learned a lot in the class. I learned about kinematics, energy, rotational dynamics, etc. These were all really hard concepts.",
    "I have a better understanding of the mechanics behind our physical world.",
    "In high school, I took AP physics but was pretty terrible at it and was terrified that university physics would destroy my morale and GPA. I have learned that physics isnt as scary as I thought it would be and while I still dont love physics, at least I halfway understand it. This is all thanks to Professor Steinacker and many hours attending office hours of course.",
    "This course teaches the main concepts of calculus-based physics (energy and momentum conservation, moment of inertia, the forces that work on an object, etc.)",
    "I developed a comfort in working without numbers, became more fluent in algebra and mathematical manipulation, and overall improved my problem-solving abilities (especially proofs). I learned how to both use methodical procedures and experiment to solve problems, and experienced the excitement and sense of accomplishment of puzzling out difficult problems in these ways.",
    "I learned a lot with time management in regards to the problem sets and a lot about general physics concepts.",
    "I gained an in depth knowledge about physics that I didn't know before. The problem sets helped refine my skills, and the tests were very fair.",
    "Classical mechanics",
    "Problem solving, introductions to physics. I have never taken any physics before, but Steinacker made everything so clear and approachable.",
    "This course was similar to my high school physics classes with added calculus, so the calculus addition would be the main thing.",
    "A deeper understanding of physics.",
    "I developed skills in approaching complex problems slowly in an effort to understand the system prior to calculations. I gained a very thorough understanding of introductory physics and learned how basic concepts apply in complex situations. I also learned patience and problem-solving skills from the difficult problem sets given as homework.",
    "Classical mechanics mostly, a good calculus review, problem solving skills",
    "I learned how to plan long term and take relevant notes in a lecture. I also learned how to ask for help to learn what I didnt know.",
    "I felt like a learned, even if just by a tiny bit, how the world works",
    "Energy, Momentum, Angular Motion, 2D Kinematics, Simple Harmonic Motion, Waves",
    "Learned a lot about classical physics and problem solving.",
    "This class was extremely challenging. The sheer perseverance you gain from completing the 15+ hour psets and attending office hours daily is unlike any other I have developed. As a first year, I will admit this class made me question my decision to pursue a STEM field multiple times but I think the support offered was invaluable. The only way to pass is to ask for help, find the people who are willing to help, talk to your peer tutors, and talk to the professor. I did a lot better than I thought I would have but only because I realized early on that I needed the help. I think this was an extremely humbling experience and as difficult as it was I am very grateful for it.",
    "learned how to tackle physics problems!",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of basic physics principals such as linear and rotational kinematics, as well as the principals of orbital dynamics, and simple harmonic oscillation. Most importantly I was able to practice extensive algebraic manipulation and conceptualizing complex physical phenomena.",
    "I learned how to solve mechanical physics problems.",
    "General knowledge of physics and a bit beyond",
    "I gained much knowledge about fundamental physics. I also believe the difficulty and rigor of this class challenged me in ways that I have not previously encountered before. It taught me how to approach answering problems that might not have an obvious solution at first glance. I have also realized that while a question may be difficult, the pursuit of the right answer provides a certain degree of satisfaction as well, contributing to my overall understanding of the topic. This class has also taught me to think through potential solutions critically and in different ways, as few problems have the same exact method of solution. I was able to develop a sense of what pursuing a career in engineering might entail.",
    "I was able to develop problem solving skills, specifically for multistep problems. Mechanics and forces knowledge was gained, with the course covering kinetics, circular motion, torque, work, energy, etc. The derivations for many of the essential equations related to these topics were also taught."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - office hours EVERY DAY with the teacher - beautiful lecture notes - highly prepared lecture",
    "Fantastic help net for this course, office hours and study halls with the professor and TAs almost every single day, and multiple times a day at that.",
    "The course was great for introductory level Physics.",
    "There is a consistent level of work required every week to succeed. That said, occasionally we have extremely busy weeks with other classes. Though Adriane is very lenient with extensions and such, it may be nice to drop a single homework grade.",
    "The calculus knowledge required for this course is overwhelming for someone with very limited prior calculus experience. Taking Math 115 before taking this course would be a good suggestion for prospective students in this course.",
    "The lectures are great in my opinion. They're interesting, and although Professor Steinecker goes rather fast, it was okay with me. She's really enthusiastic about physics, which I genuinely appreciate, and apparently people who go to her office hours really like it there with her. Some ways to improve the class maybe include adding a little multivariable pdf or little review session for anyone who has no exposure or who has forgotten it. Like there's not much multi in this class, so it wouldn't really be that hard to give students that little amount of exposure instead of scaring them with \"double integrals ooooo\".",
    "Strengths: The instructor was extremely engaging and thorough in her explanations of concepts.",
    "Strengths: the organization of the class. Steinacker's lecture notes were always clear, organized, and posted online soon after the class. They were very important for me when I was looking back at the material for a second time to have guidance and to be able to fill in some of the gaps I may have missed during class. I also appreciated the ample amount of support via office hours and study halls, as well as the fact that the PSETs were challenging enough to prepare us for the tests. Weakness: lectures move very quickly so I usually don't actually end up understanding the problems she puts on the board. I end up just writing a lot of calculations without understanding how we got to them, which then makes applying the material so much harder. I think the class might benefit from doing fewer problems but going through the especially difficult ones a bit slower and then leaving the ones we don't get to in the lecture notes (kind of like what happens in the reviews)",
    "Professor Steinacker cares so much that it's incredible. No other professor I know hosts extensive office hours every day of the week. She does everything possible to help students succeed in the course, whether that's posting notes, review sessions, pset hints, or giving us advice on how to work thru difficult problems. The only thing I'd say to improve is to do more demos - we did a lot at the beginning of the semester, and they were really exciting and got me interested in the physics behind what we were observing, but we did a lot less demos as the concepts got harder, which made these new concepts (especially astronomy) even more difficult to fully understand.",
    "Strengths: Professor Steinacker is amazing! The grading policy is generous, since you can gain half of your points back on tests by doing corrections. There's also a ton of support for the class, with peer tutor hours almost every night and Prof. Steinacker's office hours almost every day. Weaknesses: It's hard, but that's not really a weakness.",
    "Professor Steinacker is a wonderful person - she is just unbelievably kind, considerate, and passionate about physics. Her lectures focus on understanding why these physical properties exist (which sometimes makes them a bit dry, but gives you an intuitive sense of the science). The psets are what kills you in this course - they generally take about 8 to 10 hours. It is imperative that you go to office hours if you can't figure out a problem (or 4 lol). Anyway, the psets are long, but they prepare you well for the exams. Speaking of exams, the course is very forgiving in that Professor Steinacker will let you do exam revisions to make back half credit of the points you lost, which saves literally everyone.",
    "The course is organized pretty well in the first half, but the second half was much less organized.",
    "The course was very engaging and it was very easy to get help when needed.",
    "Problem sets will take up a large chunk of the week and I felt like I was incapable of doing anything on my own, but I learned from when I was able to receive help on the problem sets.",
    "The class is pretty difficult, even for a student who has taken AP Physics C in high school. The problem sets also take an eternity and are very extensive.",
    "There are no weaknesses! The professor is amazing and so willing to help and her lectures are amazing and easy to understand. She also had office hours every day which is amazing.",
    "Great course!",
    "The class is very very well taught. The psets are incredibly difficult and are time consuming. It's a difficult class to take when every pset requires multiple office hour visits and feels impossible to do alone. It really made every other class I had so much more difficult just because of how time-consuming this class is and it would drain me every single week. It eats up your time in a way other psets don't. It would be nice if the psets were cut down to even just 6-7 problems instead of 8-9. Or even just 2-3 main problems with multiple parts to it. However, the professor is kind with extensions. It was also incredibly kind to have test corrections for the midterms. Also a life-saver is her notes that she posts after every lecture, it helps to clear up a lot of questions.",
    "The strength of this class is certainly the professor. Professor Steinacker is one of the most caring and dedicated professors I have ever had the pleasure of learning from. Her dedication to the class and the learning of her students is truly unparalleled. The main weakness of this course is certainly the problem sets. They consistently take me 6-8 hours a week IF I complete them in office hours with the help of peer tutors. Otherwise, they only take longer. These problem sets are also more algebra and (less so) calculus-heavy than it seems that they need to be.",
    "Don't know if psets always needed to be as long as they were - think we did reach the point of diminishing returns for some of them.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course is the amount of help provided at any given point. Office hours are incredibly helpful (as well as Study Hall) and you can tell how much Professor Steinacker cares about her students every single day. The corrections for exams are life-savers, especially with a class as hard as Physics and I wish other courses (in STEM especially) would do the same thing.",
    "The teacher and the structure of the class were very good.",
    "Strengths: Professor Steinacker provides typed up notes for every single lecture that she doesI use these to go over points that I didn't get in class. Her notes are extremely well written in class and online, greatly facilitating learning. The psets are always challenging and take a very long time to do, but she provides notes from time to time to guide us along with the more difficult questions and has many available office hours and study hall hours. The tests are also always fairthey either draw from pset questions or from her review sessions. She has never thrown us something that we cannot derive from her lessons. Weaknesses: The psets were definitely the most challenging and time-consuming part of the process for a lot of students. I do wish we had much simpler questions at the beginning of the psets to help drill in the concept before moving onto more complex problems so that we knew how to apply the formulas and what \"tricks\" we can use (ex. at the maximum height of projectile motion, an object will have 0 velocity in the y direction, and the time will be half that of landing time).",
    "The course is very good at helping students understand how the answers come about, however, I think there should be a general, consolidated review of these concepts during lecture rather than just basing off of examples.",
    "The lectures moved super fast and I constantly fell asleep during them, and others often would too. The class is also very reliant on office hours, and so for someone like me who doesn't work well in crowded environments\/needs to see things and not hear them to understand, it wasn't super conducive to learning. That said, the tests are really fair and Steinacker is a great professor and person.",
    "Weaknesses: only weakness really is a sometimes fast-paced lecturing style, but honestly necessary to get through all the material, and though sometimes fast the material is always available in depth through lecture notes that break down everything to digest on students' own time. this does mean many connections must be made by students outside of class BUT... Strengths: this is actually a strength because it pushed me to think for myself and want to grapple with challenging questions on psets on my own before later using office hours for help. PSETS - surface weakness but hidden strength - are very difficult, but always more so than the exams, so you are faced with the hardest types of questions in a way that prepares you for anything around exam time.",
    "Strengths: lots of help available for problem sets, lectures were clear and engaging, expectations were clear for exams Weaknesses: grading of problem sets took a while",
    "This class forces you to push yourself and the psets take a long time and you have to put a lot of effort into them. I think the material is interesting and engaging, but the class is hard.",
    "Strengths: taught well, given lots of chances to improve over the course of the semester Weaknesses: office hours felt disorganized at times, for some reason study halls felt more organized",
    "Physics is for many people, unless you are an engineering or an applied physics major, a difficult subject. Professor Steinacker assured that as long as you put in The work necessary to understand the material as it go to office hours, email her with questions, reach out to the peer tutors, then you will absolutely get a fair grade in this course. The homework problems are difficult to start but if you go to office hours both the professor and the peer tutors are ready and willing to help you not only do the problem but to actually understand what youre doing. This allowed you to know exactly where you were in terms of understanding course material in the class before any exams which was extremely helpful.",
    "A great strength are the resources to get help in the course and the professor. Very helpful.",
    "This course had lots of support and a very engaging community, with office hours and study hall nearly every day. The material can be challenging and the problem sets take a very long time, but the grading and support system make it more manageable.",
    "I believe the extensive psets were a strength of the course as its complexity allowed us to understand more than the surface level of the material.",
    "I think the strength of this course was the rigorousness of all the problems we did, coupled with the kind enthusiasm of our professor as she led us through to develop the skills to become comfortable in these problems. The challenge of the problems was perfectly balanced by her support, so while the class pushed me intellectually at times, I never felt detrimentally stressed. One small thing I think could be improved is the first problem setit confused many of us (for example, I didn't understand the \"i\" notation) and would probably be better if we were given clarifications and more guidance alongside it.",
    "Content is very packed and crammed. Went a bit too fast.",
    "A major strength is doing test corrections. It makes me review material I'm not comfortable with, and is extremely helpful.",
    "Strengths: the professor is very good in lecture and makes the concepts easy to understand Weaknesses: the problem sets can be tedious because of the amount of arithmetic involved. It can also be very difficult to resolve any grading issues because of the large size of the course",
    "Its very difficult and the problem sets take maybe 10 hours every week, but I learned so much and the resources are incredible. The peer tutors are amazing, and Professor Steinackers office hours are fantastic; she is the kindest professor Ive had and is so happy to help. The only weakness would be that its a very time consuming class, but I honestly didnt mind it too much because I was never frustrated or felt anything was unfair. You just have to put in a lot of time.",
    "The lectures contained lots of material, and it was hard to decipher what was a proof and what was a valuable concept that we would have to recreate.",
    "It would be helpful if lecture notes were posted before class.",
    "The Psets every week took sometimes 10 hours even while going to office hours and study hall.",
    "The course is taught very well. Its greatest strength is the professor. She has a genuine passion for teaching that is palpable during her course lectures and course planning. She has structured the course in a very organized manner, maximizing the depth with which each concept is covered. The main weakness lies in the problem sets. While they are very helpful to the students' learning and are interesting, they are very long. I spent a minimum of 7 hours each week on the problem sets.",
    "Strengths: Let's be real, we all know it: the main strength of this course is Professor Steinacker, a ray of light who makes this very difficult and stressful class bearable. She's an incredibly talented instructor, who truly loves physics and wants you to experience the joy of problem-solving as well. She doesn't want you to suffer. Office hours and study halls were incredibly helpful and supportive spaces. The class is a ton of work but you can't say that Professor Steinacker and the TAs\/peer tutors don't put in an equal or greater amount of work supporting us. Weaknesses: This course felt like 2 credits worth of work. Myself and everyone I knew in the class spent 10 hours a week physically present in office hours and study hall working on the psets. Office hours and study hall were really positive spaces, but I often felt it would've been impossible for me to do any of the problems on my own without significant help from my classmates, TAs, and peer tutors.",
    "The course goes through a lot of content but relies heavily on the help of TFs to explain concepts in the problem sets. A discussion section would be helpful for students.",
    "I have no weaknesses for the course. I loved all of it.",
    "Strengths: Steinacker Weaknesses: Long homeworks",
    "Main strength of the course was Professor Steinacker. Steinacker was a great, dedicated professorreally appreciated how she held office hours and was always willing to help us with difficult P-sets and concepts we didnt understand. Her kind, caring, and understanding attitude helped me feel more enthusiastic about this course, which was very challenging overall. The P-sets were more helpful than the lectures for me in understanding the material, because the lectures went pretty quickly and covered a lot. Biggest weaknesses were how time consuming the P-sets were and the difficultly of the exams. While the P-sets contributed to learning, some of the extremely time consuming questions seemed unnecessary.",
    "The class is extremely well structured and detailed, I'm not sure of there is much to improve in terms of the actual course. However, I did find that the study halls would often be missing peer tutors or TA's, or at least whenever I showed up there would be a lack of help available. I understand not wanting to assign too many tutors if not enough people show up for them to work, but if there as an interactive way to check in for the sessions so that the ideal amount of tutors could show up that would be cool.",
    "Lots of homework, but awesome professor--Professor Steinacker invests so much in students to make sure that they are learning",
    "The strength of the course is the depth of the course work. The problem sets are often very challenging and pushed me to new levels of understanding and made me more comfortable with rigorous problem solving. Another strength for the course was its historical contextualization of material. A weakness of the course could be that not much time was given to the last unit on waves. I think the course could be improved by either accommodating more time for it, or removing it from the curriculum.",
    "The professor is very good at teaching. The weekly problem sets are very hard; they could be made easier.",
    "Strengths: long office hours and help Weaknesses: material often was presented in a slightly convoluted way that did not tie explicitly to real life situations or was not clear in the connection",
    "The problem sets are very much strengths of this course as they helped me to more fully understand the material we went over in class. The variety of problems on these problems helped to demonstrate how the physics principles we learned in class applied to real world problems. The creativity of the problems also helps in increasing engagement. Having the office hours and study halls every day (Mon-Thurs) was very helpful for those, like me, who had to attend many, many sessions to understand the homework problems. One weakness of this course is the lack of practice problems outside of problem sets. I would have liked to have more problems to work through, particularly in preparation for the exams.",
    "The course offers ample opportunities for peer tutoring and study hall hours, with extra help provided for PSETs if needed. Topics in class are taught in depth, but individual classes may seem a little disjointed and sometimes difficult to follow. PSETs have difficult, multistep problems on them, which are helpful in applying the material later, but sometimes are not very helpful when first learning the material. This could be solved by perhaps having the first half of the PSET be simpler problems designed for better learning the material and the second of the PSET having more difficult problems."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, you learn so, so, so much and you really understand physics!",
    "Yes, if physics is something that interests you or you need the class for your major. The class isn't bad, homework just takes a while. Optimize your time by only working on the homework during office hours and study hall and it's very manageable.",
    "I'd recommend this course to the students who would like to learn physics. This course is for students who have or have not seen physics before. Anyone can take it.",
    "Yes, though I have no other physics courses to compare it to. The PSETS are not as bad as people make them seem, and after a few, you get better not only at understanding physics but also coming up with problem solving strategies. The idea of taking something you know and finding something you don't is very well taught and developed through this course.",
    "Yes. Well structured for student success and not a bad class to learn physics in. Professor Steinacker is an amazing and caring person as well.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want an introductory class in physics but only if you have nothing else to do with your time or are that genuinely interested in physics and\/or like learning. For everyone who has to take it, just do it.",
    "Yes! Steinacker is amazing at explaining concepts and the logic behind the steps of solving a physics problem.",
    "Yes! You learn so much about being physics and about the importance of internalizing material in order to be able to apply it. It's so much work, but the work really keeps you on track al year which I much prefer to it being easy and then being slammed for exams.",
    "If you have a strong physics background, you may be best served by another course; while the psets are still difficult and you'll learn problem-solving skills from them, you won't learn many concepts different from AP Physics (outside of some astrophysics at the end). If you aren't as confident with physics, Professor Steinacker does a wonderful job of setting you up to succeed and provides support every step of the way. Regardless of your background, the psets will take 6-10+ hours a week as you do and redo problems at office hours - they're the best and worst part of the course because you end up learning the concepts really well but with a lot of time and uncertainty about how long any given pset will take you. However! Professor Steinacker knows this and doesn't give psets during exam weeks - and the exams seem easier compared to the psets.",
    "Absolutely! The p-sets are definitely very time consuming and difficult, but it's really rewarding. There is a lot of support for the class, with peer tutor hours\/office hours almost every day. The class itself is very engaging, and Prof. Steinacker always explains things well and uses demonstrations to keep things exciting.",
    "Honestly, I would just take it for Professor Steinacker - she truly cares about her students. But you will need to invest a hefty amount of time each week doing the psets (which is doable, but takes time). If you are going to have a busy semester, I probably wouldn't take this course. If you have never taken physics before (like me!), this will probably require more time than PHYS170 but I think it probably gives you a better understanding of how things actually work (which is cool).",
    "Most people who are taking this course are taking it because they must.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the natural sciences.",
    "Only if you have to take it.",
    "Yes!! I already mentioned above: she makes physics seem so easy and interesting and fun.",
    "Yes! Great introduction to physics. Prof Steinacker cares a lot about students.",
    "It'll definitely teach you the concepts you want to learn but be prepared for how time consuming it is.",
    "If you were like me and are debating between 170 and 180, I think the choice is still unclear. In short, 180 seems to be better taught, has a better curve (supposedly), but has more work. Pick your poison, I suppose.",
    "It's classic physics so take it if you have to. But Steinacker is a gem of a human being and a really good professor which makes it a better.",
    "Yes. If you want or need to take an intro physics course this course is perfect. It is a significant challenge and takes up a lot of time but it is really satisfying and there are so many resources. There are so many office hours and Professor Steinacker is such a joy.",
    "I'd only recommend if you really have to take it. If you're pre-med choosing between 170 or 180 please choose 180. This class does seem to be harder but having Professor Steinacker makes it very worth it!",
    "Yes, best stem course Ive taken at Yale so far.",
    "Speaking from a pre-med stance, I would strongly recommend this course over Physics 170. I've heard some complaints in 170 that they were not taught the concepts necessary on the MCAT. I cannot speak for that course myself, but Professor Steinacker really drills in physics concepts, and I believe it is more important to know how to use the formulas and how to extract information from problems than it is to use the formulas in the context of biological sciences\/medicine. Starting general then going specific is much more easy to do than starting specific and going general. Once you learn the basics, you can apply them to any field.",
    "If you like physics then yes. If you have to take a physics class yes.",
    "YES yes yes please take 180 over 170 if you are life science-oriented, and from what I've heard 180 is better than 200 as well, but i can only speak for 180 so - first, Prof. Steinacker is a brilliant woman and so helpful, and you will learn loads just from sitting in lecture and absorbing the material. second, yes psets are difficult and will require a significant time commitment, but if you go to office hours and get help from peer tutors and prof. herself then you can ace all of them, and they prep you really well for exams. third, you won't have to worry too much grade-wise, psets are difficult but ultimately fine, concepts are age-old classical physics so extra help can be obtained from outside resources if needed (prof even provides book chapters to supplement and her own in-depth lecture notes), and if you engage with the material well and are willing to work til you understand it intuitively, you can ace exams!",
    "Yes, you will learn a lot, and if you put in the work, your marks will reflect that.",
    "I would recommend it because understanding physics is important for many science majors.",
    "Yes",
    "If you are a premed student deciding between physics 188 and physics 170, I would absolutely 100% as someone who had a premed roommate in 170, recommend physics 180 with Professor Steinacker. People say that in 180 the homework is harder however I would have to disagree. And this is coming from someone who almost failed physics in high school. The homework and 180 is challenging, but as long as you ask for help help will be given to you. Watching my roommate struggle with her physics 170 homework - which was much longer than 180s homework and also limited help was offered for that homework- was not fun. The only downside is that if you are extremely busy then you will have limited chances to go to office hours however many of the peer tutors are willing to meet with you one on one outside of office hours because they are just so awesome. So yes, I would have rather taken no physics however med school requires I take a physics. And I strongly recommend physics 180.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are passionate and easily understand physics (or if it's required). The class is a very large time commitment, especially if you do not have a strong physics background, but the professor and peer tutors\/TAs help a lot to make it more doable. If you study correctly and often, you will learn a lot in this class!",
    "Yes! I found it was a rewarding class to take as an introduction to physics and I also loved the professor.",
    "Yes, the professor is amazing.",
    "I would, it's a very rewarding course.",
    "Yes its a good course but I would not recommend the TA study halls",
    "Yes. I did not think I was going to like this class, but it was my favorite. Professor Steinacker is INCREDIBLE; she is so clear and makes everything make sense, and she is so available if you need help. If youre premed, take this over 170!!! Its so much better; if youre willing to just go to office hours and spend the time on the psets, its not so bad. The exams are also similar to the problem sets, so if you put the time in on those, the exams arent awful.",
    "It is a prerequisite for many majors, and that is the only reason I took it. I would say the same to my other students.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class I learned a lot in one semester",
    "Yes. You will definitely learn mechanics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I would preface my recommendation by saying the students who enroll in this course must be willing to put in a large amount of time in. This course helps students learn physics in a dynamic and interesting way. It is well taught and many resources such as extensive office hours, study halls, and one on one tutoring are offered.",
    "I'd highly recommend this over 170. Both are hard, but Professor Steinacker is a brilliant instructor who really makes this class worth it. It's not...easy, so I wouldn't recommend taking it just for the fun of it?",
    "Yes this is the best way to learn physics.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Steinacker is just an important resource, and is so good at what she does, people would be sorry to miss her class.",
    "Yes! The class is challenging, mainly because the psets take a lot of work, but you learn a lot and I found it to be ultimately rewarding. Definitely would recommend over 170, which is an equal amount of work but generally a much less cohesive and fun class (at least based on what my friends in it have said).",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in and devoted to learning Physics\/need it for a major requirement. It was the most challenging course of the semester for me and the P-sets take an extremely long time.",
    "If you must take the course, then I think this physics level has the most support in terms of office hours and tutors. However, please be prepared for a very heavy workload.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students with a physics background. I would be more cautious in recommending this course to a student with no physics background, but I think that it is still manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the professor is very good at teaching the material.",
    "Yes, because I believe I learned a lot in a short amount of time and the professor was very engaging",
    "Yes! It's a nice introductory physics course but you definitely get out what you put into it. Plus, Professor Steinacker is an absolute gem :)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, particularly those who are pursuing careers in engineering. My understanding of physics has grown enormously and I have really enjoyed learning in this class, despite the frustrations I have felt on multiple fronts when I did not initially understand the problems.",
    "I thought the class was great. Lectures could feel long at times but for the most part I enjoyed and learned a lot from them. There's a lot of ways to get help and working with others on the PSets does wonders (those PSets are hard and take a while fi you're lost so any help goes a long way). It was a lot of fun and was required so not bad.",
    "Yes, the course was good for covering most of the basic physics essentials required for higher level classes and forces a deep understanding of the material."
