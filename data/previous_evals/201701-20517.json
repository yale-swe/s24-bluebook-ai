   "comments": [
    "Cooperative game theory -- one\/two-sided matching games, Shapley value, minimax, Nash equilibrium.",
    "I learned many cooperative game theory concepts, including the core and the Shapley value.",
    "Cooperative Game Theory taught me to view the world in strategic and mathematical terms. Concepts such as the Core or Shapley Value were more than illuminating. For they allow analyses that can yield striking and counterintuitive results. Professor Dubey's very skillful transition from math to purely verbal logic made me aware of the huge intersection between the two. Now, even without extensive mathematical notation, I feel capable of proving core concepts.",
    "This class taught me how to approach problems differently Professor Dubey showed me how to breakdown problems I never thought applicable to game theory."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely need a textbook to go along with.",
    "Great course. Pradeep Dubey is clearly brilliant but also an extremely understanding professor. Course was digestible to students who didn't have a background in proofs and math theory. I would say that this course could benefit from a TA, just because while Professor Dubey made himself as available as possible, he was not on campus during the week.",
    "I thought the course was excellent. The course could possibly be improved by more explanation of the mathematical techniques and more concrete examples. I found that the mathematical concepts became obvious to me through the application thereof to concrete examples.",
    "Strength #1: Professor Dubey. An incredibly charismatic lecturer, approachable adviser and brilliant mathematician that managed to make even the most difficult concepts easy to understand. Strength #2: The breadth of the coursework. It covered most vital concepts of the field of game theory without getting superficial. Excellent. ... Strength #n: The plenty of opportunities to apply the material. A final paper, for example allowed the analysis of real world problems. Weekness #i: nonexistent.",
    "i think this course should be 2 days a week rather than a seminar. it is a concept-based class with some examples but because of the weekly rotation I don't feel like we covered enough topics by the end. The material is really interesting, the way Dubey presents it and in the larger social context as well, but by the time we got to the more applied, difficult, more known topics of cooperative game theory the semester was over and it was taught too rushed. I consider this a class that was nice to take, but that I didn't learn transferable things in",
    "This class is fantastic."

    "Incredible accomplished professor teaching a very low key class. He is very relax about grading and cares about teaching the seniors in the class. Easy to communicate. Overall a great class to finish off senior year.",
    "Yes, it a low pressure class and you can learn as much as you want from it. It would have been nice to have a TA though at some points.",
    "Yes! I was concerned about taking this course because I don't have a strong proofing\/math theory background. But I learned so much and was able to do well just by putting the work in! The class is interesting and digestible, and I feel I have left it with knowledge of the fundamentals of Cooperative Game theory. Professor Dubey is a gem!",
    "A hidden gem! Absolutely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "If you have, at all, considered the possibility of accustoming yourself with game theory, go for this class. It is an absolutely amazing introduction to cooperative game theory, with an brilliant and approachable professor, fascinating material and fair grading.",
    "Professor Dubey is a fantastic professor, and more economics professors should teach like him. He aims to teach you game theory such that you understand the value of each proof and lesson. He recognizes that proofs can be difficult to follow and works to translate every line of math into plain English. Anyone who wants to learn more about game theory should take this class."
