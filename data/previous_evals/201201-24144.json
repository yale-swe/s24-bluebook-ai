    "Absolutely take it. There are not enough classes at this school that talk about the ethics of artistic and protest practices in the real world, that let us see what is being done in the art world outside the walls of the museum and the institutions.",

    "Take it! The readings were exceptional.",
    "Incredible class! Unfortunately, unlikely to be offered again at Yale. But if it is, TAKE IT.",
    "Yale doesn't offer a glimpse of this type of art - take this seminar while you can, and learn about art in a completely different, and much more powerful, context.",
    "I'd recommend it. It's a good class, and it's not too harsh grading wise."
