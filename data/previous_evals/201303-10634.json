   "comments": [
    "This class provides a coherent picture of the rich French literary tradition. The books are great. Anyone interested in literature who would like to take a lecture with a lot of reading but not much writing should take this class.",
    "Good course! Great books, great professors, varying level of discussion based on section (mine was great but it just depends who ends up in there with you). Not too much work other than reading the books - a book every week\/week and a half, one 5-7 page paper, in-class midterm and take-home final.",
    "A very enjoyable lit lecture! Professors Samuels and Kaplan have very different lecturing styles, and do disagree on a fair amount, which makes classes much more interesting. (They reserve the last 10 minutes for a mini-debate type thing.)",
    "You get to read great books and think about them and there's not really any work.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, but with some caveats. I would recommend this class because the professors are wonderful and the books are very interesting. I learned a lot about literature. That said, I was a non-humanities major taking this class. This ended up being more difficult than I thought it would be. I got the impression that grading would be lenient. It wasn't that lenient. But that's fine! I'm glad I took a literature class that challenged me. Just, if you don't have this background, it will challenge you. On the whole, though, I think the class was still one of the most welcoming literature classes to people without lit backgrounds.",
    "There's a lot of important French literature compressed into a short amount of time. Sometimes, two or three lectures are not enough for the novels, some of which intellectuals treat like scripture. There was a little too much pretense in the lecturing style for my taste, and you could probably get just as much out of these books by reading them on your own and doing some research on them.",
    "This was the first lit class where I read the entire syllabus (real talk time), and it was a great experience. The lectures are really engaging and thoughtful, and I love the tag team approach by Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuel -- it lets you see how academics work with and off each other in developing ideas, which is awesome. Even though I didn't love every book on the syllabus, it was really good to read them all and feel like you have had some taste of the French literary greats, and to be able to speak coherently on how the canon works together as a whole.",
    "Great survey of French literature from the 19th and 20th century. The reading load is definitely manageable and the material is very interesting. Professors Kaplan and Samuels are wonderful lectors. Keep in mind those this is a lecture and survey class, so if you're hoping to go really in depth, this might not be the class for you.",
    "The workload is very heavy IF YOU ARE DOING IT IN FRENCH because, of course, reading in a foreign language is more challenging than reading in your mother tongue... this of course depends on your fluency, but, regardless, when preparing for the midterm especially, I felt largely at a disadvantage.... Just something to consider! Lectures were fine, gave a lot of historical background and less criticism, which I like, but depends on your taste. Reading list was GREAT, and I would say take the class if only for the reading list.",
    "Excellent! One of my favorite courses at Yale so far. Both professors are engaging, super smart, and incredibly knowledgable lecturers. The book list is fantastic -- Stendhal, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, Proust, Celine, Sartre, Camus, and Sarraute. I would highly recommend this class to anyone -- not just literature or French majors.",
    "A fantastic course, absolutely take it. Fascinating professors who give wonderfully dynamic lectures--I can't say enough about them. Great reading (maybe some texts were better than others, but you never stay on one text for too long), and fascinating orientation of the content in a historical context. Not a heavy workload at all--one in-class essay, a paper, and a take-home final. If you want to read some great books, enjoy 2 great 50-minute lectures each week, watch a few movie clips, and just generally have a class you can always look forward to, this is an obvious choice.",
    "In short, there is no better course here at Yale that surveys the development of the Modern French Novel. The lecture style shifts a little abruptly when Professor Samuels passes the baton to Professor Kaplan and the readings cross over the fin de si\u00c3\u00a8cle, so watch out. One mid-term, one short paper, one take-home final. Entirely manageable.",
    "I would recommend it but READ THE BOOKS IN ENGLISH, EVEN IF YOU ARE IN THE FRENCH SECTION. I was the only one in my class who was reading them in French, and I struggled because we moved so fast through the novels. You only spend approximately one week on each novel, which gets really difficult. It's helpful to get the French books in order to follow along during section, but overall you will have a much easier time if you are able to read the books thoroughly. So unless you are absolutely fluent in writing and reading French, especially formal french, READ IT IN ENGLISH. Ultimately it's a really interesting class and the professors are super smart and accomplished and a privilege to learn from. Some of the lectures can get a bit dull, but it is a good class especially if you're into French literature and can read these books fast.",
    "Just sign up and take the class. Professors Samuels and Kaplan deliver consistently original and thought-provoking insight. A particular strength of this course is the lecture format: 40 minutes of lecture and 10 minutes of guided Q&A between Professors. It's great lit, and Professors Samuels and Kaplan don't shy from addressing the nuances of reading texts in translation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The books we covered were undoubtedly some of the best pieces every written in literary history, and the authors were all masters of their time\/all time. If you are interested in learning more about French literature, one of the most famous and refined literatures in the world that inspired countless writers of other countries, this course is the one to attend. The two professors were spectacular: both masters in their realms who are also extremely nice and approachable. The only thing to keep in mind that this course is taught in lectures + sections, unlike most other French literature courses. I have got used to seminars so it felt a bit strange to me at times. The lectures covered a lot of stuff, were short and went fast. Otherwise, it would still be an enjoyable course even just for the books we read and the professors we had."
