   "comments": [
    "Definitely. This course is geared toward molding you into a more effective writer. If you are struggling to write good essays but are committed to changing your routines like writing essays weeks in advance this class will be very helpful for you. However, if you already know what makes for an effective argument or are a fairly good writer, this class will be very boring and annoying for you.",
    "English 114 is a nice introductory writing course to get used to writing at the collegiate level. One of the things I appreciated most in this class was that the criteria for each essay was clearly laid out so that you know exactly why you got the grade you did. The selection of readings were interesting and not too long. For two of the four papers you get to pick the topic, making it a lot more interesting to write. All in all, I would definitely recommend it for anyone except English majors who may want to look at ENGL 120.",
    "This is a very good course, and Professor Silverman is a very nice professor. I definitely recommend this class. There are four papers in total, but for two of them, you really get to write about what interests you, so the topics are very open-ended.",
    "It's a great class to take if you want to improve your academic writing. It definitely covers this objective. The workload can be pretty bad at the beginning but it gets better with time. Grading is not that harsh but it's very difficult to score perfect on essays.",
    "Only take it if your major goal is to improve your writing. Do not take it as fairly advanced writer.",
    "Great readings, great professor, great class... take it.",
    "It's a well-rounded class in which hard work pays off. Not too much reading and a lot of writing--but with guidance. You learn about the many resources that Yale has to offer and Professor Silverman is approachable and supportive, so as long as you putthe effort you'll see your writing improve!",
    "I would definitely recommend English 114 to another student. It has been a very good introduction to writing at Yale for me. I am more confident in my writing after this course.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are committed to improving your writing but beware that it is one of the most boring classes to sit through twice a week",
    "Great course! It teaches you how to write an academic essay. This is crucial for a successful career at Yale. The \"Writing Power\" section explores the power relationship in various contexts, e.g. race and power, economy and power."
