    "It's genetics, so if you don't like the material it will be boring. However, it's a minimal time commitment and the quizzes aren't hard, so it's manageable. There's no point taking this if you're not an MCDB major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student - especially an MCDB major deciding between this course and MCDB 200 (mol bio). It is interesting and a lot of the topics covered are extremely socially relative. The bi-weekly quizzes were not too much to handle and the papers for section were generally interesting.",
    "Take this class if you want an easy Genetics class.",
    "Genetics was a very interesting course that taught at a comprehensive pace appropriate for anyone in a science major or having a strong science background. It is not an easy, gut intro class, but the material is well-taught and the class format (3 lectures and then a biweekly quiz\/paper discussion) was more enjoyable than a large midterm or two exam format.",
    "The class is fine. Don't take it if you don't have to unless you have some incredible desire to learn about genetics. There's bio classes to take.",
    "Take it! Good class, interesting, fun, and just the right level of manageable challenge. I've loved the experience, and feel like I learned a lot of very valuable information-especially practically applicable to my lab (I work in a yeast lab).",
    "I would recommend Genetics to a student that was interested in Biology and Science. The course is difficult and a lot of work, but if you are interested in the subject material, then it will be a lot easier.",
    "Tis course was just remodeled and now there are quizzes every other week and a section on the days of the quizzes. If you have heard bad things about this course, ignore it. Yes, it is difficult and the reading is sometimes tedious, but I have learned a lot and having quizzes every other week really takes the stress out of the course. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with a strong background in biology. Its very interesting but hard to follow if you're rusty with your biology info.",
    "DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE MOL BIO INSTEAD.",
    "People will tell you it is horrible, and you should listen to them. I decided to take this class because I wanted to \"learn new things\" since I'd already learned what was in Mol Bio, but I sincerely wish I hadn't. Just preparing for the final, and taking it, I realized there was absolutely no point to studying the lectures (Dellaporta's). I would have been better off skimming the relevant portions of the book and doing practice problems, since his part of the final was definitely not based on his lectures. If you have to take this class for the major (I heard Mol Bio is slightly better, please consider that!) be prepared to hate lecture, be frustrated at the professors and the organization which seems to have no point to it, and struggle through the semester. At least the quizzes were multiple choice.",
    "It was a good introduction to genetics. Dellaporta was great but I think the guest lectures largely lacked continuity\/structure.",
    "Its a pretty good course; I feel like the material will set up a basis for many future courses in MCDB and MB&B, if you are pursuing either of those majors (I have already taken some higher level courses in these majors, and I know it would have been helpful to have this course under my belt first).",
    "It's a good course if you are really interested in this particular field of Biology. You learn a lot about different fields of genetics and a variety of ways to get at genetic information and document it and process it, so it is pretty cool.",
    "Good introclass to genetics, get a thorough overview of subject material. Lectures depended on the instructor - Dellaporta was great but the other two were so-so. Didn't really have to read the textbook although it helped with the tougher areas. The course was restructured this year, with biweekly quizzes and biweekly sections where we discussed journal articles. The quizzes were for the most part fine; the journal articles ranged in difficulty and usefulness. It was nice having section during class, and they gave us a chance to talk with TAs on a smaller scale. However, since we only really spoke about the journal articles, there was limited application there. The final was probably a fair judgment of our abilities, but it was HARD.",
    "I thought the class was a good introduction to genetics. There are bi-weekly quizzes and paper discussions (no midterms). The quizzes which are not too bad if you go over the readings and follow along in lecture. The final was pretty rough though, so make sure you know your stuff going into it.",
    "It's fine. Take it if you have too. Not the best MCDB class but not terrible. The beginning with dellaporta is good, get's worse from there but not terrible. Learn a lot. The paper discussion helped me learn a lot of modern genetic techniques.",
    "Take it over MCDB200 for bio major requirement. It's an easy class with a pretty nice curve so I would recommend it to non-majors who don't want to take a gutty science class.",
    "YAY GENETICS TAKE IT",
    "Not recommended unless you are an MCDB major and have no choice.",
    "Lots of math -- the perfect course for a math\/physics person who wants to learn some biology and be quantitative at the same time.Loved the mathy aspect -- it was more problem solving and logical thinking than rote memorization.Additionally genetics is fundamental to understanding human health and the life sciences.",
    "Genetics is an interesting subject, but the course leaves a significant amount to be desired. Dellaporta's lectures are pretty good and interesting, but those of Acar and Garc\u00c3\u00ada-Castro were pretty bad. Hopefully the section that is worth 25% of your grade is removed from the course (section a-holes can really make a section worth this much a stress), but if not, you will still be ok. Being successful in this course definitely takes some work, but it is very straightforward. The final, however, was another story. Studying for some hours before the quiz becomes standard, but be careful if you take the lab on a Tuesday because you will have a lab report due and a quiz on the same day.",
    "Genetics is an interesting topic, but this class is very hard. There are three professors who teach it, which makes it feel disjointed. Many lectures also feel a bit disorganized and difficult to follow. There is also a quiz every other week, which makes the workload seem intense but also helps you study for the final.",
    "Genetics is necessary to establish a firm foundation in biology. The course is pretty chill with 3 lectures and then a biweekly quiz\/paper discussion in section during lecture time. The professors are great and friendly, and the textbook is super helpful.",
    "I would recommend this if you are interested in more individual and population scale biology. It deals with molecular biology briefly, but is more focused on and better taught in the larger scale issues. The biweekly quiz\/paper reading format is especially interesting because you are exposed to scientific papers in the field that show where the field is currently.",
    "It is a good class with interesting material. It was in the processof being restructured when I took it, so it was really organized. I love genetics, so I enjoyed it.",
    "Personally I think Genetics was really interesting. It's definitely not an easy class, but I don't regret my decision to take it instead of the intro bio courses. Definitely come prepared to memorize a lot of information and keep up with the reading though!",
    "Pretty easy class now that they've changed the format. The only tough part for me was speaking during section-- sometimes it could be frustrating that a science class had a speaking and participation portion ofthe grade, but it was a good skill to practice. Make sure not to write off the final, its a completely different format than the quizzes and requires much more effort",
    "Different teachers made the class a bit disjointed. That being said, all the professors were excellent. Material is not difficult, and the quizzes are more straight-forward than the short answer format in cell bio. Studying will take about 1-2 hours every week, but aside from that the work is minimal. Final was more comprehensive than expected, so study more than you think you need to (as in go over all the slides).",
    "Sure, if you're interested in Genetics enough to see past the various flaws of the course. The quantitative material was confusing. Having 3 not great professors was confusing. I liked biweekly special Tuesdays. The final was much more confusing and harder than expected, compared with the quizzes. I wasn't fond for reading papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who finds genetics interesting. Genetics is a subject of my typical read-for-pleasure library, so I may be a little biased, but I found the course material equally engaging as many of the books I had previously read. Be prepared for a lot of material, but if you put in the work, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "I don't know what the bad hype about genetics is. It's a medium-hard class. Just keep up with the material like you should and you will be FINE.",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend it. The three professor have wildly different teaching styles and it makes studying for the super tuesday quizzes extremely difficult. Dellaporta also gives the nastiest quizzes. The average for his quizzes landed roughly around 6\/10 (however, there were a total of 11 questions, so he gave you a \"freebie.\" But really, think of it as the average being able to only get half of the questions right).",
    "Great intro genetics course. Basically no work at all, but the biweekly quizzes are great for making you keep up with the material nonetheless. I'm really glad I took this class. Didn't think I'd like genetics, but it was extremely interesting and pretty fun.",
    "Meh. The material is interesting, and if you get lucky with a TA, it's better than it could be. However, the course needs to figure out some structural issues before it can really be a great class.",
    "Yes, take the class however the section can be quite difficult as we were hardly aware of the technicalities involved in discussing the paper. But, a great class overall. You will come out of it knowing loads of stuff. Study hard for the quizzes, they can be very probing.",
    "No, I would most definitely not recommend this course to a fellow student. This course was irritating, frustrating, and just not very good at all. The final was terrible, the lectures were not interesting (even though the material is pretty interesting), and everything was so disorganized. Definitely take Molecular Bio if given the choice between the two.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a really interesting topic. That being said, make sure you go to every lecture, even of the lecturers you don't really like. The final is really hard.",
    "This is NOT an introductory course! Instead, MCDB 202 builds on the framework of the basics of genetics to address broader issues such as disease and populations, development, etc. I liked the course, and its format of biweekly sections with quizzes was a refreshing change from the typical 2- or 3-midterm science course. Sections were a nice outlet to gain exposure to the scientific literature and learn how to critically analyze and discuss such papers. I felt that the final was very challenging, so prepare by doing practice problems, even though they aren't graded. I certainly wish I had. Genetics is a field of biology that has expanded massively, and, because its role in medicine and other fields can't be ignored, I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand more than just the very basics.",
    "Personally, I didn't think it was worth taking. I didn't really learn much at all - most of the topics had been covered in other biology classes. I thought I would get more out of this class.",
    "This course will teach you more genetics that you will ever need to know for practical purposes but it is still a good course to take! Sometimes confusing, sometimes boring but it is not difficult if you go to class\/read the book for what you didn't understand. Biweekly quizzes and section (this takes the place of one of the lectures), and a final exam.",
    "Genetics is a good class to transition from intro to higher level bio courses. In the first half, you learn the basics of how genes are transmitted, how geneticists describe their interactions, how they are located on the chromosome, and how they are studied in populations. The second half of the course goes into molecular mechanisms of gene expression and regulation in metabolism and development. What MCDB 202 doesn't do is go very far into the most cutting-edge genetic research - it covers the necessary basics, and a lot of what you talk about it from the early\/mid 20th century. People looking for this kind of thing might be disappointed. In terms of the mechanics of the class, the biweekly quiz format is low-stress and section gave you a chance to try more challenging\/modern papers, which was fun. There isn't a ton of assigned work and the problem sets are optional (though very helpful).",
    "Yes, don't take the lab though.",
    "Fortnightly quizzes. Mostly interesting lectures, but nothing mind-blowing. Second half is better. Must do well in quizzes since worth half the grade. Fortnightly paper discussions, on same day as quiz, are as useful as you make them. Be prepared to learn on your own. No problem sets.",
    "Dellaporta is amazing but gives hard quizzes; go to his office hours. The other two guys are awful but their material is easier. The final is surprisingly hard. Not a bad bio class, I really enjoyed it, esp the stuff Dellaporta taught.",
    "Prepare well for the quizzes and read everything",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in genetics. The biweekly quizzes are manageable and prepare you very well for the final. Discussion sections involved a conversation about a scientific paper relevant to that modules genetics topics. These provided a nice change from regular lectures and also was an enriching experience and good way to analyze these papers.",
    "MCDB 202 is an important course that should be highly encouraged to anyone interested in pursuing the biological sciences.",
    "Take it if you like bio. Every biologist needs an understanding of genetics.",
    "There are only a few professors in student's life, who offer the opportunity to learn from an incredibly bright and talented professor, who makes studying a subject exciting and engaging. Dellaporta was not one of them.Dellaporta was by far the worst professor of the bunch. And he borders on being the worst biology professor I have had at Yale. Not only were his lectures useless (because they mostly consisted of random factoids that were thrown in), but he failedto articulate what topics were going to be emphasized on the final.Genetics was the first class I have had to actually read the book to understand. After multiple years of Yale, this speaks volumes about the terrible quality of his teaching. As a case in point, his explanation of linkage mapping was completely stupid. Beyond belief dumb. A quick read in the book clearly explained the technique, and this discrepancy really caused me to question how he got tenure at Yale. (Because from his description, I question if he can do it himself.)He didn't just come off as incompetent, he seemed legitimately stupid. I know that some professors have difficultly articulating themselves and are in fact brilliant, but Dellaporta isn't one of them. And when I checked his CV, I saw he went to the University of Rhode Island---not particularly surprising.It was really funny that he made the comment that he likes working at Yale because everyone is as smart or smarter than he is. Ha. Don't flatter yourself, there's no way you are as smart as anyone who goes to Yale.Sidenote: Murat was awesome :)",
    "Ok class, only for MCDB majors.",
    "MCDB 202 is a fairly easy class that gets at important concepts and techniques in genetics. It is well taught and well organized, and involves reading some actual scientific papers with helps build that skill and is very interesting. I would recommend it if you are interested in the subject matter, particularly population genetics, which makes up a significant portion of the course, whereas molecular bases of genetic regulation is a smaller part.",
    "do NOT take this class unless you have to. Poorly taught (except for garcia-castro). Professor Acar was a good professor but almostliterally read out of the book for his portions of the class. The quizzes aren't too too challenging, but it's never clear what will be on them, and the final is awful for everyone because we haven't had anything but multiple choice all semester, and then suddenly are expected to do a short-answer problem solving final worth a significant part of our grade. Terribly organized. The section expectations were never really explained, and that ended up being 25% of our final grade. So if your TA doesn't like you, that's tough, it's the same as doing bad on the final except that you can't contest your grade or really explain where you went wrong. I don't feel like I was even that much better versed in genetics after the class. And I feel like I actually did really well, so this isn't a sour grapes review, I just want my semester back",
    "If you're an MCDB major you have to take it. I really hope they improve the way they do assessments and refine the material they decide to teach. Dellaporta's quizzes are very tricky. The homework doesn't seem relevant. The final doesn't seem comprehensive (it's supposedly designed to be a 90 minute test). I wish the class were more conceptual, but in reality, it boils down to how do a few basic statistics and understanding a few key operons and understanding the basics of developmental genetics. The average was a 69\/100 on the final. I don't know what that says about how much the students got out of the class. It's not like this class is statistical thermodynamics or something ridiculously hard, so if people score so low, it really speaks to either poor grading, poor comprehension, or a poor form of assessment. I hope this class can make necessary improvements. It has a lot of potential to inspire students to get interested in genetics, a field that is being increasingly relevant for research purposes.",
    "Basics of genetics with quizzes\/section every other week.",
    "I would strongly recommend genetics to another student. I felt that I learned a lot through the semester. The teachers were very approachable and the new class structure was a huge step up from the average basic science lecture course. It is disappointing that more classes are not taught this way.Definitely take the course.",
    "The class is great if you are interested in genetics or looking for an mcdb class. The professors are really great!",
    "Do not take this class unless absolutely necessary. If you need a biology class for your major pick any of the other ones besides this one. I feel like I learned almost nothing in this class, and it was the hardest class I have taken thus far at Yale. Do not take it. Going to class is absolutely pointless and there are so many other better biology classes Yale offers.",
    "I enjoyed genetics. I thought the material was interesting and the teaching was fine. Not a lot of work at all for a science course.",
    "Yeah, I would recommend it. The lectures are interesting, and I think that this is stuff thatevery biologist\/doctor should know. There are quizzes\/paper discussions every other week. Dellaporta's quizzes (all multiple-choice) are the hardest, and they are problem-based, so do the optional problem sets. One good thing is that you get to drop at least on question on every quiz, which was a lifesaver. This year, the class average ended up being around an 83, and he said that you needed to be within one standard deviation of the mean (73) to be guaranteed a B-. So overall grading doesn't seem too bad, although he never told us the cutoffs for B, B+, A-, etc. Dellaporta, who's in charge of the course, is a very nice person and is extremely receptive to student feedback. Take it -- it'll be a challenging course, for sure, but I don't think you'll regret it.",
    "Very interesting material, but be sure to over-prepare for quizzes and exams. It gets really difficult, quickly.",
    "If you are interested in biology or genetics, I would recommend this course. You must go in prepared to give this time more coursethough. You will only truly enjoy this class if you put the time in to learn and study the material. You can't slack off in this class.",
    "It's a good class, but keep up with the reading and do the problem sets. The quizzes are sometimes deceptively easy compared to the final. Not too bad tho",
    "Studying for these quizzes stressed me out like any other midterm, except these happened every other week. Either take this course if you've taken AP Bio or Molecular Biology recently -- otherwise, you might struggle.",
    "Don't take it. It's not interesting and drags on. The workload and material gets significantly more difficult halfway through, so don't be fooled. It's an interesting class ultimately, but looking back, I probably would only take this class if necessary.",
    "Genetics is a very fascinating, well taught class. Study for every quiz AND KEEP YOUR NOTES for the final! Also, all of the professors are very accessible, so if you have questions, talk to them.",
    "Don't take it unless you really love the subject.",
    "Dont take"
