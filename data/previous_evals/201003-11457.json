    "I could learn from the course that there were many other books that the scrolls writers regarded as authorities and cited in their compositions.Among some scrolls, they show the differences of the biblical interpretation. In the class, we could find that many cases in which the scrolls authors quote or alldue to Scripture demonstrate that they placed some books on the higher level.This is really such a great course.",
    "Numerous ways, more than I am able to write. Most importantly, however, it has helped broaden my own understanding of one type of Second Temple Judaism and allowed me to further connect its ideas with others found during the same era."
