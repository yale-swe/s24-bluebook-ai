    "This was a good course that had some great discussions over the course of the year. We learned about the history of the olympics and what the goals are of the event.",
    "Great overall. First 5 weeks are not what you'd expect for a class on the Olympics.",
    "I learned about different issues with the Olympics and athletics in general and engaged in meaningful conversations about how we view other people and athletes",
    "Very interesting and different view of how the Olympics plays into history",
    "We focused a ton of ancient history of athletes, sports, and olympics games, while also seeing the trends from then to now. Seeing what beliefs and practices we took from the ancient Greek in Sport.",
    "How to debate and take on modern day issues with both reference to modern and ancient texts as well as through poignant conversation.",
    "The Olympics politics and history of everything"

    "Very good course.",
    "I think more time could be spent on the modern material and less on the ancient",
    "The strengths of this course were the seminar set up that allowed everyone to engage and argue and understand different points of view. The readings were super interesting and thought provoking. I really liked the presentations. No weaknesses",
    "George is great and class is very interesting and engaging!",
    "No weaknesses, i kind of wish we met more often than just once. Strengths: THE FREEDOM. students taught and we listened and took notes. Engagement was huge and discussion was amazing. some convos got heated and i loved it.",
    "So fascinating. Syrimus is so passionate and it makes everyone get involved. No weaknesses.",
    "I thought this was a great class. I loved the readings, and truly enjoyed all of the class discussions. I loved that classes were organized with student presentations as it allowed for great conversation and debate.",
    "The strengths is that the guys talked to much for there only being 3 of them"

   "comments": [
    "Yes if you want stimulating discussions and a more chill course, this is good for you.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in sports or the Olympics it was interesting to learn the history and origins",
    "Yes I would. It totally changed my perspective towards the Olympics and invited me to challenge different views instead of just accepting them",
    "Absolutely it was a very discussion based class but they were very interesting and I wanted to engage in conversation",
    "YES YES YES YES. Not to sound bias but you will love this if you are a classics major, love Greek history or if you are an athlete. It is super interesting.",
    "Absolutely. Take this class immediately.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While it was interesting being in the class as an athlete with many other athletes, I believe that anyone would enjoy this class. It was fascinating to study topics including race, gender, and the natural body all through the lens of the Olympic Games. Having many different perspectives from many different students allowed for great conversation in every seminar meeting. Although this class meets early on Thursday mornings, I really do not think the early start time should discourage anyone from participating.",
    "Yes because it was very cool to see all the components of the Olympics together"
