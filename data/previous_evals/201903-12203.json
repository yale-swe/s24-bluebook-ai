    "I gained many insights into the process of working with a large group on a project, how to engage with a client in a consulting setting, and furthered my understanding of the global conflict between China and the United States in today's environment.",
    "This class was amazing. The way that Weigold taught it made it into basically a class on the military, with a slight focus on consulting. I loved this class and the experiences it provided.",
    "Really got to understand the importance of rigorous diplomacy all around the world- China is outperforming the US big time in Micronesia and most people do not know anything about the place. The insight from traveling to a place like Chuuk will stick with me my whole life",
    "Gain understanding of political-military synergies, particularly as they pertain to US-China relations in the Pacific and the role of island nations in between.",
    "I learned a lot about research, as well as designing a project with deliverables."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the Capstone was the ability to work directly with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and speak to key stakeholders related to our project, such as U.S. Ambassadors in different regions of the world. Moreover, the trip to Pearl Harbor was such a unique experience that I am very grateful for. On the flip side, I was not happy with the nature of the group project. There were 11 members on the team and many people were unresponsive to work together. I believe that we could have developed an even better final product with fewer group members.",
    "This was fantastic- Admiral Weigolds capstone was already the most sought after but I think this will be even more the case when he comes back next year. Not only will he bring you to Hawaii, he works on projects of huge geo strategic importance and in addition to the practical work we achieved I believe that this was one of the greatest learning experiences Ive ever had. Just saying, I got to travel to Chuuk, an island Ive never heard of, where it turns out people use pachinkos (like bows and arrows) to kill each other for fun, and they almost never see foreigners. How are we supposed to prevent Chinese influence in a part of the world we know nothing about? Trust Admiral Weigold to organize another fascinating project",
    "I think having a bit more direction from the client from the start would help guide the research and unify the capstone group. Producing something a bit more tangible also would have been really cool, but I understand this is difficult to put into the context of something as big and complex as USINDOPACOM.",
    "The biggest difficulty was working through a group project with such a large team. It was hard to organize meetings and ensure that we were all on the same page."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the Capstone project provides students with a unique element to their education by working with a client outside of the Yale environment.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course to other students. It was perhaps one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It is unlike anything else",
    "So good, felt like we were touching on some of the most major issues of geostrategic importance, and playing our small role in the existential power struggle between China and the US as it plays out in Chuuk. Also take this class if you like Hawaiian beer",
    "Depends on the spread of Capstone options. I think Jackson needs to do a better job at getting diverse clients.",
    "I would definitely recommend this capstone. ADM Weigold is extremely helpful throughout the process and helps keep client demands realistic."
