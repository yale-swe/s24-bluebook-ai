    "Theorizing Sexual Violence is the best WGSS and theory class you will ever take. And you should take it.",
    "This is an awesome class. It moves past simplistic views of violence and really gets you to engage with a lot of foundational thinkers. Melanie is a wonderful discussion-leader so class was never dull. The intervention project and self-defense workshop were great ways to get us to engage with the topics outside of a classroom setting. Having a diversity of opinions (i.e. not all WGSS majors) makes seminar conversation a lot more interesting, so people who aren't the usual shoppers of this course (i.e. straight men) should actually check it out.",
    "Definitely take this but be wary of the readings getting worse as the course goes on",
    "YES. Challenging, enlightening, inspiring. Well worth your time. A true \"Yale experience.\"",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Whoever you are, take this class. If you're a WGSS major whose first complete sentence was \"Screw the patriarchy\", take this class. If you shrink at the term 'feminist', take this class. If you can't imagine yourself ever taking this class, take this class. Seriously. The subject matter is often touchy and difficult, but the course is terrific. And Melanie, in addition to being a fascinating person, is a totally brilliant and kind instructor.",
    "Fascinating subject and reading material. Workload (including reading) is very manageable for a seminar. I did almost every single reading in its entirety. Melanie is a good leader, though sometimes I felt conspicuously out of the WGSS-club loop.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. It changed the way I think about myself, my body, tv shows, movies, advertisements, university announcements...the list goes on forever. I'm not exaggerating when I say this class changed my life. The workload isn't overwhelming. The readings are fascinating and provocative. If I had my way, everyone would be required to take this class. TAKE IT!!!",
    "Yeah, I would certainly recommend this class. It really gets you thinking and theorizing into your own life, past just the academic realm and into real life. I really do think it's a great class.",
    "Whether or not you're a WGSS major, take this class if you are interested in a) how the media represents rape and victimhood, b) how sexual violence shapes women's lives and feminist activism on college campuses, and c) how sexual violence intersects with inequalities, both locally and transnationally. Melanie Boyd is a phenomenal professor, and the class covers some great readings -- but the student presentations, the self-defense class, and the \"intervention project\" (a rape prevention project on campus) are what make this class especially exciting. Two notes of caution: if you've already taken a lot of WGSS, be prepared for some fairly repetitive readings, and if you are taking this class for personal reasons in addition to academic reasons, be prepared for a semester's worth of triggers. The one other downside of the class is that it examines sexual violence almost exclusively in terms of rape within a heterosexual matrix (\"diversity\" here means talking about sexual violence against black women, immigrant women, and women in the Middle East)... if you're interested in learning about queer sexual violence or other forms of rape, you probably won't learn too much about those topics in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that is willing to do the reading and participate in discussion. The course topic is very heavy and you need to go into the class ready and willing to hear some ideas that you may not have thought of yourself. HOWEVER, this course has two papers, on 5 pg on 10 pg, weekly responses, a presentation, and a group intervention project. Lots of work, but worth it if you feel passionately about the topic and are willing to put the time in."
