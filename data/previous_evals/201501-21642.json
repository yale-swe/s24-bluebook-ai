    "Pretty good class, interesting stuff.",
    "Although it is good to know techniques out there before conducting fieldwork, I'm not sure how helpful certain techniques would fit with certain research locations. I would recommend this class to places with application to archaeometallurgy.",
    "A very nice overview of Archaeological Lab science topics\/methods and what it consists of\/entails.",
    "Definitely worth it if you're interested in a broad range of archaeological science techniques. Generally, each topic\/technique only gets one or two lectures, so don't expect an exhaustive discussion of any one thing. However, the final project lets you specialize in something of particular interest to you.",
    "Yes, I will definitely recommend this course to other students. What we learn in this class is more than archaeological techniques, but how to use this techniques to solve archaeological questions.",
    "ARCG 316 is an excellent course that introduces students to the wide array of quantitative analysis available for archaeologists to use. I would highly recommend it to any student looking to do work in archaeology or anyone who has an interest in lab sciences.",
    "The class was invaluable for anyone looking for the scientific and laboratory side of the discipline of archaeology. I would definitely recommend it to any graduate or undergraduate students with a major or concentration in archaeology, as well as students outside of the discipline who are interested in applied sciences."
