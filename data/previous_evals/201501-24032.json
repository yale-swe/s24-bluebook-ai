   "comments": [
    "This course was really great. I absolutely loved the reading list, and discussions in class were super interesting. We had a lot of freedom in developing our paper topics, and with support from peer comments through the digital platform, we were able to produce meaningful papers on topics we were personally interested in. I really loved viewing this wide range of American literature through this lens of the \"Nonhuman.\" This seminar is really great, and not too much work outside class aside from reading and a few totally manageable papers. Overall, a really excellent course.",
    "Take it! The topic and the professor make it a truly enjoyable class.",
    "One of the best reading lists I've had in an English course here! A great course for discussing philosophical questions about what defines humanity, through the lens of great literature.",
    "I highly recommend this class to another student-- an exploration of the non-human in literature spanning 19th century versions of non-human entities to present day iterations. Extremely exciting\/inventive topic with incredible readings.",
    "ENGL 433 is the best literature class I've taken at Yale. It's almost an American Lit survey, but instead of focusing on the American Dream (been there, done that), you examine the texts through the lens of the other, be it nature, dehumanized Native populations, or the digital. Professor Dimock is so smart and so kind, and runs class so smoothly I was always sad when it was over. It's about a novel a week, and some of them are pretty dense, so just make sure you have time to read about 200 pages per class. Take it take it take it."
