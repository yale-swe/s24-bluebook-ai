   "comments": [
    "I feel like the course would be best taken over a whole year, split between one semester of readings and theoretical things and the second actually doing the project. It was too rushed and felt like we constantly had to make decisions on the fly that weren't necessarily the most thought out. I also feel like towards the end we never really circled back to whether we were really serving our intended audience, and the hastiness certainly contributed to that. Like, why the emphasis on producing? Who was that for, really? (Especially with all the talk on faculty diversity recruitment\/retention, it just felt like a twisted way of showing the pressures that professors are under in the tenure timeline.) I wish we had gotten the chance to reflect on the process of creating our process because honestly that's where I learned the most (and also felt the most frustrated).",
    "The course was incredibly engaging, and it kept you constantly on your feet. Our discussions of readings were more than sufficiently thorough, and everyone in the class was so invested with the project.",
    "It was so disorganized. Honestly this class should be a two-semester application-based course. The first semester should be spent learning about different public humanities interventions and the second semester should be focused on the class project. It was much too rushed, even though the concept was amazing."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but highly dependent on who else is in your class in terms of direction of class project, delegation, timeline, etc. and similarly for the discussions that make up the first part of the semester; some people talk a lot and feel comfortable taking up that space and others not so much, but talk =\/= work being done. The class has lots of potential, but sometimes the push to have a deliverable at the end felt like it was over-crowding a more nuanced, thoughtful approach; it was like \"oh we really need to get this done so we're just going to do xyz\"...which we all knew going in, but I'm really questioning if that should even be an intent of the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in public humanities. This course gives you an honest look at what it takes to be part of the field.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for the first two thirds. I think the last third, the project section of the course, could really stand to be improved and was quite disorganized. This was partly the fault of the class but Professor Brasseaux did very little to corral the class and keep things moving. That being said, the first part of the course was amazing.",
    "Disorganized, but pretty fun."
