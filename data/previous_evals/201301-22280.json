    "Lit 122 was great! I feel like I learned so much from the materials, and have a great context. Take this class if you want to read really, really good world literature, and want to improve writing comparative, literary essays.",
    "If you're a lit major, you're going to have to take this class no matter what. But for non-lit majors, still consider it - it's pretty good. You write 3 papers for the entire semester, and read a diverse range of really interesting texts. The reading is pretty heavy, but I think the professors may be trying to streamline it for next year. Lecture is pretty small, and you're occasionally broken into two sections to discuss the texts. If you're willing to put in the work and are looking for an interesting writing\/humanities credit, take the class.",
    "It's a LIT requirement. Otherwise I'd recommend another course.",
    "This class was interesting and it seemed like a lot of my classmates were getting a lot of each text. As a freshman, I felt unfamiliar with much of the literary theory\/terms (for lack of a better word) that the upperclassmen in the class were using which made keeping up with discussions difficult. The speed of the syllabus meant it was difficult to learn enough of each text's background and discuss it meaningfully -- lectures are more like literary anthropology than about the text itself or as literature. It's a lit major requisite, so if you have to take it, consider taking it as a sophomore\/junior.",
    "Lit 122 provides a survey of various works in the genres of lyric, epic, and drama. It offers an interesting perspective, exposing students to works from India, Africa, Japan, and other regions outside of the West.",
    "You'll read things you never though of reading before, and have reason to read things you thought of but didn't. The lyric unit is a strong opening, but the epic unit is a lull, and the drama unit doesn't quite reach the same heights as lyric. Trumpener is a great discussion leader, can't speak for Ben. Lecturers and texts are inconsistent in quality but the good ones are in my opinion worth the bad ones.",
    "This course is great for anyone interested in different types of literature that you wouldn't really have a chance to experience anywhere else. It is a survey course and a great glimpse into african, greek and japanese literature among many more. Most all of the lectures were extremely interesting and gave insights into the works that sometimes were not necessarily literary but definitely unique. Highly recommended.",
    "This class, unlike the other requirement for Lit majors, Introduction to Narrative, is very palatable. I would not recommend it if you do not have to take it--there are many better, less diffuse humanities courses at Yale--but if you do, you will be treated to some exhilarating texts (Sweeny Astray, Japanese Noh drama) and some baffling ones (the Mahabharata). Professor Trumpener is an excellent instructor, one of the best I have had at Yale. Professor Baer, whom I did not have as a section-leader but experienced as a lecturer, was less impressive this semester.",
    "Do not take this out of curiosity. Take it out of NECESSITY. Dull, disorganized.",
    "Most reviews would probably respond to this saying \"take it since you have to, if you're a lit major.\" And they're right, it's probably not a class I would have chosen to take if I didn't need it. But I'd suggest not going into class with that attitude because it really that bad. You read interesting works you probably won't read anywhere else, you get guest lecturers, and the workload is very manageable. You can write on pretty much anything you want. However yes, the disadvantage of having so many somewhat seemingly \"random\" choice of works is that the course seems to lack direction, and the works are merely glazed over because professors probably won't be extremely knowledgeable about each (and there are simply too many)."
