   "comments": [
    "I learned how to think critically about novels and hold literature in tension in with theory. I also acquired skills in close reading and film analysis.",
    "I became deeply familiar with how issues such as exile, migration, alienation from one's country, and home are presented in film and literature. As a class we learned about the major themes that arise in such works as well as the various ways issues around migration can be artistically represented. The course was wonderful in the sense that it taught us not only about content but also method. That is, we analyzed not just what has been said about exile but also how it has been communicated. Professor Mirakhor did an excellent job teaching us to also develop method in our own writing and express ourselves regarding the major course themes as well.",
    "This course taught me how to approach political topics from a literary point of view. I believe my writing improved with the help and feedback given to me by Professor Mirakhor. The themes of the class were extremely interesting, diverse, and engaging as were the readings.",
    "I learned a lot from this course about reading modern literature. I had never taken a class on modern literature but had read a lot of the works by the authors previously. Professor Mirakhor helped me to learn how to better interpret and understand the world we were reading."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus for this course was very well thought-out; the material was well organized and parlayed into very compelling and pertinent conversations. I can't think of any course weaknesses.",
    "Professor Mirakhor is fantastic. The syllabus is extremely well put together and organized. All the readings fit nicely together and contribute meaningfully towards a cohesive understanding of issues related to exile and migration. At the same time, they are all interesting and it is clear that the syllabus is really curated to best serve the purpose of the course. I appreciated how the readings touched on exile in different forms. They were decidedly not Eurocentric in scope, which is almost astonishing given the tendency of most literature courses. Instead, the course included completely diverse depictions. Professor Mirakhor is an excellent facilitator during class discussions and continuously raised questions that pushed us to think critically about the material. She exemplifies how seminars really should be taught: she allowed room for student-led exploration of the material, while providing framing and direction so that the discussion never became aimless. She also made sure to contextualize the material by discussing the influence of social forces such as racism or political events such as 9\/11. This was gratifying and refreshing. The workload is quite fair and the class is enjoyable because it is intellectually stimulating. Professor Mirakhor provides strong constructive feedback and is supportive of intellectual inquiry.",
    "This is one of the finest courses I have taken at Yale. It provoked new ways of thinking about pedestrian topics. Discussion remained fresh and engaging week after week. My only critique, and it is a small one, is that the prompts for the papers could be rewritten to better help students understand the expectations of the assignment. That being said, Professor Mirakhor was always making herself available to us during office hours and it was clear she was on our side and wanted us to succeed.",
    "I really only see strengths. I really enjoyed the discussion aspect of the course and worked very dillegently to prepare for class. In most seminars I had taken before I was very nervous to speak in the classroom but professor Mirakhor made the atmosphere very comfortable and I participated more than any other class I had previously taken at Yale."

    "Yes. This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale. The novels and essays on the syllabus are pieces that everyone should take the time to read and discuss. Professor Mirakhor is an excellent discussion leader and really pushes her students to think both expansively with regards to course themes and specifically with regards to the texts.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Mirakhor is fantastic. The syllabus is extremely well put together and organized.

    "This class is amazing. Professor Mirakhor puts together some of the most interesting readings and topics together. She's incredibly intelligent and you'll be smarter for having taken her class. It is a lot of reading and she won't give you an easy A, but this is one of those few classes that the struggle makes it all the more worth it.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course if you want to develop a great relationship with your fellow classmates and your professor and if you want to have lots of fun learning and reading."
