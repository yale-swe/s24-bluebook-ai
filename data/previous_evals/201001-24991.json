    "Pretty good class to learn about a fairly interesting subject. Lehrach genuinely cares about his students and his real-world experience bring the class life. Beware though, the book is terrible - expect to learn from class or another outside source.",
    "This course was my favorite this term, by far (and not because some of my other classes were boring). Mr. Lehrach is a helpful, kind, and sometimes even fun instructor. His expertise in the field of propulsion was always a pleasure to hear about, and he tied together all the background science into the field.My one concern is the grading--I've heard that lots of people who took this last time loved it and thought that they were doing well, only to get horrible grades. Hopefully he isn't as hard a grader as they say, but we'll see.",
    "As far as engineering electives go, Propulsion is a cool one. You learn about the components of turbojet engines, ramjet engines, and rockets. The subject matter isn't too difficult if you've taken Thermodynamics (and a little Fluids doesn't hurt either). The problem sets are manageable, and Mr. Lehrach's industry background is pretty rare among Yale professors. There's a good mix of theory and application in the class, which a lot of other engineering classes can't claim.",
    "A must-take class if you're at all interested in the aerospace side of engineering. You'll come away with a deep understanding of modern propulsion systems and a feel for the industry as well."
