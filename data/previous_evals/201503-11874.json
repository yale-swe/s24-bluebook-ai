   "comments": [
    "I would recommend English 120 to any student- not only those with a vested interest in writing. The assigned readings are contemporary and never felt like work. The essays are manageable. Dr. Stuart is a joy to have as an instructor.",
    "Interesting class, heavy reading load. Be prepared to write a lot and \"kill your darlings.\" If you don't have a big background in writing, you will improve considerably. If you do, you will enjoy the class and the essay prompts.",
    "Great class. Very challenging at first, especially if you haven't written creative nonfiction before. However, you learn a lot and come out much better at personal writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. This class will challenge what you know about writing and expose you to intriguing and thought-provoking essays. It will prompt you to think not only about how you write, but why you write. I did a lot of reflecting while producing work for this class which I found to be very helpful in my growth freshman fall.",
    "English 120 is definitely a much different course from high school, and a great introduction to non-academic writing. Prof. Stuart is great on a one-on-one basis but the class does get sluggish if readings aren't done (it is, after all, a seminar).",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who seriously wants to improve their writing. You will write 5 essays and think about in writing in ways you might not have before. Your writing will definitely improve but you will get more out of the class the more you are willing to put in. Most of the readings are enjoyable and it is not totally required to do every single reading. A much better writing credit than ENGL 114 but more difficult as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great course to clean up any highs schoolers writing and bump it to the college level.",
    "There is a lot of writing and reading involved. It's a lot of work but that's how you improve. Helped me think about the writing process in a new light."
