    "The seminar is an in depth analysis of Heidegger's early philosophy. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Philosophy 701 is a seminar which works through the entirety of Heidegger's Being and Time, focusing on deep engagement with the primary text. Prof. Harries lectures for most of the session, explicating the text and drawing from a wealth of knowledge of the history philosophy where that is helpful and relevant. It is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale and I would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "A comprehensive journey through Being and Time, clarifying the text and pointing out its limitations. Absolutely recommended."

    "The course gave me a clear indication of the intensity and sophistication of graduate coursework in philosophy.",
    "This course helped me to make a great step forward in my knowledge of the history of philosophy, and has given me a platform from which to explore post-Heideggerean traditions in 20th century thought. This will be extremely useful my comprehensive exam in the History of Philosophy. It has also helped me to think conceptually about metaphysical problems in the history of Platonism, which I hope will feed into dissertation research."
