   "comments": [
    "I improved my approach to planning essays. Also learned to identify parallel or contrasting themes in different books.",
    "I developed close reading, analytical interpreting, and strong writing skills. This was facilitated by stimulating and challenging class discussions led by my peers.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the subject material--it was fascinating working with the topic of sequels and revisions. I learned a little bit about how to write, especially through significant feedback from the instructor.",
    "I thought that this class taught me how to think of novels in relation to one another and how craft is such a sensitive process.",
    "One thing I learned was how authors \"teach you how to read a book\" early on in a work of fiction; we spent a lot of time considering how different authors structure their works, address the reader, and create a landscape for their writing. This course made me reflect a lot about revision what it means, why we do it, how we do it. Revision is everywhere, everything, it seems; all art is somehow inspired by things that came before it. I think this course illuminated this concept in interesting ways that got me thinking beyond just the books we covered in the semester. This class also helped me write more concisely; the papers were all on the shorter side, which really forced me to narrow my focus and pick my words carefully.",
    "I gained insight into how texts are revised over time and how prequels, sequels, and adaptations relate to one another."

   "comments": [
    "The seminar format was amazing for discussion, and even when the students didn't have much to contribute, Professor Gordon always had somewhere to take the conversation. The essay prompts were also very open which was nice. The course might improve by spending more time in class discussing comparisons to other books rather than just discussing the book we were reading at the time. We definitely did do this, but maybe a little bit more would have helped.",
    "The small class size and the professor were both major assets to the course. I really enjoyed the texts we tackled. My only suggestion would be to perhaps skip reading Jane Eyre and the Wide Sargasso Sea.",
    "The material is fascinating and Gordon is a remarkable teacher with a wealth of knowledge. However, I don't think he took enough advantage of the fact that it was an incredibly small class--there could've been excellent and productive back and forth conversations, but Gordon treated it slightly more like a lecture.",
    "ENGL018 was a great course. The reading list, professor, and atmosphere were all wonderful. The books were all interesting and covered a range of genres and topics and styles. I also really enjoyed having the unique and truly special opportunity of watching, getting to meet, and working with the Q Brothers and their hip-hop remix of Othello. That was a great, rewarding experience. I also really liked having the opportunity to analyze a play (a musical!) in a literary English paper, which was a fulfilling challenge. Moreover, Professor Gordon always had interesting things to say and led great discussions, and his generosity was unmatched by any professor I have had so far at Yale. I suppose the only suggestion I have for improving the course would be to vary the structure of class each day. Outside of the Q Brothers wee and the Alice Munro creative project right in the beginning, we more or less did the same thing in class each week. This worked, but sometimes I felt we could have changed up how we approached books and how we structured the discussion.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and think the concept of looking at groupings of texts is an intriguing one. Discussions and assignments gave us the opportunity to examine parallels and distinctions over time and between authors. My only recommendations for the course would be to find a way to examine the texts more closely\/read them more deeply (as often it felt like we lacked the time to truly delve into all of the nuances of each text in class) and for there to be more specific\/pinpointed writing feedback. Other than those suggestions, I thought this was a very good course and liked all of the texts that we read and analyzed."

    "Yes I'd definitely recommend this. I really enjoyed most of the books on the syllabus and Professor Gordon is awesome. In addition to being extremely insightful and accommodating and helpful, he also brought us food a lot which was always the highlight of my day (excluding of course the rest of my time in his class). Definitely, definitely take this class.",
    "Yes, I adored Professor Gordon and think that this class is both an interesting introduction to college-level English and a unique opportunity to work closely with other freshman and a distinguished professor.",
    "Super cool class with insightful discussions and a lovely professor who brings in food related to the books you'll read. Overall wonderful.",
    "I would recommend this course, but be forewarned--Gordon is a remarkable teacher and incredibly knowledgeable but doesn't take full advantage of the incredibly small size of this class. We did some fun stuff that did take advantage of the size, such as a small debate, but overall the class feels a little bit more like a very long, intimate lecture.",
    "Of course!!!!",
    "Absolutely take this class! Professor Gordon is simply the kindest, most generous professor you will find on campus. He has also been at Yale for 40 or so years, so he knows everyone and has connections that give you unique opportunities in the classroom. The reading list was really great, and each class had an interesting discussion and focus. The reading is a solid amount but interesting and doable, and the papers are really open-ended, so you can write about what interests you. Professor Gordon always had really helpful feedback, and he truly devoted himself to his students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Gordon is wonderful (he brought in baked goods pretty much every week which always connected to the course texts), and we read some intriguing books which I may not have encountered otherwise. It is quite a lot of reading for a freshman course but is certainly worthwhile and enjoyable."
