    "Thinking in a new way.",
    "An incredible course that makes you personally reflect on your place in the universe. All FES students should take this course - I believe anyone coming out of this course will be better equipped to handle environmental issues in the future because they will have a larger personal stake in the interconnectedness of the Earth and universe. One of the best courses I've taken at FES.",
    "Re-orient myself within the wider web of matter and happenings. It brought me a sense of self of my purpose for being here at FES--and that is to improve myself through changing my ideologies, and in doing this, I now feel more prepared to take on the challenges we all will face in the next century.",
    "Interesting discussions. Interesting to meet other people in the room.",
    "This course imparted an incredibly comprehensive overarching way for thinking about the intersections of science, cosmology, ecology, community, and faith. I will very much operate differently on account of the insights this course provided.",
    "This class was overwhelming in the effect it had on my daily life. Completely reshaped how I interact with people, life, and matter around me. Connected me with a new sense of wonder, gratitude, and spirituality.",
    "A creative and profound perspective to understand the whole universe and all the evolutionary history with all our knowledge, combining religions and science.",
    "It was wonderful to learn about the universe from both scientific and spiritual lens at the same time.",
    "This course should be required for students at FES. It prompts us to think about the world that we've inherited, and cosmic evolution as a creative process based on connection, interdependence, and emergence. We examined a range of dynamic interactions and interdependencies in the emergence of galaxies, Earth, life, and human communities, and thought through how this influences our current moment and the work that we are doing."

    "The discussions are by far the best portion of this class.",
    "Strengths You realize you are the universe.",
    "The strengths are the space to talk about the important questions that every other class avoids. The weakness is that other student's perception of this course is not what it actually is, thus keeps students from taking it.",
    "Love the \"alternative\" approach to teaching and being - that is a very welcome refreshing input to the at times stale Yale teaching. Sometimes the room could spin a bit out of control in self-righteousness.",
    "It was so great, it's hard to think of weaknesses. Strengths included the hybrid learning style, the way each student was celebrated, the dialogue between students and between teacher and student, and the feast at the end.",
    "How perfect it is!",
    "Mary Evelyn and John are wonderful instructors; would have liked to hear more from them.",
    "The flipped structure works great, and they are clear on expectations from the very beginning."

    "I strongly suggest everybody take this course, especially for those who have background mainly on science or engineering.",
    "Be ready to invest time and emotional energy in your weekly postings, and come prepared for class discussions. The more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it."
