   "comments": [
    "You know what you're getting into with class. It's tough, Kagan is a hard grader, the material is challenging, etc. But the workload is not overbearing, and the discussions are very good. One thing about this class that I did not expect is that there weren't any insufferable students. In a high-level philosophy seminar with Shelly Kagan, I expected the section assholes to be out in droves, but either my class happened to have none or Kagan is just very good at tempering their tendencies and leading the discussion. He's tough on you; you better be prepared to defend your views (although sometimes I do think he jumps the gun and will object to what you say just for the sake of objecting without necessarily having thought his point through), but the class isn't too hard that you have to worry much about getting a D. If you can take it Credit\/D, do that. It's a very important class for anyone to take in order to learn about how to live a good life, and a class that I would recommend to anyone up for the challenge.",
    "Yes for the serious philosophy or EPE major -- will certainly force you to think rigorously. Yes for other interested students if you can get in as well. As long as you're willing to do serious work on papers. And you can start cred\/D and then switch after your first paper grades. Shelly is demanding, a tough grader, and a bit of a jerk... but he isn't a psychopath and you'll leave this class feeling that you have gained a huge amount.",
    "Normative Ethics is an intensive survey of the discipline of normative ethics. It isn't your typical philosophy class - its focus isn't intellectual history or tracing great philosophers' ideas; rather, students are taught how to think about ethics from a contemporary analytic philosophy lens. Some people might not find this their cup of tea, so be forewarned. I, for one, discovered that I'm much more of an applied ethicist; many of our discussions were overly abstract for me or treated ethics as if it were somehow a metaphysical or ontological reality as opposed to a system constructed by human beings. I prefer the DS-type survey of philosophy class, and Normative Ethics isn't that kind of class. Shelly Kagan is an awesome teacher and deep thinker. The things you've heard about his grading are true, but this class is probably worth it if you're philosophically inclined or have a Credit-D to spare.",
    "The quality of this class really depends on the people in it. Shelly definitely helps guide discussion but largely leaves it up to the students to decide what direction to take it in and will often sit back and let people talk for a while, which can be either great or horrible depending on the students and what they decide to talk about. Office hours with him are generally helpful in clarifying your thinking, though it can be pretty difficult to figure out how to write a good paper for him. The workload isn't hard - reading is honestly usually very short - but it's usually the process of actually figuring out what to write about for your papers and how to write them that can be difficult.",
    "An absolutely wonderful course. It is the purest seminar I've ever taken, where the emphasis is truly on student discussion, not professorial lecture. Shelly has a glowing reputation, and I must say he far exceeded my expectation. He is incredibly smart. He will listen to your garbled half-idea, understand the point you want to make better than you do, reconstruct it in a far more convincing way than you ever could, then proceed to break it down. Papers really are at the core of this class. They provide an opportunity to grapple with and explore a narrow topic on your own. I probably learned more from the hours and hours I spent writing papers than from anything else in the course. Above all, Shell's detailed comments on the papers is really incredible. He writes about 2000 words on each paper--the most extensive (and gruellingly deconstructive) feedback I've ever gotten in any class. Take any class you can with Shelly. He is what every yale course should be.",
    "I definitely recommend this, especially for philosophy majors -- it will be challenging, but will make your writing a lot better. Though you could probably get away with not doing the readings, doing them will make the papers go more smoothly and will also make class discussions more enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely. The course will make you think rigorously and systematically about ethics, and you will come out a better thinker. Shelly can be tough, but he's the most dedicated professor I've ever met; never have I seen a teacher put so much time and effort into grading papers (he practically writes full-length essays in response to your work). If you have any interest at all in ethics (which you should), or if you just want to challenge yourself to think hard about difficult issues, you couldn't find a better course through which to do it.",
    "This class is incredible.",
    "Take this class! It is scary and you should be scared, because the papers are hard and the seminars are fast paced, and you will be expected to participate a lot. However, I think it is good to put yourself in a situation like this so that you are forced to seriously challenge your own ethical beliefs and defend them against other smart people. I felt that my own personal ethical beliefs grew immensely as a result of taking this class, although it was at the cost of a good amount of work and stress. If you take the class definitely start the papers early! I didn't leave myself enough time for the first paper and never ended up with a good topic, and ended up getting an abysmal grade. Luckily, I learned my lesson and put in the hours on the subsequent papers to get a good grade (and luckily the first paper grade was discounted), but it was scary to not really have any safety net. Meet with Shelly (maybe multiple times) as he is very helpful and very willing to help is students however he can.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who has prior experience in philosophy and is prepared to think really hard about ethics for an entire semester. This class is difficult, but worthwhile. And if you do take the class, meet with Shelly before each paper, perhaps multiple times. I came away from every meeting with a completely new perspective on my ideas, and would often leave meetings questioning the arguments I had believed most strongly.",
    "Take this course. Wonderful discussions. Consistently one of my most enjoyable courses to attend. And this course seemed to attract a bunch of extremely engaged students. Also, no professor beats Shelly at providing essay feedback. If you take his comments to heart, you're going to learn a lot. He's one of the tougher graders, no doubt, but just meet with him. If you haven't had much experience with philosophy, it will be difficult to write essays that successfully meet his expectations. So glad I took this course.",
    "Fantastic class. Without a doubt the best Philosophy seminar I have taken at Yale. Shelly is absolutely brilliant, and one of the sharpest thinkers I have ever met. He is also a terrific teacher, and will make you a better writer, a better thinker, and certainly a better philosopher. The course's content covers many important questions and debates in normative ethics, and occasionally touches on a few questions in metaethics. Unlike many philosophy courses, the ideas and theories the course engages with are generally divorced from their historical roles (or associations with particular authors). Instead, you evaluate moral arguments independently, on their own merits, I think for the better. Shelly keeps discussion interesting and lively, and goes out of his way to make sure every student participates. But having strong views and being comfortable defending them will make discussion more enjoyable. Students do a majority of the talking, but Shelly's contributions make discussion especially good. He has a fantastic ability to clarify and crystallize philosophical disagreements, and he will often reframe half-baked arguments of students in immensely clear terms. The course is not particularly work intensive -- the reading (while engaging and worthwhile) is not lengthy, and the course requires only two five page papers and one ten page paper, each on any topic of your choice. The point of these papers is not to regurgitate other authors' moral arguments, but to*do* moral philosophy yourself. Shelly has very high standards, but he is not an unreasonable grader. If you choose a topic narrow enough that you can address it forcefully in five pages, and if you make thoughtful and compelling arguments for your position, you will be rewarded accordingly. Shelly also gives astonishingly detailed feedback. I have never had another professor engage so seriously with my work. Often, the length of his comments came close to the length of the papers themselves. He will understand exactly what you are trying to say (quite possibly better than you do), and he will give trenchant criticism of everything you did wrong, including every flaw, misstep, and unaddressed objection to your arguments. But just because he tears your argument to pieces, does not mean you will get a bad grade. And the quality of your papers will improve throughout the semester. If you are at all interested in moral questions and want to learn from one of the very best teachers at Yale, take this class. I cannot recommend it enough."
