    "German 130 is an excellent course in which you will find yourself reading, writing, listening, and speaking German with a fluency you never could believe possible in such a short amount of time. I have had an absolute blast in this class. Learning the language in this class is fun, engaging, challenging, and even hilarious on occasion. The workload is well balance and meaningful, without make-work. The tests and projects are rewarding and, when you look back on your previous work, you will realize just what a difference this course has made. If you get a chance to take it with Theresa Schenker, do it. That said, I have enjoyed getting to know the members of the German department, and you can't go wrong taking this course with any of them. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "I would definitely recommend German 130 to another student, it's a great course whether you're looking to fulfill your language credit or improve your German overall. Take it with Theresa, if at all possible, you won't be disappointed.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who loves German and prefers a well-paced language class",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I felt I learned a lot of German in this class, and it wasn't painful or a ton of busy work. Resources for learning were readily available for all students as well.",
    "Definitely! It was fun. You must stay on top of things and not fall behind with the homework, and be prepared for a lot of confusing grammar, but all in all it was a great class."
