   "comments": [
    "i would say yes, but be prepared for a lot of work. Shufro is okay, but there are probably better out there.",
    "I would not recommend English 120 to a fellow student, which I do not say lightly. Lured by its promotion of \"New Yorker-style\" nonfiction, I expected more. Perhaps my expectations were idealistic, existing only in that quixotic style familiar to a course guide. That said, the class did not revolve around writing beyond its commitment to peer revision. The workload was manageable, the essays writeable, the discussions bull-shit-able--none of this, however, added up to an intellectually satisfying experience.",
    "English 120 is overall a very good writing course. Shufro is a good teacher and gave great suggestions and feedback for my writing. The workload is heavier than other english courses, but in general it's easy to manage. There is a profile project that requires interviewing someone in the New Haven area. Start thinking about who you'd interview right away, and it will save you lots of anxiety later. Take this class if you want to be better at writing, regardless of what you plan to major in.",
    "English 120 is a personal essay writing class where you'll read a lot of good non-fiction pieces and begin to refine your personal style. I would definitely recommend the course. The readings are usually very interesting, theskills your learn are helpful and apply to all types of writing, and the discussions can be fun.",
    "The ideal course for any student with an interest in expository writing."
