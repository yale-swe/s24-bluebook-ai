   "comments": [
    "This class was great, definitely take it if you have the opportunity! You get to meet people from museums across campus that you would not have access to otherwise. The majority of classes are guest lectures, and the speakers give invaluable information about how museums work and explain the differences between an art museum and a natural history museum. Our final project was to put up an exhibition at the Peabody Museum, which is super cool!",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "A hands on approach to understanding the uses of museum objects. I would recommend this class to anyone interesting in having an interdisciplinary approach to the study of museums and exhibit design.",
    "I would encourage any student who is interested in museum work to take this course. However if they are looking for an easy course with minimal time commitment this is not for you",
    "AMST 716 01 is a graduate course designed to introduce students to the study of museums and their objects -- and importantly, the people who find, maintain, and share them with the world. I would highly recommend this course to any graduate student who has a vested interest in the public humanities, in learning how to make a concrete impact on the community they live in beyond the cloistered bounds of their dissertation project."

    "Helped me to think more about objects in different ways. Helped me to gain a broader global perspective on issues relating to objects in museum contexts. Helped me to establish better interdependent skills. Helped me to think outside the box.",
    "This course gave me a TON of practical experience with museum work.",
    "This course broadened my understanding of both the resources involved in the public dissemination (and curation) of knowledge, and also of the many opportunities available to get involved from the volunteer to professional levels. I entered the course with an abiding love of museums but no real idea of how they were run on a large or particular scale; I left feeling like there was more out there to know and learn about museums than I originally conceived, and that there are all kinds of possibilities for growth and innovation in the industry. It re-inspired me to look beyond article and book writing as the primary goals of knowledge generation in my field. The course helped me understand -- practically -- how to make my work relevant to the greater public, how to reintegrate \"the humanities\" with the human."
