    "Air Pollution is an interesting course with a very manageable workload. Professor Gentner is great and so is the TA. The subject matter is not too difficult to begin with and they both do a good job explaining the concepts and are understanding and flexible with exam dates and homeworks. There were only 5 pretty short problem sets throughout the semester and three exams that you are able to use a cheat-sheet for. There is a substantial final project that you should start a good bit beforehand. Unfortunately, you have to submt a project proposal only about a month into the course when you haven't covered much of the subject matter yet.",
    "Air Pollution Control gives a fundamental understanding of what the air quality issues we face today are, and how we should address those problems. It is a fairly even combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis. Be warned: workload is fairly light for the first third of the semester, and then it picks up drastically.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It is laid back but interesting. The exams are fair and the final paper gives you enough freedom that whatever topic you decide on is bound to be interesting to you! Overall, a relevant and interesting class full of information but not too stressful.",
    "Reading many of the evaluations for this course from last year, I find it hard to believe they are even describing the same professor. Professor Gentner very quickly grew to became one of my favorite professors I've had in the environmental engineering department so far. His teaching style was highly interactive and engaging, and I really appreciated the focus on the final project, which really allowed us to use a lot of what we had learned over the semester (depending on what topic you chose.) I also love how interdisciplinary the study of air pollution control can be, and how Professor Gentner gave us room to explore some of those facets in class discussions and lecture. I do wish that there had been more continuity between what we learned in lectures and had to do on our problem sets, and also that the progression of our learning in lectures had been more linearly organized (and more organized in general, but maybe that's just the way I personally take in information best), but overall I really enjoyed this class, and would definitely recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is concerned about air quality problems and wants to learn more about them. It's not too much work and you come away feeling like you've learned a fair amount. I especially liked the treatment of climate change and wished we had done a little more on that.",
    "Pretty interesting class. An interesting mix between seminar and lecture. Psets due about every 2 weeks, 3 non-cumulative exams (with a 1 page cheat sheet) plus a final paper\/presentation. If it's not required and you're not super interested, would recommend that you really think about it."
