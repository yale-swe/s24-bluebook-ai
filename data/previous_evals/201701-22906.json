   "comments": [
    "i learned about sentential logic, first order logic, and theorems\/proof techniques.",
    "The course description is pretty self-explanatory, and it absolutely delivers on what it promises. By the end, I definitely felt like I was thinking more clearly in general, and, despite not having a background in first order logic, really felt like I got a grasp on formal logic.",
    "Semantics, relation of math to language, good proof structure",
    "I got an intro to mathematical logic, which was not only interesting in and of itself but proved to inform how I approached my other studies and everyday logic. It was fulfilling to prove the soundness and completeness of a system of thinking that we truly use in everyday life.",
    "I took this class as a required class for the Philosophy major. It made me a better writer but it was really hard for me! I didn't have any mathematical background and sometimes the lectures are not as helpful as going to office hours. But, I am glad I took this class in the end. If you are willing to put in the work, its better to take this class than First Order Logic.",
    "Learned a lot about the metatheory of logic: soundness and completeness of first-order systems. Added a lot of practice and nuance to my understanding of proof methods like induction, recursion, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about formal logic, but more than that I developed skills making detailed step-by-step logical reasoning and proof writing. I also learned how to be more detail-oriented and not take even seemingly-obvious things for granted.",
    "How to do proofs in logic.",
    "The class proves the soundness and completeness of first order logic, that is, that everyone in PHIL 115 COULD have done everything they did. It covers a great amount of material quickly; I learned how to approach proof-based work, recursion, and the convergence of syntax and semantics for specific purposes.",
    "This class really allowed me to understand how to do proofs. The expectations of the TA were clear, and my TA provided many examples of how to actually prove things rigorously. Yet it wasn't just the skill of proofs that I learned, there is a certain beauty to all the different proofs we learn in class.",
    "You learn about metalogic, the notions of satisfiability and consistency.",
    "I understood how to systematically approach different systems of logic and what the requirements of a rigorous proof are.",
    "In a nutshell, I learned about why first-order logic is a decent logical system to use. We evaluated first-order logic according to two criteria (known as soundness and completeness) and endeavored over the course of the semester to prove that first-order logic satisfies those two criteria. All the theory in this class is at a meta level, which was a new experience for me - and a very interesting one."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lecture outlines were really helpful! I think non-math majors would benefit from more time devoted to learning how to write proofs in the beginning of the semester.",
    "Strengths: teaching style was very engaging, enjoyable Weaknesses: time spent on different parts of material (sometimes multiple days on easy stuff, cramming complex material into the end of lectures)",
    "It is hard to engage in lecture for sure.",
    "I think the course is quite strong as it is.",
    "Strengths: Focused around one logical, proof-based task Weaknesses: Lectures utterly unhelpful. Might as well just go to section and office hours.",
    "I don't think I have any weaknesses. Lectures were great, the packets Professor Shin made were SUPER helpful, and my TA was incredibly helpful in both section and office hours. The psets took time but were never unfair and were often fulfilling.",
    "I think this class is really only as good as the TAs who teach it. I had a wonderful and understanding TA and the professor is very funny, but I have heard that it is bad from previous years who had poor TAs. It is also a very harshly graded class and the psets are difficult, but there are no final exams.",
    "This course is tried-and-true, no nonsense, and probably does not need to be improved in any major structural ways. A little bit of refinement and proofreading in lecture handouts could be helpful, but otherwise totally solid.",
    "The biggest way the course could be improved would be if more time were spent going over the big picture of what the class is trying to accomplish and how each topic falls into that picture.",
    "Well taught, practice solutions would be very helpful to know PSETs.",
    "I did not keep up nearly as much as I should have, but the resources are plentiful and very helpful. It takes time to make mistakes and figure out what is happening, be sure to invest in it.",
    "Sun Joo is a clear lecturer, as well as my TA.",
    "No glaring issues",
    "This course is extremely well taught and well assessed. Perhaps, uploading the lecture notes online would be one of the few ways to ameliorate this class.",
    "Strengths: (1) Very clear lectures with helpful lecture notes; (2) interesting homeworks that solidified understanding well; (3) great prof and great TA (Akhil). Weaknesses: (1) Lecture notes often had major typos that obscured understanding; (2) course is bit slow for a math major (only two 50-minute lectures a week and problem sets every two weeks). The philosophy people had to work pretty hard to keep up though - I suppose they're not used to quantitatively oriented classes. It'd be great if there were separate logic courses for philosophy majors and math majors."

   "comments": [
    "Math Logic with Prof. Shin is great. If you are not a math major, there is a bit of a learning curve in the beginning of the semester to learning how to write proofs so go to office hours! The class is really chill. The p-sets are just applications of definitions and theorems that we go over in class. If you understand what's happening in lecture, then doing the p-sets shouldn't take too long. P-sets are roughly every other week. She was pretty good with giving you a week or two to solve each p-set so look at them early so you can at least start thinking about the questions. Professor Shin is super helpful definitely go to her office hours. If Akhil is TFing again, DEFINITELY go to all his sections and OH. He saved me this semester.",
    "If you are a mathematically minded person this class will not be difficult, and I found it to be enjoyable and interesting. It's all psets and no exams. The final assignment was brutal, but otherwise the psets were of reasonable length.",
    "No, I personally did not like the course material. I found it hard to be interested in the material.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course. I did not take first order logic and was comfortable throughout the class.",
    "no. It's stressful and you have to seek out all of the resources you need to succeed. It does not lend itself to success.",
    "I would if a student is interested in logic. It's a fulfilling course but not the easiest.",
    "I took this class for the logic requirement. I think this is a really good introduction to proof based writing class, and it is much better taught than first order logic. The only scary thing is that it is mostly men and mostly people who are math majors. I found an amazing group of women to study together with and it helped me with that class immensely.",
    "This is probably where anyone who is already quantitatively inclined might want to start with the logic sequence - do yourself a favor and skip First-Order Logic. Everyone can benefit from learning the kind of logic that happens in this class. It will make you smarter.",
    "Yes, if you want to understand mathematical logic (know what is going in though!)",
    "Good, interesting course, but be ready to put in some serious work on the problem sets.",
    "Absolutely! It is the start of philosophically interesting logic and a challegning, doable, and highly enjoyable first venture intro proof \"math\" and logic.",
    "This class really allowed me to understand how to do proofs. The expectations of the TA were clear, and my TA provided many examples of how to actually prove things rigorously. Yet it wasn't just the skill of proofs that I learned, there is a certain beauty to all the different proofs we learn in class.",
    "Yes, everyone should take at least one logic class",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Take it if you do philosophy, if you do math, if you need a QR, or if you just want to learn more about the meta-requirements of a sound and complete logic system. The practical applications are endless.",
    "THIS IS NOT AN EASY COURSE, BUT YOU SHOULD TAKE IT. Especially if you are interested\/majoring in any of the following fields -- Math, Linguistics, Comp Sci, and Philosophy (particularly Metaphysics and Epistemology). This course is challenging, the grading is not easy, but I am a much better off as a thinker. PROFESSOR SHIN IS BAE. SHE REALLY IS. HER JOKES ARE ON POINT, and she is also very kind and supportive if you need any help on the homework\/in general. TL;DR -- I am probably about to submit this course evaluation and get a bad grade, but I have no regrets. I worked hard, I learnt a lot, and I made great friends while doing the PSETs.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student to whom the metatheory of first-order logic sounds intriguing. The course is rigorous, interesting, and satisfying. Plus, Sun-Joo is brilliant and entertaining teacher. Every lecture was beautifully planned and besprinkled with a few hilarious interjections. I would caution, however, that the level of difficulty for you will be profoundly different depending on your background. If you're a math major, this class will feel like a regular proof-based Yale math class, except it'll be taught at about half the pace. (There are just two 50-minute lectures a week, and problem sets are given about every two weeks.) I'd recommend it as a low-key fifth class. On the other hand, if you're a philosophy major who isn't quantitatively inclined but wants the QR, this class will probably be one of the most challenging on your schedule. Your experience may vary, but these generalizations are based on what I consistently observed in myself and my peers. So just plan accordingly. Either way, TAKE THIS CLASS - it's very interesting and rewarding!"
