    "Yes, good amount of grammar.",
    "Have had such a comprehensive survey of German grammar: with only a dictionary, I now feel very empowered and capable of speaking the language! The grammar can be a little nitty-gritty at times, but power through, and you'll find that it is well worth the time and effort that you will end up putting in! Also, take with Ansgar if you can; he's wonderful!",
    "If you took German 1, you can't stop until you've taken German 2. Especially if its with Ansgar.",
    "If you've already taken German 110, 120 is the class where you actually begin to feel some semblance of understanding of the language. You learn much more than you think you do, the coursework is definitely manageable, and you leave the class feeling as though you could probably navigate your way through some portions of Germany.",
    "A good course that should only be taken for requirements."
