    "An understanding of contemporary legal issues in archaeology, a lot about the process of restoring ships, and ship building, design, and tradition.",
    "I had very little experience with art historical methods, particularly with regard to ancient civilizations; this course changed that! Fascinating details of very early human civilization.",
    "I learned a ton about historical analysis and how to work with primary and secondary sources and, of course, a lot about ships.",
    "I gained insight on the historical context of boats in many ancient civilizations and the development of those societies. Coming from a major in a different department, it was new material I had never seen before.",
    "It felt that this course was primarily a survey course in ancient Mediterranean Art History, with a side focus on ancient maritime culture.",
    "I learned a broad array of information regarding the arts of the ancient Meditteranean, with a fascinating emphasis on maritime archaeology. The course encouraged me to consider not only the objects and vessels of trade but also the interconnectedness of many ancient civilizations."

   "comments": [
    "I really liked having presentations by everyone in the class. Overall there is not much I would change.",
    "Great course.",
    "The strengths of this course include the personal class size and the comfortable environment created by the professor. A weakness would probably be not knowing where I stand in the class until the end of the course.",
    "It would have been nice to have a more intensive focus in lecture on the nautical component of the course, given the framing of the class.",
    "The course was so much fun and I learned a lot. I don't think a lot can be improved.",
    "I felt that the thematic nature of the course was an effective way to organize what might otherwise be an overwhelming amount of material. Professor Foster covered a wide array of civilizations and cultures but delivered the material in entertaining and enlightening lectures. She is an amazing educator. I really enjoyed the research and presentation component of the course as well, as it allowed each of us to explore individual interests and consider those interests via the thematic lens of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - it is definitely a niche interest, but if you enjoy thinking about the past, this is a class you'll enjoy.",
    "This is a very enjoyable and relaxed course, but you'll still learn a lot. Definitely worth taking, Professor Foster is knowledgeable and enthusiastic.",
    "Professor Foster is a great instructor and very passionate about her field of study. Class is run like a seminar but it works really well. As a STEM major taking this class I learned a lot and did not feel hindered from a lack of background.",
    "Phenomenal course. You can probably get the specifics on the workload from other comments, but as an engineering student without a background in history\/humanities classes, I felt like I learned a lot and got a ton out of the course.",
    "Yes! Professor Foster is wonderful and cares about her students. If there is ever a problem she is very easy to talk to and accommodating.",
    "Yes. One of my top 5 classes at Yale",
    "Absolutely! Ancient Ships is a wonderful class. The material is fascinating and Professor Foster is an astounding lecturer with so much to share. She is remarkably passionate about her field, and she creates a comfortable and dynamic learning environment."
