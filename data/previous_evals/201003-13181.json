   "comments": [
    "A survey of the ancient schools of philosophy. You read Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Sextus Empiricus, Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas.",
    "I highly recommend Gilmore. His explanations are at the point where you almost regret reading the reading assignments because he clearly summarizes many pages of dense complexity in about thirty seconds. Section debates are always fun and probably more educational and productive than the actual reading itself. A very laid back and funny professor.",
    "This section is a usually topical, frequently monologic ramble through broad questions such as \"What is Justice?\" - with little or no attention to the considerably more complex thought of the philosophers whom we ostensibly read. Do not expect to open a book in class more than two or three times a semester, and, if this is your first exposure to ancient philosophy, take heart that this is not what people who study it really do. Entertaining in small doses, arguably.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants a firm grounding in the history of western philosophy, as that's pretty much what this course gives you.",
    "If you want to enter the world of Plato and Aristotle on a guided tour, this is your course.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. You will learn SO MUCH. I have lots of friends who went through first semester without learning a thing. On the other hand, I have a decent grasp of forty works of the Western Canon and how they relate to each other. DS is an incredible opportunity. Don't let it go to waste.",
    "This is a solid, worthwhile class about ancient philosophers. I have no doubt that I will come to appreciate the material we have studied here more in thespring, when I can see its impact on more modern thought. I would recommend it if you are interested in learning the foundations of philosophy.",
    "I do recommend it. DS in general is very rewarding and interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend DS Philosophy with Professor Gilmore. Although the readings can be at times dense and hard to follow, Professor Gilmore explains important topics with pertinent examples and witty metaphors. His grading is somewhat tough, but always fair--his extended comments will undoubtedly lead to better writing in the future. Gilmore's sections are always entertaining and, most importantly, enlightening.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies for a fellow student only if they were very interested in philosophy. Some of the concepts required a lot of very deep and time consuming thought, so although the readeings were not much in themselves, for one to fully get everything out of the course, it would require a lot of time and effort.",
    "I really enjoyed this section of Directed Studies. Some people say that Gilmore lectures a bit too much, but I thought he struck a good balance between explaining the material himself and letting us pipe up. He gives hilarious (but clear) examples, and his knowledge of art led our class off on interesting tangents. I'm planning to take his lecture, \"Philosophy of Art\", next year.",
    "When it came time to study for the final exam in this course, I was surprised to see how much of the information I had retained. This class manages to provide a fairly in-depth look at many of the most important ideas in Western thought. I loved Professor Gilmore - students who didn't were frustrated with how little time we spent looking at the actual text, but if you're interested in understanding the ideas in the text and having interesting discussions applying them to real life situations, he provides exactly that."
