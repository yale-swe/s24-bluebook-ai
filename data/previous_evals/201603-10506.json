   "comments": [
    "Really got me to think about minds and artificial intelligence. Learned how to write much better",
    "From a knowledge perspective, I learned a great deal on a topic that is very multifaceted and pretty abstract\/sophisticated. It completely revolutionized my perspective on artificial intelligence and the implications of consciousness on computer science and the world in general. From a skills perspective, my learning was perhaps even more valuable. This class challenged me to cut out all the excess and redundancy from my comments in class and writing. I really honed my ability to get straight to the point without using jargon and elaborate sentence structures, something many professors actually encourage even though it is needless and basically a way to thoughtlessly make a paper that is longer or more elaborate. I am taking away from this class a new realization that every single word in a writing assignment should be pointed, clear, and essential. This skill will help me in my writing in the science world and also in my general ability to make a point as clear, concise, and eloquent as possible.",
    "This class facilitates rigorous thinking and reasoning. Prof Gelernter also helps make your writing quality much better.",
    "Beyond learning efficient and effective writing skills, this class gave me an understanding the difference between weak AI and strong AI, and the importance of that difference. Furthermore, this class reminded me of the importance of considering all sides to an argument.",
    "Writing clearly and concisely. The various topics in AI, philosophy of mind and computing",
    "I learned to write concisely. The material was also interesting",
    "I learned how to write in a concise manner. I also learned very much about the field of artificial intelligence and its future.",
    "I developed an understanding of different theories about the mind machines, and consciousness. That's about it.",
    "I I've always been interested in the debate between computationalists and anti-computationalist. The course gave me a broad overview of this debate.",
    "Learnt how to write effectively and concisely, and how to think analytically about whether machines can ever have a mind."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Prof was very smart and super interesting Weaknesses: didn't follow syllabus",
    "While we did not get through as much material as the syllabus intended, I think that was actually a strength of the course, as it allowed us to really delve in to the readings and themes we covered. I would not change a thing about the material or the way it was taught.",
    "Strengths: The topics engaged in the class is extremely intriguing. Weakness: The course can be better organized. Also, cooperation between the professor and the TA should be improved.",
    "This class is quite unstructured, and it often feels like no progress is being made from class to class. However, I realize now that the purpose of the class wasn't to read a lot of articles, or write a lot of papers. The intention was to make you think very deeply about the few things we read, and to write very carefully in the few assignments we had. This class is the definition of quality over quantity, which can be refreshing at times.",
    "Strengths: Good content, very knowledgeable professor, willing to engage in discussion in class. Weakness: Lack of personalized feedback on the writing.",
    "The grading was harsh, but I think I have become a better writer for it.",
    "The class was based on very few grades and it was also extremely unorganized. The professor had a very detailed syllabus to begin the year and ended up getting through about half of it. This was very disappointing because I entered the class very much looking forward to some of the readings towards the end. This was also a problem because Professor Gelernter realized pretty quickly that he wasn't going to have enough grades to submit. He ended up cutting some assignments out and shortening and combining others to compensate. Our professor always showed up at least 5 or 10 minutes late to lecture and very rarely got through the material he had planned for the day. He decided to put it off until next time, and then we just fell further and further behind. This was part of the reason why we didn't get through very much. Professor Gelernter was also extremely slow with grading, and it took him about a week and a half to grade 20 assignments with 150 words each. He was also very unapologetic with his criticisms and grading and didn't commit to meeting students most of the time. Instead he told us to email him questions that he sometimes didn't respond to. I had to email the TA twice to get Professor Gelernter to answer my emails. It was very hard to see the strengths of the classes amidst all of this, but Professor Gelernter is a very smart man with an endless amount of knowledge. The material to the class is very interesting, but I don't think taking this class was worth it.",
    "The course covers very interesting subject matter, but not in quite the breadth or depth that I think it should, for it only drew from a select few short readings. It should definitely cover more material.",
    "Prof. Gelernter gave extensive feedback on all our assignments. That was of immense help. Meanwhile, the class was a lecture meant to be a discussion; I wish that I had heard the thoughts of more students-a lot of them are rather quiet.",
    "The material was very interesting and Professor Gelernter was amazing. The short writing assignments helped me understand what was expected and the feedback helped improve my writing."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Definitely. Take this, hands down. One of the coolest classes at Yale. One of those rare few classes where there is no busywork or pointless exercises\/discussions; Gelernter really values conciseness and getting straight to the point while still entertaining provocative and thought-intensive discussions and assignments.",
    "This class is worth taking if you want a writing credit with less workload but intellectually challenging.",
    "Yes, the professor is engaging and challenges his students to really think about their writing.",
    "Yes, but only if you care deeply about artificial intelligence. If you are just looking for an easy writing credit, look elsewhere because you will not have a good time here.",
    "This was definitely the worst class I've taken at Yale, which is a shame, because it is a really fascinating subject. We moved very slowly, we only covered 5 different readings I believe. There weren't really discussions in class, just Professor Gelernter talking while occasionally asking questions. The five or so people who paid attention would take several tries to answer the question to his satisfaction, which is one of the reasons why we didn't get through very much. One criticism I saw when I was deciding to take the class is that Gelernter goes on political tangents. I don't think this was really true. He did go on a few tangents, but some of them weren't political. The grading was arbitrary and capricious as well. When I decided to take this class, I assumed that all of the people who were complaining about the grading were CS majors who are bad at writing. This class truly is graded very harshly. In general I think when reviews say \"oh grading is so harsh\" that is nonsense, i.e. Shelly Kagan classes are not actually graded this harshly. In this case, be warned. BE WARNED!!!!",
    "If work hard and do a lot of thinking about the assignments, you will definitely improve your writing significantly. The topics covered in class are very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who struggles to write long papers and likes to think about very complicated questions.",
    "The class was based on very few grades and it was also extremely unorganized. The professor had a very detailed syllabus to begin the year and ended up getting through about half of it. This was very disappointing because I entered the class very much looking forward to some of the readings towards the end.

The material to the class is very interesting, but I don't think taking this class was worth it. Very tough to get a good grade and please the professor, at least in my experiences. Maybe someone else cracked him and gave him what he wants.",
    "The course itself is great, but the professor is not. He likes a very peculiar style of writing (which is fine), but does not bother to help his students understand how they can write well in this style, leading to a lot of confused and helpless students who, even if they try to seek his help, will not be helped in any sufficient manner. Even as someone who likes writing concise pieces, I found it extremely confusing when he would change \"sentiment\" to \"feeling\" in one part of my essay and then \"feeling\" to \"thought\" in another part with the idea that that somehow produced brevity. I had an extremely difficult time finding the right phrasing for things, and when I contacted him for help, he did not bother to explain anything to me, then did not respond to my next two follow-up emails. I could go on and on about reasons I do not recommend this course (it moves at an incredibly slow pace, it does not encourage student participation at all), but this is the gist of it.",
    "Definitely. It is a must-take for anyone who is interested in Computationalism\/anti-Computationalism or AI in general. Beyond these topics, the class also touched on many other humanities areas.",
    "Yes. The material is very interesting, and Professor Gelernter has a deep understanding of the material. A good course to help improve your writing."
