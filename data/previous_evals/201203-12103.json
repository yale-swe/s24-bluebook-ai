    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student - Italian is a beautiful language that's fun to learn and Michael is an AWESOME professor.",
    "yes.",
    "The Italian Department is easily the chillest language department at Yale. They could make Italian really difficult because almost everything is irregular, but they do a good job keeping L1 both manageable and fun. The professors are extremely casual and friendly, and the tests and workload are not bad at all. Definitely a good choice if you are looking to fulfill your language requirement.",
    "Take it with Michael!",
    "Italian is a great department at yale and I would definitely recommend it. If you take italian make sure to take it with Michael Farina.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend Italian 110 to another student interested in beginning Italian. You'll learn so much in a relatively short period of time and the entire Italian department is great!",
    "Learning italian... about 100 new words each day... pace is fast... but you do learn very quickly.",
    "If asked to summarize Italian 110 for a fellow student, I would explain that this course provides a rigorous and comprehensive introduction to the Italian language. After just four months of study, students leaving the course will probably be amazed at how much grammar and vocabulary they were introduced to. That said, any comprehensive and satisfying course naturally demands some input on the student's part, and this class will be work. Students should expect to study daily, especially when trying to master complex topics like irregular verb tenses. Nonetheless, the workload is reasonable and definitely manageable. At the end of the semester, students will leave with a firm foundation for the Italian language and an enthusiasm for continued study.I would, therefore, definitely recommend this course to another student, and would especially suggest taking it with Prof. Farina, if possible. Prof. Farina incorporates effective teaching methods into the classroom and his daily quizzes ensure that students stay on top of their own studies. Most of all, though, Prof. Farina's enthusiasm and passion for Italian will inevitably rub off on and motivate his students to continue their study of the language. Any student who wants to open a new window in their life and receive a comprehensive introduction to a beautiful language should definitely take this course!",
    "L1 Italian is a great first language to pick up in college if you've never studied a spoken language before. Definitely take the class with Michael Farina if you can. He might seem a little tough in the beginning and warning, there are daily quizzes, but you really get to know the material. I'm looking forward to continuing my study of Italian.",
    "Italian 110 was an excellent introduction to Italian that is vigorous without being excessive. Quizzes are helpful for memorizing vocabulary, and class each day has a main idea that is well covered. Overall, it is an excellent class that i would recommend to fellow students seeking to learn a new language."
