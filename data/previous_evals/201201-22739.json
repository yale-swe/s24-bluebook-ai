    "You're probably only going to be taking 390 if you have to as a Classics major, but this doesn't mean this is a bad class. Your Latin will improve immensely and you will feel that you have a far greater understanding of the language, and of language development in general, as a result of the class and from Prof. Solodow's little asides. Yes, it's at 9am, which is a bit brutal, and yes, it's a huge amount of work that requires a lot of attention to detail and effort, but I would say that it's been one of the most concrete and rewarding learning experiences I've had at Yale, even if it can be painful\/mildly traumatic at times.",
    "It is, for the most part, a Latin prose composition class. The translations are difficult and often use several idioms that you have to just look up in the back of the book, but they also improve your knowledge of the grammar dramatically. I would recommend it, but it is a lot of work.",
    "There are reasons to take this course beyond the fact that it is required for Classics majors. Writing Latin, even if you don't find it inherently interesting, will help you read Latin better and give you a better grasp on Latin grammar and syntax. The workload is reasonable and fair."
