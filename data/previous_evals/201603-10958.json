    "In GLBL 121, we learned many of the statistical methods for the social sciences. This course is extremely applicable to many jobs, in which data analysis is required. From basic descriptive statistics in the beginning to multiple regression at the end of the term, this course allows an individual to grow in their knowledge of statistics.",
    "Basic statistical skills and ways of interpreting data",
    "I learned the basics of statistics and regression, along with how to use STATA.",
    "I learned descriptive stats, comparison of groups, significance tests, and regressions",
    "I learned about how to conduct meaningful statistical calculations and about being a knowledgeable consumer of data. I am now proficient in Stata and the overall language of statistics.",
    "I think that this course is very important and applicable to a lot of potential jobs and fields of work. However, I also feel like this is a course that I came out of feeling like a knew a lot but also very little at the same time paradoxically. I feel like now I could do statistical analyses and use stata is I had some help, but I'm not really comfortable doing it on my own.",
    "I had never taken stats before. JT really breaks it down for you",
    "knowledge of statistical methods, inference, significance tests, regression, STATA",
    "Introductory statistics. Learned valuable and widely applicable skills to enable better analysis of academic studies.",
    "A thorough understanding of the statistical techniques needed to conduct and comprehend social science research. I truly feel like I learned so much! Professor Thomas totally fulfilled his goal of making us informed readers of research.",
    "AQA was a thorough and complete course about statistics and its application in multivariate regression. I feel that I have developed both a theoretical and practical understanding of statistics.",
    "The class provided a good introduction to both Stata and statistical concepts to aid students for future engagement with the subject material.",
    "Stats! General survey: regression, inferential stats.",
    "I learned so much in this class. For the first time, I feel like I can read and understand stats, tables, regressions, etc. when I see them in research papers. I walked away from this course feeling like I actually learned so much information that could be useful to me later in life.",
    "I learned Statistics and time management. I've never taken a Statistics course before, so I gained a lot of skills in reading data and that kind of stuff.",
    "Great introduction to integral concepts in statistics such as hypothesis testing and regression, as well as to using the computer program Stata.",
    "I learned about the different ways to interpret and analyze data and the strengths and weaknesses of different methods.",
    "I gained an ability to analyze and evaluate statistics as well as to use Stata software. This is an incredibly useful course for anyone.",
    "After taking this course, I gained a solid background in statistical analysis for the social sciences. This is an extremely applicable course, and I learned much about how to analyze statistics given in political science publications and journals, as well as how to use STATA, a data analysis software.",
    "use of stata, introduction to statistical analysis and policy",
    "I learned how to use basic statistical methods to analyze data, charts and tables in political science articles, and the software STATA. The class is pretty fundamental if you plan on going into public policy.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of statistics. I also learned how to critically evaluate other research, and how to use the fundamentals of Stata. Most importantly, I learned why statistics is important and the space that is open in the field.",
    "I learned how to use the appropriate statistical tests to evaluate data.",
    "This was a great class for understanding research based statistics, you really learn math in an environment that encourages you to understand how that math is being applied. You learn the theoretics behind the calculations.",
    "I developed strong basic skills to study problems in the social sciences with statistical approaches.",
    "So much!!!! I learned important skills in statistics, such as confidence intervals, significance tests, regressions, etc. I also loved that we learned intro level Stata. And beyond the simple equations, I appreciated that we had to understand the theory behind the math and then apply to real world situations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very good and does not need to be improved.",
    "Review of p sets and posting of p set answers",
    "This is overall a fantastic course. I would only recommend that the easier material at the beginning of the semester be condensed so that we can spend more time on the harder material (i.e. regressions) at the end of the semester. I felt the class became a bit rushed in the final few lectures.",
    "This is a pretty solid intro stats course. I took it so that I could maybe do the data analysis course. I think the course could have less interaction with the students, I found that since we were constantly being interrupted by questions, I would get lost in the course of the lecture itself.",
    "Strengths: Organized class, incredibly fun and engaging lectures, covered plenty of information in a clear and understandable way. Weaknesses: none",
    "The 1.25 hour lecture is absolutely brutal. I realized later on in the course that this was one of the more interesting statistics courses (when I started reading the book-->and then everything made sense), but the dragging on of the lectures makes you not want to do the reading. I think that there is too much guessing and room for inference from the students. I believe that things could be gone over more quickly if answers and concepts were just given out without the need for students to dance around and guess at conceptual and theoretical questions for hours at a time. In other words, I really like Professor Thomas' lecture style, but because he sometimes doesn't teach concepts directly and has students guess at it, the concepts become more difficult and messy in student notebooks when they could be defined concisely and clearly.",
    "Strengths: problem sets are fair and helpful, Professor Thomas is a wonderful professor, midterm and final are challenging but fair.",
    "Not sure how it could be improved honestly. Professor Thomas takes the world's most boring material and makes it interesting. The class's excellence is firmly grounded on his talent as a lecturer.",
    "Professor Thomas' lecture style was so good it made stats interesting and engaging. I actually wanted to go to lecture, which had never happened before for a quantitative reasoning class for me (the Life and Times stories helped a lot!). Only improvement I could recommend would be to actually read and analyze research papers in the psets but I understand there might not be time for that in one semester.",
    "The strengths are without a doubt the professor and the fact that the slides are very clear and helpful. The professor always takes the time to explain everything thoroughly and is readily available to answer questions. The main weakness was section, as the T.A.'s did not seem to be on top of the material and sometimes made things even more confusing.",
    "The biggest strength of this class was Professor Justin Thomas. He brought such joy to class and made everyday as engaging as possible. The problem sets were reasonable and the exams were manageable. The class moved a *bit* slowly, but this was due to the Professor's love of answering students questions rather than overall pacing. His ability to answer questions was very helpful for a lot of students, but I personally wish we could have covered a bit more material.",
    "Professor Thomas is a major strength of this course, given his humor and engaging lecture style which breathes some much needed warmth into the subject of statistics. I think the course could be improved by creating a clearer link between the TF sections and lecture. The TF sections were driven largely by Stata concepts which are not tested on in exams, and were primarly used for 1 question on the problem set each week. There seemed to be a disconnect from sections and lecture that was sometimes bridged by TFs reviewing class concepts, which proved to be extremely helpful. Perhaps if there was an optional review section at the end of the week, unrelated to Stata, it would help to solidify lecture concepts even more.",
    "Strengths: well-organized, not too hard, interesting problem sets, great set of peers.",
    "A strength of this course is Professor Thomas. Hands down he is one of the best professors I have ever had during my time at Yale. He is kind, brilliant, and very accessible. He is always willing to help you and make time to ensure you understand the material. I looked forward to class-- his stories at the beginning and enthusiasm throughout made me want to be there and keep learning. The problem sets and tests were also incredibly fair. I have a hard time finding a weakness of this course.",
    "There were no major weaknesses of the course, but I did feel that the speed of each lecture was inconsistent. It was sometimes too slow or too fast. But overall, it was a great class, Professor Thomas is super engaging and the TAs were very helpful!",
    "This course is incredible. Professor Thomas is a great teacher and makes what is often a dull subject very enjoyable through his charisma and grasp of the subject matter. He is able to keep an entire room of students captivated on applied statistics. It seems like we did not cover everything we set out to cover, so it could be improved through increased or improved pacing, but other than that the class was great.",
    "The lectures were excellent and always easy to follow.",
    "Justin Thomas is a great professor. He's personable and kind, and really cares about his students. The lecture material is a little dry, but he does his best to make lecture interesting. I honestly don't think this course requires such a huge time block, which includes two 1 hour 15 minute lectures, as well as weekly section. Other than that, more case studies and applications of statistical material in class would help to keep the class more engaged.",
    "the class helped us feel like we were in a real world scenario during problem sets, especially when we used actual data; engaging lecture course and well-prepared material; focus on understanding how to interpret statistics instead of just doing the math",
    "This course's strength is Professor Thomas who is very personable and one of the most enjoyable professors I've had. Its weakness is the number of assumptions we are forced to accept when moving through some of the material. There were times I felt confused behind the intrinsic reasoning behind some of the methodology we were using, though perhaps it was for the best it wasn't explained to us? The class moves quickly so there isn't much time to question what you're learning.",
    "The greatest strength of this class is Justin Thomas. He makes material that could otherwise be boring incredibly accessible. Furthermore, for students interested in policy, he relates all the material to real decisions we could be making in the future. I so appreciate Professor Thomas taking the time to give great advice and getting to know us throughout the term. This course is also strong in that it places an emphasis on truly understanding the concepts, rather than just regurgitating information or plugging and chugging through a problem set. Lastly, I think the course is strong in that Professor Thomas makes sure to engage students along the way. I was amazed at the amount of students that went to lecture every class, as compared to other similar classes. If anything could be improved about the course, I wish we could cover a bit more or go a bit faster. Although I appreciated how thorough Professor Thomas was in teaching the material, I think we're capable of learning a bit more quickly to get through more information.",
    "You are exposed to everything you need to know, one way or another. In other words you are given all the tools to succeed if you put in the work.",
    "The strength of the course is that it prepares you really well with the fundamentals of statistics and the instructor makes sure that everybody in the class has a thorough understanding of the material. The resulting weakness is that the course does not go to higher level or more complicated statistical materials. By the end of the class I can understand about 70% of the statistical methods and illustrations in academic papers, but am not confident that I have the skills to conduct such research with my knowledge on stats.",
    "Strengths: JT is AMAZING! The course moves at a good pace -- not too fast or too slow. Topics felt well explained and comfortable before moving on to the next. Problem sets were challenging but doable -- very fair. I feel that Stata added a lot. And I loved how applied and real world it felt. I love that on problem sets, we didn't just have to find a statistic and confidence interval, but then had to \"advise the mayor\" on policy based on data. Weaknesses: Cant think of many -- overall, really wonderful class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to other students because not only does it give you a better understanding of statistics, but it is also not an extraordinarily difficult quantitative reasoning class. For global majors, this course is perfect. I would also encourage others who are looking for an easier QR course to consider GLBL 121.",
    "yes",
    "This is basically AP Statistics taught by a fantastic professor. Take this course if you want a strong introduction to statistics or if you have to for the Global major, but there is no reason to take it if you took AP Stats in high school. Professor Thomas is amazing and makes class interesting and engaging. Problem sets every one or two weeks and a reasonable midterm and final. Overall a great course.",
    "Yes take this course. Professor Thomas is great and he will make learning stats much more enjoyable.",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in statistics of any sort. This class will teach the essentials for making statistical inference, conducting calculations, and using software. Professor Justin Thomas will truly invest himself in your learning, and you will certainly learn plenty. It was an amazing course that restored my confidence in my quantitative skills.",
    "I'm not a Global Affairs major, and I believed that this would be a good QR that would give me an applicable skill. I do believe that the last part is true: it was a good QR credit that wasn't very difficult, and I did learn a new skill. However, there are other more fun and interesting ways to fulfill a QR credit without walking almost to science hill.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only does Professor Thomas do a fantastic job of teaching the material, but he also does so in an entertaining yet instructive way. The concepts and course work are highly practical, and you finish the semester with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of statistics. However, what makes this course unique is that it is more than a simple teaching of \"plug-and-chug\" statistical tests. AQA forces students to understand how these methods work and why they are able to apply them. I think that sets this course apart from any other introductory statistics course.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who want to better understand statistical analysis, whether for reading scholarly papers or for conducting their own research.",
    "Take this IF IT IS WITH PROFESSOR THOMAS. JT makes this course enjoyable, I could not imagine learning this material with a boring professor.",
    "Definitely take this course with Justin Thomas!!! He is a GOD in lectures and is so interesting to listen to (even if its stats like, weird, I know). Requisite for GLBL but I'd strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in social science research.",
    "100% recommend. Not only for Global Affairs majors but also for those looking for a QR credit. I have learnt a lot of useful skills.",
    "AQA is an excellent course. Whether you're a global affairs major or just someone looking to take an intro-level stats class, I would highly recommend this class. It has a fairly low workload, manageable exams, and I left with a strong foundation in statistics. Professor Thomas is the one the best professor I've had at Yale - definitely, if you have the chance, get to know him!!",
    "The majority of students taking this class are doing so for their major (see: prospective and current Global Affairs majors), so they likely don't need a recommendation for the course as they are taking it anyways. Professor Thomas is engaging and hilarious as a lecturer, but the subject material is rather dull and grows repetitive, so it still may be difficult to concentrate. The course itself is a good introduction to statistics and provides students with the tools to delve deeper into Stata or statistics in the future.",
    "Really tries to engage. As interesting as intro stats can be probably. Still can get pretty dull though just based on the material.",
    "Intro for GLBL but great for anyone who wants a friendly introduction to statistics.",
    "I would take this course if you are interested in the GLBL major or if you are looking at a different social science major for which it might be helpful to have stats. I wouldn't take this as a QR credit -- there are much better classes that could fill that requirement.",
    "Professor Thomas makes this class incredible. While the material is difficult and the psets tend to be hard and long, Professor Thomas will make it worth it. He is incredibly kind and enthusiastic and will make you look forward to class. He is also is always willing to meet with you to go over things you don't understand. Few professors are as great as him. My advice for this course: keep a good attitude, ask for help if you don't understand, and work hard. It will be worth it and you'll have some fun along the way (Professor Thomas is hilarious and so so fun).",
    "If you're trying to get a QR out of the way, this is definitely the course you can take. Professor Thomas is great and patient, and if you actually do the work, it makes sense.",
    "Yes! This is a good QR for someone who is not so confident in the number world. It is also a good class for anyone interested in the data side of policy research.",
    "Absolutely. I would recommend this class to each and every student at Yale as long as Professor Thomas keeps teaching it.",
    "100% great course. Stats is a good QR: relevant and very geared towards those that consider themselves more of humanities people.",
    "GLBL 121 is a very useful and painless intro to some basic concepts of statistics, and to the software Stata. Professor Thomas' lectures are always engaging. For those who are a bit hesitant to take this course, you shouldn't be: if you're willing to put in the effort, this course is very rewarding.",
    "This is a required class for all Global Affairs majors, and I would recommend this course to those majoring in the social sciences. The skills learned in this class, although a little dry, are very applicable in future internships and in other classes. The workload for this class is quite manageable, and is a good class to take to fulfill a QR credit.",
    "i would recommend to a student even if they aren't doing global; would recommend over intro stats courses because it was engaging and interesting, and stata seems more useful than SPSS",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in an intro statistics course with by far the best learning environment and professor you're bound to get in similar classes.",
    "I would recommend the course, both because it's required for Global and is a pre-req for many graduate schools, but also because it's good knowledge to have going into the professional world.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you have no experience with statistics and are interested in policy or public affairs. Professor Thomas is the best of the best -- not only is he a leading researcher in his field, but he makes the material incredibly accessible. He's fun, approachable, and also is so willing to give advice outside of class. At the same time, the course is indeed rigorous, and I think I learned more than my friends who took classes like the Stats 101 course.",
    "This is a great course to get a basic overview of statistics with a social science focus. I especially enjoyed learning to use Stata to digest large data sets. Very useful skills.",
    "I would recommend this course. The work load is manageable but that being said you do have to do the work. JT is also a great instructor and he wants everyone to succeed.",
    "Justin is a wonderful lecturer and you should all take it!!!",
    "YES!!! Even if you don't gravitate towards math\/statistics as I hadn't, Professor Thomas will make you love the course! He is an amazing professor, who clearly explains complex theories and equations. I actually looked forward to going to class every day. I also find it much more interesting than most math classes because it has a real world aspect to it."
