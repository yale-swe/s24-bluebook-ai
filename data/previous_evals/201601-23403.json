    "The course was interesting, and talked about many analytical methods. Because we talked about a lot of material that was new to me in the semester, things were a little all over the place. But it was an enjoyable course.",
    "This course covers important topics in statistical genetics. However, I often felt that the statistics were not adequately explained, and I would have prefered to finish this course with a better fundamental understanding of the statistical methods. This issue had many sides to it: the topics were not always fully explained in lecture; the lecture slides available online are not self explanatory so reviewing them after class is difficult; and there was insufficient support for help with homeworks, which otherwise could have been useful exercises in understanding the material. When I sought help on the homework, I was told more than once that I couldn't have a certain thing explained to me because it would give away the answer. In a graduate level course, I would expect the emphasis to be on learning and understanding the material and not the evaluation. Overall, I could have learned more from this course if the lectures had a different structure and the course put more of a focus on teaching rather than testing students.",
    "I need more basic concepts preparation for the biology terms. Either a brief explanation in class or some relevant reading materials would be helpful.",
    "This course beyonds my expectation. It's very helpful for beginner in genetics."

    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Dr. Zhao is an expert in the material.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Professor Zhao explains some topics very well but glazes over others. This was especially difficult at times because the lectures, posted online, don't have adequate information to review on their own. Clearer lecture material and more resources would help."

   "comments": [
    "Dr. Zhao knows the material too well which also means he talks really quickly through some of them. I liked some of the homework assignments that involved doing an analysis on a dataset, but I liked the ones that involves proving equations less.",
    "This course covers important topics in statistical genetics, and students pursuing those topics in their research should take this course. However, as I pointed out above, the teaching and structure of this course could be improved. The work load is relatively light, though this had a trade-off with some topics being only lightly covered and explained."
