    "It is a very time consuming class, but if you enjoy drawing it is definitely a fun one to take. Yes, homeworks could take a while (4 hours or so) but you can treat drawing homework as a break from your other work. It is also messy and the drawing supplies are cumbersome, but you get used to it. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest to get better at drawing, and Marie is a good person to take this class with.",
    "absolutely. It teaches you to focus.",
    "This class is fun to take and I would recommend it, although it is, in fact, very basic. We start with the most simple concepts which allows you to rethink your style and try new things. However, we spent the majority of the class only using newsprint and charcoal.",
    "This is a fun, low-stress drawing class. Marie is really nice and I think all levels of artists are welcome. You draw in class every week and have a weekly assignment that takes 4 hours or so, with a little bit more time spent towards the end of the semester.",
    "This class is actually a lot of work. Don't take it lightly. If you are interested in pursuing the art major then this is definitely a good place to start, but If you just want to draw, try taking the class credit fail.",
    "If you like Art and have only thought about it as a hobby, please do give this class a chance. It might change your entire life and make you reconsider your life's decisions. It did exactly that for me! Marie is a GREAT professor and I don't think this experience would have been the same for me if it wasn't for her. However, I would not recommend this class to someone who has zero drawing skills because they'll get frustrated by the workload pretty soon. It's all about enjoying what you do. And you can only truly do that if you have some skills. I'm now considering Art along with a STEM major. That's how big a difference this class made in my life."
