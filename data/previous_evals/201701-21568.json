    "skills for my particular research project, i.e. condensed matter theory. various different techniques\/methods and thinking paradigms related to topological superconductors.",
    "I've learned how to better manage my time, how to communicate with other people in my lab, and how to better explain my research through writing and presentations. I've also developed some practical skills in a lab setting.",
    "You get out as much as you put in for whichever research project you choose.",
    "This course, more than any at Yale, has shown me that I want to go to graduate school. Its so cool to get to explore new\/open questions and just have kind of your own specialty. It also really taught me time management, especially b\/c I was working a lot on my own.",
    "Great research skills overall. Cool to see how research is done in practice and what it means.",
    "I learned a great deal about independent research and problem solving, how to ask for help in productive ways, how I learn best on my own. I learned a great deal about quantum computing and optics also.",
    "I gained experience working on research on a specific field and coming up with and trying solutions.",
    "From my experience in Karsten Heeger's lab, second semester: I learned practical laboratory skills, learned about conducting research and putting together a technical report."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "More feedback during the semester-- it sometimes felt like I was totally on my own and unsupervised.",
    "strength: go at your own pace, explore something that interests you, experience what research is like. weaknesses: none really...depends on who you have as an advisor.",
    "I don't think there were any weaknesses. Prof. Moore was absolutely great and organized, which made everything simpler. This course was much better and much more organized with him than it was with other professors in previous semesters.",
    "I liked the independence this class gives you to explore the physics research topic of your choice.",
    "This course is pretty dependent on your adviser, so you should choose wisely! But regardless the structure of the course is pretty lenient and allows for students and their advisers to work at the pace most comfortable to them while also doing what is necessary to complete the course. There isnt really any feedback from Prof. Moore until the very end so that might be nice but otherwise great course, well organized, and perfectly structured for the myriad of student\/afvoser pairs that are part of it.",
    "It is very decentralized, and the whole structure is basically up to the professor. I would perhaps suggest some information was sent to the professors, i.e. encouraging them to meet with their students one on one at least for an hour biweekly, encouraging them to find projects that could be original and not just mindless assisting in a lab, and any other tips and course structures the department has realized will give a good experience for the students.",
    "The course is very well structured! Maybe put more pressure on advisors to be more involved in the reports. A handout or more instruction and feedback on the midterm report and final presentation\/report would be useful too, I wasn't sure what was expected and how to improve.",
    "It was a nice experience doing research with a few deadlines that require you to reflect and consider where you are more carefully. It was also very helpful to be able to seek advice from and hear the opinion of an supervisor during the process.",
    "The great thing about this course is the level of freedom we have to pursue whatever research we want. The proposal, midterm paper, and final report keep us on track without burdening us. Great. The only weakness is that it is mostly accessible to people who seek out research on their own. Some more resources on the physics labs at Yale that are ready and willing to take undergrads would be great. (and I know it has started already)"

   "comments": [
    "Physics 472 is excellent in that it allows one to receive course credit for one's research and gain experience with giving semi-formal presentations.",
    "you have to take it if you're in it, probably. pick advisor wisely and be prepared to put in 8-12 hours a week in order to actually get anything done, especially if it's a one semester project. don't procrastinate and pick a day or two each week to focus on it. quality depends on your advisor and topic.",
    "Pretty relaxed credit, depending on your advisor, but certainly useful and necessary if you want to continue in the field.",
    "it's essential for a career in physics research. take it and explore something interesting.",
    "research for credit is a great balance to an otherwise p-set heavy curriculum. I enjoyed it a lot because I got to focus on a niche branch of physics, and get a good understanding of the day to day of research in that branch. I wish I'd started doing research for credit sooner.",
    "Yes! I mean, if you're a physics major, starting to take research for credit as a junior is ideal. Also, David Moore was just the best professor I've ever had leading this course! He was responsive to students and always made himself available, which is something I had not seen any of the other instructors do in this course in previous semesters. He was incredibly organized. He distributed our presentation schedules to the entire department, and so it was much easier to communicate with my PI and my lab about it. The way he organized the presentations schedule was much better than in previous semesters, when we would rush to a doodle poll to make sure that we didn't get bad time slots. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but he seems to have scheduled students with the same advisor in sequence, which made it easier for professors and lab members to attend our talks. He also seems to have tried to keep a gender balance in all of the presentation days, with all of the women in the course evenly split among the three days of presentation, which I really did appreciate. Overall, this course could not have been better than it was this semester, mostly because of the instructor. I should also say that your lab experience and other aspects of the course will vary a lot depending on your advisor and research area.",
    "Required for the physics major so yes!",
    "Yes defibitely! And if possible take it earlier rather than later--i wish I could have done more than 2 semesters",
    "Its cool to learn how a research group works and how original research is done. Do make sure you get a professor you resonate with on a personal level, not just that has an interesting topic. As most people will probably mostly interact with a postdoc and not the professor, I would suggest you still take initiative to meet up with your professor a couple times throughout the semester to update and get feedback on how your project is going.",
    "Research for credit is a lot of fun! Find a good mentor and make sure you have a solid plan though, it is hard to finish a project in a semester.",
    "Consider taking the course, if you are interested in doing research and want to consistently spend time with it. The course is well organized and it was also very helpful to discuss the project with Prof. Moore.",
    "Yes, if you want to do physics research!"
