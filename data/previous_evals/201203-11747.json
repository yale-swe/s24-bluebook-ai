   "comments": [
    "A great way for undergraduate musicians to stay active as performers at Yale College.",
    "Yes. If you're a good enough musician and you want a chill class, this is probably it for you. You can make it whatever you want to make it, and you don't have to rehearse all that often since a whole semester of time is definitely enough for you to make a piece at performance level.",
    "Performance of chamber music is a great way to experience music with new friends! Take this course as the instruction is first tier and the workload is fair.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Music 220 to another student. It was an amazing experience and I am lucky to have had this opportunity",
    "YES. If you like chamber music and are a skilled player you have to take the class.",
    "Yes take it if you love chamber music! It's a bit of a time commitment, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "If you have a preformed group, it can be a lot of fun and you will become much closer to your chamber group members. The final performance at the end of the semester is also a lot of fun.",
    "You audition at the beginning of the semester, your group is chosen for you, then you have two hours of rehearsal per week and one hour of coaching, plus studio classes every two or three weeks.I would highly recommend this course to any student that likes chamber music.",
    "Good class if you want to continue playing an instrument at a high level but not have too much of a commitment. Coaches are helpful and overall the class is pretty fun.",
    "This course is a great chance to improve your chamber music skills with some of the best musicians at Yale and to be coached by great professors and grad students.",
    "If you are a performing musician on campus I highly recommend adding this course onto your schedule (and auditioning). It really brings out the best aspects of chamber music.",
    "It's a good class to keep up instrumental skills. However, don't expect to learn too much from the experience. It simply makes you practice music with a group of great people!",
    "This is a good opportunity to play chamber music in a focused, but not overwhelmingly intense way. If you have a chamber group, take the class! My only concern is the lack of wind coaches (at least my year).",
    "Absolutely",
    "Take it if you can! Probably the best (well, only) way to get organized chamber music experience, along with coachings, as an undergraduate. The rehearsals (2 hours a week) and coachings (1 hours a week) are all scheduled on your own or with consultation with your coach, so it doesn't feel like a lot of work at all, even though obviously it is only for a half credit. Everyone in the class seemed talented and committed to the class, so overall a really good experience.",
    "A great opportunity to play great music with other students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student with prior chamber music experience, as other group members are likely to have had this experience and will benefit more from similarly experienced peers.",
    "If you are interested in playing chamber music here at Yale, I would absolutely recommend this class! The coaches are very good and the time commitment is very low. Besides occasional mandatory attendance at recitals, between coaching and outside rehearsal you will probably only have to put in 3-4 hours into this class a week. Be aware that you commit to two semesters, though. Also note that this class is retakeable as many times as you like! Great for stocking up on credits!",
    "I would definitely recommend Chamber Music class."
