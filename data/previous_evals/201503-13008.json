    "Dance Theater is an amazing class. Emily Coates is smart, caring, and passionate about dance. She is able to get people from a range of backgrounds interested in the history and practice of expression through movement. I didn't come to the class with a background in dance, but never felt like I was at a disadvantage. The sense you get from the class is that everyone has life experience that contributes to their movement vocabularies and that all forms of movement are valid. The class is also amazing because, unlike most other classes at Yale, you get to move around!",
    "Such an interesting course! I'm really glad its open to dancers of all levels. I learned so much more than I imagined I would. Professor Coates is amazing, talented and so so supportive! Most of class time is \"movement research\", along with guest teachers and there are two writing assignments to turn in. I really enjoyed working on both. The format for writing is determined by you. Really adds to the classroom experience. The final project is super enjoyable too because you get to explore a topic of your choice and develop choreography for it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in thinking with their bodies and exploring movement as a form of research.",
    "Dance Theater was a decent overview of the most influential choreographic approaches in avant-garde dance in the last 50 years. You will not have a chance to deepen in something that you like, unfortunately, which makes the development of the final project sometimes complicated. Ultimately, I recommend the class as a means by which to explore the discussions of identity, interculturalism, body politics by means of performance. This is a class that will push your thinking and practice to another level.",
    "Survey of various choreographers\/approaches to dance theatre from 1950 to present. Never get too in depth with any single style, but you get a general sense as to what the landscape is, and can hone your choreographic eye and work in depth on a final project (do it as a partner project!) Recommend for dancers and non-dancers alike."
