   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course, but I would do so less for the material taught than for the experience of hearing Prof. Bloom talk about his experiences in literary study and life, with the occasional interesting insight into the plays.",
    "A classmate of mine compared this course to \"high stakes book club,\" which I find an incredibly apt description. The class expects that you will read and engage with the text on a deep intellectual level, and discussions incorporate both a reverence for and an investigation of the text on every level. Class is ordinarily structured around read-alouds of different scenes, followed by open discussion and cold-calling. You will stay on your toes, but Bloom creates an environment where every answer will be taken on its own merit, and he will push you to expand your ideas and your means of communicating. The fact that there are always cookies on the table and a tea kettle on the stove completes the picturesque experience of this class.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. Bloom is a lovely man, and he is still completely brilliant. Listening to him talk about Shakespeare is amazing. There's 1 or 2 plays every week, which feels like a lot at first but gets a lot easier the more you read. Our class only had 2 8-10 page papers. You're only at Yale once-- take the opportunity to study with Bloom, if you can.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you get in. It's such a different experience than my other seminars, and there's no better way, imho, to learn Shakespeare than to do it by reading it aloud and discussing it with Professor Bloom.",
    "Definitely more of an experience than a class, but a decidedly good one."
