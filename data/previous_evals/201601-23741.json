   "comments": [
    "Professor Sadeghian is wonderful, she is always so willing to help her students and offers very interesting insights.",
    "Not sure",
    "Absolutely. There is not a better professor than Professor Sadeghian and she really makes you feel like you can engage in the material. It is a safe academic learning environment where you can talk about anything and know judgement is passed for misunderstanding such sensitive topics. The material is interesting and engaging; for example, one week, you look at a documentary on transexuals in modern day Iran; the material is interesting and so important to the changing world and she covers it with grace and in a way that you take a ton from the class. Her classes are constantly the best things I have taken at Yale.",
    "This is a great course that covers a broad range of very interesting topics relating to gender\/gender identity and sexuality in the history of the Middle East. The course does jump around quite a bit, but if you don't know much about gender and sexuality in Middle Eastern history (like I did coming in) it's a very good survey of some various important subjects. Professor Sadeghian is fantastic and kind and great about helping you and accommodating for you when you need it.",
    "The course gave me an extensive and profound view of all the challenges and opportunities of the Middle East region. I would highly recommend the course, no matter what of the student's background or career interests may be. It adds significant value to you in an individual basis as well as a professional one, and keeps you interested and motivated throughout.",
    "Readings were usually very interesting, so was the info Saghar brought to class. However class discussion was often stilted, maybe that was just the group of people in the seminar this semester.",
    "We learn about the role of women and sexuality in Iran, Pakistan and Iraq primarily. It's such a fascinating class that I'm sure many will enjoy. I feel like my western viewpoint has been challenged, and I've thoroughly enjoyed that.",
    "A great course if you want to know about gender in Iran and the changes that happened there throughout the years.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially to anyone interested in gender\/sexuality studies or Middle Eastern society. I felt like I gained a lot of knowledge as well as research skills from doing the final project. The readings are engaging and the material lends itself well to discussions. This is also a good seminar for those who have not taken many seminars\/paper-based classes before, since it sort of eases you into both structures."
