    "I learned how to engage with the modern tradition of social thinking, and also how to think and understand the complex development of social thought.",
    "I gained an incredible amount of knowledge on some of the most important thinkers in philosophy. I learned how different historical moments affected their work. I learned how to trace the question of the self, the nature of man, of freedom throughout different works. I learned different frameworks for thinking about the world.",
    "I developed skills to better analyze interdisciplinary philosophical texts. I gained insights into the trajectory of modern social theory and thought.",
    "This class is a very good snapshot of classics in the Western cannon. The material toward the end of term can be tricky to understand (re: Hegel) but the class focuses on the epistemic development of philosophy so everything in the end fits together.",
    "Critical thinking ability, new world perspective, fundamental knowledge of philosophy, writing skills"

    "Excellent, well organized course. Professor Leslie was great at bringing excitement and knowledge to the course, while letting us engage with ideas that were interesting. He provided a lot of background and information that I found tremendously useful, and balanced speaking\/letting us have discussion quite well. Overall, an excellent course. I imagine the course could be a tad difficult at the beginning without previous philosophy experience, but Professor Leslie was extremely available outside of class to help.",
    "This course was amazing as it was! I think Professor Leslie once stated this too--but the only way the course could be improved, in my opinion, is if it met twice a week instead of once. Class is usually more of a lecture with Professor Leslie running through a lot of material in the time allotted. We usually didn't get much of a chance to speak about the texts--but another day would be beneficial for solidifying what we've read and also discussing\/answering questions.",
    "This class was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. Showing up to seminar each week was one of the highlights of my week. This course gives a great foundation for modern social theory and philosophical texts in the fields of ethics, politics, and economics. The reading list was phenomenal, and the professor was always approachable and engaged.",
    "The strength of this class is the professor's teaching material, which organically links the philosophers together. But as an EPE major, I also hope to see more economics imbedded in the course reading.",
    "Fantastic teaching, great reading list, very comprehensive. Wish I had even more in class time."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Professor Leslie is incredible, and if he ever comes back to teach at Yale you should definitely take this class (or any of his classes). He really cares very deeply about teaching, and if you're someone who is a bit afraid of diving into the canon for lack of background, he's very supportive and will take you through the works with excellent speed. Also has fought to diversify the syllabus, which is incredible. I think this course gives you different lenses for thinking about the world, and if you put time into each of the thinkers we read, then you'll get a lot out of the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale, with a phenomenal reading list and an even more phenomenal professor. Seminar was always interesting and helped bring different aspects of the text to light in order to give students a better idea of the trajectory of modern social thought.",
    "This class is a requirement for EPE major and personally I think this is a good measure by which one can test if s\/he is really interested in EPE. But the class is heavily emphasizing the first two letters. The class assignments are very manageable.",
    "Yes absolutely. The professor was incredible and I learned how to think about the world in a new way. I developed a strong skill set to engage effectively with prominent intellectual ideas."
