    "Great reading and a fantastic group of students to discuss with.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The assignments were good but Professor Hartman was a terrible teacher. She spoke to us as if we were all in the fourth grade. She mostly assigned her NYT articles for reading, as if she had won a Pulitzer. And her feedback just wasn't substantive enough for a writing-intensive seminar. She'd make small wording\/grammar changes and then act as if you had submitted a truly pitiful piece of work. Maybe I have an axe to grind, but I found her teaching style to be objectively poor and self-congratulatory. Do not take this class."
