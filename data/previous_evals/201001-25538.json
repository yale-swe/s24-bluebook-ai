   "comments": [
    "Technical Examination of Art is a fun course about how science and history intersect in art historical research. The workload is not too bad, although some of the reading is pretty boring (at least all the science stuff.) The classes themselves were always interesting and hands-on, which went a long way in teaching us how to approach artworks from a conservation standpoint.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is very interesting and is different from most other courses. The work is manageable. The conservators who teach the class do a very good job.",
    "Weekly reading responses (1-2 pages) and a final paper\/project (you work on analyzing one work of art in the Yale Art Gallery and approach it from a conservator's standpoint). It's a great class to take to shake up the typical lecture-section art history class, and it's interesting to look at works from the eye of a conservator rather than a lecturer who acts as if each work of art is perfect. It sheds a different light on art history. Definitely take it if you're considering work in the museum world- either a curator or conservator. It's definitely applicable to those professions.",
    "You should try to take this class. It is interesting and will be different from the other classes you're taking.",
    "It's very interesting subject material, with an appropriate workload. Be ready to be confused for the first few weeks - you probably haven't thought about these issues much before, and most of the terms will probably be new to you. Also, if you're the kind of student who really likes to talk in seminar, this class may not be the best fit for you - there's limited opportunity for discussion and a lot more lecture. For the final project, you get to spend 4 or 5 weeks doing your own examination of an object. This is lots of fun! It definitely makes the frustrating first few weeks of class worth it. Overall I recommend it.",
    "The course is basically an introduction to the job of a curator, which is actually pretty cool and not something most people usually get to learn about. The class structure is pretty loose, so there is a lot of information coming at you with not a lot of indication of how much you are responsible for. In the end you are not responsible for that much, which leaves you free to explore the things that interest you the most.",
    "Yes.",
    "A course where you learn less about what the object means, and more about what the object IS. Great for filling in the holes about materials, history of objects, and connoisseurship.",
    "This class is not as good as the Visual Examination course. It is being worked out and it may end up being better, but it was more frustrating than fascinating, which is saying a lot since I am interested in conservation work.",
    "This is a fascinating class--once in a lifetime opportunity to work hands on with objects in the YUAG collection and with the conservators themselves. You will learn things you can't possibly learn in a book or a lecture hall and get to see things you'll see nowhere else. This class is a MUST take for art history majors.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course unless you are in the art history major, and even then, I was a bit disappointed. The class has the potential to be a great course, but it needs to be more organized and cohesive."
