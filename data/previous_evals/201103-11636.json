    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS EVER. take it take it. hard language very easy class. the pace is very slow and the work is very very manageable (30 min\/night if even). if you like languages, she will give you bonus material on the side if you want to go faster. KvK is the best!!",
    "I think Czech 110 is a great class that I would recommended to anyone at Yale. However it is important to know that although it is a level one language class a lot of linguists were in my class making the learning speed a little quicker.",
    "If you're serious about learning Czech, be warned that a lot of people who take this class are not. You will certainly learn the language, but you have to put a lot in to get a lot out. I love the Czech language, so if you think you can put up with a distractions, definitely take this class."
