    "It's an advanced course that has Syntax I as a prerequisite for understanding the topics in it. It is a great course to take if you're interested in learning Syntax, and reading some original literature in the most important topics that have been researched in the last 50 years. It will bring more questions than answers, which is always good if you want to do research in the future."
