   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Although many of my peers were less enthusiastic about the course than I, I found the material covered fascinating and extremely compelling. Professor Anderson is a wonderful instructor; his lessons are clear, his stage presence is soothing, and he is clearly well-versed in the subject matter.",
    "Yeah if you want to explore intro linguistics or you need a fun SO credit take this course.",
    "easy",
    "This class is not an easy A. I was hoping it would be a gut class, but the papers are actually a good amount of work. I took it credit\/d\/fail so I didn't have to worry about it as much but there are better classes out there.",
    "Do not take this class. It is not a fun elective. It is not an easy A. If you're looking for something you can skip all the time and have it literally not affect your grade at all, that is the only reason you should take this class. The notes are all in the textbook. The papers are graded harshly and the TAs will dock you 20% for one wrong fact. A class you will likely end up with a B in unless you put in a tremendous amount of work. If you're looking for a linguistics course or easy SO credit, I highly recommend LING 110: Intro with Ryan Bennett who is amazing and funny and you walk out actually feeling like you know something.",
    "Not very interesting, grading is pretty dependent on your TA. You don't have to go to class especially if you know someone there with notes or if you have the book.",
    "This class was pretty low key and so a welcome change of pace. However, there is not much oversight, so it's easy to fall behind and, if you do, you will not get a good grade.",
    "This class is a lot more work than you might expect. It doesn't seem a lot but if you are going for a decent grade (B+ and above) you have to put a lot of time into it. Do not take it if your schedule is heavy.",
    "A good class if the subject matter interests you. A two page essay assignment every two weeks, and a final 10 page research paper (with an optional take home exam\/book review instead). Relatively low workload, but you need to be on top of it if you want to get a fair grade.",
    "Only take it as a Cr\/D course.",
    "Yes, it was a really cool class where you get to learn about things that you wouldn't normally learn in other classes at Yale.",
    "It's a decent enough class. Not an enormous amount of work, reasonably interesting material, sort of dry lectures. It's a pretty average class.",
    "Linguistics 149 in a great introduction to animal communication. The class' pace is perfect - slow enough that the work is manageable, fast enough that the class is always exciting, and so well planned that you can always work ahead in the syllabus. The class not only taught me a lot about animal communication, but helped me better understand human language. I would definitely recommend to any student to take Linguistics 149.",
    "It's really interesting and I really liked it a lot. I am glad I took this because it turned out to be the fun highlight of a really terrible set of classes. Prof Anderson can appear boring during shopping period but LIES, ALL LIES and he's actually got a really interesting lecture style (and lecture has lots of videos of cute animals!) I did a total of two readings out of the<insert number far more than two> readings listed on the syllabus and I still think I did all right and I could keep up.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a really interesting and nonthreatening linguistics class. It's six 2 page papers (one every two weeks), one is dropped, and a final excercise, which is a ~10 page paper on either an animal of your choice and it's communication or a book review, or a take home final if that falls through.",
    "This class in terms of the work isn't that bad. There are 6 two-page essays (you get to drop the lowest one) and a final 10 page paper. The class itself though is really boring, which made it seem like a waste of time sometimes.",
    "This is a pretty boring class... lectures are dryer than the desert, and the class is pretty repetitive. The professor has a monotone that often put students in the class to sleep. The class is pure lecture, with NO input or participation on the part of the students. I would definitely shop it if you're considering taking it, because it is not for everyone. That said, the class does grow on you a bit, as well as the professor. The grading system is ridiculously easy: 6 short (two page) essays through the semester (the lowest of which is dropped) and then a final paper, all of which you can get ample help on. In order to make people come to class, they didn't post the lecture slides, so be aware that past comments regarding that may not be accurate. This is a good fifth class if you don't mind being bored, especially if you credit\/d it.",
    "It's not a bad fourth or fifth class. There are 6 essays of which you drop one and a final essay that is about 10 pages long. Prof. Anderson has mostly interesting lectures (it is on animals and how they communicate with each other after all), but some lectures, such as the ones on syntax, just are not all that interesting (but that's just my opinion). The major issue is grading discrepancy among the three TAs. Each essay (except for the final paper) is graded by one TA, then your next one is graded by a different TA. Therefore, my grades generally fluctuated around the high end of the grading scale, but I wasn't ever really sure how I would do.",
    "The 2 pages papers are grades tough at first but once you figure out how to write them the class is not too bad. If you read his book and do the papers over the weekend, you should get a good grade and won't need to attend class. Make sure to do the 8 page paper because the take home final is miserable.",
    "PSYC 149 is a good course if you are looking for an easier science credit. The class is low involvement and the topics are not difficult to understand. PSCY 149 is good for fulfilling requirements, but you would probably get more out of a harder, more involved class.",
    "Not necessarily a gut, its tricky to score good points on the essays. That being said, if your willing to actually do the readings in order to write the bi-weekly essays with a bit of effort, a doable fifth class",
    "Not too much work and something different to the normal Yale class",
    "I would if you just need an easy credit to take credit d, but not to anyone else.",
    "Would recommend as a good and relatively easy List B class to take.",
    "The class does not have very much work, however, the short essays are graded so that it is not a complete gut.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class, especially to a student (of any major) who has interest in animals. I loved the course material and therefore actually enjoyed going to class, although many others did not attend class. Classwork consists of 6 shorter essays and a longer final essay at the end, VERY simple to get a good grade if you attend class. If not, you may be lost and should consider taking the class credit D- although you may still struggle because most of the material will be unfamiliar.",
    "No. I feel like if you want to take a class in Yale, it should be a class you want to take, not just because you've heard that it's easy. This class isn't hard, but because I wasn't interested in it, it wasn't easy.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. The material was interesting but it was not delivered in a good way.",
    "Easy class and would recommend because although it is boring, it is fairly easy to get through.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student. There is a lot of reading, but if the work is stayed on top of and there is zero procrastination, the class will be very enjoyable and rewarding.",
    "Easy. The book is practically all the lectures, so no real need to go to class.",
    "An interesting subject but hard to really immerse yourself if you're not interesting in pursuing the subject",
    "The class seems a bit dry but the professor knows it all well enough that it makes it interesting enough. I'd recommend it if you can stay interested throughout shopping period.",
    "Learned things I never dreamt of about animals.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes! Even though Professor Anderson can be a little dry, you'll learn about a lot of interesting animal communication systems. If you have already taken a linguistics course, some of the human language lectures might be a bit boring, but most lectures focus on animals. There's not too much work \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just 6 short essays (really 5 because you can drop one), and if you read his textbook and some of the readings specific to the questions, you'll do well. This is a great List B course to take if you're a psych major!",
    "Although dry at times, this course was well-structured with a very manageable workload. As someone who had never been exposed to linguistics before, a lot of the content was new and therefore interesting, but I wouldn't recommend it to a student who already has experience in the field.",
    "A great class if you want an easy work load and a class where you can show up if you want. You don't need the lectures for the assignments (5 or 6 one to two page essays) or the final paper. Overall, it was interesting material presented in a boring way.",
    "Interesting course, sometimes dry lectures. You learn a lot about animal communication and a little about basic human speech. Take it if you're really interested in animals."
