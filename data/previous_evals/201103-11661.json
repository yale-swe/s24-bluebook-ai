    "Be warned, the film screenings often go on for 3-4 hours so this course is time heavy. If you want a good and non obscure overview of documentary film around the world post 1989 its great. Not good on depth though but a great overview.",
    "This is a great class if you simultaneously want to learn about some current world events as well as documentary theory. The class was really small, so discussion were always great and the class got close. The weekly work was not too bad, the readings sometimes took a while. There are only two papers. It is a very interesting class.",
    "I really loved this class. At times, I thought that the lectures were a bit dry, but the documentaries we watched were all amazing and I feel like I learned so much from them. I would recommend it if you love documentaries. If you are not a fan of documentaries though, I would tell you to look elsewhere.",
    "The content of the documentaries is strong and so are the filmmakers; this alone makes the course worth taking. If you are interested in film, take it. If you are interested in the ethics of representation in any visual field (reporting, NGO's, documentaries etc) then it is extremely thought provoking.However, having two instructors teach the course is vital because I don't think anyone has enough depth of knowledge in all the relevant regions of the world to teach it alone.",
    "I would, but would express that it is an intensive class that is designed for students really interested in world documentary."
