   "comments": [
    "Class was okay. tests seemed to focus on the little things that sometimes you might have overlooked while studying or didn't understand. However, the material is relevant to all inorganic chemists. Perhaps if concepts were explained more fully, then I would suggest this class to someone else.",
    "If Professor Faller is teaching, this class is not worth your time. With ANYONE else it would be a fabulous review of coordination chem, point groups, group theory, etc. These are all things that all inorganic chemists should know, and I plan to retake this course in a following year when someone else is teaching it. It is a shame that I have to do that, but the information is really essential.",
    "I feel as though it's a really valuable course and I plan on at least auditing it again next year when Nilay teaches it. I wouldn't recommend any of Prof. Faller's classes as I just don't think he cares. Nothing more frustrating than sitting in class and knowing both your time and the professor's time are being wasted.",
    "Course covers many important inorganic topics as well as coordination chemistry.I would recommend this course especially for organometallic or inorganic students",
    "Chemistry 557 is an examination of the basic principles that underlie inorganic chemistry and spectroscopy. I would recommend it for an inorganic chemistry student due the the fundamental nature of concepts such as crystal field theory and point groups. However, an out-of-field student may find the course too fast-paced and containing too many unfamilar and esoteric concepts unlikely to come up in their research.",
    "Strongly recommended. It is an essential course in the chemistry field."

   "comments": [
    "If it was taught better, I'm sure it would have been useful to me.",
    "I think I know less about inorganic chemistry now than I did coming into the course.",
    "Helps explain the fundamental principles about coord chem such as spectroscopy, magnetism, and ligand coordination.",
    "It helped me understand questions I will encounter during my lab work in the following years",
    "This course was a useful refresher on the basics of inorganic chemistry. For example, one of the topics stressed on the exams was using carbonyl tretches to differentiate betvween various complexes and to assign their structure. This is a technique that comes up often in papers in my field and will be very useful during the course of my research.",
    "Although most of the content I've been encountered in college course before, it still offered many new information especially those associated with math.",
    "As an organic chemist who works with organometallic reagents, I was hoping the course would assist my understanding of said reagents. Unfortunately, this was not the case. However, I did gain an understanding of group theory which I believe will help me to get a better feel for certain aspects of the literature."
