   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it but with caution. It will be an easy and somewhat interesting class, but it will get boring at times.",
    "A general review of the creation of the confept of refugee from antiquity to the present day. Looked at various texts including legal cases to fiction.",
    "Great intro course to refugee studies on a historical aspect. You read interesting pieces and watch moving films. Essays are manageable and flexible around your specific interest in refugee studies.",
    "Definitely, especially if it is your field of interest.",
    "No way, you're better off taking an engaging lecture or another HISTJ seminar.",
    "While there are one or two other classes on refugees, neither explores the themes and ideas of asylum and exile in the same careful way and in the same enlightening depth as this course. If you're interested in improving or advocating for better refugee policy, you must take this course, for it will provide you with enough background knowledge to make the wisest and most insightful choices and contributions.",
    "I would strongly recommend anyone with an interest in refugee and asylum studies, as well as European history, take this course. The legal scholarship we covered was also extremely insightful and could appeal to students interested in law and human rights. While it offers a solid overview, course content is such that students approaching from any level in their studies will gain new insights, through both the reading list as well as the conversations that Professor Leaman facilitates. This is an exellent course, ideal for students in the ER&M program, with applications for many other disciplines at Yale. I highly recommend."
