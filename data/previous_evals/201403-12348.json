   "comments": [
    "You can probably learn a lot in this class whether you start out knowing a lot about Europe or very little. A fair amount of reading is assigned but it's not too strenuous. Occasionally discussion is a bit slow, but David Cameron is a great professor who's extremely knowledgeable and wants to connect with students.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in learning about the European Union. Be aware of the fact that if you are not a European student, you might feel a little overwhelmed given the number of Europeans in the class. However, you will walk out of the course with the ability to talk confidently about a lot of the important issues that the EU faces. In fact, the many Europeans in the seminar make the conversation more diverse. Professor Cameron is also a sweetheart and very well-versed on this stuff.",
    "Quite a few tabloid Model UN types but the atmosphere is always bearable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Whether you are a beginner or know a lot about the European Union, you will learn a lot. The readings are pretty interesting and manageable. The bulk of the work is the final essay, which is not bad. Cameron is a fantastic teacher who is super friendly and approachable. He also pretty chill and seems like a laid back grader. Overall, the class is a chill class which I would totally recommend.",
    "Engaging discussions, but not very easy to figure out how one does from the comments on the weekly responses. Letter grades would be nice.",
    "Take this class if you're at all interested in European politics or the EU Professor Cameron knows literally everything and you'll learn a lot. Probably lectures a little more than most professors in seminars, but discussions were still good. Average workload weekly reading responses which aren't too burdensome, and a 20-page final paper.",
    "If you don't know much (or anything) about the EU, take this class. Professor Cameron is Yale's expert on the subject and he cares a lot about it. The readings can be a bit dry and the seminar will likely depend on which students enroll; however, there will likely be a large contingent of European students which will add incredible degrees of perspective to class discussion. The final paper is 50% of your final grade and the response papers are not graded.",
    "it is a small seminar class, which would allow you to learn not only from the books, but also from your fellow students. Take it. You will learn a lot about the EU member states. Professor Cameron is very helpful when it comes to working on your final-paper."
