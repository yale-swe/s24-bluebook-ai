    "Take this class if you want to learn about organic pollutants, but not science. Organic Chem might be a better choice.",
    "Yes. It is a great class",
    "Basic orgo chem, mass transport processes, and pollution case studies on oils spills, PCB's in the Hudson etc. Psets are not bad if you go to section, you cover a lot of material, but it gets more interesting as the class goes on, and Shimi (who spends incredible amounts of time on this class, preparing materials etc) breaks it down so you feel like you are really understanding it. Useful, esp for Env Eng or Env Sudies majors!",
    "This is a great class with material that is both interesting and relevant. There's not too much work and accommodates a wide range of chemistry backgrounds. If anything, Professor Anisfeld makes this course totally worthwhile--he's very knowledgeable, organized, and responsive to questions\/help.",
    "yes but it's hard",
    "Definitely take it! It's super interesting and fun. You learn about the chemistry of pollutants and how to apply it to real-world situations. This class is awesome!",
    "Yes, great class.Its a good introduction to the way that organic pollutants move through the environment, so I would say it is relevant for environmental studies, engineering, or chemistry students.The professor is fantastic and very supportive\/available, and the case studies are interesting. This was one of my favorite classes this semester!"
