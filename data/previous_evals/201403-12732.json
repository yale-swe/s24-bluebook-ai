   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Math 120 just because it is an essential topic to know, though if you have the opportunity to take it elsewhere, that might be better.",
    "Take the class if you need it for your major or really like math. It is decently taught and I feel like I definitely learned new concepts, but it did not teach me to love math.",
    "MATH 120 is a good course to learn multivariable calculus. Since many of the students have taken multivariable calculus before this class, I would recommend those who haven't taken the course earlier to get a private tutor from the beginning. I would recommend MATH 120 01 to another student, because my instructor did a good job of teaching the concepts as well as being available for questions outside of class.",
    "Typical multivariable calc class, with a heavier emphasis on Stoke's theorem and the like.",
    "MATH 120 is a very important course to take for anyone interested in advanced-level mathematics, sciences, or engineeringit was easy to see the numerous potential applications of the curriculum.",
    "A very high paced math course that requires work outside of class to fully grasp information, but does pay off with greater understanding of the world. I would recommend the course to another student, mostly because it is a key stepping stone for higher levels of more engaging math and not because of the intrigue of the material.",
    "The class is difficult (there is essentially no curve) but doable. Just be prepared to set aside a lot of time to learn the material. If you take the class, try to get in Miki's section.",
    "I'd say it's calculus in two and three dimensions. Basically, more calculus, same basic principle. It's a pretty approachable math class if you have a strong BC background though, so it seems like a great place for math majors, or just interested english majors to start.",
    "Math 120 is a classic multivariable calculus course taught in a section format. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone interested, though I feel as if anyone wishing to take the class wold probably be committed to it already without input.",
    "I would recommend it as a good general calculus course.",
    "Math 120 is a great follow-up to a single variable calculus course. Don't expect to be challenged by the calculus itself, thoughthe hard part is the concepts and the setting up of expressions, not actually evaluating them. If you want to learn more applications of this material (center of gravity of a solid, heat\/liquid flow, electric field) take ENAS 151, the equivalent math course for engineers. But, the two curriculums will teach you the same math equally as thoroughly. The tests are tough but 100% fair. Psets are maybe 2-3 hours a week if you pay attention in class.",
    "It's very difficult but also learnable and there are a lot of resources available to help you through.",
    "A fairly hard class, although not an incredibly big workload. The weekly problem sets can be tricky, but not terrible. Your experience in the class apparently varies a lot with your teacher: mine was very good but others haven't had such great experiences.",
    "You will learn lots, but you will definitely have to learn a lot of concepts on your own\/online. Highly recommend watching Khan Academy videos for Stoke's\/Greene's Theorem."
