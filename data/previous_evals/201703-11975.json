   "comments": [
    "Synthesizing various information, constantly thinking about the multi-faceted issue of democracy and journalism, and applying it to the current-day society.",
    "This course taught students to think critically about the role of journalism in democracy and the ways that the digital era affects democracy on a local and global scale. The readings were excellent and provided new and deep insights into these thematic questions. Professor Sleeper also invites several guest speakers to class every year who are experts in their fields, and their visits help clarify what they've written (which is assigned as reading) and bring a helpful outside perspective to our class discussion.",
    "This course opened my eyes to many issues and problems that I had either never considered or knew about. I am more knowledgable about the problems that assail the public sphere and I believe I am a more responsible citizen now.",
    "Learned a lot about the responsibilities of a democracy and the public sphere, and we read about a lot of journalists and their impact, but this is not a journalism course. That being said, if you're interested in the duties of journalists, this is a very interesting course with a lot of good readings."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great readings, satisfactory discussions, and incredible visitors.",
    "The course was extremely interesting and made me think about journalism and our role in the liberal-democratic public sphere in ways I never had before.",
    "The strengths of this course include the reading list, the enthusiasm that Professor Sleeper clearly brings to the subject matter and to each seminar meeting, and the guest speakers. Although it is a small seminar, the classes were often conducted as lectures, and I think our class could have benefited from more interactive conversation among all seminar members. Professor Sleeper requires students to engage with each other's thoughts on the readings on the Canvas discussion forum page, but that same back-and-forth rarely translated to in-person class discussion. Every week, a different student was required to present on the readings from the past week. It seems like that responsibility could be changed so that the students were guiding the class discussion rather than lecturing to the rest of the students, and that could facilitate more participation.",
    "The small seminar aspect makes it so everyone can really give their ideas and opinions and feel comfortable. Sometimes however, we found ourselves not being able to discuss and talk as much as we liked, moving more into the \"lecture\" feeling that some seminars can get.",
    "A lot of readings that at times didn't seem all that relevant. Professor Sleeper is really interesting, but at times the format could feel more like he was lecturing rather than the discussion expected from a seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Fun seminar, great way to start thinking about journalistic ethics and its role in democracy. May be a bit biased for democracy.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the material",
    "Yes! It's an intriguing subject matter, highly applicable to modern life, has a manageable workload and keeps you thinking about the future of democracy long after the seminar ends.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Even if it is in no way involved with a students major, this course can open the eyes of many students and expose them to ideas and concepts they might never encounter in college. Furthermore, this course teaches the civic responsibility and duties we have as citizens, and I believe it is essential for Yale students, many of whom will become leaders in some capacity.",
    "This is a class for anyone who wants to take a step back from the journalistic and political developments that seem to be rapidly unfolding and understand their history, their normative basis, and their implications for the future."
