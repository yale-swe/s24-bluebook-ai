    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in land conservation.",
    "Good class, well organized, and Gentry does a good job of keeping the speakers focused on the topic and getting into the meat of the issues. Asks good questions.",
    "Good course. Brad, Rose, and all the guest speakers were very knowledgeable, and most of the conversations and lectures were great. The only significant thing I would change is to move the focus away from the \"dealmaking\" side of conservation towards other issues involved with protecting land. More field trips might be useful.",
    "This course provides practical and up-to-date knowledge in land conservation issues in the United States. It also provides students with the opportunity to work with a clinical project that complements theoretical and conceptual knowlege with real, on-the-ground experiences.If you are interested in land conservation in the United States or its application elsewhere in the world, you must take this course!"

    "The discussion and mandatory blog responses, as well as the clinical projects.",
    "Both professors have such a wealth of experience and breadth of knowledge. It really helped put things into perspective to hear their personal stories and takes on the material that we were covering. Guest speakers were also well-selected and prepared. This was one of the most practical courses I took at FES",
    "Clinical project was excellent experience.",
    "Excellent teaching, excellent speakers and great class discussion. I was very impressed with the way that the class balanced the environmental and ecological necessity for conservation with the interests of economic development and social justice. These movements are sometimes in conflict and I thought Brad and Rose did an excellent job addressing this conflict in both class discussion and with the choice of speakers.",
    "Overall this course is great. It introduces students to different methods of conserving land, whether through land trusts and regional conservation groups, conservation finance, etc.Brad is obviously a fantastic professor who has a wide breadth of knowledge and knows how to share it in a clear, concise and humble way.",
    "I enjoyed the reading response format. It gave everyone a chance to participate and have their questions addressed in class. The speakers were well-chosen and insightful.",
    "It was well organized and run, and I enjoyed the variety of speakers.",
    "Great guest speakers! Good topics every week.",
    "some of the speakers were really engaging\u0085a good speaker made conversation much more interesting",
    "The readings were perfectly selected.",
    "The opportunity to learn about the facts and processes of conservation in the way that many towns and land trusts do it. The clinical experience was wonderful in that it gave me the opportunity to work for an organization separate from Yale and establish connections.",
    "- Profesor Brad Gentry is EXTRAORDINARY!- This semester the course also had the benefit of counting with Rose Harvey, former Trust for Public Land's Regional Director, in a co-teaching arrangement that provided tremendous insights on real life examples of land trusts' experiences and case studies. Rose's interventions were great!- Selections of class presenters, who were some of the best experts in their particular subjects (conservation movement, land trusts' best practices, conservation finance, limited and conservation oriented development, wetland mitigation banking, ecosystem services, carbon sequestration, etc.)- Through the well-selected weekly readings and course assigments students were prepared to ask in-depth questions to presenters as we had the opportunity to read background information on the presenter's subject"

   "comments": [
    "A number of the clinical projects were less than successful. It may help if students have more of an opportunity to delve into the projects before making a decision on which one they would like to do.",
    "My only wish was that class discussion was a bit more theoretical, but I think the emphasis on the practical was by design.",
    "The clinical projects were hit or miss. Some people really enjoyed them, and others, not so much.",
    "Some repetition in the speakers.",
    "i wish that brad had spoken more frequently",
    "None.",
    "I would like some more direct lectures teaching you about how things are run and what aspects are needed for the strategies for land conservation. The guest speakers are great, but one of the best speakers was the one telling us exactly what \"Fee Simple\" and \"Easement\" is, what components are mandatory, what is not, etc. The direct, \"here's how it is\", could be taught a bit more.",
    "The land title out-of-class workshop was too basic and needed a better introduction, rather than to go directly into a title search. Also, the town of Gilford's land title archives are so organized that one wonders if this experience canbe comparable to other localities.I would recommend a more in-depth workshop on land trust management or visit a particular land trust office and learn about their experiences with land titles searches."

    "It worked out fine, but it did make it more difficult to coordinate.",
    "Advantages: work is part of a team, you get everyone's input and creativity, ultimately you might end up doing less work because everyone contributesDisadvantages: sometimes are waiting on the individual who has not turned in their part, or may be out of town often. Can sometimes feel held back. On the flip side, when everyone is pushing ahead and you are overwhelmed with work for other classes, you can feel like you're letting people down."
