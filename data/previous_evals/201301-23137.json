    "Take it!!!! It's a chance to create a portfolio of poetry that's workshopped by a super talented professor and your fellow students. You turn in a poem a week and some reading responses- good fun stuff",
    "This course has really helped me to feel comfortable in reading the new school of contemporary academic poetry. Moreso, I've been introduced to much of the theory of poetry with has been very interesting and enlightening.",
    "A satisfying, full-tilt introduction both to the contemporary poetry world and to pertinent Continental philosophy. Readings consist of poems from the Norton Anthology of Contemporary Poetry, a manual on writing poetry (more interesting than one would think), and handouts of philosophical\/theoretical essays. We read Saussure, Lacan, Heidegger, Kant, Nietzsche, Adorno, Jakobson, and others -- not a light list, nor is it to be taken lightly. Class time is devoted to discussing the readings, doing craft exercises, and reading poems closely. Half the poem you write are in assigned verse forms, the other half are free. Workshops once a week. This course is a great alternative to the oversubscribed and competitive seminars offered by Louise Gl\u00c3\u00bcck, Cynthia Zarin, et al. Prof. Andrews is a real, live, talented young poet, on the ground, publishing her work today. Her commentary and analysis are honest and invaluable, and for the entire class that she devotes to explaining literary journals and publication (basically a one-hour how-to on publishing your work), this class is a godsend. You would be hard pressed to find this kind of detailed, pragmatic advice anywhere else."
