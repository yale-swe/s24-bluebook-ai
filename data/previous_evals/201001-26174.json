    "Yes, IDK about the other professors, but Profesora Leon was very thorough, and I'm feeling pretty good about next year. Just learn your verbs.",
    "If you really want to learn spanish this is definitely a great course, but if you are just looking to fullfill a language requirement I have been told that other languages are much easier...so check it out.",
    "It's a good class. I put that the amount of work was average, though the pair\/group presentation about a Spanish-speaking country was incredibly time consuming. The Spanish program is set up to the student's advantage- there are lots of online resources and the professors\/head of Introductory Spanish keep students updated about tests\/exams. Look ahead in the syllabus just to stay on top of your schedule. Spend small amounts of time on vocabulary throughout the semester so you won't have to worry about it come exam time. The Centro site (Activity Pak) is really good for this, though also look through the book because the website doesn't have it all. Expect to learn a few more tenses and another mandate. Overall, if you stay on top of work and participate in class, you're golden."
