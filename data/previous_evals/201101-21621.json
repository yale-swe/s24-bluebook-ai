    "If you are at all interested in the major issues confronting American city politics and\/or wish to grow as a writer\/thinker, this class is for you!",
    "The best thing I got out of this course was working on a very long research paper. Second-best thing was the group of kids--small, fun. A very friendly environment by the end of things. Horan is great; she will call you out on your dumb remarks but recognize your astute observations.",
    "City politics. I would take it if your interested in urban politics and the way america especially these 3 cities has developed.I would take this class if you are willing to participate and do the reading",
    "This class is a thorough look at the political economies of NY, Chicago and LA. Professor Horan is a wonderful professor who puts much thought into class and expects much of her students; in return, students work hard and spend time preparing for seminar each week. As compared with other cultural history-based courses on urban environments at Yale, this class provides refreshing rigor and realism. Take it!!",
    "I truly recommend this course. Although not easy, it will be rewarding in understanding the dynamics of cities."
