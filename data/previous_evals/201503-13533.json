    "Question 2: Time spent writing reading questions might have been better spent working on research proposals.",
    "Both professors were extremely knowledgeable and helpful about how to create good project proposals and what methods were useful to carry out particular kinds of research. I definitely plan to solicit their feedback on future stages of my research project.",
    "I imagine that this class is a difficult one to teach, given the breadth of methods covered and the range of student backgrounds within the class, and both professors did a great job of managing these challenges. I thought the way the course was structured, with several weeks devoted to in depth exploration of a given method, was really helpful and allowed students to focus in on what was useful to their individual projects. I also thought that having this class co-taught was really valuable and would suggest that this continue in the future. Also, both professors were very available to discuss my project at length, and provided helpful feedback on my work throughout the entire semester. I benefitted a lot from the time they took with me, and from being able to work out ideas with professors working in different fields.",

   "comments": [
    "Course lectures and discussions were engaging and insightful, and effectively framed outside readings. Proposal review sessions with classmates were also very helpful.",
    "I learned a lot from the readings, the lectures, and the guest speakers. All of the methods we learned about were really valuable, even if I don't incorporate all of them into my current project. I feel a lot more confident in preparing research project proposals in the future and I received a lot of really helpful feedback to improve my current project.",
    "Emphasis on student projects; perspectives from both an anthropologist and sociologist; range of methods explored; having time to workshop our ideas with classmates; well selected readings",
    "The group discussion and peer feedback was very useful. The powerpoints were clear and well organized.",
    "Amity and Justin cultivated a supportive, engaging classroom culture - throughout the semester, they both set aside plenty of time for us to work with and to learn from our peers. The assignments were also very well-designed and very useful beyond the class itself.",
    "The variety of research tools. My personal favorite section of the course was the discussion. I learned a lot from discussing reading and peoples' experiences in the field."

   "comments": [
    "Alternating between modules was a bit overwhelming. I found myself torn between which modules to choose. Maybe there's a way to bring the two together.",
    "If possible, I would have liked to participate in all of the workshops, so recording them next time would be helpful.",
    "These are very minimal suggestions, I don't think this course needs much changing, but here are a few thoughts - - maybe draw on questions that we submit more directly in class - I understand why there is a no-laptop policy, and I think that makes a lot of sense, but I also think that it makes close readings of texts difficult if not impossible, because many people read assigned articles and take notes on their computers; sometimes I think class discussion was less focused than it could have been as a result (but, this is also our fault as students when we haven't done the readings) - that the class schedule was flexible to suit student needs was great, but given these changes it would be nice to get in-class clarification on when assignments are due (sometimes this was a bit confusing)",
    "The specific focus on research question development needs the most improvement. The course met its objectives in terms of exposure to different types of research methods, but was not very helpful as a framework for developing a research question.",
    "The assignments, their descriptions, and their deadlines were available from the very beginning of the semester in the syllabus, but weekly homework was sometimes assigned a little out-of-the-blue - next year, it might be helpful to students to note those smaller weekly homework assignments in the syllabus from the beginning, too, just to provide the same advance notice and descriptions given for the bigger assignments (annotated bibliography, research proposal, presentation, etc.)."

I think my future research will really benefit from this time and exposure to diverse methods that I might not have chosen to explore without taking the course. I have experience in social science research already, and this course was not redundant.",
    "My career plans are in private land conservation research, planning, and outreach, so this course provided me with very useful training in data collection techniques, grant proposal-writing, and presentation. Perhaps my most valuable take-away from this course was in interview techniques. The exposure and skills I developed in this course definitely met my expectations."

    "Try to pick a project topic as early as possible and use each lecture topics to constantly refine the research question, since it's an ongoing process.",
    "This is a great class to take, regardless of whether you have extensive or minimal background in social science research. This course will be the most useful if you plan to actually develop and carry out your own research project; the work in the course will be less valuable if you do not, but you will still get a valuable exposure to various social science methods. I don't think it would make sense to take this class as a second year after already having completed research.",
    "This is a very valuable course, but you should come prepared with an already fairly specific research question in order to fully benefit from it.",
    "Definitely take this course if you can - the final products are well-designed and useful and the professors are interesting and supportive."
