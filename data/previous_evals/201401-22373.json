   "comments": [
    "Great classthat challenges your current understandings of race and that broadens your knowledge of how race is examined, studied, and understood by many people who employ historical methods",
    "Each week, we read a work related to a specific theme addressing the topic of race and races in American Studies. Based on our selection, we took a 'nuts-and-bolts' approach to the analysis of the construction of the book, including the author's choice of source materials and period, for example.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are engaged in any field of ethnic studies research.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it provided a comprehensive environment for a sustained conversation from a wide array of books. I wish that we had the opportunity to discuss larger themes as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested primarily in a historical approach to race in American Studies. The class reading includes fantastic examples of scholarship on race in a variety of contexts, and the written assignments are helpful and interesting.",
    "American Studies 701 is a course on major themes and methodological approaches to research in American history and culture. The style of the syllabus allows students to choose to focus on the readings that most pertain to their own research. Though a few of the readings focus on the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the class has an emphasis on nineteenth and twentieth century history.Yes, I would recommend American Studies 701 to another student because of the breadth of knowledge that the readings provide and the skills that I developed through class assignments.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. I found it really useful for thinking about different theories and ideas about racial formation and critical race theory."

   "comments": [
    "The professor did a great job of exposing the class to many different approaches to historical research. It deepened my knowledge by exposing me to these range of methods. It also deepened my knowledge by exposing me to books that focused on races other than African Americans.I am not a historian so it may not directly contribute to my dissertation, but I think seeing Professor Jacobson's approach to his work and to reading others' work has helped to shape how I read others' research.",
    "I found the analytical focus on research praxis to be particularly helpful in my own construction and thinking-through of a research project.",
    "This deepened my knowledge regarding some major themes in American Studies, particularly regarding some consistentconversations around war, imprisonment, and popular culture. While this course didn't directly contribute to my dissertation, the syllabus was helpful in teaching in the future, which was deeply appreciated.",
    "This course greatly expanded my familiarity with the historical literature on race and racism in the United States. It also introduced me to a range of exciting interpretive approaches and methods in American Studies and Cultural Studies more broadly.",
    "This course was extremely helpful, and the final paper was a particularly good opportunity to push my thinking on issues that are directly relevant to my research. Thanks for a great semester.",
    "This course presented the opportunity to read both broadly and deeply about racial formation because of the flexibility the professor built into the course. I was able to choose a couple of books which became important in thinking about scholarly conversations I want to join."
