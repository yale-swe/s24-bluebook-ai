   "comments": [
    "It is the basic biology of cancer, and it moves into specific cancers as well. It is a \"science for non science majors\" but it definitely does take work. I would not call it an easy science class (unless you have background knowledge of biology - and enjoy it) but it was definitely very interesting. I highly recommend this class.",
    "This is a really interesting course. Cancer is one of those things that you hear a lot about but don't really know much about. The course description says it's for non-science majors so people tend to thing it's more focused on like the patients or emotionally dealing with cancer but it's not. It's pretty science heavy. It focuses on the immunology\/genetic\/biology aspect of cancer. But it's not anything you can't handle if you're not a science person. The majority of the class is non-science majors.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is not afraid to put in a lot of hard work! An overall rewarding class though.",
    "This is not a gut, however it is a course for non-science majors. It is very scientific and dont take it if you dont like Biology.",
    "This is a science class. You will learn science. This class is kind of a trap. If you're looking for a gut, do not take this. If you're looking for a manageable science class, do not take this. You will learn a ton, but your GPA may suffer and you will leave class braindrained and often confused.",
    "This course is awkward to talk about (\"Where are you going?\" \"Oh, to cancer.\") but great to be in. The 20-student cap makes it easy to ask questions, and the lectures keep you awake. Prof. Belperron is a sweetheart and great at teaching. Cancer is not her area of research, but she knows more than enough to teach it.The quizzes and midterm are pretty difficult; luckily you also have a presentation and final paper that factor into your grade. Take it anyway! It's a science credit, you'll learn a lot that's relevant to your daily life (like whether or not eating pesto increases your risk of cancer), and you'll have fun with it.",
    "This is one of the few science credits for non-science majors that is extremely interesting and worthwhile! Seriously--you will learn so much and be constantly interested! Professor Belperron is also very kind and engaging. The class is quite challenging and demanding, however, so definitely do not take this class expecting it to be a gut or \"easy\" science credit. Even though there is a lot of material and the tests are hard, it's still a very worthwhile class. Besides, if you're bad at test-taking like I am, there is a final paper and presentation that you can do well on! So basically don't take this class for a perfect grade, take it because you will be a better, more informed citizen of the world afterwards.",
    "Cancer was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. I'm not a science major, so I took this for the SC credit, and I am so relieved I did. This class isn't a gut, but Belperron is so good at structuring and teaching the class that it felt very easy. There's not an immense amount of busy work (no problem sets) but the work that the class does involve really helps you understand all of the key concepts. I would recommend this to anyone who needs the SC credit.",
    "I would recommend it for a science credit. The course is definitely NOT a gut if that's what you're looking for, but it isn't super hard. The structure is pretty simple and workload is not that bad. The quizzes can be tricky but aren't worth that much (3 at 5% of your grade). All in all this is a great course that gives you a deep understanding of cancer and current treatment. My understanding of biology was basically nonexistent at the start of this course, and now I have a pretty good grasp on some basic cell concepts and on genetics.",
    "It's a large seminar that explores the science and history behind cancer as well as the techniques being developed to treat it. I highly recommend it to anyone at all interested in the subject matter and looking for a great science credit",
    "This class teaches the basic scientific mechanisms of cancer. The class really made me feel better equipped to handle my own health. I think it's useful for everyone.",
    "It's not a gut but it's a science credit that you'll walk knowing as much as a pre-med does. Professor Belperron is caring, thoughtful and personable. Cancer affects us in more ways than we can imagine and this class allows you to understand the concepts very deeply.",
    "Yes! The things I learned in class were so interesting and so applicable to real life!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is very interesting and topical in terms of things you hear about in the news.",
    "This is a great class and i think everyone should get a chance to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. A bit more science based than expected but the material is relevant and interesting and it's something everyone could learn about today.",
    "Yes"
