    "I learned about security in Central and Eastern Europe more broadly. Having only focused on one country, this course was extremely interesting because it allowed me to learn about areas I wasn't as familiar with.",
    "Geopolitical challenges emerging out of territorial and ideological conflicts, shared history, as well as nuclear and energy politics have been especially insightful to me. Furthermore, I have substantially broadened my understanding of Russia's involvement with and influence on the issues in the region.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between Russia and many Central and Eastern European states. The course did a thorough job of outlining past and current issues that affect relationships with neighbors throughout the region."

   "comments": [
    "The reading assignments each week were very informative and it was very easy to complete the reading each week, as the workload was not as high as some other classes I've been in.",
    "Strengths: a truly interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach, with the breadth that allows to grasp the complexity of regional challenges. Truly enjoyable course. Weaknesses: 2-hour seminars were not enough :)",
    "The course focuses on an area of Europe that is often overlooked and underestimated. The scope is understandably broad given the sheer size of the region being covered, but great information is provided for further study and exploration."
