   "comments": [
    "It was my first ever look at environmental politics and at rivers, so I found the class eye-opening. It was broad and in-depth and multi-disciplinary. The Professor had excellent things to say, and I thought the contributions made by my classmates to discussion were very insightful.",
    "Throughout this course we analyzed various orientations human societies have had towards their \"environment,\" and we unpacked that word itself. I experienced fundamental shifts in the way that I conceptualize the scale and practice of human impacts on the environment and what the Anthropocene has meant for our watersheds. I really enjoyed learning from James Scott, whose theories are so foundational for social and political theory more broadly. \"Seeing like a State\" is masterful.",
    "Learned a lot about rivers, and some about methods of communicating, presenting and writing about said rivers--what techniques work, which ones don't. I also gained a better sense of holistic thinking, about the subjectivity of science and cost-benefit analyses, and about the beautiful wrecks that are unintended consequences.",
    "1. How rivers become a site for the assertion of political power 2. The iatrogenic nature of river improvement schemes 3. The fallacious nature of \"restoration\" projects",
    "I took this class without any real experience in the area, so I learned a great deal about river engineering and the histories of a variety of rivers. I enjoyed our philosophical disxusssions about the relationships between humans and nature, and I have gained a new appreciation for environmental movements and philosophies. I most enjoyed the books about eels and the snail darter. I find myself telling friends about those books over and over.",
    "I became better at thinking about rivers.",
    "I think a valuable skill gained from the course was the responsibility of being a discussant. I wish this responsibility was emphasized a bit more, but overall it was extremely valuable. This is a good course for people who want to force themselves to speak up more in class.",
    "As an architectural student in a poli-sci class, I really enjoyed this course. The discussion around nature and culture made me re-thought many of my established understanding of architecture, infrastructure and cities. My reading speed increased greatly, as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the amount of content that we covered here was much more substantial than with any other Yale class I took this semester. I consider it a plus, because I took the class with the aim of learning as much as I possibly could. The discussions after reading the material in class were also very interesting, and I liked how spontaneous it was. I felt like I learnt so much more from it because we were all supposed to do the readings beforehand. Also, the 2 hour length of the class is a good length for in-depth discussions.",
    "First of all, I think this could be considered a history class, and it would have been helpful for my awarenessl to have it listed as such (almost all readings turned out to be historical). Also, I think the reading list could have been a little more diverse in terms of its sub-topics for the theme of the class. It was largely focused on European and American history, and I would have really enjoyed some comparative analysis and an awareness of the modern history of dams in developing nations, especially in terms of the politics of the World Bank. There is rich literature on dams in South Asia, for example. Overall though, I learned something new in every class meeting and mostly enjoyed the readings! I don't know where I would have encountered many of them otherwise. They were extremely long (often 500 pages) but it was never really expected that we read them in their entirety. It might have been nice to have a few weeks with shorter readings though, for the sake of delving deeply into a particular argument on a subject.",
    "Strengths: GREAT topic, mostly great readings, entertaining and insightful professor, and a fun and engaged group of students that made class a pleasure. Weaknesses: Not a lot of structure to class. Sometimes felt repetitive. I also wish we could have also had some social theory brought in to class discussions via short intro\/supplementary lectures by Prof. Scott. Minimal feedback on class performance and participation. Not much guidance for final paper (Prof Scott did set helpful intermediate deadlines to get us started on paper topics, which were very appreciated. However, we didn't receive feedback on these topic proposals.)",
    "Great selection of books, and a wonderful professor\/moderator.",
    "I think that some of the readings were a bit long and as a result discussion was not as focused on each individual text. Sometimes discussion could lag. However, a few of the readings were amazing and provoked intense discussion. I liked how professor Scott took the time to consider each of our comments and propose counter arguments. However, this sometimes decreased discussion between students. Overall, I enjoyed this course tremendously.",
    "Professor Scott, who said he started teaching this class because he discovered he's really into rivers, was evidently no career \"expert\" on the subject. Much of class consisted of informed reflection and conjecture based sometimes loosely on the (mostly) interesting books we read. This generally made discussion fun, philosophical, and liberating, and brought out Professor Scott enthusiasm and kindness. However, sometimes we drifted to the extent that it became hard to pay attention or stay engaged. I wish that we would have turned back a bit more often to hard fact (whatever that means) and expert opinion. Lest I appear to have learned nothing form this class, by \"expert\" I mean anyone who is very well acquainted with rivers, whether scientists, fishermen, loggers, local officials, farmers, or artists. Less about the Rhine and Mississippi, more about the Amu Darya, Zambezi, and Xingu! We spent far too little time discussing the Soviet bloc and Global South, and far too much time lamenting the \"lost romance\" of the Rhine, as depicted in postcards sent by bourgeois European tourists. What about the outstanding ecological and cultural diversity of the Niger, the 8,000 year-old history of the Indus, the fierce battles between environment and economy of the Paran? Let's hear the subalterns speak.",
    "One of the weaknesses of the course is that there is too much reading. Some weeks, it was even unclear whether students should attempt to skim\/read both books assigned or just focus on one book. I think it would help if course expectations were made clearer from one week to the next. The strength of the course is that the readings are generally pretty interesting (though I think some could be switched out for other ones). Also, this is not a required class and the students who are in it want to be there. This creates a group of self-selecting students who are all interested in river politics."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I definitely would.",
    "Yes! James Scott is a legend and deserves to be. The topics engaged in this class are not ideas I have encountered in any other setting, and it fosters a great intellectual community to be a part of. There are lots of readings but few assignments, except for a long paper at the end that is an opportunity for you to research something you are passionate about.",
    "A definite yes! I would recommend it! The reviews from years previous are quite accurate: it is basically a book club with a fascinating, fabulously irreverent and slightly spacey professor. You learn a ton about the construction of flood control and the aims of social control that hid behind all of these different statist environmental \"improvement\" projects. I was very interested in the topic before taking the class and I came out of it even more hooked. Rivers are fascinating, fascinating things--you finish the class with an impressive if incomplete sense of just how much they have shaped politics, culture, human settlement and society. The readings are, for the most part, quite good. A few books are AMAZING (Snail Darter, Rising Tide), a few are duds (Disconnected Rivers). A book a week and a term paper (with no length requirement, as Prof. Scott refused to provide one). Not life-changing but totally enjoyable and interesting!",
    "Definitely worth taking the course! Jim is one of \"those\" teachers who will make your Yale experience and teach you to think about the world in a different manner.",
    "I've always been relatively passionate and knowledgeable about rivers, but nonetheless, this class changed the way I look at them. When I see a river now, I think about it much more intensely and thoroughly than I ever would have before. I feel that I can see how humans have changed it, and how it has changed us. It could get a little abstract and repetitive, and I occasionally zoned out during discussions, but i emerged with a deeper knowledge and appreciation of an important part of the world. Professor Scott is kind, interesting, and very talkative.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in reading a wide variety of books and genres. I personally did not like some of the books that were more ecology-focused. I much preferred the more historically-focused and anthropological readings. If you are someone who doesn't mind reading some (at times) dry ecological books, then this may be a good class for you. The class is also very dependent on the students who are in the class with you. It's all discussion based, so the other classmates make a big difference. I would consider this. I really liked how the professor allowed for maximum flexibility with the term paper. This class is great for the student who has a river-related project that they want to work on and doesn't want a lot of constraints.",
    "Although it may not seem like it, but this course would be perfect for architectural students who would like to understand the nature-culture issue better.",
    "I would recommend this course for some but maybe not for others. It seems that it's a highly individual decision. Do you want to take a semester to explore the topic of rivers and write an independent paper on it? Know what you're getting into. It can be fun. You will definitely learn a lot. But there's a lot of reading, and it can get overwhelming. So think carefully about whether you are really interested in this small discussion based seminar where we read a book a week."
