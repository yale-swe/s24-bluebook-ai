    "Not that I'm qualified to make this claim (seeing as how this is the only lab I've taken at Yale so far), but I'm pretty sure this is the most awesome lab class ever. One day, I got to track a weather balloon. Another day, we went on a field trip to take water samples up and down the Quinnipiac River. In short, it was awesome.",
    "fun",
    "its fine and required to take if you are taking G&G 140",
    "Since you have to take it with EVST 201, and that class is great, I would recommend it. As labs go, its not that bad, though at times its a bit boring. Some of the labs, like the River Field Trip, are very interesting. Only a lab report every two weeks.",
    "I had a lot of fun with the lab. You'll get to play around with some of the basic instruments with which environmental data is gathered and then delve into some analysis. This is required with G&G 140, but it's certainly interesting.",
    "The lab is required if you take the course but it's nowhere near as intense as a chem or physics lab. We only did three actual experiments, each followed by a week where all we did was discuss the experiment, which made the lab often feel much more like a section for the lecture course. The fourth \"experiment\" was just analyzing someone else's data, and the fifth one was actually a debate about global warming (which was actually pretty fun). But some of the experiments, like launching a weather balloon and tracking it with a telescope or going on a field trip to 5 different sites on the Quinnipiac River, were really fun. There were lab reports which were pretty substantial but only due every other week, and there was a final that caught some people off guard but which was manageable as long as you studied. You will do A LOT of Excel, but if you haven't had much experience with Excel, this is a good opportunity to learn it. Overall, the lab is often enjoyable and even when it isn't, it's worth taking it in order to take the lecture course.",
    "You have to take this course with the core lecture",
    "You have to take the lab, but it's pretty cool. You launch a weather balloon, go on a tour of the Qunnipiac River, and play with a bunch of lab equipment. Write-ups aren't terrible either.",
    "It was neat. There are fun field trips, short informative labs, and quality discussion time with a the TF",
    "The atmospheric science lab was pretty fun. We learned about different meteorological measurements, went on a field trip around the Quinnipiac River, went up on the roof to learn about the winds, got comfortable with Excel, and debated global warming. It was a good complement to the class. And with only 2 hours in the lab weekly and 4-6 hours writing up the lab reports every two weeks, you could do so much worse with a 1\/2 credit lab (compare 4 hour chem labs with intense lab reports). It was a great complement to the class.",
    "This lab is a required component of EVST 201 so there's really no point recommending this lab specifically. I HIGHLY recommend EVST 201 though and this lab is a great component, I really enjoyed it! Very useful information that every layperson should know (i.e. how do we measure weather?)",
    "While you get to do some interesting labs overall I don't know how much more I learned from this class in addition to the lecture.",
    "I mean...you have to if you're taking the class. It's okay. Super fun at times. At worst, it's just a chore. Never excruciatingly painful. I liked it overall.",
    "It's a nice lab, especially the weather balloon experiment and the river trip. Some of the others were slightly more boring, but it's a great addendum to the course.The debate was also great.",
    "The outdoor labs are fun, the other ones are miserable especially if you don't know how to use Excel very well.",
    "This is a fun lab that's not too time intensive. The reports are not unduly difficult, and you learn some neat stuff about the atmosphere and oceans while doing it. The activities done are neat and fun also.",
    "Pretty easy lab course (you have to take it with the class), but there are some fun labs, and most of them are actually informative and cool. I'd say take it.",
    "This lab is manageable and more relevant than other labs I have taken and labs themselves are overall very interesting. I would recommend it to another student for those same reasons.",
    "This is one of the best labs I've taken here. It has relatively little work, but you learn a lot from it. Definitely worth it!",
    "This class should be taken with the lecture. It definitely helps and it's not that hard.",
    "The two week labs were fun and interesting. We get to take weather measurements and do analysis of the river and apply this lab to what we are studying.",
    "you have to take it. not so bad...",
    "The lab is pretty easy, and the reports aren't too bad, very straightforward. Show up for all of them, on time, and turn everything in and you should be fine. The TA\/TF's are pretty helpful, and most answers to your questions can be found online or sometimes in the book, though the book is pretty much useless.",
    "well, EVST 201 is awesome, and you have to take the lab with it, so yes! take the lab.",
    "As far as required lab classes go, this one is better than others I've taken. Lab write-ups do take more time than they should, but for the most part are pretty straightforward, and the fact that they are spaced out every other week allows you to work in a less rushed way."
