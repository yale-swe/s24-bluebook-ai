    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan managed to balance his clear knowledge of the subject matter with a very reassuring presence, the main effect of which was to make sure that everyone felt comfortable making contributions to group discussion, whilst at the same time knowing that what they said would be critically analyzed. This is a good balance, and should bode extremely well for when Ryan is leading classes on his own.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan was not very active in this course. I wish he would have been more available to students, and had vocally expressed this availability. In discussions, Ryan seemed at a lost for how to guide and steer the students' thoughts. I would encourage Ryan to 1. Go above and beyond in making himself available to help students, and 2. To utilize the Yale Center for Teaching and Learning resources and workshops as much as he can to learn how to better act as a discussion leader. Ryan obviously has plenty of potential to be a great future scholar, I'd encourage him to put forth more effort in the teaching side of being an academic though. I know it is hard to balance focus between teaching-training and research, but Ryan has plenty of unrealized potential in the former that could be brought out with a bit more preparation and utilization of Yale's pedagogical resources.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan was particularly helpful regarding discussion of paper topics. Regarding the small group discussion, I found Ryan to be an excellent facilitator and he helped draw out questions and counterpoints that were illuminating.",
    "Instructor: Ryan Michael Darr \u00a0Ryan added very precise and crystallized discussion to our class. And overall, he was a good facilitator of our discussion sections. He was also helpful in suggesting research materials. I thought he ably assisted Professor Tanner in every way."
