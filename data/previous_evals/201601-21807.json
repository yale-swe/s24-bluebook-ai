    ". Unfortunately a pretty unstructured class... The class was put together from two formerly taught classes, and that made the whole experience pretty chaotic... The first part (taught by Mark) mainly went over pretty general principles (such as milankovitch cycles or the earth's heat budget), which you probably already studied in your geoscience\/geography class in highschool, or in another introductory G&G class at Yale. The second part (taught by Noah) dealt with sedimentology and related geochemistry. This part was only a few class meetings, but it was much better structured and I felt like I actually learned something new. Throughout the semester, we had to name rock samples in short \"rock quizzes\" at the beginning of most classes. I wasn't particularly interested in this, but we definitely learned how to classify sedimentary rocks. The spring break trip (together with Global Tectonics) is pretty great. You'll be able to be in the field and actually see some of the stuff you've learned in action. We went to Sicily this year, and I think the plan for next year is Spain.",
    "Take the course if they're going on a cool trip.",
    "This was a good course. It was the combination of two different course. The spring break trip is really fun and you do a lot of geology.",
    "It's alright.",
    "maybe in future years, if it was restructured. The spring break trip was incredible and I feel like I learned the most there. The class was a really fun group but needs to be worked on a lot before it is taught again."
