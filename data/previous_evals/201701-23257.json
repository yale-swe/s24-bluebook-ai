    "A good foundation in the concepts of fieldwork of cultural anthropology and the methods to implement those concepts.",
    "Pretty much a necessary course if you're going to do fieldwork. Incredibly helpful to take your junior spring if you're doing fieldwork for an Anthro thesis the upcoming year, as the professor and TA will help walk you through the process of creating a project proposal, thinking through ethics, and developing a strong enough base in theory to make your idea more compelling.",
    "amazing class, such an interesting exposure",
    "We learned some theory of anthropological methods and questioning the ways of engaging with anthropology.",
    "I learned theories about ethnography and how it is properly carried out--both in \"the field\" and in writing. Most of this information came from anthropologists, but it also plucked from other fields, such as sociology, philosophy, and journalism. The course tested my creative abilities as most of the assignments challenged us to concepts we had never heard of, and to formulate responses that pushed the boundaries of the given disciplinary tool. I learned that ethnography is fraught with peril, but not universally a hopelessly \"colonialist\" endeavor as I had previously been led to believe by those in other disciplines--rather, it is possible for someone higher on the \"power dynamics\" scale to produce an ethnography of a marginalized group, but one has to be careful to follow the ethical guidelines.",
    "I have received a great training in ethnographic methods as well as the theoretical knowledge around ethnography. The practical assignments combined with the theoretical readings provided a lot of insight into the qualitative methods."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The fieldwork projects are all incredibly engaging, so students tend to get into them and put a fair amount of effort in. However, the workload was still surprisingly low, and I wasn't sure it was really enough writing to merit the writing credit. I would have appreciated a more writing-intensive course to help me feel more prepared to write a thesis next year.",
    "I think I took this course believing it to be more like a graduate methods course than a undergrad methods theory course. This course should have beens structured on creating an effective ethnography that demonstrates learned meaning and implements new styles of methodology. Instead it was about questioning different kinds of methodology and the field of anthropology. Often, I'd walk away from class more disinterested in anthropology than before, which was a disappointing feeling for me.",
    "The main strength of the course was how it eschewed the typical seminar method of having a large paper, but instead made use of small creative assignments along the way, which did not emphasize citing secondary sources but rather from the insights of the students themselves, who are the primary researchers in ethnography anyway. The instructors were engaging, and most of the students were enthusiastic. I felt a major weakness in the class was the way in which the instructors and the students alike tended to shove trendy academic tropes down our throats--(the students more than the instructors) like to reduce many things to Marxist theories of hegemony and greed\/capital, feminist theories of patriarchal oppression, colonial theories of imbalanced racial dynamics, even going so far as to challenge biology itself by calling kinship and sex constructs--and while those observations are valid, they were always trying to find some negative spin on every detail and every bit of ethnography that proved one of these theories, rather than examining smaller details that might reveal something more novel which challenges these theories dominating the humanities and social sciences today.",
    "The strength is that it provides a somewhat practical insights into the qualitative methods. There is a bunch of courses on quantitative methods for social science, but as far as I know, this is the only course on the qualitative methods. In that way, it is a very valuable course, and it was also organized very well. The weakness would be the unclear grading rubric. It is definitely a difficult endeavor to grade such a creative and flexible assignments. The course would greatly benefit if it improved on that front. I also felt the readings could be shortened, since we didn't really discuss all of them in class."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent course for anybody considering research in the social sciences.",
    "Even if you're not an anthro major, the fieldwork you do for this class is fascinating and the readings, even the theoretical ones force you to think pretty seriously about the ethics of studying other humans, which should be a consideration in almost anyone's life and studies. Highly recommend. It's not too much work and no final (the final project is less work than many of the projects throughout the semester), so it's pretty easy to balance with your other classes.",
    "YES",
    "This is a good course for those who are exhausted by seminar papers but still want to be challenged, and a must for anyone who wants to use ethnography, but not just ethnography for some gigantic anthropological project--most of us in the class were not anthropologists and described ethnography as a tool and not a whole field, which the course respected.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is in the anthropology or sociology major. It is, however, somewhat of a commitment; you will need to go out and do fieldwork on your own. If you like how that sounds, take it! There is also a lot of readings every week. They're very interesting, but it's still a lot."
