   "comments": [
    "It is a ton of work, but well-work the effort. I would absolutely recommend this class or any other taught by Dr. Magaziner to fellow students.",
    "I would highly recommend the course but not for a first year student. The level was very advanced and was often daunting especially for the new students.",
    "Highly recommended for anyone with interest in African history or politics. Not recommended as a first course on Africa, because you will not get as much out of it as you could with some prior background.",
    "Absolutely! You can't go wrong with this dynamic combination of books, ideas, classmates, and professor. Discussions are the richest and most enlightening aspect of the course (so make it a priority to do the readings), and Magaziner is a smart, committed seminar leader. I left each class significantly more knowledgeable and passionate about both African history and the power of history and ideology more generally. Studying African history implies questioning the discipline of history itself! So I loved how interdisciplinary the course was - we discussed art, philosophy, anthropology, history of science as well as \"traditional\" history and historiography. Very exciting stuff.",
    "it is an ambitious (given that it adequately covers so much history and through different literary methodologies) endeavour which fulfills its objective to journey through ideology which has come to shape present-day Africa. I would recommend the course for any students seeking to understand the shaping of the continent pre and post colonial.",
    "This isn't the sort of seminar you can get away with not reading for. You need to keep up with the reading and meet the deadlines. Given that you do this and find the subject matter interesting, this will be the best class you ever take by far.",
    "It was a very interesting course that provoked a lot of thought, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It depends on the student's academic interests and the program he or she is enrolled in.",
    "I would recommend this course. I learned so much and was so inspired!"
