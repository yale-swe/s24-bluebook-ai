    "The course does not have an electronic version of slides or papers. I would recommend professor to do one next year.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to future students. I really enjoyed the guest lecturers( who were experts in their field) as well as the reading material that the Professor provided for the course. Since this class had a relatively small class size, it allowed for discussion type learning atmosphere.",

    "Great class, intersting topics.",
    "This course was interesting exposure to the field of occupational and environmental medicine. It was nice to have guest lecturers share their expertise but fewer of them may have been good to improve a sense of continuity\/cohesiveness of the overall course."

    "Instructor: Mark Bernard Russi \u00a0Dr. Russi is a fantastic professor and an asset to EPH. His lectures really involved the students and encouraged participation. He valued every person's input and really got students thinking about the material. Although he asked questions, he never made me feel like I was being put on the spot. He was sympathetic to student needs and made sure that all concepts were explained clearly and completely.",
    "Instructor: Mark Bernard Russi \u00a0The instructor is very nice, answering questions in prompt way.",
    "Instructor: Mark Bernard Russi \u00a0Dr. Russi was very passionate about this course and enabled his students to think critically about current issues in occupational and environmental medicine. He encouraged his students to participate and be invovled during his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Mark Bernard Russi \u00a0Very personable and intelligent. His grasp on current and historical topics is immense. His experience is legendary.",
    "Instructor: Mark Bernard Russi \u00a0very passionate and knowledgeablevery helpful and receptive to students",
    "Instructor: Mark Bernard Russi \u00a0Professor Russi is very knowledgeable and approachable; being in his course was an enjoyable experience. While I think his lectures provided good exposure to many major topics, slightly more structure to the course would have been nice. It would likely be helpful to students to do some sort of summary or wrap-up at the end of lectures or the course to help make connections between the material and research that is presented."

    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This was a great introductory course to Occupational and Environmental Health and was alwaysinteresting and entertaining. I feel that I learned many things that will be useful in my career, even though I am not going into Occupational Health. The readings and assignments were useful and not busywork.",
    "I was concerned if I would have problem with zero medical background. But the lecturers and the instructor just made it easy and understandable. I like the way they are delivering. It's a good course for every student with or without medical background.",
    "This course shows a brief overview of the various issues and exposures that occupational and environmental medicine health care workers mightcome across. I would highly recommend it to another student. This class was very enjoyable and I learned a lot in this course.",
    "it's helpful, it's interestingI would recommend it.",
    "Excellent class",
    "Overall, thiscourse was good exposure to the given fields, requiring little work outside of class besides reading articles, but it is probably not the best course for someone not very interested in the subject matter to begin with. There is a great deal of detail in the course that may be beyond the scope of interest for some, but Professor Russi is a very knowledgeable and approachable lecturer and is an interesting person to learn from."
