   "comments": [
    "If you know little about the way the universe functions, this is a super interesting class. Sometimes the lectures are a bit slow and sometimes the pair and share partner exercises result in periods of awkward silence, but overall the material is engaging and Professor Edwards clearly cares about the subject.",
    "Insipid science courses will continue to be a problem until Yale decides a) to grant an Sc credit for any course that could conceivably be interesting or useful to a humanities\/social science major (e.g. computer science, most psychology classes) or b) to allow students to fulfill the Sc distributional requirement with courses taken Cr\/D. Until then, this is a fine (if bland) course with minimal work and easy grading.",
    "I am glad to have taken this course, as I learned a lot about some interesting natural phenomenon. Occasionally lecture can seem a little juvenile (we often had to \"think, pair, share\" with someone sitting next to us), and the grading was sometimes weirdly strict given the format of the course. Overall, though, I definitely got a lot out of it given the work required.",
    "I would definitely recommend ASTR 160. The course covers three topics in depth: exoplanets, black holes, and the fate of the universe. Dr. Edwards is a great lecturer and makes lecture very engaging. The workload is extremely reasonable, and the weekly problem sets do a nice job of reinforcing the material covered in lecture.",
    "I have never taken a non-major science class before so don't have much to compare it to. I thought it was pretty bad though. No real substance, pretty random psets.",
    "An easy science credit, but you won't get much out of it if you know anything about astronomy at all. Wouldn't really recommend it unless you need it.",
    "Yes!! This was a wonderful class, and a lot better than other intro astro classes. You get the most interesting material with the best professor and very simple math. You learn a lot and the grading is fair. The material was super interesting and you end up learning a lot!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. it's interesting, and very well taught.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class to any student. It isn't even a very good class to take if you need an easy QR, and NOT because it isn't theoretically easy... the lessons and concepts are so incoherent, the exams are so vague, and the grading is so hard (maybe because it's supposed to be an easy class?) that it takes more time to understand what the Professor is even trying to teach, or wants from us, than it is to do the actual work, which is just a ridiculously large time commitment.",
    "This is a phenomenal class that I would completely recommend to another non-science major. If you want deep math take 343, if not, DEFINITELY take this class. Professor Edwards is AMAZING and very energetic. I was always very engaged in class. Set up so you can succeed, and lots of people got As, but that's cause the information is taught in a really accessible, engaging manner, not cause it inherently is easy. Fantastic, very interesting science credit with very important, relevant material.",
    "Take it-- such unique subject matter and you get to go to the observatory!",
    "If you've ever heard words like black hole, dark matter, dark energy, quarks, singularity, and wanted to know what was going on, I suggest taking this course. It's a science credit that you learn A LOT from in very comprehensible terms. Totally worth it.",
    "Definitely recommended - focuses on three topics over the semester (planets outside of our solar system, black holes, and dark matter) and includes chances to go to the observatory."
