    "I gained a more nuanced understanding of concepts like exploitation, slavery, economic injustice, etc. that are familiar and incredibly relevant.",
    "More than anything, I think this course instilled in me the instinct to question structures (social, economic, political) that I take for granted or don't ever think about at all. It is difficult to be an informed and genuinely thoughtful citizen when you assume a priori that capitalism is the best system."

    "I think this course has a lot of potential. The readings are really interesting and Professor Carico is extremely smart. However, I think the class could have been more structured with more input from the professor about the topics we should discuss. Becuase we did not have a lot of structure the conversations were often not as engaging or challenging as they could have been.",
    "I think sometimes the reading was a bit much to be able to actually complete week to week, which is a challenge for optimal engagement with the class. I liked the fact that the class was small and people cared about the subject matter, so class discussion was always personal and engaging and lively."

    "Yes. Great class, interesting topics and great professor.",
    "This course covers incredibly important topics, and does an amazing job showing how economic justice and racial justice are inseparable, so whether your interests fall more toward one or the other of those topics initially, this class is really illuminating. The syllabus was wide ranging and great, even though sometimes it was not possible to complete all the readings. Since the topic of the course is so broad and present in every area of life, it is easy to make it personal, relevant, and practical. It is also possible through the open ended assignments to focus on areas that are most interesting to you.",
