    "This is a fabulous course! It's classes like this that remind me why I chose Yale! Professor Korie is a Tony nominated lyricist and does a fantastic job teaching! You don't have to worry about grades for this course; if you do the work and you do put in effort, you will get an A. I had never written song lyrics before, and now I can't stop! It's a really fun class! Professor Korie brooks no fools, though, and will be very honest with you about your lyrics, which I personally found very valuable. I would recommend this to anyone with a theatrical background who was interested in maybe writing musicals!",
    "This is a very intro level course with a light amount of writing. I think this is a course good for varying levels. It is a chance to try something completely new if you've never taken a writing course, or for someone with experience to come in and lay down some ideas by the end of the semester."
