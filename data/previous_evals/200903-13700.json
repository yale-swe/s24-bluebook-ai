    "I very much enjoy the subject of governance. The readings by O'Neil and Clapp& Dauvergne were particularly useful. It might be interesting to include Gus Speth's latest book in the readings next year, to show how his \"Worldview\" changed over time...",
    "The short reading essays really contributed to my comprehension of the material.The prof explained theories very well and used practical examples, which was very helpful.",
    "The papers provided that was for a great help for the understanding of the different aspects of international environmental governance and policies.",
    "The homework and class activities and exercises were very helpful to understand in a practical way the theories and concepts that we were learning in class.The material, articles and lectures were very interesting.The participation of guest lecturers was very valuable and interesting.",
    "The new concepts of practiced sustainability are interesting.",

    "In some ways the response essays felt a little repetitive - it appeared each time we were simply applying the Worldviews to a problem. While this is helpful, it might be good to dedicate one response essay to something completely different - perhaps to something like \"Governmentality\"...",
    "The prof was out of town for two classes and we had several guest speakers. I would have liked to have more classroom time with the profs rather than from guest speakers.",
    "The instruction will need to provide feedbacks to assignments some days after the deadline and not at the end of the course so that we can improve our skills and our understanding over the classes.",
    "Professor Cashore should revise the assignments. I would have been more engaged by fewer, more developed assignments as opposed to the barrage of busy work and long assignments we received.",

In terms of fitting in with the rest of my studies, I believe it helps me to understand the workings of institutions and the \"hidden\" relationships between the 4 IR theories and the 4 Worldviews.",
