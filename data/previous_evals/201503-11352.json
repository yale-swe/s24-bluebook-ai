    "Directed Studies isn't for everyone, but I loved it. If you like reading a lot of literature really quickly, and are okay with picking up and dropping books like Leonardo di Caprio does with models, definitely take DS Lit. (Or just DS, and then you'll have to take Lit.) Slanski is a great professor, and you'd be lucky to have her.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student if it was a stand-alone class, but it is worth it to take this class if you like Philosophy and HP. Also, your class will probably be largely dependent on your professor and how you like to learn. Also it will depend on if you like Lit classes in the first place, which I don't really. Honestly I just took it because I wanted to take Philosophy and HP. I would recommend it overall because DS is fun and writing the papers can be an almost enjoyable at times.",
    "Lots of work. Do the reading - it's very rich and foundational in the Western Canon. Professor Slanski is well known, but realize that in her class she focuses much more on small ideas than looking at the work as a whole.",
    "I left every class with a newfound appreciation for literature. Prepare yourself for unexpected connections between works, long but meaningful silences, and eye-opening paper comments from a highly qualified professor",
    "very demanding, and anxiety inducing, but it is an experience that will reshape the way you read every book.",
    "I would absolutely recommend DS Lit. The books and discussions, along with the essays, really make you think!",
    "Yes, but I would ask them if they like Ancient Greek Literature first. Reading the texts in this course is difficult if one is not interested in the subject and type of literature.",
    "DS Literature provides the foundations of literature in the western cannon. I would not ask to change any book on the syllabus.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student if they are very interested in classical literature."
