   "comments": [
    "U.S.-Mexico Borderlands covers some really interesting issues -- if you're interested in learning about violence and the femicide on the border, labor issues and labor organizing, or the drug wars, take this class. Plenty of interesting readings about the realities of life on the border, but also too many dry theoretical readings. The work is very manageable, and Professor Gutierrez Najera is very approachable and a great resource.",
    "Since Professor G isn't going to be at Yale anymore, I don't know how relevant this review will be. There's some great information, but it's just a middle-of-the-road class. A lot depends on seminar discussion, and since there's so much reading (that not everyone does), what I actually got out of each class wasreally uneven from week to week.",
    "The material is very interesting and focused, and it's an important subject to understand these days. However, I was a little disappointed that classes weren't more discussion based. There's also a lot of reading some weeks. But overall the workload is manageable.",
    "Yes, interesting reading, good professor, and manageable workload.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Very interesting class that deals with issues of race and gender along the US-Mexico Border. Integrated sociology and anthropology with some politics. A lot of reading but you do not need to do it all to get by in class. Workload is a few reading responses and a midterm and final essay (10-12 pages). Not too much work for a seminar.",
    "A good overview of the sociopolitics of the US-Mexico borderlands. Enjoyable, informative. Discussion is not great but the material you get from it is. It most likely won't be taught again, though, as the professor is visiting from Dartmouth. Maybe try Pitti's class.",
    "A great class, would recommend to anyone seeking to get a better understanding of the borderland and America's long history with Mexico.",
    "A good overview class of the US-Mexico border in the current era. Great class discussion although I wouldn't take it unless you are already curious about the subject. Definitely a great class to learn more about the interactions between the US-Mexico government.I would recommend."
