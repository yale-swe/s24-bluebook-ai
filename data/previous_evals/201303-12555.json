   "comments": [
    "Computer Networks is a great class that I would definitely recommend taking, especially with Professor Yang. One of the best parts about Computer Networks is that Professor Yang will teach topics based off of student interest. Our year, we spent a large amount of time on network applications (HTTP, SMTP, FTP, YouTube, Netflix, Akamai, BitTorrent, etc.), but if student interest is for topics lower down on the network stack, Professor Yang will shift the focus of the lectures. The workload is above average but is definitely manageable. Our year, we had 2 written assignments, 1 relatively easy programming assignment, and 2 long programming assignments (building web servers and TCP). In Computer Networks, you learn a lot of tools, principles, and information that are important to know as a computer science major. Really, take any class with Professor Yang.",
    "I definitely recommend it, together with decentralized systems. These two work so well together.",
    "Your basic introductory networking class. Content seems to vary a lot year to year based on Yang Yang's mood. Be aware that all the programming assignments are in Java.",
    "A great class! The best systems-related class I've taken at Yale. Take it if you're at all interested in practical computer science. _____ CONTENT: Networks info will be useful if you plan on working on hardware, web startups, or if you just want to learn why your torrents are going slowly. It's a thorough overview of how the interwebz work. _____ SPECIFIC CONTENT: the class goes over the different layers - network, application, transport, physical. It also looks into basic theoretical concepts: modelling network flows, dealing with signal interference, congestion, and routing. All of the Powerpoint slides are put online, and are generally very clear. _____ PROFESSOR: Professor Yang is one of the clearest and most interesting CS professors I've had. He has a lot of interesting related research and really knows the material from top-to-bottom. His lecturing is very clear, somewhat conversational, and sometimes funny! He gladly answers questions without seeming intimidating. _____ WORK: the workload is heavy - make sure you've finished CPSC 323. You're basically writing large-scale programs from scratch, so make sure you think out the high-level structure of your code. It helps to have experience building real applications. There are fewer assignments, so the workload is probably 1\/3 to 1\/2 the hours of CPSC 323. _____ SPECIFIC WORK: there are 5 problem sets and 2 exams. 2 are easy and written. One involves writing a ping server with different concurrency methods - this is fairly easy. One involves writing an HTTP server using sockets. The largest one involves writing a TCP handler. The exams go over theoretical content from the slides. _____ SUMMARY: take this class unless you're only into theoretical CS. It's useful, well-taught, and interesting!",
    "This course is indeed pretty interesting, but do not take warnings about the workload lightly. I probably spent as much time on this course as I did on 323, maybe even more. If you want to learn all about the protocols that make the internet work and if you are prepared to have this course dominate your semester, take the class; otherwise, skip it.",
    "This class will teach you a huge amount about networks. Two of the five assignments (HTTP server and TCP\/IP) are very long, but extremely worthwhile. Start them early enough, and you'll be fine.",
    "The class is a lot of work, but you should take it. The material is important for most types of jobs in industry.You should also start the TCP and Webserver assignments early. You think they wont take you that long, and you're wrong. They will each take at least 20 hours.",
    "I understand how the internet works a lot better after taking this class. It's one of the most important and fundamental CS classes that every major should take. The class is not too much work consistently. The only two assignments that took a long time were servers and TCP. All the other assignments were pretty straight forward and the two midterms were also very fair. Prof. Yang also has amazing lecture slides so you don't need to take notes during class. I would definitely recommend going to every class though since I felt that I got a lot out of it by doing so.",
    "I would recommend the class. Unlike a lot of Yale CS class, networking is something we deal with every day. There's a taste of theory, but largely the class is very applied.",
    "Yes.",
    "Really hard course, but worth it if you have the time. You go through the network stack and learn about the different layers, with an emphasis on the application layer (ie. HTTP, SMTP, etc). I struggled a bit but it was worth it. Definitely try to take a class with Professor Yang before graduating.",
    "A must-take for anyone who will be dealing with networks (e.g. the Internet). You learn a ton of very applicable information like how web servers work, while also learning the theory behind the field and some general topics like concurrent programming.",
    "This course is very well organized. However some of the topics covered are too abstract for such an applied subject that it could seem a bit dry for some people. The professor is always prepared and does a great job covering the material but at times rushes through important topics. Exams are not difficult but expect to spend a great deal of time in the problem sets, which are also harshly graded."
