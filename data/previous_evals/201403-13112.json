   "comments": [
    "I think everyone should take introductory English. Section is very interactive and the discussions are interesting and wide-ranging. You get out of this class what you put in: consider the texts you read in a way that interests you and bring your perspective to section. You write a few papers and I think each time your approach improves a little bit. Not a lot of work at all and intellectually engaging.",
    "Templanza is great. The class totally improves your writing skills and your critical readings and writing skills when it comes to literature. Difficult readings and challenging papers. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "ENGL 115 with Professor Templanza was a great course. I think the reason I found this class to be so valuable, was the way in which it challenged me. The literature we read in class was not easy by any means, and beyond merely understanding the meaning of each piece, I had to participate confidently in class discussion in order to share my thoughts. This was difficult at first, but gradually, I became more comfortable. Additionally, the papers vastly improved my writing abilities. I will always attribute the newfound confidence I have in my ability to write and read analytically to Professor Templanza. This is why I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "This was an interesting class especially since it was so small. Some works are more fun to read than others. I learned a lot about literary analysis essays. I struggled to grasp the concept in the beginning but in the end I think I improved a lot. There is a decent amount of reading but it's definitely manageable. I don't regret taking this class but I'm also not thrilled about it.",
    "Good intro to literary writing.",
    "It is an interesting course that offers a ton. It truly helps one understand the complexity of the works associated with war."
