   "comments": [
    "This is a very critical course for students who wish to pursue further studies in STEMS. Students with prior knowledge of single-variable calculus are STRONGLY recommended to take this course, at the freshmen year.",
    "Math 120 gives a fairly good introduction to multivariable calculus. Like a reasonable number of Math 120 students, I had already studied some multivariable calculus prior to taking this course, and I think that I benefitted from that. The workload is not bad - weekly problem sets plus two midterms and the final. Professor Steinerberger is an excellent instructor. He explains the material in a manner that is both clear and engaging, and manages to find humor in what could otherwise be a dry subject. If you are considering taking Math 120, I would definitely recommend his section.",
    "Very informative, provides the basics if you're trying to go into any STEM field. My experience was positive, but I heard it depends on the teacher.",
    "I would recommend this class only if the student in question is absolutely certain that he or she is going to study pure math. It is a very hard class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who has any interest in anything math related.",
    "Maybe. If they really like math.",
    "Math 120 has a pretty bad reputation, and I think that has in part to do with the fact that for may freshmen this is the first class they are taking in which they aren't at the top. Being a sophomore in a mostly freshmen class I could not a difference. If you are comfortable asking question when you don't understand and taking confusion as an assessment of personal worth the class is honestly fine. If you don't let ego get in the way it is a generally manageable class. The review sessions before midterms are great resources and really help one focus on what and how you should study.",
    "Fine class for a required prerequisite if you plan on doing math\/science",
    "MATH 120 is not a class for the casual math student (i.e. \"just taking it for premed,\" or \"I just want to try it because math is okay I guess\"). The subject is admittedly very interesting, but the struggle that comes with preparing for the exams and dealing with the strict and unforgiving grading scale is (in my opinion) not quite worth the intellectual gratification. Taking this class without being prepared for a relatively heavy course load and difficult exams would be a mistake.",
    "If you like math and science, multivariable calculus is a good thing to learn.",
    "Math 120 is a fast paced math class. If you are able to complete the problem sets on your own, then you should be fine for this course.",
    "If you have taken Multi before you will do will, and if not, you are not going to do well. For an intro math class, there is virtually no curve and you should expect that your grade will not be good. For all your hard work, you will also have an inadequate comprehension of the material, since the course requires a full syllabus to be covered in a certain amount of time; you never have time to absorb the material and the textbook is mostly unhelpful and stale.",
    "I would highly recommend NOT taking this class. Take the engineering version, or really anything else.",
    "Math 120 is a pretty comprehensive overview of multivariable calculus. It progresses through five chapters or so of the textbook in a straightforward manner. Not proof based. The class varies a lot by section. Students who were in the good sections (Havlikova, Bookman, and I think Gonzalez) really enjoyed their classes and did well, I think. However, other teachers really do a bad job (a friend told me to avoid Epa's section at all costs). My section, with Stefan, was a mixed bag. On the one hand, he's a humorous, young guy and is quite prepared to interact with you and help out on administrative things etc. He offers interesting interjections on math history and is clearly enthusiastic about the subject. However, his explanation of the concepts was often not very clear. Most of the examples were straight out of the textbook, and I found it much easier to understand when I followed along in the textbook. I think one big thing Stefan didn't do a good job of explaining was how to decide which theorem\/concept to apply to what problems. The problem sets and in-class examples were easy enough because it was given to us how to approach the problem. However, when tests came around, I got tripped up because I had no idea which theorem etc. to use.",
    "It's a difficult class, but I think it's well worth it. Multivariable calculus is just an incredibly interesting subject, and I feel like I learned a lot in the semester I took it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you are seriously interested in math, or have very good quantitative reasoning skills.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 only if you need it for your major because it gets challenging towards the end of the semester in terms of concepts, and its not that relevant to many areas of interest. The class itself is a straightforward math class, and really I think the only thing that determines if you should take this class is whether or not you need to.",
    "Math 120 was challenging but I enjoyed it because of my particular instructor. I would only recommend it to a student who absolutely must complete course for their major or program."
