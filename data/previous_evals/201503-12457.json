    "This class is one of the best science classes I've taken at Yale. Each week, you read 2-3 research articles related to a signaling pathway and then each class you break down the papers. By the end of the class, I felt like my ability to critically evaluate scientific research had increased immensely (especially since you don't just read high profile papers--Professor Crews loves JBC), and as a result I feel much more prepared to pursue a career in science. It's also incredibly cool to be able to learn so closely from a more senior faculty member like Professor Crews, an opportunity that I haven't really found in any of my other biology classes. The class isn't too much work at all on a week-to-week basis, and while the final grant proposal is pretty long, it's also a pretty interesting and doable exercise. A great seminar to take if you're looking for an intimate class that will help you grow as a scientist.",
    "A great class to get a good grasp on reading primary literature. Before this class I couldn't get through a paper and completely understand it on my own but definitely became very efficient at reading papers by the end of the semester. For the first few classes it would take me a good 7 hours to get through each paper but I can comfortably read a paper and understand figures and experiments in a couple of hours now. Dr. Crews is what you wish every other Yale professor to be, always open to suggestions about the class and willing to meet outside of class if you need help or want to discuss your grant proposal topic.",
    "This class is challenging but very rewarding. You will learn to analyse and think critically about scientific literature and your ideas about what makes good science will be challenged. This is one of those courses where how much you get out of it depends on how much you put in. So, put this class in your priority list. You might be intimidated at first, after all, it is an Advanced Seminar. But, don't fret! Don't be afraid to ask questions even if you think they are dumb. No question is dumb! Especially ask questions during seminar because many other students may not know either. And the students that do understand, they will be able to explain. We are all students here and we are all learning-- so ask, ask and ask! The grant is the most rewarding assignment I have done for a science course at Yale. Put some effort into it-- it's worth it. Trust me. You will gain a new confidence in scientific thinking, one that you did not have before. Good luck!",
    "Absolutely take this course. This course is why you came to Yale, why you love learning. It is why you challenge yourself and why you decided to study biology. It will push you and it will make you a significantly better scientist. It is a couple papers a week, a presentation, a midterm, and a final grant proposal. Week to week, the work was low, just reading papers and looking up some methods. However, the work is heavily skewed towards the midterm (the abstract and specific aims of your grant), and your final grant. Yes the grant proposal is daunting, but it can be accomplished, and you will be extremely proud of your work at the end. Professor Crews is incredibly open about his work and his career which was invaluable. This course is difficult and stressful, but incredibly rewarding, and at the end, you will be thankful you took this course. Do it.",
    "Excellent MCDB seminar - my favorite of the ones I've taken, probably one of the best of any classes I've taken at Yale. If you're interested in research, this would be a very useful and fun class for you to take. Prof. Crews is extremely knowledgeable and cares about teaching this class, so I'd say it's worth taking it just for him. Signal transduction is also generally a useful subject to have some background in. Just take it!"
