    "good course to map theory to papers.",
    "I would probably recommend going and prioritizing the time spent. It is worthwhile to read in advance article with methods that could be used in the future, and it's probably not too bad to invest less in lesson that aren't as relevant for future work",
    "Course is very fragmented. The three components do not fit together. There is no homework, so there is no incentive to keep up with readings or to try to understand the (very complicated) papers. The course needs to do better with teaching students how to use econometrics. Only take if required for your programotherwise, there are better ways to learn econometrics.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students in the econ department who need to fulfill the second year econometrics paper requirement. It is a useless course otherwise. But it does not have to be this way. If the course were adjusted to cover more standard material and have more assignments in which students could practice applying the topics covered in class (even if these assignments are not graded), that would improve the course. Asking professors to teach the course who actually know how to and care about teaching would be an easy way to improve the course, though from what I have seen, these skills are neither valued nor encouraged by either the department or the university itself.",
    "Somewhat useful. The course would benefit from giving small, non intensive, practical homework assignments of the sort of download this data set & apply the technique we just discussed. Would make learning much more effective.",
    "Focus on areas that will help you in future work."
