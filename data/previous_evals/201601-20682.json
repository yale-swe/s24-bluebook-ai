   "comments": [
    "Hard, but worthwhile. So many WOW! revelation moments each class. So many important authors. Also, taking DS with the DUS is fantastic. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "The most intellectually interesting and stimulating class that is just really fun.",
    "Though the course itself doesn't have much continuity connecting the works, the variety of readings ensures that there will be at least one that really appeals to you. Many of these are radical, history-altering works that everyone should read before graduating. The amount of reading is fairly manageable and pretty consistently interesting. You get out what you put in, and class discussion is often illuminating, frequently often helping you understand, clarify, and articulate your own thoughts and feelings on certain subjects.",
    "For me, I wanted to read the texts from before arriving to Yale, so I found the material more engaging this semester than last. Professor Slanski's method of running section is at times hit-or-miss, with some texts brushed and left aside. She grades primarily on the writing rather than the content, which is slightly different from the rest of my DS professors. Overall, it is a rewarding course with rewarding texts.",
    "I would highly recommend this course - not only do students engage with subjects that are still highly relevant today (both inside and outside of the general realm of politics) but also have the opportunity to collaborate with fantastic colleagues and professors.",
    "You will do a lot of reading about the foundations of modern government.",
    "Great course, great faculty, great community. DS is painful, and you'll learn only as much as you commit; but you won't find anything like it elsewhere in Yale--not taking DS will be the biggest regret of your Yale career.",
    "I like DS and the selection of books in the HP syllabus is amazing, but try to get another professor. Slanski is not trained in the HP discipline and often she will not really understand the text."
