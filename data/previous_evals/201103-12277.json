    "It depends on the expectations of the student. I expected to really learn how to work with wood- i. e. lots of techniques. This didn't happen, so i'll admit i was pretty disappointed in the end. That being said, it was nice to have a class that was very hands on, I was happy to spend hours and hours working on my projects. This class may be a nice compliment to a busy schedule.",
    "This class is introduction to sculpture in wood. Pretty self explanatory. The class is structured around developing ideas for sculpture and then learning how to make it in the shop. You learn a lot, but as everyone says, everything takes longer than you think it will take. To really do the job right, you need to take your time, do lots of tests, and be patient as you mess up over and over again. If you put in the time and effort, the class and the product are immensely rewarding.",
    "Once things had settled down (there were some complications at the beginning of the semester), Julian took charge of the class. We read some interesting essays on sculpture, though the conversations that followed normally felt uninvolved. We worked on two sculptures for the entire semester, which is good if you know what you want to do. It can be frustrating if you're used to producing more, especially because learning about the machinery and how to make cuts is very time-consuming. I recommend the class as a way to break from any other medium you've been studying in. Hands on work in wood can be very satisfying.",
    "YES. DEFINITELY! There is no place on Yale like the woodshop. You learn how to handle wood, and notice details about warping wood, textures, grain, colors, and species more than ever before. It's a beautifully physical and visual class.",
    "I learned a lot about how to do basic things with wood. Wood is a challenging material and so the student needs to know what he or she is getting herself into. I knew nothing about building before this class so it was hard and making a \"good\" piece of art is even harder. I would recommend the class to anyone but keeping these ideas in mind. Also, it's important to note that Julian's very young and this seems like his first time teaching.",
    "Great class if you know what you want to do with the shop and you're willing to put in a lot of effort and time to get it done. A lot of freedom is given to get out of the class what you want. But everything takes at least 10 hours more than you expect. Don't take it if you're not willing to put in effort. The crits are great, but outside of the crits, there's not much leading in terms of artistic creation. Which is good if you know what you want to make but for someone new to art it might be a little unsatisfying. Julian is great at helping you do what you want to, however, in the shop and on the machines and everything.",
    "The class in an introduction to both woodworking and sculptural art. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in both tackling the technical skills of wood and in exploring how one can represent larger ideas visually.",
    "Disregard any evaluations from before 2011, because the professor has changed and the class is completely different from before. That said, it's still a good class, and probably somewhat less work than before (though the class will probably be different anyways the next time Julian teaches it). If you're looking for a good introduction to contemporary sculpture that actually involves making pieces, this is definitely a great class for that. As far as I can tell, Scott, the old professor of this class, focused much more on technique than we did this semester, so you're certainly not going to learn to make an ornate cabinet or a grand piano or something like that. To anyone hoping that this class will teach you how to make anything useful (i.e. furniture), while you certainly can use it as a jumping-off point for learning those types of skills, this class is about art, not furniture-making or even carpentry."
