   "comments": [
    "ANTH 170 is a thorough look at China's history and how its history shapes its culture today. I would recommend this to any student; it's a great social science credit, and would be interesting for anyone, even those with no prior knowledge of China. There is a lot of reading, but it really is helpful to do the reading and go to all the lectures. You'll need it for the midterms and final.",
    "Excellent introduction to anthropology with a slight historical bent. Really good instructor and TF, simple, low-stress assessments and great for a broad survey of Chinese history.",
    "Lecture is extremely dry, section is barely bearable. Huge drop in attendance midway through the semester, but the workload is manageable.",
    "Yes, overall I really enjoyed the class and I learned a great deal but the information was kind of hard to follow, especially since we went over time a lot and it seemed like we didn't really stay on track. George was nice, but sometimes, the section times seemed kind of useless.",
    "Would recommend!",
    "Great survey course of China through its whole history, with a mainly anthropological focus.",
    "It is a great class and you will learn a lot of interesting things, but be sure to be already interested in Chinese studies.",
    "Great lecture class; well-curated selection of compelling readings; crucial for anyone who wants to learn more about China; Professor Siu is incredibly gracious, and of course thoroughly knowledgeable about the subject; thought-provoking exams that really tie everything together; would definitely recommend",
    "This course makes you question all the assumptions (that you don't even know you have) of the world and of people."
