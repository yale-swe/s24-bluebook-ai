    "Learned Creative Cloud programs, Rhino, model making skills, drafting skills, and critical visual thinking. This was a great first studio in the Arch. design track.",
    "Lots of drawing, Rhino, working through ideas with sketch models; this class is really about pushing production as you refine your ideas.",
    "I have learned so much in this course! I've learned how to manage a LOT of work. I've gotten better at drawing. I learned how to actually make things that look nice on Photoshop. I learned to use some tools in the shop to make wooden models. I've started to figure out an aesthetic style. I've had space and time to explore ideas related to space and art and architecture.",
    "I learned how to design!",
    "This has been the most formative class, if I can call it that, that Ive ever taken.",
    "I learned how to think creatively and efficiently, and how to not be afraid to tackle complex and abstract design problems\/prompts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is SUPER time consuming, in a way that is bad if you don't like architecture or your peers. However, if you do like architecture, this will be so immensely fulfilling and you will learn so much (whether it feels like it or not in the moment). Strengths: - amazing, dedicated TAs and TRATTIE IS AMAZING, PRECIOUS, WONDERFUL, TRANSCENDENTAL - field trips were not only incredibly fun but also very inspiring and rejuvenating; I always left super motivated to work and with fresh creative juices - you really do end up learning so much; the class might feel kind of all over the place sometimes but at the end it really comes together Weaknesses: - the first third\/half of the semester felt like a front loading of work (most memorable lows were the 36 draws due at the end of shopping period and that one assignment where we have 11 deliverables due (biome)). Maybe these moments were necessary for forming the studio environment which is hardworking and very present but it really sucked in the moment lol",
    "You get to spend a lot of time with your class as they are mostly all sharing your major, you get to be really creative while learning how to express that creativity in a way that provides structure and space. Trattie and the TFs gave really helpful feedback, even though it was sometimes stressful to have feedback given so frequently.",
    "The strengths are an amazing community, wonderful TFs who support you through the entire semester, and a professor who really really cares. The class, in its vague abstractness, encourages students to explore and create really interesting, unique projects. As for weaknesses, at some points the workload felt unnecessarily high. In addition, at the beginning of the course, it was easy to feel really anonymous, which is difficult in a class that is so small and so production based. I feel like Trattie could have done a little homework to at least learn all of our names earlier in the semester. There isn't really any true feedback in the course either. Because everyone is doing such individual, personal work, its difficult to tell how you are doing. Of course there was feedback at the reviews and we had midsemester check-ins with Trattie, but it was still unclear what was expected and whether we were fulfilling those expectations.",
    "A LOT of work in the first half, and much more spread out in the second. This organization is probably intentional on Trattie's part, but just be prepared to work a lot before fall break.",
    "I think studio is amazing but is objectively more work than any other credit and a half course at Yale. We have to do a better job setting and managing workloads in studio because while high production increases the speed of learning to a point I felt apathy beginning to set in for our entire studio by the end because we were just struggling to invest in the process of making.",
    "Strengths are Trattie and the TAs. They are some of the greatest people you will ever encounter (although the TAs do change each semester, unfortunately). The course was also organized around a central theme, and I think they did a good job of tying the projects back to this theme while still giving us a TON of creative freedom. I thought the woodshop\/modeling workshops were super helpful, but I would have loved more of these all-class tutorials. While it was great to have class time to work, sometimes you felt that you didn't actually acquire a lot of the skills you needed until you direly needed them and then had to seek out help on your own. There was often talk about leading computer program tutorials such as CAD and Revit but these never happened even though it seemed a lot of people wanted more exposure to these more practical architectural design skills."

   "comments": [
    "I would do it all over again and again and again and again, etc... Trattie's studio was the perfect first studio.",
    "You have to take this course if you're majoring in arch and concentrating in Design, and it's the first real studio class anyone studying architecture will take, so it helps you learn what the work and presentation culture is for architecture.",
    "In hindsight, I loved this course. In the moment, it was a rollercoaster. The class is very intense. Especially in the beginning, the emphasis on production feels overwhelming. At certain moments, I thought very seriously about dropping the architecture major. But in others, I felt elated, filled to the brim with excitement about my work and pride in the work my classmates were producing. The community we built throughout the semester is something that you will find in no other major at Yale. The 17 people in our class became a strange little family. The late nights and early mornings and cramped hands from hours of drawing were bearable and even enjoyable, because of the support of my friends and our amazing TFs and Trattie.",
    "Only take this if you are an architecture major or your name is Kayley Estoesta.",
    "Well you have to take it if you're on the design track; I'm not sure I would recommend it to an Urban student or someone in a different major since it kind of consumes most of your time\/life (in a wonderful way! but nevertheless, consumes it). I know the workload seems intimidating but you will gain a whole new group of best friends who are enduring it right along with you that makes it so totally worth it 3"
