   "comments": [
    "It was great!!! Made me want to do G&G. I loved the course and how it made me think about a lot of processes on Earth that I didn't even consider before. It changes your perspective on time and the world. Really life-changing. Take this class!",
    "Great survey class to geology and earth's processes!",
    "Oh boy... so: Interesting class, difference in the two lecture styles was stark and frankly Danny's lectures were straight off the powerpoint and went way too fast to comprehend most of the information. Dave's were a lot better. Grading on midterms\/final could have been a lot more clear in terms of both what was required for full credit and what you got points deducted for, which was very frustrating. Probably would have been a smoother class when Evans was still teaching it, but still learned a lot and got a solid intro to the major. If you have to take it for the major, you'll enjoy it.",
    "Dynamic Earth is essentially a very comprehensive introductory course to the geology major. I would recommend this course to anybody who has a strong interest in geology. However, this is definitely not a gut science class and probably should not be taken by people just looking to fill their science credit. I made the mistake of taking this class for that purpose and, though I did learn a lot in the course, was a bit overwhelmed by its rigor and also the fact that everyone else in the class was a prospective geology major (and thereby came in with a much stronger base knowledge than I.)",
    "It is a great intro science course",
    "G&G 110 provides a concrete overview of the geological sciences. It both serves as a prerequisite for students planning to major in the department and as an introduction to the subject for non-science majors (of which I was one), so it is versatile and accessible. Yes, I would recommend it to a fellow studentespecially if he or she is able to take the lab along with the lecture. (Sadly, I was unable to take the lab, but from my observations of my classmates, it was clear that the lab helps to connect all the pieces of lectures and make the material all the more real and lively!)",
    "Solid intro to Geology, but perhaps a bit basic for math\/physics-heavy students. The lectures are well done and entertaining, but seem to follow the textbook pretty closely, so do one or the other really well and half-ass the second. The professors themselves are really warm-hearted and you should definitely get to know them well. Take the mid-term roadtrip, too - it's a blast!",
    "I would recommend for anyone who has an interest in learning geology. Good intro course, lots of individual attention to the students."
