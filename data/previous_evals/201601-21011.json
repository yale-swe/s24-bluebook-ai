   "comments": [
    "Most of the stories are beautiful, but a few times I felt we spent too much time on a text and I would think whether the author actually meant any of the things we were alluding to. I also thought Prof. Grigoryan supported specific students' opinions a bit too often. She is very informed on what she teaches.",
    "RUSS 023 is an amazing class, and by far the best class I've taken at Yale so far (and maybe will ever take). Professor Grigoryan is truly incredible - approachable, enthusiastic about the material, funny, etc. The text selection is great too. The reading-load is on the low side (we had roughly 30 pages for each class), which allowed me to read everything very closely and thus led to great class discussions. The syllabus is organized well and the shorter essay assignments definitely helped to strengthen my writing, as I had to condense all my ideas into 3-4 pages. A great, great freshman seminar that I would recommend 100%.",
    "I would highly recommend Russian Storytelling to every freshman at Yale. It is an incredible opportunity to read stories from and learn about a rich and exciting culture. The amount of reading is quite manageable--only a very short story or two for each class--and the essays are short, focused, and can be edited and re-submitted. In addition, the discussions are engaging and eye-opening. I learned so much not just about Russia, but about storytelling, about narrators, about the role of the reader, and about how to truly analyze literature.",
    "This class is a good overview of Russian literature through the genre of the short story. The workload is manageable and the class is incredibly fun. I'd recommend it to anyone.",
    "Its a really good freshman seminar if you're looking to learn how to write and analyze literature. the readings are relatively easy and interesting to read.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to Freshman. The class gives you a comprehensive understanding of the Russian short story and opens up new interest in Russian literature as a whole.",
    "Seminar simply based on analyzing short stories and connecting them to the history of the time during which they were written. I would recommend this course to a student only if they are interested in writing by Russian authors and enjoy seminar type classes.",
    "Take this course! The freshman seminar environment is really cool, the readings are short and interesting, and Grigoryan is awesome. I felt the most intellectually stimulated and passionate I have all year, and I enjoyed the papers. Take it!"
