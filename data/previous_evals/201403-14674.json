   "comments": [
    "This course is a great way to learn about art and architecture to which you might not otherwise be exposed. The monuments and artworks studied are beautiful and fascinating to learn about. However, sometimes lectures seemed to stay on the surface, or only examine an issue or artwork from one angle (this might be difficult to remedy, since it is an intro class, and only a 50 minute lecture). Perhaps slightly fewer objects and more in-depth analysis could be fruitful? This is a small thing, but lecture often started five minutes late and ran five minutes over: not a big deal for me personally, but others with classes following HSAR 118 often had to miss the last few minutes of lecture because it was running over. Overall, take it if you're curious about the material, but don't expect too much in-depth analysis or discussion.",
    "Absolutely, I would recommend this class to anyone, whether they're considering being an art history major or not. The professor is really knowledgable and insightful and the material is beautiful and fascinating. There's not too much writing or required reading and it really gives you a comprehensive overview of Islamic art. No Middle Eastern background knowledge is required and you get a lot of appreciation for Islamic art and architecture.",
    "I would definitely encourage anyone with an interest in Islamic art to take this course! The lectures offer a thoughtful and cohesive overview of a wide range of material, while the sections allow you to discuss these topics in depth-- and to make several interesting trips to the YUAG! The strength of the course lies largely in its ability to allow for the critical analysis of specific pieces and also to provide you with a broader, historical framework for Islamic Art. Thus, I felt that I not only learned about important works in the cannon of Islamic Art, but also that I gained a vocabulary for talking about these pieces thoroughly. In short, it's well taught and very comprehensive-- take it!",
    "Highly recommend! An incredible low-stress class with a ton of interesting material you won't get anywhere else"
