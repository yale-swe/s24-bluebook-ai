    "I CAN READ!! I can't speak, like at all, I felt like I could speak better after L2, but like, I can kinda read and it's pretty dang satisfying. That being said I STILL HATE THE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT YALE :D",
    "I became a better spanish speaker",
    "I gained the ability to speak and write in Spanish",
    "better understanding of Spanish language and culture, more confidence in reading and speaking",
    "I increased GREATLY in my Spanish-speaking, writing, hearing, and reading skills. What I loved most about this class was how it reviewed many of the concepts we learned in prior language classes, allowing us to better appreciate them. This review also helped me to clear up many of the misconceptions that I had about Spanish. I now feel far more confident about using and learning Spanish."

    "The language requirement sucks! K, that being said, actual things... the class could be improved by not focusing so much on strictly grammar and also on application of grammar, like awesome, I can write an essay, but I can't speak. If I go to Peru they're not going to be like, \"Hi! Please order your food in essay format\". Nope. It's going to be me, stuttering through some broken phrase because I can't verbally think on my feet. Also, also! The tests should test vocab! Like, why say I need to know vocab and then not test on it? It makes me feel like I don't need to study it then I learn less. The first chapter would be tested on the quiz, then the second chapter of vocab wouldn't be on the test. Weird. Also, if my below ratings of the course are suboptimal it has NOTHING to do with Fernando, man was just following the course structure, he was fantastic.",
    "It could be paced slower",
    "Can be very boring. Is very simple if you keep up with everything",
    "Strengths: - Reviews prior concepts from other courses - Greatly encourages speaking and writing - Lots of feedback - Reading and discussing stories greatly helped my comprehension of Spanish - Class discussions improved my speech and comprehension of Spanish Weaknesses: - Could encourage more out-of-class work - Textbook was mainly in English; professor still taught the class in Spanish, which helped, but I still felt that this took away from my experience a bit"

    "Pretty good class and not a bad way to fulfill a language requirement.",
    "Do it for the language req or if you want to learn to write spanish, if you want to learn to speak Spanish take it over the summer and go abroad, this class primarily focuses on writing if taken at Yale. As for my prof... FERNANDOOOOO! That man is great! Honestly. I kinda despise the language req, but he made it really painless. I suck at Spanish, but I'm dumb enough to still try even though, let's face it, I've been taking it for 5 years (including high school), and it's obviously just not happening. So yeah. My Spanish is bad, but he didn't give up on me. He still called on me, and gently corrected me, and even though 90% of the time I was wrong, I never felt embarassed. I dunno, it was cool, he's a good guy. I've taken L1-L3 here and he was def my favorite prof so far. The first two were fine, but I was always a little nervous in those classes, and he just managed to make the envrionment of this class really relaxed, which is ideal for learning, but still challenged us.",
    "Definitely take the course with Fernando!",
    "Take it with Fernando! Super chill guy, very approachable and fun, really loves his students. Made this class THAT much better",
    "Definitely. It helps one to really understand what it means to be a Spanish speaker. It helps to review many concepts without ever being redundant or slow. It's the perfect means of continuing on from L2 and getting ready for L4, as it should be."
