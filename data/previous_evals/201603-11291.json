   "comments": [
    "MCDB 105 is a mostly wonderful course. The first two lecturers, Professor Carlson and Professor Gendron, and terrific. They provide a nuanced explanation of contemporary issues in biology. The third professor, Professor Summers, is one of the worst at Yale. I learned very little from him.",
    "Great course for getting your science credit. It is INTERESTING. I promise! Three distinct units. Basic scientific principles that essentially function as ammo you'll have for the rest of your life when arguing with anti-intellectual nut jobs like Donald Trump or your uncle. You'll get a handle on evolution, plant-life\/fuel, and infections and vaccines and things.",
    "I learned that there is no chance in Hell that I was meant to be a BIO major. Everything about this class was a struggle. I didn't understand what it meant to take notes for a bio class, what is fluff and what is fact was not clear to me. Writing a biology paper is hard",
    "Plants.",
    "Through this course, I learned a lot about infectious diseases, plants and evolution - topics I had varying degrees of familiarity with before. I think it was a nice survey course that went over several topics in some detail, so I was able to gain insight into different areas of biology and also learned a lot about the social components of science, which was interesting.",
    "This class was a good general survey of a few pertinent ethical\/social issues concerned with biology.",
    "I learned biology at a very basic level and got a better grasp on some current topics that are often debated in the media (GMOS, CRISPR, etc).",
    "I have a much better understanding of the world around me for having taken this class. I feel like I learned so much about how diseases spread, treated, politicized, and how they affect different countries around the world differently than in the US. I feel much more informed when I ready current events about immunology, genetics, and the environment, and I feel like I can engage with these topics on a much deeper level.",
    "Received basic training and knowledge in topical world issues related to biology in the modern day.",
    "This class was interesting, but I don't feel like I learned anything.",
    "The main knowledge I gained from this course was a better understanding of the most topical scientific issues and questions facing the world. While the course didn't delve too deeply into any one topic, I definitely left with a better vocabulary about some of the things I read about in the news and online.",
    "Good basic understanding of a broad range of important world issues.",
    "I learned about the social history and basic biological functions of diseases and environmental systems.",
    "How to take notes",
    "This course is a good introduction to some of the overarching topics in biology and the real world issues related to them. A lot was review from high school biology, but I enjoyed discussing the wider issues in section and class time.",
    "This course gave me very interesting perspectives on the politics of infectious disease, plants\/agriculture, and evolution and gave me the basic scientific literacy needed to address these issues as a policymaker\/informed citizen.",
    "That test answers are only correct if the written portion is written down word-for-word as it was in the notes.",
    "Taking AP Biology before taking this course helped tremendously",
    "Learned a great deal of info about bio and life cycle",
    "I have a much better basic knowledge of key scientific hot topics and can talk about them intelligently - a skill set not to be underestimated!",
    "It was cool to write the final paper, using scientific sources as well as news sources.",
    "A broad overview of popular scientific issues",
    "This course was a great introduction to basic biological processes and the relevant ways they relate to social, political and economic issues in the world. The method of scientific investigation and scientific thinking was emphasized in the course and balanced with a need to think of the social implications of scientific inquiry and discovery. The limits of science were also explored.",
    "I gained experience in topics in biology with which I was not familiar, and I think this experience will help me understand issues in public and daily life relating to biology.",
    "A good overview of biological disease, a better understanding about plants, and a few base theories of evolution.",
    "I learned valuable lessons about biology while also developing an understanding of how these biological concepts connect to modern day issues.",
    "I feel I gained insight into the hot topics in biology today--genetics, climate change, evolution--and their ethical implications. I appreciated the scientific background a lot.",
    "Good class",
    "Evolution, Ecology, Plants",
    "I gained a basic familiarity with various hot-topic issues in science today, such as genetic engineering, evolution, and immunology\/vaccination. It was interesting especially to learn about gene editing technologies, as they are increasing relevant and controversial.",
    "Learned about viruses and diseases, blant blindness, evolution",
    "Learned a lot about different interesting topics! Great overview\/introduction to many important issues in bio in the modern day. Final paper was a nice way to look at a topic of personal interest in more depth.",
    "Basic Biological principles that are useful in life"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "John Carlson and Professor Gendron made this course fantastic. The weakness of this course lay entirely with Professor summers. His section of the course was atrocious, and very little material was taught. The only way to improve it is to remove him from teaching.",
    "I wish we talked about the topics in lecture and that were going to be on the tests in section instead of current events.",
    "All lectures were interesting. Exams corresponded well to the material. Review sessions were helpful. A well-structured course.",
    "The weaknesses are that there is a large discrepancy between the teaching style of each of the three teachers. This was especially apparent in how different each of the three midterms were (and how \"prepared\" students felt for each of them).",
    "We should get more guidance on how to write science papers and how to find resources. I felt like I was thrown to the wolves with this paper.",
    "The third part was not as good as the other two.",
    "I think the course is good in that it focuses on three units and does not spend too long on any particular topic, and the assessments were not overly challenging. It might be improved by diversifying the final section on evolution because there isn't a lot to say about the topic in seven lectures without being redundant or going too far in depth.",
    "I think that it was well-organized within each of the modules, but as a whole it seemed a bit disjointed with three different modules that at times did not seem to have much relation to each other.",
    "Professor Carlson was a fantastic professor and I found his lectures very engaging. Professor Gendron was also interesting, although I felt like he oversimplified things too often and treated the students like children. The last section of the class on evolution was not engaging at all. I felt like more time was devoted to learning rhetorical questions that appeared on the powerpoint slides than actual material. I know that this is a science class that is intended for non-science majors (myself included), but I felt like the professors underestimated the students' capacity to learn. I almost wonder if it would be possible to have one professor like Professor Carlson teach the whole course. It was hard to every settle into the class because the professor kept changing. Also, I felt frustrated by my section every week because although my TF, Sally, was fantastic, the other students in the class did not put any work into the course. I like the idea of perhaps including some special sections next year in which students could opt into a more challenging, rigorous section experience.",
    "This was a good science course for non-science majors. Nothing to complex and the material is presented in a way that makes it much easier for a humanities major I think. Not nearly as much wrote memorization as a typical science class. I thought the evolution module was pretty lousy but that was more of a professor issue. Pretty easy and not much work at all. Three nights of studying all semester and one day to bang out a 5 page paper.",
    "I think that the third section of the course, on Evolution, could have been a little bit clearer and more consolidated. All three sections were really interesting though.",
    "Low workload for non-science majors, not interesting material and professors varied in capability and level of engagement.",
    "It's a science class for humanities majors. The three professors did a good job offering digestible explanations of important scientific concepts. My one complaint is that it felt like our level of engagement was limited by course policy. For example, the requirement that the final paper be divided into two sectionsscience and discussionmade it difficult to write a paper focusing strongly on science. I'd imagine they did this so that students wouldn't just write about ethical issues, but at least for me, dividing them in this way made it harder to write the way I wanted.",
    "It will get you a science credit and can be interesting at times.",
    "The first module was very good, the second was good, but the third was terrible. The professor of that module was boring and taught right of his slides. He also just seemed to want to rail against Mike Pence.",
    "I think the main strength of the course is its level of accessibility to non-science students while also being able to remain relevant and interesting. Throughout the entire semester, I was surprised with how fascinated I was by the things we were learning and discussing in section, and I was overall glad that I took the course. I think another strength would be the multiple professors model, as each one was unique and brought their own strengths to the course. I can't really point to any specific weakness, but I do believe some students would have liked to see more rigorous study of the presented topics.",
    "Would have been nice if we had been told about the level of specificity required on the exams, it was often more than expected.",
    "Strengths: overall, the types of things you learn about are generally pretty interesting, and the readings are a decent supplement Tests are in class Gendron and Carlson Weaknesses: test material Summers section big lecture",
    "Strengths: it's easy and interesting (most of the time) Weaknesses: it's easy so people don't put time\/effort into it",
    "The first two sections delved more into information that was unfamiliar to me. I thought the last section was often explanations of concepts that were common knowledge.",
    "Evolution section was fairly repetitive. Could have all been covered in one lecture.",
    "Some professors were boring",
    "The first part of the course on diseases taught by Professor Carlson was very well taught and interesting. He used a lot of real life scenarios and explained the science behind the diseases clearly. One weakness of the course was the third part on evolution. The lectures were not as organized.",
    "Having three different instructors meant the course was taught differently each \"trimester\" of the course. This was frustrating because certain instructors were much more effective and organized than other instructors and because it meant tests were structured differently each time, so students could not really improve from one test to the next in terms of learning how to better address that instructors wants or needs.",
    "The course was a good overview that delved into both the science and issues as promised. The lectures themselves could have been more issues related. The means of assessment was fair overall, although the different format of the last exam through some people off.",
    "I appreciated the dynamic personalities of Profs. Carlson and Gendron especially, which made lectures stimulating and engaging. But in terms of the final project, I thought it asked a little too little of us I would have preferred being able to present a coherent argument about a scientific topic, rather than just a quasi-neutral \"hear all sides\" assignment.",
    "I was very surprised and upset with how the grading of the essay-exams was done. I was expecting more leniency; I would write words that weren't the exact same as the words on the slide at the lecture and then get docked points for it.",
    "Some lectures are well organized and interesting; the disorganization of others was disheartening. Also, the tests were geared toward the scientific knowledge more than the issues associated with them. I think the name of the course should be changed then.",
    "The strengths I think are the rotations between the 3 lecturers which provide a better flow to the class.",
    "Some of the lecturers are better than others.",
    "Great course lots of interesting info",
    "I think overall the expectations for the exams weren't very clear or consistent. The first exam had a practice exam, while the other two didn't. The last exam was very open-ended and if a TA interpreted a question differently, it could be misleading as you took the exam.",
    "The lecture series got progressively worse as the semester progressed. I like the idea of being taught three separate current issues in biology, but the style of each lecturer as well as the quality of the content was vastly different.",
    "Infectious disease unit was extremely interesting - the other two units not so much",
    "A weakness of the course is the lack of the hands-on lab component which would be a useful tool to observe principles that are taught theoretically in class. The discussion section also isn't a very strong supplement to the course. Finally, the final lecturer for the course- Professor Larry Summers- offended many students by integrating heavy handed religious criticisms in his lectures. The other two lecturers were great and very organized. They seemed very enthusiastic about the subject material and their lectures were easy to follow.",
    "There isn't actually a lot of science material in the course except for the first section (of three). The second is not bad. The third is really dry. Perhaps try to vary the lecture styles a little more and enrich the second and third topics.",
    "The course was really interesting and I really enjoyed the first two lecture sections- taught by Professors Carlson and Gendron, but the last section on evolution in schools was boring and felt overdrawn.",
    "The course was excellent at distilling scientific knowledge, and the sections were also very productive at digging into the ethical aspects of the issues. I would have liked the option to look a little more deeply into the science, however.",
    "Stayed a little too basic and had unengaging sections. We had great readings for the sections online but the discussions were at a really low level.",
    "Good class",
    "Fascinating overview of different subject areas within biology",
    "The modules that dealt with current, hot-button issues were the most interesting (gene editing, vaccination, etc.). The modules that dealt with issues that have been more or less settled (at least in the Yale community) felt a little more redundant (i.e. evolution).",
    "strengths--> low workload weakness--> test did not cover the \"issues\" but purely biology",
    "The lectures and sections are great strengths. The professors are some of the best professors at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Issues Approach to another student, but I would warn them that Professor Summers is a terrible professor and this his section of the course is vague, not well presented, and poor.",
    "The course is sneaky hard. The test are very difficult compared to what you may think.",
    "If you need a science, take this one! Manageable for the non-science major and, at least for the first 2\/3 of the class, pretty fun. Go to lecture and you'll be fine for the three exams (non cumulative essay responses spaced out throughout the semester). No weekly work except section which is hit or miss.",
    "If you are a nonscience major then this is the class for you.",
    "I'd strongly recommend Issues Approach, it is a fun class and teaches you a ton of interesting material and facts. The professors are all very funny and engaging, especially Carlson and Gendron.",
    "absolutely not. easier ways to get a science credit for non science people and this course is not interested nor well taught",
    "Yes! Get your science credit, enjoy the info.",
    "Classic gut science",
    "Yes, it's a great science credit for non-science majors.",
    "Yes and No. There are many people who need a science credit and it was good for that but in terms of actually wanting to learn I saw this was a miss.",
    "Yes, if they need a gut science course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student in the humanities who is looking for science credit, because it is a nice combination of both. It is not too much work but still requires effort and understanding of the material, so keep that in mind. Overall it was a painless way to earn a science credit and covered material that is actually really important in today's society, so I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "If you are a non-science major looking for a science credit, this is a good option. However, if you have already taken AP Bio in high school, this course will probably be too easy for you.",
    "I'd recommend this as a 5th class or as a science credit for a non-science major. Not too much work at all and a definite GPA boost. Relatively interesting material as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a humanities student who is looking to gain a better understanding of biological issues which have affected history and continue to affect our daily lives. It is an interesting and well taught class. Definitely the best Distributional Requirement I have taken in all four years.",
    "Just take it for the credit",
    "Its a huge gut. If that is what you want it is perfect.",
    "Yes!",
    "It's an easy science credit, but it was a little less interesting than I had hoped.",
    "I would definitely recommend An Issues Approach to Biology to another student! Being a liberal arts major, I definitely found the course both interesting and accessible. The variety of topics presented in class makes it so the course remains fascinating throughout the semester, and the exams were definitely reasonable (three midterms). The final paper at the end was open ended, which can be fun if you start early. And I personally found the professors great, but I know opinions vary on that front.",
    "Perfect SC credit for non-science people. Decently interesting and a very light workload.",
    "I took this course looking for a science gut. This class is easy to get a B in, but is actually fairly difficult to get an A in, as the exams are much more technical than the focus of section or lecture. As a matter of fact, the required sections are basically useless, as we only debate current issues topics, and our TAs DON'T GRADE OUR WORK- the other TAs do. There are 3 in class exams, and one 5 page paper: not an awful amount of work, and spread out well. Carlson and Gendron are both really great lecturers, while Summers just goes on Mike Pence rants. Overall, I regret taking this course because it's harder than I anticipated. This class is a decent science gut, but try to find something better.",
    "Gut science. First unit is great, second is ok, third is wildly boring and will leave you taking a test on which you have no idea how you can be asked about what the lectures contained.",
    "I would recommend the course as a science credit. The exams were not easy, however, as the questions were many times unclear.",
    "This is an interesting course with a light workload. The emphasis is not on complex biology.",
    "gutty",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the three topics presented. The three tests are not too hard, and the paper is not too long.",
    "Good for an SC credit. Otherwise you won't feel like your life has been changed.",
    "Yes great science credit for non-science majors, tests are fine if you go to lecture.",
    "Some sections of the course are better than others. If you've taken high school biology then this will be mostly review. The issues discussed in section are interesting and the readings are short.",
    "This course is good for developing basic scientific literacy\/if you need a science credit. Depending on the modules and the professor teaching them, the course can be more or less interesting I especially enjoyed our first unit on infectious disease. Absolutely take it if it's something that interests you.",
    "This is a great course for a non-science major that is not strong in any of the science departments. It's general, interesting, and not overwhelming. I would definitely take it again.",
    "Yea. Good easy science credit.",
    "Great class take it",
    "As good as it gets if you're looking for a science gut. Take it.",
    "I think it's important to consider the TA, but found the course to be more enjoyable than I was expecting. But if you hated bio in high school, then this won't be much fun. I do think its topics are very relevant to current issues in the news.",
    "Yes, especially if you are a social science or humanities major needing a science credit. The material is accessible, but the exams will sneak up on you so make sure to take good notes!",
    "Yes, take it if you need a science credit!",
    "I would recommend this course to students who may not have a strong background in science or who didn't take AP Biology. If you put in some effort there is great potential to learn a lot. It is interesting and not too demanding of a course.",
    "This is an easy but fairly interesting bio course designed for non-science majors. You'll go over some basic biology and tie those concepts to ethical and political implications. For the most part, the teaching is fun and engaging. It's an interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for an interesting science class for non science majors.",
    "It's okay and the diseases unit is really interesting actually-- if you're looking for a non-sciencey science credit. If you're actually interested in detailed science, look for another course.",
    "Yes. The course was interesting and easy to follow. A very good science course for non-science majors",
    "I would recommend this course for those in need of an engaging and accessible science credit.",
    "Yes!",
    "Good",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to gain a basic biological understanding of important contemporary issues!",
    "Good SC credit! You will have to study but it's pretty enjoyable and low stress.",
    "I would recommend this course as a very doable science credit for non-science people, with a very manageable workload and fairly interesting material, especially the modules on timely, relevant science issues like gene editing.",
    "It depends on what the student is seeking from the course.",
    "Take it! Interesting topics that aren't too challenging to understand. Definitely great for non-science majors looking for an interesting and relatively laid back course to take.",
    "Take it. Best science credit on the block. You will enjoy class and get a science credit that is not too tasking."
