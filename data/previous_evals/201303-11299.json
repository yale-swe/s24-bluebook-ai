   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. I had never taken an Anthropology class before, and this class opened me up to many new and fascinating themes. I appreciated how broadly scoped the class was as well. Whereas many SAST only focus on one country, this class touched on every SAST nation and provided insightful information about each one. Professor Shneiderman is extremely knowledgeable about many aspects of the course and she is very open to meeting with students to share her passion.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is either very interested in South Asia or is looking to learn a lot about the region, it's a fairly intense class but definitely worth it if that's what you're looking for.",
    "ANTH 276 is a wonderful class! I would recommend it to any student! The class deals with the themes of belonging, family, identity, caste, and migration in reference to South Asia. It approaches the material with an anthropological perspective and many of the readings are ethnographic works. There are weekly reading assignments, three short paper, periodic presentations, and a final paper. Multiple documentaries are watched throughout the semester, including one over a South Asian meal! I really enjoyed all the assignments and always looked forward to going to class.",
    "If you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken this class then I feel really sorry for you. The class never felt like work because it was so enjoyable. We used texts (both theoretical and ethnographic) and media (documentary films, news articles) to study the topic. The entire class structure was very well organized. The class was seminar size but it was taught in both seminar and lecture style. The lecture style was especially helpful for students unfamiliar about the structure of societies in South Asia. The seminar style focused more on anthropological\/sociological interpretations of the structures and their meanings for the social world in South Asia. I very much enjoyed the many small assignments we had for the class. I also liked them for practical reasons\u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of them counted for small percentages of my grade meaning I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to freak out about doing really well on my final paper. Prof. Shneiderman would often remind us how the regional context of South Asia and its social world can be understood within a larger global scale, so it never felt like we were learning about some remote far away places, it felt much closer to home and home was a lot of different places for each one of us in class.",
    "I highly recommend Anthropology 276 for fellow Yale students. The material is interesting, thought provoking and well prepared by the instructor. The class is a little early in the morning but well worth it.",
    "Yes, absolutely! If you're interested in South Asia this class is great. You get to read and talk about BIG things like class, caste and gender in the context of such a compelling and interesting region.The lecture is part seminar and definitely feels like a seminar which is great, and most of the readings you do for class are really very interesting. All the films you watch for class are great.Also for the final paper you get to write about whatever you want, which can be really cool if you're interested in one particular thing.",
    "The class really made you think about often poorly understood topics like 'South Asia' and 'ethnicity' and 'caste'. It's a tough class for any level of experience with anthropology - there are lots of little assignments and some difficult readings - but it's really informative and useful and interesting. There's something for everyone. That being said it is very anthropology-heavy.",
    "A survey of a few themes which are explored in various South Asian contexts. This course in largely an introduction to Anthropological inquiry which uses South Asia as a context for the source material. For those interested in South Asia in other fields, this is a VERY important course to take, to reconsider and think critically about themes covered, for example in Economics and Political Science.I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Shneiderman really cares about her students and made this class really enjoyable. This is my first anthropology class, and I learned a lot!",
    "If you're at all interested in anthropology but like me had little knowledge of what it was, or interested in South Asia, this class is a must do. There is definitely more work than other classes, and a lot of writing, but this class was incredibly satisfying, and I left knowing so much more about South Asia, having a deep interest in the area, and a greater understanding of what anthropology is. Definitely one of my favorite classes this semester, I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, absolutely! It's a wonderful area studies\/anthro course that focuses on important themes such as gender, religion, class, caste, etc. Take it!!",
    "ANTH 276 is a great class. You will learn a lot about South Asian cultures from a leading expert in the field. The workload is a little heavy, but worthwhile and interesting, so keep that in mind when you are choosing classes."
