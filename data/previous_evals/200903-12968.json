   "comments": [
    "This course moves really fast because there is so much material to learn. It is basically learning a language in a semester.",
    "This course covered way too much material. To expect students in an elective course to learn a programming language and then apply it as a design tool is a lot to ask. It should really be a sequence of 2 semesters.",
    "Course was structured very well to build up technical knowledge early on and allow for combination and exploration of techniques later.",
    "A little to technical for my taste as opposed to presenting the broader conceptual components which may then be learned.",
    "I think that an incredibly complex subject was described in a very accessible way, not focusing on computational troupes, but basic principles that we can carry forward on our own.The course website was very helpful and made for interesting presentations throughout the year.The weekly assignments kept us on our toes, but I would have preferred bi-weekly - to allow for somewhere between a sketch and a working project.The only criticism is not of the course, but the school - our work load is too much to focus on our actual interests in a manner that is fulfilling. The final project was weaker than I hoped because of the time demands of our 18 credit hours.",
    "The amount of notions to learn and apply was actually huge. Assignments on a weekly base were helpful to catch up with the teaching schedule, which was intense. But sometimes, at least in my case, a week was not enough to cover the contents and figure out how apply them on a concrete task.",
    "The material and assignments were well structured and sequenced, and allowed a beginner to learn the basics of programming by writing its own code.",
    "The material for the first half of the semester was well structured and methodically outlined. In an appropriate sequence, William thoroughly presented an informative and useful yet critical overview of computational design, from building simple scripts to finding their applicability in architectural design projects. Our weekly assignments aligned well with their respective lectures, although, admittedly, having weekly deadlines became overwhelming as midterm review week for studio approached (it seemed everyone started to have some trouble keeping up by the beginning of October). After the first few weeks, half the class time became allocated to reviewing sketches we each had prepared. I thought this was beneficial as it allowed all of us to see how others approached the problem.The second half of the course, dedicated to the development of a final project, was appropriately more fluid. While still addressing technical concerns, William designated class meetings for presentations of our project ideas and then to showing us different techniques that pertained to our explorations in some way. I found the sessions he held towards the end of the semester where he showed us how to practically find and adapt existing scripts to be a perfectly timed and extremely helpful review of all that we had learned throughout the course of the semester.",

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I was hoping to learn more web based interaction within processing.",
    "My expectations were not extremely high, but I feel like a learned a lot.",
    "I expected more of an overview of computational theory and design than a rigorous study of a programming language, but the opportunity to do this was extremely valuable and important to broaden our views of the power of computation and software by stepping down to lower level processes.",
    "My expectations were that we would seriously delve into questions of computation - although this is an introduction type course, we did not. I did not expect to do weekly tasks and was instead expecting to develop a project over the semester on a particular topic that could be shared with and worked on together by my fellow classmates.",
    "I wanted to learn core concepts. I wanted a course that focused not on just making cool things (which we did), but systems of thought that I could apply to an course in the school. My expectations were met 100%.",
    "I was worried about myself not having the background for this class, but ultimately teacher's clarity and availability for explanations and didactic assistance helped a lot.",
    "I expected to learn programming and produce some coding with potential for architecture and this expectation was met with success. My final project was by far more advanced than what I initially expected from the course.",
    "Having taken a rhinoscripting seminar in the past, I anticipated that William would offer a substantive and thoughtful synopsis of the benefits of computational thinking, scripting, and design. I enjoyed the course very much and appreciated the sincerity and intensity he gave to instruction. William broke down any intimidating preconceptions novice scripters had about necessary mathematical inclinations or programming experience and successfully conveyed that with some practice, anyone could use a script if she could grasp the logic of a language.",
    "I expected to get further in my design computation exploration. The reality of it is that it is hard and requires a good amount of skill-building. Perhaps an advanced seminar might be a good idea."

   "comments": [
    "Due to this course I have a greater understanding of digital modeling programs.",
    "I think that this class may have less value for me than others. I cannot seem to get that motivated about the end results and how to actually use processing as a design tool. This may be because of my limited skills, or my waning interest in the subject matter.",
    "I'd had no previous programming experience and found it difficult to keep up with the pace of the course. The lectures were clear and interesting and I was able to follow the thinking, but I found it difficult and frustrating to digest and make use of these techniques for the individual assignments. For students with programming experience this was probably much less of a problem. I very much enjoyed being exposed to different theories of coding and seeing on-screen codes being written, spliced together, and being used to generate meaningful output and graphics. It was important for me to realize how much we take for granted using software like Rhino or CAD and that as a result we often understand very little about the operations we call forward in these programs.",
    "The course was valuable in that it forced me learn another programming language, but it became very uninteresting after the first few weeks due to the structure of the course (although this is probably a personal comment different than my classmates). Will was enthusiastic enough to pick the class up during those low points and did progress the material fairly well.",
    "I had a background of self-taught coding, but this course has helped me become more proficient as well as grounded. I feel like I can communicate concepts to others much more clearly now. Which is important. Although I may not be coding all the time, I feel the future will involve architects working more and more with software - being able to speak about the core concepts clearly is essential.",
    "This course was really valuable to me. I developed a whole new set of skills and technical knowledge in a field i'm really interested about.",
    "The course was very valuable.",
    "This was a great course although it would benefit from being split into multiple courses for different levels of scripting experience. Many times it was hard to follow because so much material was being covered in each class.",
    "The work I was able to accomplish in the course only made me wish I had more time to incorporate what I had learn into my design work.",
    "The course explores very interesting ideas, that will affect my work in studio."

   "comments": [
    "William Martin has a great expertise on the subject matter and he is extremely enthusiastic about passing his interest and knowledge of the information to his students.",
    "William Martin was great. He individually spent an exorbitant amount of time with each student, making sure that everyone was not restricted by the scripting aspects of the course. I couldn't think of any better to teach this subject, but, that said, the course would certainly be better if we had a TA or two semesters of learning.",
    "The instructor made presentations in a very clear and captivating way, designed to introduce new techniques every week to build on those from the previous. He was available to answer questions about assignments via e-mail and made frequent trips to New Haven in the final weeks of the semester to provide additional help for our final projects.",
    "The professor is very knowledgable on the material, but I think should do away with the idea that he needs to get everyone on an even playing field. Nothing ever works like that, and instead should look to a flexible learning paradigm on how to teach the material (particularly at Yale with such disparate backgrounds)",
    "Very effective - used the website as an interactive teaching tool.",
    "William was a great teacher: passionate, clear, prepared, and informal enough to make such a cryptic subject more accessible",
    "The instructor was highly effective in his teaching. He is very committed to the course.",
    "Instructor put in an impressive amount of extra time with students and had an incredible excitement and expertise for the subject. This course exposed the class to digital techniques that are very relevant in the profession today, but not part of our education at yale. I would highly recommend this course in future semesters.",
    "William was fantastic. He was clear, thorough, and made himself available for additional instruction after class and by appointment. At the end of the semester, he selflessly offered his time to help all of the students in the class to reach a satisfying point in their final projects.",
    "William is able to make complex code comprehensible for students with relatively low expertise in coding. This in itself is highly laudable and a rare skill.The one thing William should have done is to enforce the deliverables more strongly - a key portion of succeeding in the class was to complete the weekly assignments, and this should be emphasized more."

    "In some respects the length this course does not seem adequate for students who are really interested in learning processing. Maybe a advanced class can be offered if there is enough interest.",
    "I have already stated that I think the course should be split in two.",
    "Short weekly readings might help, though this may be too much on top of coding assignments, which need to be done with attention and repetition to build familiarity with the language.",
    "Change the structure of the course.",
    "More courses! I would like there to be more than one computation class. It is very hard to bridge the gap between those with experience and those with none. A follow-up course would be much appreciated!",
    "none",
    "Showing a lot of examples of the work by architects and designers using code during the first classes might exemplify different potentials of algorithms and stimulate students imagination for the final project.",
    "Have at least two classes...one for students with programming experience and one intro course.",
    "For the first four weeks, weekly assignments are feasible but after that, because of the studio schedule, I think it would be helpful if some of the assignments were incorporated into class time (maybe some lectures could be worked through a full script), so that one would be due every other week.",
    "The course should if anything be expanded upon - an advanced seminar following on this one should be taught. Like it or not, much of what this seminar researches will be the future - Yale should try and be a part of it."
