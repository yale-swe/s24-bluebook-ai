   "comments": [
    "Pretty much same at 165L, but with E&M. Some of the circuit labs take FOREVER so watch out for those. Practical at the end isn't too bad.",
    "It was a lot more manageable than past reviews have indicated, perhaps due to the constant reforms to the course. The instructor and teaching fellows were encouraging and helpful, and students were exposed to a lot of equipment over the course of the lab class. Overall, one of the best science lab course experiences during my time at Yale.",
    "Get a good TA, and this lab is really not that bad. The actual labs don't take up all three hours and the lab reports don't take too long - just one page of write-up about what you did. One of my most enjoyable labs at Yale so far!",
    "The labs are usually pretty pointless and unnecessarily wordy. They usually have about seven pages of extra text that don't associate anything whatsoever to do with the lab itself. Way too much use of LoggerPro, and frankly, I wish they kept the old, supposedly un-insightful labs as opposed to being so creative and ridiculous with the new ones. Also, there was no actual rubric for grading labs, so the TA's just mark off points for random things they see or don't see, spelling errors, bad sentences, etc. I'd recommend 205 L , I've heard good things. I received a good grade in the class, but not a pleasure.",
    "It's an okay lab. Cool experiments some weeks, and other weeks its torture. Overall, it was pretty easy and good.",
    "take it if you need it. lab isnt always the most pleasant thing but 166 is actually pretty good. labs arent really that long and its not much work outside class",
    "I mean, it's definitely not a bad lab, but if you don't need\/really want to take it the work would get a annoying and probably tedious by the end of the semester.",
    "No i would not recommend it unless it was required. It is not always an efficient use of time.",
    "All about signal analysis and circuits... electric-y stuff. Not as fun as first semester lab.",
    "I took 205L last semester with 200 lecture. It was a disaster - 205 basically covers second semester physics, even though it is offered first semester. 166 was therefore a relief because it actually DID correspond to second semester physics (I took 181). Weekly lab writeups (1 page) take about an hour per week. Experiments are usually pretty short. Overall, a good course. You probably have to take it anyways.",
    "Not too stressful!",
    "It's really not bad. Professor Cahn has seemingly done the impossible - he took a class that was known as unbearable and made it kind of fun. Sure, it's still physics lab, but I realized halfway through the semester that I didn't dread going to it every Monday. And that really is saying something about how well the professors did to make it accessible. It helped me understand the material too. Good job, Yale Physics Department! I knew you had it in you!",
    "Great, laid-back lab course.",
    "This is a good lab course- it's not as time consuming and tedious as a lot of other half credit courses, and it really does demonstrate some good concepts.",
    "It is more relevant to being pre-med than you might expect.",
    "Physics 166L is pretty much a continuation of 165L, but with electricity and circuits, which makes it quite a bit harder. If you're taking the class you probably have to for your major\/pre-med, so all I can say is good luck.",
    "Obviously take this if you have to if you're pre-med. It's decent for a Physics lab. The lab concepts are standard, but they revamped the actual write-ups my semester, and some labs are kind of odd or confusing.",
    "It's second semester physics lab. You'll take it if you need to. That said, the course was significantly revised this year and much improved. I imagine that Professor Cahn will continue to tweak the course next year, but he's receptive to student feedback and committed to students getting the most from the course. Also, the time required for the course is much reduced, making it a lot easier to fit into your busy science workload.",
    "This is a course that they have tried to make as painless as possible for premeds. That much is clear. They have also tried to tie the physics learned in lab to biology and medicine, however this rarely actually makes any sense. It is ultimately a class that you just ask for enough help to get it all done.",
    "Its one of the shorter labs. Definitely worth taking this over 206L because you'll be spending an hour on a 1 page summary instead of 10 hours on a full lab writeup every week. Great to take during a really busy semester. Cool labs, you learn a lot. Take it.",
    "I never thought I'd say this, but this lab was actually fun, and finally not too much work. The labs are understandable, easily able to be completed at least 30 min early, and the TAs and teacher are helpful.",
    "Phys 166L is pretty fun for a physics lab course. Sid clearly made an effort to make physics fun. This class was much improved from 165 and covers more interesting material. You're probably taking this because you have to, but fortunately it's actually enjoyable.",
    "Take it as your physics lab req \u0097 it's WAY less difficult than 205 in every way, and it's not like you care about physics anyway.",
    "Some labs were interesting, but frustration with the lack of clarity made it hard to enjoy the course.However, the 1-page limit on lab reports was nice. Least time spent outside of a lab on work ever.",
    "PHYS166L is a great lab course. It's not a huge time commitment--you'll spend 2 hours max working on a lab report every week. There're quizzes. The TAs are super helpful. The physics department is pretty chill--the profs are really nice people, too.",
    "Surprisingly, not that much work for a lab: a one page lab report is due every week (which is basically writing up your lab notes on Word), and a final practical exam.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester. I really looked forward to it. I recommend taking it the same day as a friend that way you can be partnered them. The labs were all well done and I learned about physics.",
    "This semester the class was much more correlated with the Physics 171 class which was helpful. First semester we did experiments in lab that we did not learn the concepts for until much later and it was therefore sometimes very difficult to understand what was going on.",
    "Sure",
    "Phys 166 is a good introductory physics lab course. The labs were interesting, reasonable and fair, and both the professors and my TA were very helpful. One of the better undergraduate labs at Yale.",
    "If you're going to take this lab it would probably help to take 171 or 181 with it despite what they tell you. Prepare for a lot of wires and make sure you read ahead. All in all though, if you really pay attention to everything you should be fine in the class.",
    "Phys 166 is very similar to 165. Manageable one-page write-ups and labs that are easy to understand (though not always easy to set up and get to work properly). The TAs are patient and helpful. Expect it to be a steady 5 hour commitment per week (3 in lab, 2 writing up\/finishing notes\/reading next lab). If you find a competent lab partner it's a pretty solid lab, and the staff is working hard to make it a great experience.",
    "Works well with the lecture, makes you understand concepts more",
    "A necessary core course - find out how your TA likes the reports written, and stick to that. finish reports on the day you do the experiment - they're so much easier to do then.",
    "This is a solid lab course. Not as painful and stressful as the usual lab. Take it.",
    "Physics 166L 01 is a great intro course in experimental physics. It covers a lot of material, but by the end you really feel you have learned a lot of physics and that you start to understand what is happening in the world around you. No more living in ignorance. Prof. Cahn is fantastic at making the material interesting and easy to understand, so I highly recommend taking this course. It's really not that much work and you can get a lot out of it if you are interested.",
    "It's a cut and dry lab. You're not going to enjoy it much, and the page-long reports are a chore, but it's required. It's not a hard class... just remember to put an uncertainty at the end of every value you calculate!",
    "Long and tedious but depending on your TA, can be fine. My lab partner did absolutely nothing in class, and I had to do the whole thing. All she did was text\/email on her phone and pick her damn nails. So...make sure you get a good partner! Otherwise, it was pretty okay -- some labs took like 3 hrs which really sucked (esp on Friday afternoons) but overall, it was okay. Learned quite a bit in lab, though many times, lab doesn't correspond with class. But for E and M, lab definitely helped me learn the concepts at least. You'll have to take so just do it with a smile on your face.",
    "You're probably not going to have much choice in taking this lab or not. Do not be afraid, though. It's relatively pain free despite a few annoying labs. Lab practical was very doable.",
    "Only take this lab if you need for premed or in love with physics. Period.",
    "PHYS 166L is about what you would expect for a physics lab. The workload is generally fair for a 0.5 credit lab. It helps to ground some of the theoretical lessons from the class with physical phenomena, but I would recommend the course only if it's a requirement.",
    "Physics 166L is a pretty decent lab. They have worked hard to make it more manageable and applicable to medicine. There are a few labs which are interesting, such as the EKG, but other than that, the experiments do not seem too applicable. It is conceptually more difficult than first semester physics lab.",
    "Although I wasn't a big fan of PHYS 165L, I really enjoyed PHYS 166L, which is a second semester physics lab covering topics such as waves\/harmonic motion, circuits, electromagnetic induction, oscilloscopes, etc. The weekly work isn't too bad, just a weekly lab quiz and one-page lab report to submit, although it can sometimes be pretty difficult to score really high on the reports. At the end of the semester is a final lab practical exam, which sounds intimidating but actually is nothing to worry about as long as you know your stuff well. Also, Sid is really funny and genuinely interested in his students and his quirky passions for physics make the lab class impossible to hate.",
    "I would not recommend to anyone is doesn't have to take it because that's just my general opinion on labs. But as far as the lab went - I thought it was pretty cool overall.",
    "Physics 166L compliments the coursework of Physics 171 very nicely. I would recommend it to students taking the Physics lecture course because I often found that working through the concepts in lab helped me grasp the material from lecture better.",
    "It was much less inspiring than PHYS165L. But most of all I'm amazed by how much the TA for your session plays a role in determining the rest of the course for you. My TA was nit-picky about the smallest details and didn't seem to give enough guidance for writing lab reports the way he\/she WANTED, which makes up 55% of the entire grade. I spent an average of 4-5 hours a week writing up the lab report, and another 1-2 hours reading up on the following week's lab.",
    "I enjoyed Physics 166L a lot more than 165L. I debated taking it for a while because first semester was kind of miserable, and I'm really happy I decided to take it anyway. The experiments are a lot less tedious and time-consuming, and I ended up spending significantly less time outside the classroom working on my lab pages and write-up compared to first semester. The practical was also very fair and do-able, so I wouldn't worry too much about it if you know what's going on in lab.",
    "you really don't have anything to complain about any more with the intro physics lab, the professors have done a great job scaling down the workload and busy work and have made th class more relevant to medicine, less of a headache, and potentially, fun",
    "Great class. You'd be surprised how well-organized and balanced this lab is.",
    "They tried really hard this year tocontinually improve the lab, and to make it relevant for pre-meds, which I appreciated. Pay attention in lab, ask a lot of questions so you understand it (esp for the final practical) and write good addendums. Good luck.",
    "I would definitely recommend this over PHYS 205; the class is much better organized and does not leave the students frustrated because they couldn't finish the task. The one-page report is a big help, because it ensured you understand what you did, in preparing for the final.",
    "Standard intro physics lab. Less work than PHYS 206, but definitely not as interesting (or involved). The class is mostly pre-meds, who seem to suck a lot of the joy of physics (or any aspect of school, really). If you have to squeeze a lab into your schedule like me (i.e. credit number 5.5), then this class will probably be better for your sanity than PHYS 206. If you love physics, however, take PHYS 206 instead.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student. ONLY take the lab if you have no other choice. Then again, I HATE physics so I am very biased.",
    "Physics 166L is very technology heavy, it is a lab consisting greatly of circuits, loggerpro, oscilloscopes, and voltage pros. It helped me understand the concepts from class better but was not the most exciting lab to take.",
    "It's your basic intro Physics lab.",
    "Not the worst lab out there. The lab reports are really no big deal and the labs arent terribly difficult either.",
    "Yes, its a fun and interesting science credit.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it but what can you do.",
    "Dominated by premeds, this lab is pretty basic for students with a more extensive physics background. As a non-premed with a decent physics background, I was often bored by the experiments, even if they were helpful for understanding the way devices are used in a lab setting.",
    "Second part of the full year course. Not the most engaging at times, but they're really working to make it so. It's not a terrible amount of work, which is good, and you shouldn't have problems on the lab reports after you do a few.",
    "Take the courses especially after taking 165. you do have to write lab reports each week though, so be prepared to spend a good amount of time (4 hours or so) writing them. At least that's how long it took me and I'm getting an A.",
    "The workload is reasonable, but the labs can be slightly frustrating. However, the professors are really helpful in trying to improve this lab course to make it more relevant and interesting to pre-med students.",
    "The lab is essential for same majors and that is typically the reason why people take it. The lab is actually quite enjoyable and the post-lab write up is not that bad. The lab actually provides an interesting alternative approach to learning material not grasped by reading the textbook.",
    "This is a great lab course - the lab manuals explain the physics very well (do read them before class! The quizzes are not that hard if you read them), and the experiments are interesting! I am a pre-med student who finds physics very interesting, and I think it would help any student to try and appreciate how cool physics is instead of approaching lab in a pessimistic manner. I thought circuits would be very complicated - however, ASK QUESTIONS DURING LAB and you will find that they are not as terrible as you thought they would be! Also try to get Scott as your TA if possible.",
    "The only reason you should take this course is if you have to. Weekly lab reports are not very time consuming and most of the labs can be completed in under 2 hours. The labs themselves were not very interesting though and some seemed like they had almost no connection to class material, especially the ones at the beginning. I think the instructors try hard to make tailor the class to pre-meds, but ultimately this led to very forced connections to biological concepts. Also, many of the lab handouts were not well-written at all, especially those that involved circuits, so be prepared for a few long and frustrating lab days. Many times I felt like I didn't actually understand what was going on and had to keep asking my TA for help.",
    "Decent physics lab, but honestly, take it only if you need the credit.",
    "If you are taking physics lab, then you have to take it. That being said, it's one of the more pleasurable lab courses, and the instructors are genuinely trying to reform the course to please the students. It's also not too much work, definitely half the work for your physics class, so it was nice that they didn't overburden you.",
    "Aspects of the lab are being improved each year, and I feel that the lab was very enjoyable this semester. You also learn a lot and the lab is quite helpful to solidifying what you learn in class!",
    "I would recommend if you need it for your major requirements",
    "You take it because you have to. Having said that as science labs go it is not very much work at all and is quite interesting. Sometimes I would understand concepts from 170\/171 because of the lab class (especially when it came time for the electromagnetism stuff).",
    "We were a fun class. Really enjoyed it.",
    "Fun, relatively easy course if you need a physics lab. Having a background in physics is helpful. Choose your partner wisely because they'll be with you the entire semester! Overall, an enjoyable course.",
    "This is definitely a good course to take for the physics lab requirement because it's not a lot of work, but at the same time you still learn some physics.",
    "Yes, a great lab that applies physics to relevant biological (and other) applications more so than most classes even. We did EKGs, for instance.",
    "Take this lab! If you are looking simply to fulfill pre-med requirements, I would definitely recommend PHYS 165\/166L over 205\/206L. The lab is not too much work, just a 1-page write-up and lab notes for each lab.",
    "This is the second semester of physics lab. Was much more enjoyable than the first.",
    "Better than last semester, that's for sure. It's more of just playing with electric stuff than finding some special constant. I liked it.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to. It's not that bad. Sid is really enthusiastic and tries to make lab fun.",
    "What you would expect from lab for Phys 171\/ 181 lectures. Though I thought it was much more closely aligned with the 171 course material than 181. If you put in the work, easy to get a good grade. And I found that I actually learned the material better in lab than lectures.",
    "This course is a chore. Not a lot of work, but very tedious. Take it if you have to, be glad if you don't.",
    "If you are thinking of taking this course, its probably a requirement. Although it will be a challenge, it is not as painful as it was several years ago.",
    "If you don't have to take this lab, I wouldn't recommend it (unless you're really interested in circuits) - there are so many more interesting classes at Yale that you could take instead. However, if you do have to take it, then don't be too worried about it. It's comparable in difficulty to PHYS 165L (maybe even a little easier), and some of the labs were interesting.",
    "Basic physics lab, exploring electricity and magnetism and providing exposure to tools like the oscilloscope and image analysis. Recommended.",
    "This is a relatively painless lab. Take it if you need to. It's also very helpful in understanding concepts for PHYS 171. Labs are relatively short and easy to follow (but read them ahead of time, there are quizzes) and the lab reports are very short - only a page. This lab is actually probably a half credit's worth of work. There's a practical at the end of the semester, but relax, read the labs, and try to have some fun with it. You'll be fine.",
    "Very practical lab, goes by pretty quickly and the reports are manageable."
