   "comments": [
    "AMST425 was a fantastic course, definitely recommended! The course covers the development of the idea of the \"environment,\" focusing primarily on the early and mid 19th century. In addition to a lot of great readings, Prof. Warner brought in many more contemporary works during class, so I always walked away from the course with a lot to think about.",
    "Take this class if you're at all interested in the American conception of the environment, and if you enjoy having real conversations in section. It's an amazing course. I learned so much and was never bored, which is crazy because we did some really deep dives into (at times) relatively obscure material. Professor Warner is one of the best I've had at Yale. He is somehow incredibly knowledgeable without being intimidating, and always willing to see where the discussion of the material goes.",
    "If you're interested in how the United States interacts with its environment (both built and natural), take this class. Learning how Americans thought in terms of the space they take up both consciously and unconsciously is really informative for how Americans move through that space as well. However, it has a lot of reading and the discussion lags when the students don't do it, so don't take the class lightly.",
    "A rare offering. A good way to engage with early notions of the environment and environmentalism in America that isn't really covered by other courses. A fun discussion and papers that are as engaging as you make them.",
    "Definitely take this class! Prof. Warner picks out incredible texts for us to read, both things you have already read and things you might never have heard of. He leads the discussion really well and brings up a ton of great facts about American history. It's a great way to learn more about early 19th century America, and Prof. Warner is really warm and approachable. Overall one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes - I would recommend this course to anyone interested in contemporary environmentalism, broadly defined. The course traces such thinking to its roots in early American literature in ways that will change your understanding of ideas of nature. Prof. Warner brings a wealth of knowledge of the period and grants students the flexibility to craft their own projects."
