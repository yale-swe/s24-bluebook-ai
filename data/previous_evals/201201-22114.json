    "Senior Art majors work on independent projects throughout the semester. Each student presents to the group twice during weekly crits, once at the beginning of their project and once around the mid-point. At the end of the semester, the work goes up in the senior thesis show in Green Gallery. I would highly recommend the course. I grew a lot from the experience. Each student has an advisor to guide you through the process, but its up to you to on top of your work. Don't procrastinate!",
