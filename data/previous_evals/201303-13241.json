I feel that I understand some of the tension and tumult within China, and am curious to learn more after this. A great course to get broken in to the complex topic of China politics.",
    "Meaningful in allowing me to explore IR both in theory and practice.",
    "not my field, but I learned a lot about pre-2000 relations with China and China's rhetoric on US actions."
