I learned so much about the social and historical roots of different elements of French culture and understand a lot more of what I see in the news. Now, if a French person were to ask me about my views on some pertinent issues, I feel I'd be able to take a side and defend it.",

   "comments": [
    "FREN 160 is a good course for students who want to improve their speaking skills. The texts were well-chosen.",
    "The great strength of this course is the wide variety of materials you work with, from news articles and campaign ads to pop songs and documentary films. You really feel immersed in the culture\/goings-on of the country and nothing is really beyond the scope of the class. One thing that could be improved is the manner in which the writing assignments are spaced out. They were many of them clustered at the beginning of the semester, a long lull in the middle, and then two squished in at the end. A more even organization would have been better.",
    "Covering so many different topics, while helpful as an overview of contemporary French culture, does make it difficult to really learn much about any particular topic, and because so little time is spent on each, there just isn't the time to fully incorporate the vocabulary into your own vocabulary.",
    "Strengths: The conversation, readings were usually interesting, the variety of topics discussed Weaknesses: The exercises where you have to fill in the words of a video or find really specific answers from the readings to questions were not very helpful to learning the material"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to improve their speaking skills in French.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to improve\/maintain their level of spoken French in a context that is more casual\/jovial than a literature class and to learn things that are readily applicable to current events both in France and the rest of the world. It will help you develop a solid background knowledge of\/your own opinions on many salient issues in French society, which is very useful if you plan to spend some time there.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes!! Especially with M. Dumont! He is really knowledgable in basically all of the topics of discussion, and he always added some humor to the conversation. He is also just a really cool person. There aren't that many writing assignments - the course is focused on speaking and learning vocabulary related to social\/cultural aspects of France, and you learn a lot about current events in France as well. M. Dumont also organized a class trip to the met opera, which was an amazing experience."
