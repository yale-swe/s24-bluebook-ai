   "comments": [
    "In this course, I went from not understanding a single word of Hindi, to now being able to have conversations, and writing full paragraphs in devanagari script! I cannot overemphasize the amount of knowledge I gained from the course, and look forward to hindi L2.",
    "How to read, write, speak and understand basic Hindi.",
    "The knowledge of both hindi language and indian culture. I was surprised by how quickly one could pick up the script.",
    "I learned the basics of the Hindi language, but also gained a better understanding of the people and the culture. We explored beyond the textbook into real-world uses of Hindi.",
    "I came in knowing no Hindi and left knowing lots of grammar and almost all of the verb tenses. I learned vocabulary to get by but that can always be expanded with time. It is amazing that we learned to Devangari alphabet and quickly used it to write and read Hindi. Taking such a language expands the mind because it forces you to think in different ways. Such is the case for such a beautiful language.",
    "Went from no knowledge of Hindi to basic conversational\/reading\/writing ability.",
    "I can fluently read\/write in Devanagari script now and have a decent grasp on speaking very basic Hindi and understanding basic-mid level Hindi.",
    "I am able to speak Hindi at an elementary level.",
    "Loved this course and gained important skills in speaking and writing Hindi!",
    "This course was extremely helpful in developing my language skills in a non-Romance-language area from vocabulary to pronunciation to the attendant cultural knowledge. Although I thought the course took a little while to get off the ground, once we established a steady pacing we went very quickly; I felt like I knew how to apply each grammatical concept as we learned it, and Seema-Ji and Swapna-Ji were very helpful in making sure no one fell behind. Weekly quizzes were sometimes a challenge, but they felt manageable and helpful ways of gauging our understanding. Overall, a wonderful class I'm excited to continue it next semester!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall, The course is of excellent quality, and the program is well-paced to allow students time to grasp certain concepts. The only real weakness is that it does take of a good deal of time, but in truthfulness so does every other language course at Yale. Prof. Khurana and Prof. Sharma are extremely experienced in teaching english speaker the intricacies of the Hindi Language, and were by far by favorite course this semester.",
    "Wonderful professors who are willing to devote a ridiculous amount of time to helping their students. I would have liked it to be a little more organized - a precise syllabus would have been really helpful, and sometimes homework assignments were given a little late in the day before they were due, but otherwise the ideal language-learning environment.",
    "I thought the course did a very good job of laying the foundation for future Hindi education. I feel like I have a good grasp of basic grammar constructions, pronunciation, spelling and sentence structure. I wouldn't change much about the course, except to possible add more listening comprehension components, like more homeworks where we watch Bollywood movies or listen to podcasts.",
    "The course could space out the workload a little more. I found it a little challenging to do quizzes on fridays on material we'd only covered the day before. That said, I mostly liked the pace of the course as being both challenging and motivating.",
    "This class is great - the professors and the FLTA are amazing, and they make learning the language very enjoyable. They use a variety of mediums to teach the language - textbook, worksheets, videos, films, songs, magazines, newspapers, and more, and you will be surprised by how much Hindi you have learned by the end of the semester. The course could be better organized, however - clearer deadlines, what material we have covered, and what material will be on the quizzes, etc.",
    "The time between when things are assigned (later that day) and when they are due is very small, which makes completing assignments a continuous stress. It is important to practice a language every day when learning it, but easier access to assignments and curriculum might help.",
    "Strengths: small class size, intimate relationship with teachers, plenty of conversational practice, flexible workload Weaknesses: none",
    "The focus was always on learning rather than just working to get a grade, and Seema-ji and Swapna-ji were amazingly supportive and encouraging--Swapna-ji even invited us to dinner at her house! Learning was facilitated by watching Hindi movies\/seeing Hindi writing in context rather than just studying from a textbook. Overall, this class was absolutely amazing! It could have been a little more organized at times, but I really learned a lot so I don't mind.",
    "It is a very strong course. Moves very fast like any other language. However, this course teaches students Hindi very well.",
    "Strengths: Amazing teachers, fun subject matter, great lessons!",
    "One of this course's greatest strengths is its size not too many people take Hindi, and it gave the class a friendly, familial atmosphere that was extremely conducive to language-learning. Although I recognize the value of conversation sections, I thought the way they were conducted could have been improved slightly sometimes it felt as though Reeta-Ji (our Fulbright teaching assistant) didn't have a great sense of our class's level of fluency, and would say incredibly complex phrases in Hindi that we had to take time to decipher before moving on. Otherwise, though, I have no complaints; I really enjoyed the challenge of this class."

   "comments": [
    "YES!",
    "I think its a really great way to dive into Hindi, especially for people, like me, who have no previous experience in the language.",
    "Yes, especially those with indian heritage but no background in the language. I think it's an important skill and the course was a particularly effective way to introduce me to it.",
    "THIS CLASS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Please take this class if you are interested in learning the language! The professors are amazing, and the class is very enjoyable!",
    "This is learning Hindi at a fast pace in a relatively short amount of time. It's amazing! But also a lot of work. It is doable, especially if you enjoy the language. The class can be slightly stressful with assignments but actually very achievable in the long-run. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes, absolutely - it's challenging without being overly focused on scores and grades like some of the other language departments can be. Seemaji and Swapnaji are the best and definitely create a very friendly and stimulating learning environment!",
    "Yes, definitely! It's an enjoyable, great option for an introductory language course and not nearly as overwhelming as some of the other L1 language courses. You'll be amazed at how much Hindi you will pick up from going to this class every day!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The professors are extremely understanding in all matters. The course itself is a lot of fun.",
    "Absolutely! It was a wonderful and fun learning experience that emphasized understanding concepts over quizzes.",
    "Absolutely. This is one of those language courses where you get out of it what you put in you can coast by on a few stock phrases\/vocabulary words if you'd like, but the teachers give you the necessary skills to form really complex sentences after only a semester. If you don't make use of that, that's entirely on you. If you do, you'll get a *ton* out of this class; Hindi's a really beautiful language, with an incredibly rich cultural tradition underpinning it."
