    "I LOVED THIS CLASS. I learned how to analyze artwork in the context of a developing empire. The material was fascinating and all of the masterworks studied fit into a narrative.",
    "I developed my appreciation of Ancient Roman sculpture with respect to both broad characteristics and more particular variations of these characteristics.",
    "Greater knowledge of Roman culture and art.",
    "I had no experience with art history. This course was a great introduction into how to analyze works of art.",
    "How to critically evaluate a piece of art, thinking about why it was made, who commissioned it, what symbols are present, etc.",
    "Roman Art taught me to evaluate monuments, portraits and paintings through different time periods and be able to evaluate what was going on in the Roman Empire through one's portraiture. I learned how to write a formal analysis paper and learned a lot through discussions on the forum with my students and understand how different people approach different portraits and what they represent.",
    "This class gave me an in depth background to the art and architecture of the Roman Republic. Through that, I also gained an understanding of its political, social, and economical culture.",
    "Thanks to this comprehensive survey course, I acquired a keen sense of the development of Roman art from the republic to the imperial period."

   "comments": [
    "The course has no weaknesses. The textbook perfectly supplemented the lecture material, so that I was able to feel 100% prepared for the exams. The monument lists were a great study tool that kept me organized.",
    "I enjoyed the way the lectures were structured and explained, and I enjoyed the online discussion sections. I believe the Review Sessions could have been improved with explanations of the artworks that are as clear and comprehensive as explanations are during the class lectures.",
    "Professor Kleiner is great. This year the class was small, so she got to know each of us. I very much enjoyed her lectures. The online forum was better than a regular section, but still could be a burden at times.",
    "The course was excellently designed.",
    "There were many strengths of the course including the lecturer was wonderful and our TA was very helpful. The lectures were very interesting and I also liked the online discussion forum. One weakness I would say is that the lectures did tend to be a bit repetitive at times.",
    "Diana Kleiner is probably the biggest strength of this course. Her personal experience with the art is undeniable, and her passion and highly refined knowledge topic came through in every class. Her insights are invaluable, and informed my impression of nearly every piece we discussed. This course's weakness is the sheer volume of material that we attempted to cover. Part of this is by nature of the course's chronological purview. But I believe that if there were a more streamlined syllabus, it would be easier for students to feel personally connected to individual pieces of art (rather than feel adrift in the literally hundreds of objects that we were expected to be familiar with). This semester, as I understand it, the class was much smaller than in past years. I think that this course could have been improved by adding a section, or by making the lectures more discussion-based. Even though we had a great Forum on Canvas, I sometimes struggled to feel a connection to the material myself. I think that having a more personal approach to the art in class, face-to-face with my fellow student,s would have been very helpful.",
    "Professor Kleiner is extremely knowledgeable of the materials, and present them in a very engaging way. I hope that we had the opportunity to attend sections and talk about Roman art in a group setting instead of contributing to the online forum."

   "comments": [
    "This class is amazing for any student that loves a complete story. The story of the Roman empire told through sculpture is compelling and engaging.",
    "Absolutely. Wonderful course anyone with an interest in history, art, or classics should take!",
    "Yes I would because the course covers a lot of material in a clear and understandable way.",
    "Professor K is fantastic and engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! the Professor is awesome and she is very engaging and passionate about her work.",
    "Yes, this class is incredible and has a lot of very interesting material. Plus, Professor Kleiner is simply the best at evaluating the material and presenting it to students.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It will give you the ability to interpret works of art.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has strong interest in Art History and wants to learn from a great professor who has had tremendous experience in her field.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who was interested in the classics. I think that its strength is actually less the art-based focus, and more the anthropological and political implications that the course uses the art to reveal.",
    "If you are interested in the ancient world, this is a fantastic course to take! You will learn about a large number of artworks under the guidance of Professor Kleiner, who is extremely knowledgeable of the materials."
