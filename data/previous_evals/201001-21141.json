If you want to understand that text, you should take Pogge's course. However, the level of the material is so high and the ideas are so difficult, that I would not recommend this course to students that are not extremely gifted or in graduate studies in philosophy.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to any student looking for a thorough introduction to Kant's first Critique. However, for a more basic introduction to Kant, I would recommend an undergraduate course instead. Very thorough."
