    "This is a steady extension of Spanish 110. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Sure I would, other than the fact it is every day. Every day classes were killer.",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 120 to another student. By the end of the class you will feel much more confident in your Spanish speaking skills. Sonia Valle was an amazing teacher and I highly recommend her. Also from what I'ave heard from other classes all the Spanish professors in Spanish 120 are excellent so you can't go wrong.",
    "Spanish 120 is a very well orchestrated course. The syllabus is so tightly defined that students knows what sort of progress they're making all throughout the semester. The material does move quickly, but it seems necessary to move through the basic concepts quickly in order to make bigger jumps in learning the language. If you are looking at fulfilling language requirements or are headed toward a Spanish major, Spanish 120 is the way to go.",
    "Introductory language class. Take it if you need it.",
    "Spanish 120 is a continuation of Spanish 110. The course format is nearly identical and expectations of daily grammar study to attain fluency in speech and writing remain. I would recommed the class as an extension of Spanish 110."
