    "Take it take it take it. Great course, teaches you Russian grammar in one semester in a structured and intelligent manner. The professors are the best, experienced, and they are there for you whenever you need their help. They commit to the course. The only condition I would pose is that you have to commit to the course as well. It isintensive and you should be willing and able to put in a daily shift of work for this course.",
    "You go through 2 textbooks, and watch videos of a guy who goes to Russia to make a photoalbum. If you have previous Russian experience, or experience with a language with cases and can think like that, you can handle this course. If not, you may want to take the regular route. I usually worked on this for about 3 hours a night.",
    "Excellent course. Both professors really know how to teach the course, and their styles mesh nicely. Know that there will be some students in the class who for some reason have an advantage (know another Slavic language, have done previous work with Russian, etc.), but if you work hard, you won't be lost in the shuffle. Keep up with the work and everything will make sense -- fall behind and you'll be scrambling.",
    "This class has two two amazing professors who truly care about the material and their students. I really enjoyed it and at times it does feel like the class is going quickly, but all of the students in the class master the material really quickly. If you are really good with languages I would definitely recommend intensive. There are weekly exams and nightly homework, which encourages you to keep up with the material. If you can, do take this class! If not, take Russian anyways, it's an amazing language and getting more useful every day.",
    "I would say, take this course if you know you can dedicate a couple hours every day to doing the work\/studying, and if you don't have too intensive a schedule, because there are eight classes a week. There is homework every night, and tests every week, and class participation is not just encouraged, but mandatory, and if you have no experience with Cyrillic or Slavic languages, you'll find it pretty challenging in the beginning. But with ALL THAT said, it was without a doubt my favorite class this semester. It was very rewarding, and Constantine and Julia are great--i think making this a team-taught course was a really good idea. If you're leaning towards yes, or just maybe, then DO IT!!! You won't regret it :-)",
    "This class was a very intense and quick tour through the basics of Russian language. If you are interested in learning Russian at all, I would suggest going through this class. There is SO much material, but as the Russian language is pretty complex, it may be disheartening to learn it at a slower pace.",
    "They're not kidding when they say \"For students of superior linguistic ability.\" For once, I was challenged in a language course. A fabulous experience - just be prepared to work.",
    "The course is basically a crash course on basic Russian. It moves very quickly and is a good option for those who wish to attain a decent level of Russian in a short time--if combined with some sort of immersion program.",
    "Russian 125 is two semesters of Russian in one. You go through two full textbooks and workbooks and a test every Monday; by the end there's the gratifying feeling of understanding enough Russian to be useful. Though an extraordinary class, especially for those who already know a language, when they say \"intensive\", they mean it. Plan to do at least two hours of homework a night. Also, don't plan on taking more than four credits total unless the other classes have a moderate or low workload."
