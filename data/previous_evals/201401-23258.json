   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Spanish 987 to another student as an excellent introduction to a wide range of contemporary Spanish American texts and to the approaches to literature adopted by Spanish American writers in the context of changing ideas of the \"nation\" in Latin America.",
    "Spanish 987 was a survey of 20th century Latin American literature and its relationship to religious discourse. I would definitely recommend this course to another student (see reasons above).",
    "I would highly recommend Span 987 with Prof. Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez-Perez to anyone interested in 20th-century Latin American literature. The course-readings are very interesting and diverse, and Prof. Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez-P\u00c3\u00a9rez is incredibly knowledgeable, encouraging, and helpful in terms of providing guidance and assistance on the final paper. The mini-symposium at the end of the semester is a wonderful way to gain practice and experience presenting our working-papers, and it's also very helpful to hear about the work being done by our colleagues.",
    "I would summarize it as a survey of great Latin American literature of the 20th century with an emphasis on the role of religion, both as an object of inquiry and as a method or style within Latin American Literature."

   "comments": [
    "This course furthered my understanding of this particular field of literature and encouraged me to pursue new ways of framing concepts such as \"religion\" in relation to aesthetics and nationhood in Latin America.",
    "This course gave me a great introduction to 20th-century Latin American literature, and to the ways in which religious discourse has been appropriated in many works of Latin American prose. As I am interested in studying certain aspects of religion in my dissertation, this course contributed to my understanding of many religious themes and also provided me with an overview of some of the key areas which have been subject to critical study."
