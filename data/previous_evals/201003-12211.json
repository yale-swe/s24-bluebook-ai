    "It's hard. Very hard. But definitely worth it. If you have to take it, good luck. If you're taking it by choice, why? But as far as required courses, it could have been worse. Go to class, at least for Ornston's lectures, cause the book won't be helpful then. Study well in advance for his exams too because they're a ton of memorizing. But the class is fine. Lectures were interesting, but the exams were hard. It's about as expected.",
    "It's pretty good. You get a good grasp of biochemical concepts, but I would say take the other Biochem course if you could. This course has a great deal of memorization. Although the other course has memorization too, you really learn the concepts that matter and will stay with you wherever you go in science.",
    "Take it! So helpful to finish Biochem in a semester especially with no psets and great profs.",
    "I would recommend this class. I really enjoyed taking this class and if you're willing to put in a little work, its really not that bad.",
    "A good course, the tests are fair, the workload is greater than most classes but not to the degree of Organic chemistry. Three midterms and a final are the only grades.",
    "A nice way to squeeze biochem into one semester. Lots of memorization, but, hey, it's biochemistry. What did you expect?",
    "The class is a lot of memorization, but it teaches a lot aboutBiochemistry. I definitely enjoyed it, but the tests take a lot of studying.",
    "This course provides an overview of biochemistry, from the building blocks all the way through metabolism. I would definitely recommend it for pre-med students looking to gain a foundation in biochemistry.",
    "The first half is more concept based. The second half is mechanism and pathway based.",
    "A LOT of work, lots of memorization, lots of headaches, frustration, but you learn a lot and it is rewarding.",
    "Not as difficult as I had anticipated and you definitely learn a lot from the course. The averages are surprisingly not that high.",
    "I would recommend MCDB300 to another student. It was a good class that taught me a lot.",
    "Yes! It was the best biology class I have taken thus far!!!! Much better than genetics. There is a lot of consistent studying. Cramming for finals doesn't work.",
    "Fantastic course. 3 20% midterms and a 40% final - very fairly graded. No sections (which is a plus) and no PSets or anything. Just come to lecture (esp. for Ornston's lectures) and follow the book if you need help. Highly recommended, you really do learn a lot.",
    "Solid course that will teach you biochemistry, if you put in the work. I wish I had spent time each day to go over what we had learned instead of cramming it all the week before the exams. Ornston's amazing, very fun to listen to. There is a LOT of material to memorize though, so make sure you can handle the workload with your other courses. You'll be memorizing all amino acids, and entire metabolic pathways. Don't be surprised when the final asks you to draw out each structure and byproducts of each step in the citric acid cycle.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, one of my favorites so far at Yale. There's a lot of memorization you have to do, so I would definitely recommend studying at least a few days in advance before the exams. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a more in-depth look at a lot of biological concepts. It's not too organic chemistry heavy, though it was cool knowing how certain reactions occurred mechanistically.",
    "This is a good alternative to the other biochemistry class. The second half focuses very much on chemical reactions which felt like puzzle solving.There are 3 midterms and a final, but I found that this made the material much more manageable, especially since the first half of the course is more bio-centric than the second half.",
    "This was a pretty good course. The midterms and final covered a lot of information. Going to section was helpful because the TA's were pretty good at summarizing the information presented in lecture. The class seems like two different classes with Breaker and Engelman in the first half and Ornston coverying the second half. It was still a good overview of biochemistry.",
    "If you are taking biochemistry, you probably have to. Start studying a week before midterms and earlier for the final and you will be fine. The averages were higher than I thought they were going to be, which was annoying. However, keep in mind that everyone in the class is an intense pre-med who studies all the time. So, the curve will probably be lower than you expect it. Sorry I can't say anything about the curve. It was not mentioned once in class and they make us fill these out before we get our grades back...",
    "great science class if you like biochemistry, not hard, no psets, exams are straight-forward",
    "Yes, but be prepared to memorize every lecture slide for the second part of the course if you want to do well in the third midterm and on the final exam. This course is a lot of straight memorization. If you are fine with that you should be OK for the course.",
    "MCDB Biochem is a great course that is incredibly well taught by its three professors. If you thought you didn't like chemistry after orgo, this will change your mind. Make sure to review the material as you go or studying forthe exams will be very difficult. Only downside to this course over the MB&B one is that there is more of a focus on rote memorization in the second half.",
    "MCDB300 is the most memorization-heavy MCDB course that I have taken as an MCDB major. Major themes: enzyme kinetics, protein folding, and metabolism. So much metabolism. Which is really cool, but it's a lot. A lot of information. If you stay on top of the lectures (I did not do this), you won't be panicked before exams. It's nice because you don't have to read the book. The lectures are what you're tested on. Don't even buy the book, actually. Not even worth it. Take it if you're interested in metabolism. If you're intent on really UNDERSTANDING and KNOWING biochem backwards and forwards, take the year-long MBB300 course. I'll admit, it was a little painful, but reflecting on the class, it was worth it.",
    "This is a hard class. Be prepared to work hard, and study your ass off and then maybe you'll do ok. It's also really hard to pay attention in class. I would try taking notes off the computer if I had to do it again.",
    "I would take it again even if it wasn't a requirement for my major. It was useful, and what I liked most about it is that it made me understand some organic chemistry concepts - that I was totally lost on in the organic chemistry class - in a biological system.",
    "this course is a lot of work, but the material is really interesting and the professors all strong",
    "don't take it unless you have to or really liked orgo",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone!It was so useful and definitely I did not have to waste an entire year learning Biochem!",
    "Yes! Easier than MBB. All that is needed to do well in this class is studying.",
    "This is a hybrid biology\/chemistry class. It covers a lot of chemistry, but in a manner similar to other MCDB classes. The workload isn't too bad - 3 midterms and a final. However, be forewarned that the material gets significantly harder as you proceed through the semester. Like many biology classes it is team taught, which I did not like. Ron Breaker who starts the course was by far the best lecturer, but the teaching seemed to go down from there. However, Ornston (who wasn't so bad) is retiring this year, so who knows who you'll get next year. Overall, not too painful of a class, but not particularly enjoyable. Take it if you need it for premed or other requirements. But do consider taking the MB&B version.",
    "YES! Great professors, very reasonable workload, interesting material - especially Professor Ornston's material. For me, Professor Ornston taught this class and he is retiring after this semester, which is a shame for students to follow. I would certainly have to know who he is beign replaced by, because I do not think there is anyone better, nor an equivalent.",
    "It's an interesting course with a lot learned. Be ready to work hard though.",
    "I definitely would've recommended it if Ornston were coming back. The final was super easy if you studied hard enough. Definitely possible to get an A. But Ornston is retiring and I don't know who they're getting to replace him, so it might not be as good. The first two sections of the class were easy though, so I think it's still a reasonably easy course.",
    "Biochemistry was a useful course that discussed many important biochemistry topics. The knowledge from this course will surely be valuable in future years.",
    "Yes. Do it!",
    "good class",
    "It's a typical Bio course; lots of memorization, interesting material, and light on coursework but heavy on exams.",
    "Biochemistry is an amazing class. The information is interesting and the lectures are great. The tests focus mainly on what was taught in lecture and there are no psets. Unfortunately, Professor Ornston won't be teaching any more, which is a tremendous loss for this class. I would recommend taking it.",
    "YES! I had a tough time deciding which Biochemistry course to take and I can only say good things about this course. Biochemistry is a thrilling topic and the professors do a great job actually TEACHING you. Unfortunately, Professor Ornston is retiring so to the best of my knowledge the entire course is getting revamped. With that said though, with Professor Breaker in charge, I can only anticipate a great course next year. Englemen is the most dry professor. With him, there is little incentive to go to class since he read directly from the slides. Professor Breaker and Ornston were both great.",
    "The first half of the class is what you would expect from a biology class - some of the material is review, and the rest is not hard; the professors are pretty interesting. The second half, taught by Prof. Ornston, is when the serious business (i.e. metabolic pathways) starts. It's a lot of material that you really have to study, but Prof. Ornston makes it interesting and comprehensible. There is definitely memorization to do, but a lot of the times mechanisms are analogous to something you've seen before, and the lectures do a good job of pointing those cases out. The exams are fair: they test what has been emphasized in class and won't ask about obscure details. (There's no real need to read the book.) While the material, by its nature, has the potential to be intensely boring, mindless memorization, the way it's presented makes it actually interesting. I came to\/was awake in almost every class.",
    "I like how it combines both biology and chemistry. However, the second half was disappointing how it was mostly memorization.",
    "This class was amazing. The material was interesting and the professors were engaging. It was definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale and my favorite class of the semester. Although its best teacher is leaving, the other two teachers are pretty solid too. Study hard and you will do well.",
    "Biochem is one of the better courses that I have taken as a bio major. As long as you stay on top of the reading and take time to go over the lectures, especially in the third part of the course, you will be fine. The midterms and final are very fair and, in general, cover the big picture concepts so it is easy to do well. However, each question is worth 5-10 points (for example drawing one simple structure) so if you get anything wrong it is easy to lose those points. The standard deviation is therefore quite large (10-13 points if I recall correctly). The professors are great. Go to office hours if you don\u0092t understand anything.",
    "Definitely recommend. My favorite science class so far. Orsnston make it especially great. However, beware - apparently it's Ornston's last year of teaching it, and things might change since he will no longer be in charge of it. Breaker as a lecturer was pretty good too though. So was Engleman, both were clear and straightforward."
