    "General knowledge of Egyptian History",
    "Prior to taking this course, I characterized Ancient Egypt by King Tuts tomb, mummies, and pyramids. While these were all significant to Egyptian culture, I never understood how complex and interesting Egypt truly was, ow how Egypt affected the development of civilizations today. I have a new view of the ancient world and the way civilizations and empires form.",
    "I learned a lot about how to study\/reevaluate ancient history.",
    "The key eras of ancient Egyptian history-- from predynastic to Greco-Roman. Examined political, cultural, economic, environmental, religious aspects of various periods.",
    "I find it rare at Yale to take a class with a professor who is both a great scholar and a great educator, and moreover visibly passionate about the work they do. It was fun taking the course and learning about the uniqueness of ancient Egypt and also how to think about ancient history\/history as whole- how to question and frame our understandings of these civilizations.",
    "I learned so much Egyptian history. Such a nice over view of everything. Professor Manning really helps to facilitate learning instead of making you memorize hundreds of pharaohs that you will forget in a day.",
    "A historical overview of Ancient Egypt, beginning in the predynastic period and ending after the Roman occupation.",
    "Overview of ancient Egypt that did a good job of examining political history, social history when possible, and archaeology.",
    "I gained an appreciation for ancient Egyptian history, particularly its rich literary tradition and material culture.",
    "Learned about the progression of ancient Egypt in relation to society, the kingship and culture.",
    "I learned not only about the history of Pharaonic Egypt, but also about key social, economic, geographic, and political factors that impacted ancient Egypt and modern Egypt.",
    "A brief history of Egypt as well as multiple themes in ancient Egyptian life. We got to read a bunch of interesting primary texts that reflect those aspects.",
    "Solid foundation in broad Egyptian history and an in-depth understanding of the changes and continuities within Egypt over time. Understanding of Egyptian history as it relates to the time\/locale itself and history on a broader, international scale. Built skills in reading and writing about history",
    "The ability to historicize Egyptian history, along with a good broad overview of Ancient Egyptian History.",
    "I learned a lot about Ancient Egypt, from the Old Kingdom through Ptolemaic Egypt.",
    "An excellent survey of Egyptian history from the Saharan Neolithic and Predynastic Period through the beginning of the Roman era, including the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, the intermediary periods, and the Late Period and Ptolemaic Egypt. We studied Egyptian history through both the lenses of archaeology and philology, learning about tombs and momuments, funerary complexes, and temple architecture and iconography as well as a selection of literature from the Old, Middle (Classical Egyptian) and New Kingdoms. The second half of the course investigated some themes in Egyptian History such as writing, statehood, religion, society, trade and foreign relations and medicine and technology.",
    "Provides an overview of Egyptian history from pre-dynastic times through the Ptolemaic era and has modules on specific aspects of ancient Egyptian life and material history, including religion, trade and literature.",
    "I learned about Egyptian history as well as to critically analyze historical evidence",
    "I learned a great deal about the history of Ancient Egypt, as well as how it can motivate our views on the modern world.",
    "I learned an in depth history of ancient Egypt. It made me think about how pre-industrial societies really shaped our modern society.",
    "An in-depth overview of the course of ancient Egyptian history, helping to dispel some commonly held beliefs about the region along the way. This class gave me a new and unique perspective on the course of Egyptian history and the concepts of continuity vs. change within their culture, including how their ancient past relates to their present state.",
    "Learned a ton about ancient Egypt!",
    "Understanding of how ancient societies develop"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Manning is an amazing lecturer and makes the course both engaging and interesting. There are not many weaknesses to the course; I think it is a good structured class.",
    "The availability and approachability of the professor is a great strength in this course. Sometimes the lecture-style can get repetitive but overall stays engaging.",
    "The in-depth usage of two texts that are primarily used helped to focus subject matter.",
    "Greatest strengths: wonderfully interesting primary source readings and creative short essay prompts. Weaknesses: sometimes disjointed lectures (consider scripting introductions and conclusions to assure each class session has a clear narrative arc) and overly dense textbook readings.",
    "This course is great. Very interesting material, fairly light reading load, and good essay topics. Not really a whole lot to improve on!",
    "The course is organised so that we complete a survey of Egyptian history until the midterm, then go on to explore individual themes until the final. The historical survey seems particularly brief, as each of the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms are only given one 50-minute lecture, which is hardly enough to get into deeper analysis. Further, with Egyptian religion being such a significant part of Egyptian society, I would have liked to see a lecture on that early in the term so we can have it in mind when looking at historical trends and events.",
    "You go through all the kingdoms very fast then go back and fill in some of the cultural elements. While this is good, it could be improved by just going over everything that pertains to each kingdom while we are learning about them.",
    "N\/A",
    "Lectures - perhaps because of their 50-minute lengths - are sometimes too rushed. The content is always interesting but sometimes not all the slides will be gone through. I like the way this class combines textual reading and material culture, and the film screening adds on to its strengths. One thing I do feel can be improved is the finals format though! If five essays are expected to be written in three hours, perhaps some can be non-handwritten. Or there could be some ID and map questions. My hand could not move for a day after the final and the pain it felt towards the end definitely affected the quality of my response.",
    "Strengths: interesting and unique content; engaging without being overwhelming; assignments required strong analysis of various information\/materials; use of primary source literature Weaknesses: some of the secondary sources were unnecessarily long\/technical; discussion section did not always reach the level of engagement I would have hoped for Improvements: I think this class was great the way it was",
    "The material is great if you're interested, and Professor Manning lecturers in an engaged way. The essays are short and fairly open-ended, and the tests are reasonable. Sections can vary based on the TA you get.",
    "The lectures were enjoyable and informative. The readings were very manageable, and the exams were very fair; students knew what to study beforehand. No noteable weaknesses.",
    "A broader selection of secondary literature could be helpful, although this is challenging given the scarcity of Egyptian historiography written at a general enough level for an introductory course.",
    "The lectures were always facinating, as they covered content that was in the same time period or theme as the readings, but entirely new, and not found within the book. As thus, my engagement during lectures was always quite high, and I greatly enjoyed going to lectures. The discussion sections were a bit weaker, as it was often evident that many of the people had either only done a cursory reading, or not done the readings at all. As such, our discussions were often dominated by a couple individuals, rather than being full on discussions.",
    "Interesting lectures and readings. Tests and papers were all fair.",
    "Strengths: great prof, great TA, midterm and final were challenging but fair, learned a ton, very much enjoyed. Weaknesses: Section with prof manning was a little weak, felt less like a discussion between classmates and the professor, more like we all asked him our questions and he responded directly to the person asking.",
    "Strength: the interesting material Weakness: there was no intellectual challenge at all"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I loved this course. It is fun, interesting, and makes learning an enjoyable experience.",
    "Yes! This course material is very interesting and is explained extremely well by Prof. Manning.",
    "Yes, it's a great course if you haven't taken any ancient history classes yet. It teaches you a lot about how to use\/evaluate sources when lack a lot of them.",
    "Professor Manning's passion and knowledge are all to clear throughout the course and you will definitely learn a lot of random fun facts along the way.",
    "In Egypt of the Pharaohs, you truly get out what you put in. You could care very little about and do very little for this class and still walk away with a strong grade, as the course never pretends to be especially rigorous. At the same time, Professor Manning's survey of ancient Egyptian history opens up fascinating avenues for generative thought: how do we know what we know? why and how do states form? how do ideologies, hierarchies, and moralities develop over time? what did it mean to be human in ancient Egypt, and what does that mean for we humans today? This course's highs are high (great primary source readings and creative essay prompts) and its lows are low (often disjointed lectures and overly dense textbook readings). If you're looking for a one-time trip into ancient history or a light but interesting fifth class, Egypt of the Pharaohs is worth your while.",
    "yes! a must take before you graduate.",
    "Yes, take this class. Professor Manning is very nice, and the lectures are engaging. Sit in the front for maximum banter.",
    "Relatively easy pre-industrial credit that's also interesting; take it.",
    "Yes! This class is very interesting in its own right and does not require previous knowledge or background in ancient Egyptian history to enjoy or do well in. Professor Manning and CJ did a really great job de-mystifying ancient Egypt, separating the common stereotypes that we have from the historical truths and trends. The content is very straightforward and the workload is very manageable as a fifth credit.",
    "Fantastic course to take if you want a general overview of Egyptian history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Manning is knowledgeable, approachable, and entertaining. He makes it easy to stay engaged with the material. My TF, CJ, was also very insightful and helpful. Workload is very manageable and the material is pretty interesting overall. Class is organized in a low-stress manner that makes it conducive to learning and good grades if you mostly keep up with lectures and readings",
    "This class was very fun! The professor is great and the content is really ingesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is highly engaging and although it covers a huge portion of history I think Professor Manning goes through the material in a way that is clear and not at all confusing. If you have ever had any interest in Egyptian history you should take this course, particularly if you need a humanities credit or to fill out your History major.",
    "Yes, because its a good example of non-Eurocentric history that the history department offers. Offers a different perspective even for European history majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody interested in or just curious about Egyptian history. This era\/region is often overlooked, and this course taught me how much ancient Egypt influenced the rest of later history. Prof. Manning was always extremely excited about the information he was giving us, which made the course even better. He is extremely knowledgeable, and does a great job of making the course engaging and intriguing for his students. This was my favorite course this semester",
    "Yes, if they are interested in history or Ancient Egypt.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. The material is very interesting and relevant for understanding other Mediterranean cultures and Egypt's impact on Greco-Roman Antiquity. Learning about the great Pharaohs and the incredible art and momuments of Ancient Egypt is absolutely essential for anyone pursing a liberal arts education.",
    "Gut with a kind, lovely professor? Hell yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Egyptian history\/any history major looking for an interesting credit.",
    "Yes I recommend this to anyone interested in the ancient world",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in Ancient Egypt. As a class about Ancient Egypt, obviously, the class will not be enjoyable if you do not find history, or Ancient Egypt, interesting. This is a pure history class, which should tell you much of what you need to know with regards to whether you will enjoy the class. Lectures were very engaging, with the material in them being novel, as well as building upon the readings. Professor Manning does a great job of lecturing and making the content engaging. Every lecture, I was suprised when it was time to leave, as I always felt that we hadn't been in lecture for that long, despite the fact that 80 minutes had passed. The assigment workload consists mainly of doing large amounts of readings, with two papers. Both of the exams were specifically outlined with wonderful study guides, and thus made the class much less stressful than it might have otherwise been. Overall, if you are interested in taking a history class of some kind at Yale, I would highly recommend taking this course, as I loved almost everything about it.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in the ancient world and how it relates to society today. There is a lot that I learned about ancient Egyptian society that contradicted what I had previously believed and I highly enjoyed attending each and every lecture. The class itself is fascinating and professor Manning is an excellent lecturer.",
    "Absolutely",
    "No, it was basically an info session over one semester"
