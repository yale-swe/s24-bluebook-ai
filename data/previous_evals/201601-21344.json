    "Yes, you should take it if you want to have a good relationship with your teacher and be involved in class.",
    "Good course. Massive amounts of reading on syllabus, especially in the first part of the course, which can be annoying because its hard to tell what to prioritize. Professor is super nice and makes a big effort. Course had a flexible, casual feel, which was fun. Political theory-heavy, but don't be scared off. Def worth taking.",
    "Great seminar class; well-curated selection of readings (that will likely challenge many of your previous beliefs, which is always a good mental exercise); latter half of the course is filled with amazing speakers with intimate knowledge of what they're talking about; excellent weekly reading memos by Professor Fotos; would definitely recommend"
