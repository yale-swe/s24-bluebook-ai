   "comments": [
    "I have some friends who hated it, but I absolutely loved it. Quite possibly the best class I have taken at Yale. Keniston might come across as callous but at least he knows the material very well and is very smart.People complain about the math but I do not consider myself to be a math person and thought the math was fine.",
    "Well - hope you enjoy reading this, but you either are required to take the course or will not be allowed. This year, the course was taught very poorly and my hope is that it will be restructured in the future. The professor, although very smart, could not connect with students. The problem sets did not really leave any long-lasting impression, nor did what Keniston focused on in the course - the math behind the concepts, whereas many students would have enjoyed the course and gotten much more out of it if they were not distracted by math that was above our heads (we choose not to be econ majors, and although we understand its an important part of global affairs, much of this (math) was useless unless you plan on going to graduate school, in that case - take more advanced economics courses).",
    "If you're taking this class it's because you have to, so it's not like this review will help you decide on whether you want to take it or not. The material is really interesting, and I enjoyed doing a lot of the reading. GLBL225 is a very empirically-grounded class, which is a relief from more theoretical classes. It's quanty, which a lot of people didn't like but I appreciated. Knowing how to use STATA or taking GLBL121 with this class will help a lot -- I did neither and needed people to help me out a lot with the STATA-based problem sets. Work-wise the class is a not too hard, with only 2 exams and 4 problem sets throughout the term. However, administratively this class is pretty awful. Keniston was a great lecturer, but made some weird decisions about being super strict on exams and grading problem sets. Overall, don't fear this class if you're a Global Affairs major.",
    "No, as it is taught now I would not recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "This is a developmental economics class, no matter what they write in the title. Be prepared for a lot of quantitative work and know some STATA going in. Go to section, and get through this class. I'm hopeful that this class will improve the next time it is taught.",
    "Well, you have to take it, right? But keep your ears open, there's actually a lot of interesting and useful material here.",
    "The material in this class was very interesting though very theoretical. If you don't have a background in economics or statistics it will be challenging, though the class may change next year. I liked learning about the subject, and the class made me more aware of international development issues. I also liked learning about all the different studies that have been done in the field. However, the class definitely can be frustrating and confusing at times.",
    "If you're a global affairs major, you have to take this course so just take it and try to enjoy it.",
    "It is a good introduction to the issues of development econ, but some stat and econometrics background is recommended. I would not seek this class out, however, if you are not in the Global Affairs major and have to take it. It needs some time to improve I'd say.",
    "I would recommend this class, but I would also recommend shoring up on your mathematics beforehand, because the professor went to MIT and acts like it. He was still good, despite this.",
    "Approaches to International Development is a great introduction to an incredibly important subject. Covering topics such as healthcare, insurance, savings, micro-finance, small firms, food aid, and conflict in developing countries, the class helps illuminate the economic principles behind current anti-poverty efforts. The class does require some basic knowledge of statistics, but the quantitative aspects of the course are not particularly difficult. While it was Professor Keniston's first year teaching, he is a great professor and will only get better.",
    "Yes, if you are global affairs. If you're just looking for a development economics course, try to look for one where there is more established course material.",
    "The course information for GLBL 225 did not list any pre-requisites and yet the professor assumed that every student had a basic understanding of intermediate calculus and microeconomics, and basic econometrics and statistics. He explained difficult mathematical or economic concepts cursorily and by couching them in other mathematical concepts or theories. For a student without a significant background in economics or mathematics it was very difficult to understand most of the materials presented in the lecture. Some of our problem sets required knowledge that was not covered by the text, lecture, or section and were incredibly frustrating. I do not resent having to spend a large amount of time on an assignment; I assume that level of commitment is required by a Yale course. I do, however, resent having to spend a large amount of time on an assignment because I have not been taught the skills necessary to complete it. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.",
    "Approaches for International Development is a development economics course. The material is very interesting and engaging. This year there was a disconnect between our expected background and our actual backgrounds. Hopefully this will be eliminated in the future. Prof Keniston is good and should just get better as he teaches more classes.",
    "This semester there was a disconnect occasionally between the topics taught, the readings and the questions on the problem sets, and there was not a lot of continuity between topics. However, it was the first semester of the class and it improved throughout the semester. The topic is interesting, the readings aren't bad (or really necessary most of the time), the exams are very fair and manageable. The flow and structure of the class will surely improve after the bumpy first semester.",
    "The content of the this course is really interesting. You learn the latest information and research about economic development.",
    "This class is a requirement for the Global Affairs major, so majors do not really have much choice in taking it. If you are not in the major and do not want to be, I would actually suggest looking for another development class. Really not sure what knowledge I was supposed to walk out of class with. We read a lot of papers, so I guess you gather information about the field from that, but otherwise...Also, if you do not already know how to use the Stata (statistics) software, problem sets will be difficult to complete.",
    "If you are interested in development at all do not take this course unless you have to, or you will end up not wanting to study it any more later in the future. All the conclusions we reach in the course are simply \"so we really do not know what to do about this.\" If another professor is teaching it, it might be worth it though.",
    "I think so. On one hand, I'm really glad I took the course. I learned a lot and grew a lot. There is no other course like it, and if you want to learn about development, or develop your quantitative analysis skills, it's a good enough course that should definitely take it (and if you're a GA major, you have to). On the other hand, this course could be a lot better. The class was at times confusing, and section was not helpful. We were over our heads for much of the semester, though we did eventually find our way and swim to the surface. I think it will be a lot better in future years--the prof and Jackson have recognized the weaknesses and will be improving it.",
    "take it as late as you can in the Global Affairs major. Hopefully it will be taught by someone else, or perhaps in a couple semesters Prof. Keniston will become a better teacher (he is new to Yale, although you would expect him to know us better since he went here for undergrad..). The class has great material -the depth and breath of development, although (at least this time around) it should have been called 'Intro to Development Economics' because there was a lot of econ we were partially expected to know that wasn't reviewed or properly taught. So you will learn a lot, but itwon't be very pleasant (even if you're in the development track and you're passionate about the subject).",
    "As a global affairs major you have to take it, so just come prepared, econometrics is not a prerequisite but I would definitely suggest that you take it before",
    "This class should not be called \"Approaches to International Development\" because it addresses only one approach-- Randomized Controlled Trials. While these are extremely important and make valuable contributions to international development work, they are NOT the whole story, and I left class each and every day with an insane amount of frustration with how biased this course is to quantitative measurements and economic theories. Like I said, these things are extremely important but NOT the whole story! Considering that this class is supposed to be an INTRODUCTORY course to international development, I would have appreciated it very much if the class 1) did not require such high level math and econ skills and 2) was not so unabashedly biased towards one single approach towards international development. Addressing alternative approaches, such more qualitative research methods and anthropological theories, would make this class a whole lot more well-rounded and a lot more engaging and worthwhile for students like myself who are more intrigued by these other approaches to international development. Furthermore, addressing the shortcomings and failures of the RCT approach would also make this class less biased, yet I feel like all we heard about was how great RCTs are all the time and how they are the answer to everything (which is NOT true). If the class continues to exist in its current form, students will learn a lot about Randomized Controlled Trials but will learn nothing about their downsides and shortcomings and even less about alternative approaches to international development, making this a very lop-sided and incomplete attempt at an Introductory course to international development.",
    "If this class wasn't a prerequisite for the Global Affairs major I would not recommend it. But if you are an econ major it is an interesting introduction to economics in the developing world."
