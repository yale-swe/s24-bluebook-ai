    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is so incredibly interesting and relevant. There is quite a bit of reading, but it's manageable if you plan your time well. The one negative aspect of the class was the number of students. Professor Joseph likes to make the class open to the most possible students, but having a larger class makes it more difficult to get in on the discussions sometimes. It was still a fantastic class, though.",
    "I learned a lot of stuff throughout this course, so I guess that was good, but it was also an incredibly frustrating experience because it was ALL taught to fulfill an agenda. Professor Joseph seems to teach from the ultimate point of view of \"Communism is good for Latin America. The USA sucks.\" Every single reading is just skewed towards this view. Class discussions, too: every time somebody said something dissident, Professor Joseph would interrupt to tell him\/her exactly why he was wrong, and then steer the conversation back to accepted territory. The result was a lot of boring, unfulfilling class discussions in which we all sat around and confirmed each other's (and his) views for two hours. \"I agree\" was definitely the most frequently used term in this class.In short: we did learn a lot about Latin America in this class, and the syllabus was a good mix of films, news articles, and more scholarly essays. It wasn't a bad experience. Professor Joseph is a compelling speaker and teacher. But the entire class is so incredibly biased that I ended up resenting having to do the readings and go to class. I feel like I was deprived of the chance to get a fulfilling, nuanced perception of modern Latin America: the class was clearly not taught with the goal of exploring complex situations and then reaching conclusions, it BEGAN with a thesis\/overall point and then structured an entire semester towards an incredibly biased repetition of that point. We learned facts. We didn't learn how to think.",
    "A very good look at revolutions in 20th century Latin America, as the name suggests. The class focuses on Nicaragua and also branches out to Cuba, Chile, Venezuela, and Bolivia. The background I gained from this class seems very relevant to hot topics in currant affairs, Chavez for instance.",
    "If you're interested at all in Latin American history and cold war politics, take this class! The students who were selected for it were great, everyone very interested in the material, and we always had lively and challenging discussions in class.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in Latin America or Cold War history. This is probably one of the best designed courses at Yale. It's too bad it couldn't have been a year long course.",
    "Revolutionary Change is a FANTASTIC course. I had no previous experience with Latin American history, but I still felt like I was able to learn a lot. It combines a good focus on specific cases with attention to broad historical narratives, as well as addressing international, national, and local political considerations.Professor Joseph is a fantastic teacher both inside and outside of class. He has such great experience in the fields we discuss, yet is still very committed to hearing students' ideas.",
    "This seminar traces the theme of revolution throughout Latin American history in the 20th century, with particular emphasis on case studies of Nicaragua and Venezuela. Professor Joseph is very enthusiastic and always made seminar discussions engaging. The course was also enriched by films and a speaker series. It was definitely a time commitment, but I also got a lot more out of it than any of my other classes. If you have any interest in the topic of revolutions or the region of Latin America, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "WONDERFUL class. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The class is well planned, the reading is fascinating, the writing assignments are innovative and well-thought-out, Professor Joseph is always available, the class discussions are engaging, and I learned a ton.Professor Joseph is by far one of the best professors I have had. He cares so much about the students and the subject material, he is always available to meet with students, and he is a brilliant discussion leader: never too overbearing, but always ready with just the right comment or question to keep the discussion moving.",
    "This is a really great class if you're interested in Latin America, the Cold War, History, or even current politics. It covers a lot of material, but it's fascinating, and the workload is manageable. Prof. Joseph is an expert in this area and keeps class discussion interesting and engaging.",
    "This was an outstanding course, perhaps the best History course I\u0092ve taken at Yale. Professor Joseph puts a tremendous amount of work into making this class hum, and it shows. His syllabus is extremely well designed; he makes expert use of film screenings and guest speakers that really augment the learning experience. The journal assignment was a brilliant way to have us work through the readings and the other course materials and to tie up loose ends from discussion. A majority of the students in the class comes to it with some \u0093reason\u0094 for taking it, but whether you have any interest in Latin America, in an alternative perspective on the Cold War, or in seeing what a wonderful professor can do with fascinating subject material, I highly recommend that you take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This class covers a large chunk of history that American schools often neglect because it is one of our darkest periods. Great teacher; interesting readings; smart people. Take it.",
    "This is a fantastic class. Gil Joseph is incredibly knowledgeable and an able facilitator of discussion. The readings are not too long, always engrossing, and teach you about things that are not talked about in other classes. Take this class.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you take an introductory course first and your other classes are light on the reading.",
    "This course is fabulous. I had not taken any classes on Latin America and knew shamefully little about the region. While we tend to ignore our neighbors to the south, the histories of these nations in the last 50 years or so are deeply fascinating, engaging, dynamic, hopeful, and tragic stories. I never come close to doing all of the reading for a class, and I found myself doing all of it almost every week for this one. This is basically current events, and it's incredible stuff. Professor Joseph combines these readings with provocative guest lecturers and films outside of class, and he creates an in-class environment in which his students come to share his obvious passion for the material. Discussions are vibrant, and all sides of the issue are explored. This is not your typical, detached analytical approach to history. It is an engaged analysis of the history that values personal interaction with it. Both approaches are really valuable, but most seminars take the former. I'd highly recommend trying this approach with Professor Joseph."
