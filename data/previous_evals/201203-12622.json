   "comments": [
    "Yes, I recommend this course especially to math and philosophy majors.",
    "Yes take the course, but be prepared to take many notes and to have to read the book independently. Overall a great course, moves a little slowly though.",
    "Yes, take it - it's easy.",
    "I would recommend it as a credit towards the Math major which is different from Math classes I've taken here so far.",
    "Good intro course to ZF set theory. Moves too slowly to really get into interesting stuff (ordinals, Continuum Hypothesis, Axiom of Choice, etc.), but provides a good foundation of the first few axioms and the skeleton of type theory (classes, proper classes, etc.). Only 3 psets this semester (may vary, depending on how much you cover), all of which were pretty easy, involving simple manipulation of definitions. Midterms and final require more thought and solving the proofs within the time constraint is stressful.",
    "Math 270 was a very well paced introduction to Set Theory. I appreciated the ample time Zuckerman gave us to digest material and the precision with which most of the proofs in class were delivered. I would recommend reading up on a little set theory before you take this class to make sure you are interested in the material. It can be dry at times but also quite rewarding as you come to understand more about the foundation of mathematics.",
    "This is a class that's half philosophy and half mathematics. The first bit of the class seems incomprehensible just because it's so foreign, but it makes sense. You have to really, really concentrate when doing the problem sets- especially the first one! Professor Zuckerman is a really cool guy. Sometimes he gets carried away trying to give us information and it gets overwhelming, but I enjoyed the class. I probably didn't do very well, but I'm gladI took it anyways.",
    "If you like theoritical math and proofs and logic then you will like math 270! Read the book and make sure you understand all the definitions early on !",
    "Fascinating topic, great professor.",
    "It's a painfully slow course. There are some interesting gems, but they're not worth the tedium of the class and the subject itself. This is very much a logic rather than math-oriented course.",
    "I loved the material, but it's a really tough course. It relies on very precise definitions and fairly rigorous derivations. Sometimes, I wouldn't even understand what we were trying to prove, or why we even had to prove something (we often had to prove things that, in a less rigorous course, we would have taken as obviously following from a previous theorem\/definition).This course will teach you how to do proof-based maths and, more generally, to think in a clear logical way and to identify unconscious assumptions in your thought processes. One of the most interesting and worthwhile courses I've taken at Yale!",
    "Yes! First of, Set Theory is a very interesting topic. Second, professor Zuckerman is a great professor; he is a wise old mathemagician. The workload is light with only a few problem sets and two exams and final. The exams can be a bit tricky but not too bad if you go to lecture which you should. You don't cover too much of the textbook which is a shame but the professor takes the time to cover things in great detail which is also interesting. Great second math class.",
    "Overall, I would recommend it if you're interested in sets and set theory. I don't know if I'd recommend it to someone who just wants to take a random math course. Don't expect to get much farther than chapter 3 in the textbook. Only like, 3 or 4 problem sets, and they aren't bad at all. Midterms and final were ok. Less about theory and operations, more about... philosophy (sort of) and examples used to illustrate certain properties. Overall I'm kind of confused about the intended structure of the course - it was a bit random. Interesting stuff though, and I'm glad I took it.",
    "If you're a phil major, you'll find it hard. If you're a math major, you'll find it a gut. Otherwise it's a very interesting and carefully paced introduction to a completely new field. I found the midterms to be very hard however."
