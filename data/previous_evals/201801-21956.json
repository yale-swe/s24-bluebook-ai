    "This course made me feel like I actually learnt something from all my years at college - having a substantial final project is the most incredible feeling. The class was we'll structured and facilitated a great learning environment.",
    "I learned how to conduct a sociology research project.",
    "How to craft, conduct and write up a senior thesis essay.",
    "Great class; Tfs were excellent, Almeling was the bets teacher I have had at Yale.",
    "Throughout this course I learned how to conduct my own research and how to write a full length research paper in sociology. To this end this course was immensely valuable and giving me my first practice in something I know I am going to continue to do.",
    "I gained the experience of completing a long-term, self-directed research project unlike any other I have done at Yale.",
    "This course was the perfect culmination of the Yale Sociology degree program."

   "comments": [
    "Over all I really enjoyed having a space to come to in which to discuss challenges (and also successes) with my project progress. However it was hard to have such a big group in which everyone was doing so many different things. I often felt like I was in a very different place from other students in the class so my time in class was not always put to the best use. I appreciated the smaller break out groups, especially when we divided by methods.",
    "I think the way this colloquium is set up is perfect. Prof. Almeling does an amazing job of teaching and helping each and every student through their project. The TAs really are great at both providing academic advice while also supporting everyone through the whole process.",
    "This course provided a ton of support with helping me through my senior essay project in sociology. I cannot stress enough how helpful this was. One weakness was that since everyone was working on their own individual project sometimes it was hard for the entire class to have worthwhile discussions because we where all at slightly different places on often radically different projects. However with one on one help this class was stellar.",
    "I think that the strengths included the institutional support for a project most students were unfamiliar and nervous about. Also, the presence of TAs to give personalized feedback was very helpful. It was a little on the large size, and the projects were often so different that the formal classes were not always applicable, but it was still good to have a formal place to support the thesis process.",
    "This course provides immense support in an environment of creativity and strong community."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this will prepare you for any form of research you may pursue in the future. It is a great validation of all the work and time you put into this major.",
    "Definitely. If you are thinking about a year-long thesis in sociology, know that Almeling and the department really have your back through the whole thing. It seems like a daunting task to do your own research project (and it is), but you will have support every single step of the way.",
    "If you are deciding between the yearlong and the semester long senior essay project I highly suggest the year long. This way you can actually do your own research and take time and care into your project. A year is not quite long enough to do this whole endeavor and so a semester is much too short.",
    "I would recommend this course. Writing a senior thesis is a challenging and rewarding endeavor that requires a lot of personal motivation. It is the best opportunity to develop one's individual interests and do rigorous large-scale writing at Yale.",
    "Yes!"
