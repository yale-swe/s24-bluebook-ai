    "This is a fantastic class, with interesting and extremely relevant course material about the diaspora, a very reasonable workload, and an incredible professor! The workload this semester also included a panel discussion based Kahani workshop with eminent Hindi diaspora writers, which was an illuminating experience. Class with Seema Ji is a joy to attend. She was extremely accommodating and always responsive to her students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs. She led the class in a way that encouraged free and uninhibited discussion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which fostered a truly effective learning environment. A masterful writer herself, her opinions on current Hindi diaspora writing were always a treat to listen to, and her amiable nature made her feel like a friend to us all! Take this class even if you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in the diaspora, just because Seema Ji is so awesome!",
    "Absolutely -- this course provides incredible insight for both heritage and non-heritage students alike. I learned a lot from the class and truly appreciated every class activity, whether it was reading\/writing, or even hearing popular works from the visiting professor (and talented writer), Susham Bedi! Definitely relatable if you are of South Asian descent in a non-South Asian country.",
    "I would recommend this class to every student at Yale. Take it!!!"
