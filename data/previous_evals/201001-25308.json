   "comments": [
    "Take it, especially if you're comfortable writing in Spanish.",
    "This course was peculiar because it contains many different skill levels and, for those who are extremely serious about their writing, this is not an English department course; i.e. it isn't taught by a writing expert. It's a pity the Spanish department couldn't round up a Spanish writing expert to teach this course. Profesora Jordan is approachable, enthusiastic and sweet, but she is somewhat disorganized and I wasn't sure how qualified she actually was to teach creative writing. Many of our assignments felt very elementary. If you are seriously into creative writing, don't expect an intense writing workout.That said, the course is fun, not a lot of work, and a good way to practice Spanish in an interesting and low-key environment. You don't really get much practice with spoken Spanish, but the class contains a lot of reading so you get practice with that. Basically, you get what you put into it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who enjoys creative writing and loves Spanish. This is probably the best Spanish class I have taken at Yale so far. The workload is not unmanageable, but by the end of the semester, you will have several short stories and many poems to call your own.",
    "This class is entertaining and easy. Take it if you are fairly comfortable with advanced grammar.",
    "Most definitely. Fun, informal atmosphere, great readings and class activities, and an amazing professor!",
    "It's great for any student who is proficient in Spanish and has an interest in writing beyond essays.",
    "If interested in creative writing in Spanish, yes.",
    "Maybe not the most enriching class ever, but it's fun, creative, and not too much work, and Maria Jordan is lovely. Go ahead.",
    "Spanish Creative Writing is a course taught in Spanish that uses a variety of teaching methods to improve your Spanish and your creative writing. Through reading famous Latin American authors, daily creative assignments, and larger writing assignments, each student is able to greatly improve their proficiency level.I would definitely recommend this course."
