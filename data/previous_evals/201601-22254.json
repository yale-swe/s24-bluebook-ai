    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested to work in this field of solid state physics and material science. It is very time consuming, so I would not recommend this course as an extra course to take on top of other requirements, if this is not your field.",
    "Very thorough, fast paced class. Course material is almost exclusively straight from Ashcroft and Mermin. Weekly psets. Sohrab has impressive board work. I would recommend."

    "Anyone taking this course should be after solid state 1. It would be very hard to start this material without the appropriate background. My research area is not in this field so I am not sure how directly applicable the material we learned will be, but the models, ideas and calculations give a good overview of techniques used."
