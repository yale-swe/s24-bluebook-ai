    "greek 414 is a difficult but rewarding class for greek students interested in the genre of greek hymn and heavy discussion of literature (as opposed to say grammar or syntax). to read the theogony and the homeric hymns, the souc material for a lot of the myths you learn growing up, is an incredible experience. you do get frustrated with the hymns though for their elusiveness and confusion, but prof. leven helps you face such issues as sites of interest rather than mere frustration. it was definitely a class i looked forward to attending."
