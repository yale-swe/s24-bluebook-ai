   "comments": [
    "It is a course that familiarizes you with many of the issues of labor history, though less the facts. If you are an independent worker who really loves to get challenged by the teacher this is a good course. Also, if you're proactive Klein is the most incredible resource. She's familiar with the scholarship on pretty much any american socio-historical thing\/trend that's happened in the last 150.",
    "A really wonderful course. Some really interesting material and discussions are pretty great. Our seminar was pretty small, so we were able to really delve into the material and think critically about some really relevant issues. It's a lot of work, more than most other history junior seminars.",
    "This is a pretty good class, if you already have an extensive background. If you are new to the subject, however, look for another class. Often I felt lost and confused, and certainly intimidated by the very small size of the seminar."
