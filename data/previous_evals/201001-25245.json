    "The class teaches you the rest of the basic grammar of Russian. After you're done with the level you'll find yourself able to communicate in Russian much more freely. Be prepared for more work than the first semester. The class is very well taught. I would recommend it.",
    "Definitely! The language is great!",

    "Sure, if you want to learn russian.",
