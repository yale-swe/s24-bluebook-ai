   "comments": [
    "I would summarize this course as a great introduction to PET and fMRI techniques and some of their applications in research, particularly as they relate to human clinical disorders. Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in clinical disorders and application of imaging techniques in human clinical disorders.",
    "Really helpful and inspiring, even if you are not in the field.",
    "This is a class in which you discuss how to study the effects (immediate and long-term) of drugs (mainly alcohol and nicotine) on the human brain using imaging methods like PET and MRI. The basic structure of the class is that you read the research articles outside of class, and then in class, you discuss the methods in the context of the papers. I would recommend it because its a great way to learn about the different imaging methods out there and the professors are great.",
    "Fun, easy, and interesting class that meets once a week. Learn how to use PET to see drugs in the brain. Morris is a hilarious professor who really knows his stuff. Weekly reading responses about groundbreaking PET studies, a 2 page final paper, and one in-class design-o-thon where you design a PET study on the fly, but no final exam. The course has a few lectures about fMRI but the main focus is on PET. I definitely recommend you take this class if you want to learn about PET in a small, seminar-style class.",
    "A good course to open your eyes.",
    "Overview of methods of imaging specifically focused on drugs go abuse. Great for learning how to read papers effectively. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about imaging techniques."

   "comments": [
    "Prior to taking this course I had a very superficial understanding of both PET and fMRI methods. While my research is in animals, not humans, the topic is highly relevant to psychiatric disorders and aging, so many of the papers I read\/have read for my project are human imaging studies. This course provided a much needed boost in my understanding of these two techniques, and my ability to critically assess the literature and experiments in which PET or fMRI are used.",
    "Not related to current research; however, might be useful background information as I may work in imaging labs in the future."
