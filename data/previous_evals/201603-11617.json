    "I developed a deeper understanding of Russian classics and grammar.",
    "I developed a greater knowledge of certain aspects of Russian grammar and literature.",
    "In Russian 122a, there's a good balance of grammar, reading, and group discussions. I definitely learned a lot of grammar, though we did have to learn it really quickly. Some topics included the first case for nouns and adjectives and conjugating some verbs. There was a big focus on vocabulary regarding school\/university. As someone with only one Russian parent, it was a lot harder for me to communicate orally than those students who had grown up with two Russian-speaking parents. Since the class is graded on improvement, however, I felt that the practice I got was pretty valuable, and I did improve a little bit on my speaking. One skill I improved on the most was formal writing. Professor Titus gave me a lot of insight into how transition phrases, changing sentence structures, and varied vocabulary could change make my writing a lot more formal and complex, which was very beneficial."

   "comments": [
    "The course is uniquely tailored to students' individual needs. The workload was appropriate, and the materials were very user-friendly.",
    "This course is good because it is pretty low key and not very stressful but you still learn a lot just by practicing grammar and speaking. It is very individually tailored to each student's strengths and weaknesses which is great. I would like to have more class discussions.",
    "This class only met twice a week, but I believe that to really practice Russian, we should have met more often. However, the class time was equally divided between class discussion, grammar practice, and literature, which I found helpful. I also felt that Professor Titus was a very understanding professor who kept the class interesting. I wish there were more opportunities for us to practice speaking in class. I understand it's hard to fit times like these into a lesson, but it would have been helpful."

    "Highly recommend! Julia Titus is fantastic!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The intimate setting and pace of the course are perfect for gaining a deeper understanding of this rich language and culture.",
    "If you want a low key course to keep up your Russian without putting in a lot of effort this is the course for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has grown up in a Russian-speaking household without a formal education in Russian, although having some former practice with reading and writing would be useful. As someone who grew up with only one Russian-speaking parent, I noticed that it was a lot harder for me to speak Russian and participate in class compared to some of the people who practiced Russian a lot more regularly at home. That being said, I still understood everything that was said and that I read, so it wasn't impossible. Some students will definitely have to work harder than others to catch up. One important aspect to consider when thinking about taking this course is whether you want to learn Russian grammar as a Russian speaker or as an American learner. If you want to learn grammar as native Russian speakers learn it, take this class. A lot of the grammar rules learned require some intuitive understanding of grammar (such as with gendered nouns or the many different Russian cases). If you want to learn Russian grammar as any non-Russian speaker would, you should probably consider another course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students of all levels, since it is usually a small group and Prof. Titus caters assignments to individuals as necessary. It is a great way to maintain\/improve your conversational Russian and practice reading and writing. Take it! Make babushka proud!"
