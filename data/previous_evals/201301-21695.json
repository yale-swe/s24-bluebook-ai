   "comments": [
    "Physics 181 requires a lot more math than 180. Make sure you remember how to take derivatives and integrals. The concepts presented are a lot more confusing than 180. The problem set questions are all taken from a different textbook. The midterms only have 3 questions. Overall an okay introduction to physics. The professor is sometimes unclear, but if you ask for clarification, he will be very helpful.",
    "Yes. Even if you have no reason to take physics as a requirement, it was an enjoyable experience.",
    "It is a hard class that, despite mastering the concepts and physical laws, will always prove to be difficult and challenging. You have to be able to apply multiple difficult concepts to answer the exam questions, while the pset questions are pretty straight forward and usually concept based.",
    "Physics 181 is the worst class I have taken at Yale so far. I attended all the lectures, but they were not helpful at all, and I ended up having to learn everything from the book. The exams were unfair and outside the scope of Professor Parker's teaching. Overall, this seemed more like a math class than a physics one. Physics concepts were not explained well at all.Professor Parker was not helpful, even when he was approached with questions. He often responded in a snide (and even condescending) manner to students. In class, he spent the entire periods trying to derive equations the book takes half a page to derive, without explaining any of the physics concepts behind the equations. Exams were unfair, and he would not explain the solutions beyond telling students to \"look at the answer key.\" I feel like the topics could have been interesting, but Professor Parker made this class the worst one I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "Better than 200, which was taught by Golling and absolutely terrible.",
    "Though I had a poor experience with this class, it is pointless to comment on the professor, as he won't be around next year. Hence, let this be a broad commentary on introductory physics here at Yale: it needs revamping, and fast.At this stage I would recommend the physics sequence only to those who need it for their majors; it's not worth it otherwise.",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "If you have to take it, than take it. In many ways, I would not recommend PHYS 181, but I also do not want to recommend PHYS 171. It's a choice between two of the lesser evils in my opinion.",
    "awful. Peter Parker was not approachable, and I never met the TFs. the tests were impossible and the textbook rarely related to class. difficult topics, and few resources to better understand.",
    "Take it if you've never done any physics before. You learn a lot.",
    "Great! If you are premed and need this for MCATs.. take it! Don't be fooled by 171 or 170. Those courses are not \"easier\" and they are not catered to \"premedical students.\"",
    "I would recommend taking physics 171 if you do not like\/are not good at physics or take physics 201\/261 if you love\/are good at physics. 181 is an awkward middle ground and I would not advise taking it.",
    "Good course. You should have a good grasp of calculus coming into this course, though. Start problem sets early!",
    "Don't take it for fun. E&M is not fun. Otherwise, just grind on through. So glad to be done with this awful course.",
    "Wouldn't recommend unless required. Lectures not very useful.",
    "I had to teach myself most of the material from the book. E&M is a hard subject and Peter Parker's lectures were mostly proof-driven. The psets will teach you the material.",
    "This is a pretty standard course. Professor Parker was a very steady teacher, but sometimes it was hard to determine what his goals were in a lecture. He is, disappointingly, not Spiderman.",
    "Yes I would take this over 171. It will help you learn the physics better and prepare you for both the MCAT and for any major that requires physics.",
    "You will learn all of electricity& magnetism, at a deeper level than AP physics-- and then some relativity and quantum mechanics. Overall, it's an interesting course, but the satisfaction of students seems to vary dramatically with the instructor. If you have any leeway in which year you take the course, check the instructor's evaluations to make sure it will be at least decently taught.",
    "DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO!!!! If you do, you will survive, but you will not have fun, even if you are interested in physics. I'm not going to go into detail, because I don't want to scare people that might have to take this, but be warned ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE HORRIBLE COURSE. There was definitely no Ms. Frizzle, but they still had me like Keesha, talkin bout, \"Oh bad, oh bad, oh bad bad bad bad bad!\"",
    "Nobody enjoyed this class. If you need to take it for your major, suck it up and deal with the fact that it is inherently unpleasant. If you are just looking for a physics class because you like physics, look elsewhere.",
    "Good intro class. Take it to get the science requirement out of the way!",
    "Better than 180 with Barrett, but also difficult if you've never done circuits or electromagnetism before. The lectures (and problem sets) are a mix of very simple material and fairly complex\/confusing derivations and it can be unclear what will be tested. As long as you do a lot of practise questions, you should be fine.",
    "If you have a strong physics (AP Physics C) and\/or a strong math background (Math 120) I would recommend this class. Professor Parker is a good teacher and the problem sets and tests are tough but follow the textbook and his lectures well. There are weekly p sets, 2 one hour exams and a final. The professor for 171 this semester I heard was not very good. My biggest problem with the class is nothing is online everything is printed out. Nothing is on classes v2."
