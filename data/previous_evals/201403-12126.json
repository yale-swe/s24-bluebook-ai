    "Absolutely take the class if you can get in! It can be exhausting to work with the children, but the workload of the class is manageable and it's awesome to see the theory play out in the classroom. It's also a super manageable writing credit, which is nice",
    "This is an excellent course for those who love children and want to work with them in an active and direct way.",
    "Practicum is the best part of the class (observation at a day care for 3 hours once per week.) Lectures were hit or miss and are mostly guest speakers. Class is run like a lecture -with break out smaller groups (kinda like \"section\" for the last 45 min of the class). Course packet is expensive and reading was not really necessary as we never discussed it. Workload was very manageable - journal entries each week and a final paper.",
    "WONDERFUL CLASS! you learn so much in super relaxed setting. requirements: weekly you go to an early childhood education placement for 2 hrs, submit 2 sets of journal entries (7 entries total, talk about what you see in your placement and integrate readings), final paper (topic of your choice). the professors are extremely smart, friendly, and encouraging. difficult to get in though if youre not a senior\/junior studying psyc\/edst, goooood luck!! take this class if you can though.",
    "While at first it may seem like a nice break to visit a day care center instead of going to class, make sure you don't mind actually working with children. The way the assignments are structured makes this class a prime target for procrastination, be careful.",
    "If for no other reason, do it for the children. It's a beautiful opportunity to step outside of the Yale bubble and see some of the most beautifully innocent aspects of real life, if only for a couple of hours each week. It's refreshing and inspiring.",
    "Grading is harsh.",
    "Take this class. It is so useful and a nice change of pace.",
    "Learning the aspects of child development from infancy to ~age 6 from things like attachment theory, to language development, etc.",
    "Child Development is a must take class if you love children! It's the perfect balance of theory and application, since you learn interesting material on how children develop in class while seeing what you have learned unfold in an actual daycare center. It also simultaneously, acted as sort of a parenting class, which I thought was pretty interesting. It also serves as a writing credit! Definitely take it!",
    "It is a really unique class, and the best part is the opportunity to observe at a daycare center, which can be a wonderful change from other classes and also a great chance to learn from young children. The class is not a significant amount of work. There are only two sets of journal entries due, describing your observations, and one final paper; as long as you work on journals after each observation, you won't need to try finishing them all the day before they are due.",
    "Recommend if you like working with children. I looked forward to observing the class of 3 and 4 year olds every week and seeing things we discussed in class played out."
