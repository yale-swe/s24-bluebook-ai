   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend Directed Studies to other students. I want to be doing more extracurriculars, getting more sleep, and attending more master's teas, but I think the detailed introduction to Western philosophy is essential to understanding all scholarship since.",
    "I would recommend this to nearly everyone. It gives a basic philosophical context that is so useful, given that we live in a society where the ideas of philosophers like Aristotle are present in so many of our most basic assumptions about how the world works.",
    "DS philosophy is a great overview of early Western philosophy. For students who have not done philosophy before, it may be a little difficult to adjust at first, but the learning curve is not steep, especially if you seek out help early. There is a substantial amount of reading to do each week, which is usually significantly shorter than those of DS literature and history and politics, but also much more dense.",
    "I would summarize this class as an exploration of Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient and Medieval thinkers who would pick up, expand, or change their philosophies. I would recommend this class to a friend. It gave me a good idea about the major questions of philosophy, and how the discipline works in general.",
    "Take it!!! And then major in philosophy. Do nothing as purely a means, and you can be pretty darn sure being a philosophy means is about the least instrumental tool I can think of.",
    "Absolutely! In terms of sheer volume of text, philosophy has the lightest amount of reading, but be prepared to be confused (in a good way!) The lectures help a lot as a guide to what the text is going to say. Professor Woolf was the best!",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies to a new student based solely on my experience in this course. I think it provides a foundation for thinking that grounds a student for not only academia, but also for life.",
    "DS is a great course. Professor Woolf was really invested in teaching us about the philosophers, and the class was a pleasure.",
    "It's a class in which you read the major philosophical works from the Western canon and come to terms with your own view towards the topics they tackle. I would highly recommend it!",
    "If I were to summarize Directed Studies: Philosophy to fellow students, I would emphasize that the semester's syllabus can be thought of as divided into two main sections. The first section is the time spent studying Plato and Aristotle, who establish what I would call the \"Core Questions\" of the semester: the nature of the soul, the possibility of immortality, issues of God and Being, etcetera. Then, the second half of the semester includes all the other philosophers of the curriculum:Sextus, Cicero, St. Augustine, St. Anselm, St. Thomas Acquinas, etcetera. These philosophers examine more specific implications of the \"Core Questions\" defined by Plato and Aristotle - methods of how to achieve the ideal life, strategies of proving God's existence, etcetera. Understanding beforehand this structure of the curriculum can help provide a more productive and satisfying study of the texts.I would definitely recommend this course to another student. As long as students are willing and able to spend several weeks studying only Plato and Aristotle before even hearing the name of another philosopher, they will enjoy stimulating and dynamic classroom discussion and an opportunity to put the greatest minds of antiquity to the test of open conversation. Among all the Directed Studies classes this semester, philosophy was particularly meaningful for me because the works we read in this course have a way of targeting the individual reader directly and unapologetically, forcing the individual student to turn his or her mind in thought and debate about plaguing questions long before class discussion even starts. Any student who longs for this kind of academic stimulation and personal reflection as a freshman should definitely take this class!",
    "DS philosophy is a survey of some of the greatest classical and early medieval western thinkers. The class is perfect for anyone interested in philosophy on an introductory level.",
    "This class convinced me to become a philosophy major! It is amazing how the works of ancient philosophers opens our minds today. I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an open and curious mind."
