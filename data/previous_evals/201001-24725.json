   "comments": [
    "Not a demanding class by any means. Laid back and conversational classes. Self change project can be very rewarding if you take it seriously. You'll be fine even if you don't.",
    "Interesting subject matter made boring by class structure. Class attendance is not necessary to do well\/ grasp the material... very redundant.",
    "Take It!",
    "I would reccomend this class to anyone who has in interest in health topics and psychology. You need an interest in both because it really is an integration of both where you end up playing out scenarios in which you are a therapist trying to help a patient change their health behaviors, so it really is an integration of psyc. therapy techniques and health. If you have not had much exposure to psychology or other psychology classes you might feel a bit disorientated at first.",
    "The class was great! Last year's evaluations were not so great so I was a little hesitant to take the class but I am so glad I did! The class was basically conducted in seminar style even though it was meant to be a big lecture class since there were only about 15 students. Professor Toll is a great Professor and very supportive. Classes were lways interesting and wer covered many different health behaviours and possible treatments. Also the guest lectures were great (even if sometimes not that closely related to the rest of the course). Classes are usually divided into about 45 minutes of lectures (with lots of discussion and student involvement) followed by role plays (which are not graded and may seem daunting at first but turn out to be really helpful and fun and let you apply what you just learnt). This is a great class but only take it if you are really interested in the field since it is not a survey course but rather very specific and skills approached.",
    "Interesting material if you're interested in health psychology. Class is a little dry though.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that this class really shows students what the practice and application of Clinical Psychology is really like, especially pertaining to health behaviors. I would recommend this class to students who are either really interested in practicing clinical psychology as both researchers and counselors, or students who are interested in health promotion and behaviors."
