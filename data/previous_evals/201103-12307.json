    "yes, take it.",
    "if you are at all interested in the whole process of photography as a medium, go for it. it is a lot of work, but you get to do things with your hands, you learn a set of skills, and at the end you have a body of work to show for it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in art. It is a very accessible form of art. It is also really fun to learn all the techniques. Don't take the class if you are not willing to put in the time. It is only worth it when you can devote a lot of time to it. But make time for it, because it is awesome.",
    "absolutely.",
    "It wouldn\u0092t be fair to talk about B\/W Intro Photo without at least talking about Professor Donaldson (Ben). Undoubtedly, he is the nicest, most helpful person to teach students how to take photographs. Both within class, and outside, he advised us how to improve our technique, and was always encouraging us to go beyond our comfort levels. This class has a fair amount of work, and we needed to shoot nearly 30 rolls of film and show finished prints for a critique three times over the course of the semester. We were also expected to show progress, both in the subject matter of our prints, as well as in the quality of our prints. Ben was helpful by telling us how select our best prints, as well as giving us advice how to print better. In addition to the technical portion of the class, where we learned how to use the camera, develop and print photos, I found the lectures on photography as a medium of art quite helpful. We explored different photographers through the ages, and Ben talked about the photographers who developed a new idiom by means of this medium. We also had the opportunity to go to an exhibition on Walker Evans, and learn about his work before and during his tenure at the Yale School of Art.Overall, I would definitely recommend this class\u0097Ben is one of the nicest and most helpful professors I have met, and he will certainly make you put forth your best work. I felt that by taking Ben\u0092s advice, I improved as a photographer, and know how to put together a bunch of photos for an exhibition. Also he was always encouraging us about our work, and always telling us ways to improve our work.Even if you aren\u0092t an Art major, Intro Photo is an interesting class, and you will enjoy taking photographs for it.",
    "Art 136 is a photography course focusing on 35 mm film cameras using black and white film. Work is judged in regular critiques.",
    "There are two classes a week, 3 critiques a semester, and a lot of time taking photographs and developing them in the darkroom. I highly recommend this class-- I learned a very practical skill, and an art. The time spent in the darkroom was a great counter-balance to the way the rest of my time at Yale is spent."
