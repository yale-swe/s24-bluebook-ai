    "I would only recommend ECON 111 02 to a friend who was definitely pursuing a degree in Economics. Otherwise, I think reading Milton Friedman would suffice.",
    "If you liked Micro, that doesn't necessarily mean that you will like Macro.",
    "If you're trying to decide between taking the macro lecture or seminar, I would definitely encourage you to consider taking the seminar! I really enjoyed the seminar this semester, and the small class size made it easier to ask questions. Also, the Buzz Groups (small group exercises) that we did in class kept the material engaging. Overall, I had a great experience in the seminar, and I learned a lot while staying interested.",
    "Take this class if you want to challenge yourself and understand macroeconomics in a more intimate setting!",
    "Econ 111 will allow you to develop your understanding of the modern economy and financial system without diving into technical jargon and complex equations. After the class you will be able to understand and discuss monetary and fiscal policy, as well as their impact on inflation. Additionally, the seminar offers an engaging environment where you can directly interact with the teacher and other students."
