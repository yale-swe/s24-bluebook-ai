   "comments": [
    "This class is a must. For any non-native speaker, it might prove a little difficult, but Prof. Angela Lee-Smith makes the course so much more fun and enjoyable than what the text suggests. Not only that, you get to create a great personal relationship with the professor, who cares for you not only academically, but in terms of your life in general and your extra curricular activities in and outside the school. She takes the time to make Korean food for all of us and brings it to language table, and you can just see how much of a motherly figure she is. Not only that, but she gives consistently helpful tips and corrections on the writing of Korean (which is really difficult at times) and I saw my writing improve significantly over the course of the semester to a point where I feel much more confident about writing in Korean. Take this class!",
    "Take this class!! Professor Lee-Smith is truly one in a million.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to a student who is willing to commit time and effort to learning Korean at the advanced level. It is a rewarding experience.",
    "Excellent course that would really push your language skill to the next level, if you put in the work. There is a lot of work, both in quantity and diversity, but it really helps you improve in writing, speaking, reading, and a general command of the language. The professor also clearly cares about your improvement throughout the term."
