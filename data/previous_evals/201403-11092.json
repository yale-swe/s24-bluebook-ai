   "comments": [
    "A paper-based discussion group where high impact articles from the medical and scientific literature are presented and dissected. For people interested in academic medicine and graduate-level science, it was a great complement to the biochem lectures.",
    "The course is a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. Material is presented quickly, though, and thus requires a significant amount of time outside class to integrate. Workshops are interesting and help place lecture material in a broader context.",
    "It's a good course for a broad overview of biochemistry and discussing papers.",
    "Weekly journal club on clinically relevant topics related to biochemistry\/metabolism. Would recommend to take, will definitely help hone your abilities to read and understand journal articles efficiently.",
    "The course is designed to encourage students to pursue molecular understanding of disease processes they will encounter in their future clinical practices. For me, it accomplished this goal, exciting me about the possibility of one day discovering the genetic basis of a previously uncharacterized disease. The course also encourages students to assess medical literature critically rather than accepting anything and everything published as gospel."

   "comments": [
    "Deepened my understanding of biochemical research techniques, though they probably will not be relevant for my dissertation research.",
    "Although this course didn't directly contribute to my research, it did provide me with a fundamental understanding of the biochemistry that underlies all of the science we do, and I anticipate that this foundation will be incredibly valuable moving forward, particularly as a medical student.",
    "Good overview of biochemistry.",
    "This was a required course for me, and one that I had taken prior. Not as in-depth as previous Biochemistry I have studied, but well put together nonetheless.",
    "Helped solidify biochemical\/metabolic concepts, helped develop my journal reading abilities.",
    "The course deepened my understanding of the genetic basis of metabolic disease and the gene editing techniques that may be used in the future to treat such disease.",
    "This course allowed me to appreciate more the importance of basic science for improving treatment in clinic."
