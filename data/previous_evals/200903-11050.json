    "I would say that it exposes students to a great deal of Renaissance authors. Yet in my opinion, none of these authors are treated in any kind of depth, and often what results is a host of conflicting ideas, unfinished thoughts, and overall confusion. I realize the impossibility of treating authors in depth when, say, we only have a single day budgeted for Machiavelli. Indeed whole courses could be devoted to many of the authors and texts studied. For this reason I found the course to be a disappointment. In my view, it's always better to aim for genuine engagement with primary texts, even at the expense of breadth. Though this might not fully introduce students to the vast discipline of Renaissance studies and might weaken their knowledge of current anglo-american authorities in the field, I would willingly make this sacrifice if only to gain more time for engagement with the likes of Alberti, Ficino, Machiavelli, and others. In sum, because I found the reading assignments too heavy, and the discussions too light, I would not recommend the course to another student.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who has an interest in the period and who is willing to engage in in-depth conversations on primary texts."
