    "disorganized sign in, good food!",
    "Strengths: Engaging topics Weaknesses: Not enough food for everyone",
    "This course was fine overall--the topics were fairly interesting and free lunch is always a plus. The only thing that would improve it would be to emphasize from the beginning of the semester that SBS seminars and CDE seminars don't have to be attended by students in the other program. Perhaps create separate course numbers.",
    "I enjoyed the seminars but wish we had them as often as some of the other concentrations.",
    "It was great having professors come and talk about their research. Very ironic that a CDE\/SBS seminar did not have one faculty of color presenting their work.",
    "I enjoyed learning about each professor's research.",
    "It may be helpful to send out a survey at the beginning of the semester to see if SBS\/CDE students are interesting in hearing about particular topics",
    "It was great.",
    "I thought the speakers were excellent and the department made an effort to make sure there was a wide variety of disciplines covered in the guest lectures. I also appreciate the variety of food and healthy options provided!",
    "The seminar is great in providing SBS students with insight on what research opportunities await them, and how what we learn in the classroom may be applied to the real world.",
    "The best part about this seminar was the free lunch. I did not enjoy the topics covered very much. It would be interesting to have the guests speak about their research for 30 minutes and themselves and their career paths for the remainder of the time. It would be more useful in that sense.",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar series, each week was a unique and interesting presentation.",
    "Strengths:Different topic every session; variety Weakness: Sometimes the talks were dull",
    "The diversity of the speakers was a huge asset!",
    "A great way for students to learn about the current research at the school of public health as well as research conducted by academics elsewhere.",
    "We had some very interesting seminars over the course of the semester.",
    "The SBS\/CDE seminar was amazing! It was held every other week and allowed us to listen to different professors discuss their work and the implications they have for public health. I found them very interesting, exciting, and the food that accompanied these seminars was well-appreciated.",
    "There were a few lecturers that were fantastic!",
    "I enjoyed the variety of speakers and am grateful that it was biweekly. The lecturers were engaging and the content was great.",
    "Interesting research presented",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the SBS seminar. I think there were some very interesting talks presented that showed the breadth of what SBS entails and provided an opportunity to engage with professors whom we may not otherwise have the opportunity to experience.",
    "This past semester's speakers were really great, and helpful for learning a lot about exciting research going on at Yale.",
    "I enjoyed the seminars during this semester but felt they should be offered every week.",
    "Good diversity of speakers"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student as it helps you learn about other research you might otherwise not hear. All lecturers are knowledgeable in their field, hence you will be able to learn a lot from them.",
    "For the amount of time you spend in class this course is worth it.",
    "This is a great experience and I am very glad that we get to sit in on these. I would encourage people outside the department to come as well.",
    "Great course. Lacked diversity.",
    "We get to hear about research being done by the professors in our department. I found it interesting an was glad I had the opportunity.",
    "Seminars were a great way to become familar with the amazing professors and the work that they are doing at Yale.",
    "Yes it was instructive and helpful.",
    "All CDE and SBS students have to attend this seminar. I thought it was a great way to learn about different things one can do within both departments, and speakers were excellent. I would recommend attending all of the lectures if you can, even the ones that are not required for your particular department. If you really like one of the lecturers, the seminar is a great opportunity to learn more about their work and approach them for mentorship, internship opportunities, etc.",
    "Attending seminar is excellent in allowing SBS students to really observe the broad range of topics that SBS covers.",
    "The food is great (and free) and the speakers are okay. It is required and only once per week so you should attend.",
    "Yes, this course helps you see what fields are being studied in Public Health. It helps develop an interest in the processes of research and the progress of public health.",
    "A great overview of issues in chronic disease epi and a nice supplement to my course schedule!",
    "A few interesting speakers and some that are not very engaging. It needs more people from applied epi.",
    "It's great! I can't wait to attend the seminars in the spring.",
    "I thought that most of the lunch seminars were fascinating because of the diverse academic specialties of the speakers. I would recommend going to any that sound interesting (even those outside of your own track).",
    "Its a great taste of all the things involved in SBS.",
    "It is mandatory and interesting",
    "The seminar in SBS is a biweekly lunchtime series of professors from the department giving talks about their research projects and academic interests.",
    "I would.",
    "It's required but definitely worthwhile."
