    "Fun. Not too intense. Solid class.",
    "Even though a lot of arch majors take this course, it is great to take as a non arch student as well. The first class the professors accent may seem intimidating, but it is actually easy to understand. Also, i don't think it's necessary to take this credit\/d, the assessments were not too difficult.",
    "It's a decent survey course. Not knowing much about architecture, I definitely learned a ton. I think that sometimes the class is a bit painful, but discussion sections (if you can get Saga, take her!!) were helpful to dig a little deeper and talk about stuff that we're interested in. I definitely learned how to write architectural writing, which will be helpful later on, and gained a good understanding of what architecture can and cannot do.",
    "Yes - even if you're not architecture",
    "If you're in the major, you'll be taking the class. It's interesting stuff, but nonmajors may be a little surprised that a course about Modern Architecture only gets into white boxes and flat roofs towards the end of the course.",
    "A great survey course that doesn't sacrifice depth.",
    "Definitely recommend if you would like to learn something about Western architecture from this time period. It is almost entirely Western architecture, which is a bummer, but Pelkonen is a great lecturer and succeeds in covering a huge range of buildings and movements.",
    "yes, but know that the midterm involves being able to list the name date place and architect of a bunch of photos of buildings. but the material itself is very engaging and i often felt like i was attending an interesting conference, not a lecture."
