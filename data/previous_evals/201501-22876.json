    "I would most certainly not recommend this class and I wish someone had warned me a way from it. Had it not been a credit I needed I probably would have dropped it. Also the amount of work was just completely unwarranted. It's like Professor Chanda did not understand we have other classes to do work for. And she changed the syllabus (which was already VERY confusing) way too frequently and without notice.",
    "I think that this class is a vital one and should be taken by everyone especially those in the WGSS because it allows you to leave your bubble and learn about another culture while reminding us that gender issues are sometimes universal rather than simply culture specific."
