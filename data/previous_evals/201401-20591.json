   "comments": [
    "An interesting course filled with relevant readings. I really loved that this course felt like a literature course. A good deal of work though so prepare your schedule accordingly.",
    "I would recommend the course. It's very similar to F130, just with a greater emphasis on reading.",
    "It's like L3 except with more boring stories until Un Sac de Billes at the end of the semester. The grammar exercises in the course packet aren't organized as much as they were in L1, L2, or L3 (there didn't seem to be a logical progression to the lessons), but they're mostly review besides the faire causitif. It has about the same amount of work as L3, but a lot of it is clumped together toward the beginning and middle of the semester. Near the end when we were reading Un Sac de Billes, the amount of work per night dropped considerably. It's still a great class - the French department is one of the best at Yale - and is definitely worth taking. The amount of learning done slows down considerably though (compared to L1, L2, L3), either because we learned so much already or because this class doesn't introduce that much new material.",
    "Yes I would. It's a lot to do but very enlightening.",
    "Yes. I started off with L1 French, and while I always found the workload intensive, it was not until L4 that I had to think more critically while doing my French work. This is definitely the peak of my French learning at Yale--I just wish the exams weren't so painful (they are a lot harder than L3's, and this time around, our professor gave no partial credit! Yikes!). However, stick through with it and you'll tap into your innate passion for French and learning the language to its fullest.",
    "This class helps one to advance in french and is not much different from 130. I would recommend it as a class if one is interested in quickly learning french, because it moves at a fast pace."
