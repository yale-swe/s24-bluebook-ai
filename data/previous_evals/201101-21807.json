    "This is a great class that gives you a much fuller understanding of race in the United States. The reading is often very interesting, but can be a little much--you rarely have time to discuss all of it in section. Holloway is a terrific and charismatic lecturer. Be aware that it will be on Open Yale soon--so if you don't like writing papers or doing tests, you can get much of the benefit of the course that way.",
    "This is one of those classes that everyone should take. It's worth the reading. Professor Holloway is great and really engaged.",
    "A very good class. Not a gut by any means, but if you do the reading you'll do well. The writing requirements are extremely easy and fun.",
    "It's decent for a writing credit.",
    "This is a good WR credit and, if you're not a history person, a good lone history course to take at Yale. The material is so relevant compared to other history courses and the WR version is probably less stressful than the regular version since you don't have to take the midterm and final. Prof. Holloway isn't the most approachable person in the world, but it doesn't matter since all the interaction is with your TA anyway.",
    "YESYESYES: any student with an interest in American history will find this class fascinating. It might be a lot of readings, but the way this class is set up doesn't necessarily force you to do all the readings to get a good grade. Still do them, though: some of the things we talked about during section (reproductive rights, citizenship, racism in America) were fascinating.",
    "I thought this was a pretty good survey of African-American history from emancipation to the present. Certainly the broad themes relevant to the subject matter were covered very well, and Professor Holloway was a compelling lecturer. However, I was disappointed by the preponderance of primary sources in the readings. Some of them were very valuable (Uncle Tom's Cabin, Letter from a Birmingham Jail, and The Autobiography of Malcolm X come to mind), but many others were forgettable. More importantly, most weeks the only secondary source we had was Professor Holloway's lecture, and as a result I felt that my overall understanding of what happened to black America during this period changed very little. Also, I took the class without the WR credit, and the workload was fairly light. The WR syllabus is different and I think a little more work-intensive.",
    "Professor Holloway is an amazing and captivating lecturer and puts a spin on this history that is fresh and insightful. The class helps us all deal with what it means to be a citizen of the US and helps uncover our own cultural assumptions about blackness and African American history. The course covers this expansive history in depth, and gets at the root of what causes the racial tension in this country.",
    "AFAM History was a very good writing credit in the sense it is only a 3-page, 5-page and 12-page paper with no midterm or final. The class is also very interesting and you learn about our society today while going through the past. I would definitely recommend this class, but I would say taking it writing intensive gives you less incentive to go to class, but really go because the lectures are awesome.",
    "It's a pretty good class. I recommend you take it. It for sure gives you a better understanding of life in America. It shows why some problems that you may not even be aware of exist, and how you can help fix them.",
    "This class was an overview of the themes in African American history. It is more an American Studies class than a History class - the class considers novels and art along with historical works.",
    "good intro class to take. Definitely take it if you feel like you don't know as much as you'd like about race and history.",
    "Solid, typical Yale course. Not a bad WR.",
    "This class is my favorite class that I've taken at Yale. Professor Holloway is a magnificent lecturer, the sections are well run and the reading is fun and tied into the class topics well. Take this class! But take it as a writing credit, so you can skip the midterm and final and only write slightly more than the non-writing credit people.",
    "a great WR class that you learn a lot of very applicable things",
    "History of overcoming oppression since the end of the Civil War. This course is a journey and a story of increasing hope. I would recommend this class because it is very important history and it is very well tought.",
    "Good course. Holloway is great, and my TA Khalil was too. Although, the writing assignments aren't really typical of a traditional history course...the art analysis final paper especially was not really in keeping with the rest of the structure of the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. One of my favorite courses at yale",
    "This is one of those classes that you really should take whilst at Yale. The material, of course, is incredibly important for any citizen to be understand and has a huge impact on our lives today, but if that alone doesn't convince you, then the presence of Professor Holloway should. His lectures are incredible (he is second only to Nemerov on campus), and one actually nearly brought me to tears. He is incredibly knowledgeable and eloquent, whilst also being very approachable. This is also a more interesting way to get a WR credit, as the topics covered are fascinating, and it only requires fewer than 20 pages of writing all semester, although the paper topics are a bit frustrating at times. But seriously, take this class.",
    "Take it! If you don't know much about AFAM History, it is more than worthwhile. If you already know a lot, it still exposes you to details that often go unnoticed.",
    "overview of history from emancipation to present. it got a little hasty and unclear about the present, but was useful and enlightening overall",
    "I truly believe every student at Yale should take this class. If you want to gain a much deeper and nuanced understanding of American history and what it means to be American, take this class. You simply cannot understand American society without understanding the experience and history of African Americans in this country. The material of this class will change the way you view the United States and make you appreciate how our country has come to the point it is at today.If you took an American History class in high school, you will know about 10% of the material of this class. The class is a much more nuanced look into African American history and challenges the romanticized views of leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X.Jonathan Holloway is the best professor I've ever had at Yale. You will never be bored in lecture and will always come up feeling as if you truly learned something. I would recommend taking this course as a WR.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in AFAM history and don't mind boring lectures. It did increase my knowledge base, although if there is a more interesting class and your debating between this one and the other take the other one. I think the greatest benefit to me for this class were the readings, so if anything just take it for that, because you can do without the lecture. DEFINITELY take writing section because it's only 3 papers and is definitely less work because lecture isn't really important if your in a writing section.",
    "Holloway is cool. Pretty interesting. Not knock-your-socks-off ( even though his first few lectures are really amazing). low-key a lot of reading.",
    "Definitely take the writing section. No brainer.",
    "AFAM is a decent writing credit. The readings are very interesting and the material is important. But it's not one of those classes you'll remember forever. Just a decent class.",
    "I think this is a good introductory course. However, if you are already pretty familiar with African American History, then sometimes the lectures get boring. Also, although I have heard varying responses from my classmates on Professor Holloway's lecture style, I personally did not prefer it. Take either the writing section or the regular section, both have their advantages and disadvantages.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The material is relevant and Holloway is a great lecturer",
    "This is an important class, take it regardless of your major.",
    "If you're looking for a well-taught, thought-provoking, broad review of African-American history, this is your curse. Holloway is an excellent lecturer; he's straightforward and a pleasure to listen to. The readings are often fictional, but they help illustrate interesting themes from the history. Highly recommended.",
    "Summary: You think black people will get rights, but then they don't. rinse and repeat. race is important. talking about race is also importnat.Take it for a kind of fluffy history lecture with a good prof and not much work.",
    "Great class, professor is amazing, must take this class is you're are interested at all in black history.",
    "A really good class - not too much work, but very interesting. An important part of American history that's often ignored.",
    "Yup, take it! Consensus seems to be that it's a rather bearable course. The WR requirement, in particular, is not terribly arduous. And - you'll learn a lot about vitally important history!",
    "Yes definitely take it, not a lot of work, with the WR credit option you only write 3 papers which are totally manageable.",
    "AFAM 162 provides a comprehensive look at black America for the past 150 years. The more recent material is especially relevant, engaging - and for me, more interesting because I hadn't heard it before.I would recommend the course - lectures can sometimes be a bit slow, but in general they are interesting (although not everyone feels compelled to attend, especially those in writing sections) and so are the readings. Cane by Jean Toomer was a really good read.",
    "I would summarize AFAM 162 as an adventure into the social, political, and economic transitions that African Americans experienced throughout their existence in the US.Yes, I would recommendthis class to another student because it was incredibly interesting.",
    "Too much reading, but however much you do it'll be interesting. Holloway's a good lecturer.",
    "It was an overview of afam history. It is definitely worth it to take the writing section - enjoy the readings and discuss them, then write like 3 papers.",
    "Definitely take it. An eye-opening history course.",
    "Make sure to take this course if you are looking for an introduction into the African American experience. It is as hard as you make it. Prof. Holloway and the TA's are not trying to fail you. This is a must take before leaving Yale.",
    "Great course. It opened my eyes to a part of US history that I knew very little about. I would definitely recommend this class when it's offered again.",
    "This is a great introduction to African American history since Emancipation. Because of how long the period is and how complex the history is, the course is necessarily an overview, which could be frustrating if you have already studied this material in any depth. Otherwise, I would absolutely recommend the course to people who aren't entirely familiar with this history, as it is really essential to know about. It focuses mainly on how notions of citizenship and equality were at the core of all these debates and struggles, meaning that it also is an excellent general history of the US during this period. Holloway does a good job of including the different lenses of race, gender and class to complicate the narrative. The readings assigned are really good and complement the lectures well.",
    "Take it, no question.",
    "Good class. Take it.",
    "Great lecture, great readings, important material. But the other Afam history course, 1500-1888 gets ignored and is a great course as well.",
    "Introduction to AfAm History. Don't take it if you've already taken a lots of courses on the subject, it will be redundant.",
    "overrated",
    "Yes -- a great history of identity and the African-American",
    "YES!",
    "Good class, fun lectures and good material. A lot of reading which forces you to skim some of it, but a gem to take as a writing credit.",
    "it's alright",
    "take it",
    "This course is awesome! It has incredible real-life applications and Professor Holloway really is the man. He is humorous, understanding, and cares deeply for the subject he teaches. You need to take this course before graduating from Yale.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Take it if you are at all interested in the subject and do not miss Holloway's lectures.",
    "It is a great course. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yeah ultimately I would because I think it's such interesting material. It's definitely a survey of the course of Af-Am history since the Civil War though so if you dont like survey courses steer clear. But we got to hit a bunch of different periods so that was cool. Don't take it for Holloway though that's for sure. He's nothing special. Also take it as a writing credit!!! I can't emphasize this enough actually. I had a roomate who didn't and he was burdened by work the whole time. Taking it as a writing credit makes it a breeze if youre cool with writing papers",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. There is a fair amount of reading, but the lectures are terrific and you get a great survey of post-emancipation African American History.",
    "YES.",
    "Absolutely, the material is very interesting and its a great way to get a writing credit.",
    "It was an overview of the history of blacks in America, and the many methods they used to overcome the racism of our society. I would recommend it for anyone interested in American history since it is such a crucial aspect of it.",
    "HIST 187 was a solid survey of African American history from Emancipation to present, but it was not as original, deep, or ground-breaking as I expected it to be. Professor Holloway was a great lecturer, but he did not meet the mind-blowing level set by his reputation. (Not all of his lectures are as good as the hyper-prepared speech he gives during the first shopping lecture.)The course does an excellent job of combining chronological and thematic approaches to history - the themes of home, belonging, citizenship, freedom, equality, oppression, struggle, unity, and conflict give the course a coherence throughout all of the units. And the reading list is a really interesting collection of diverse genres. However, I found a lot of the material repetitive, especially if one's taken many U.S. history courses on the same era.Overall, I definitely recommend the course, but don't set your expectations too high. I also did the regular section (weekly responses, 1-essay midterm exam, 8-page final paper, 10-ID final exam) and would not hesitate to recommend that if one has other paper-heavy classes.",
    "I would definitely take it if you are interested in American history or in African American studies. It's an amazing lecture that is almost always gripping."
