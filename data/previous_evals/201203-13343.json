    "On the last day of class, Andy said, \"Thank you for taking a chance on me. I know that when you came to Yale, people didn't say, 'You have to take Horowitz!'\" Well, I'm here to say: YOU HAVE TO TAKE HOROWITZ, especially if he's teaching Disasters. Andy is amazing. Andy is funny, and smart, and probably the most passionate person I've ever met. He's also great at conveying that passion; Andy told us at the beginning of the year that he'd won a teaching prize, and it was well-deserved. Andy pours his heart and soul into class, and really cares about his students and the material. Andy did oral history interviews in New Orleans after Katrina; for him, disasters are more than just something that you read about. He's an expert in the field, and yet always treats you like what you're saying is meaningful and important. Best of all, he's young and enthusiastic and combines the genius of older professors with the ability to do things like, say, use a Mac.The class itself is one of my favorites of all time. The class material was diverse: we talked about firenadoes and the crisis of modernity and the American consciousness and even spent twenty minutes one day discussing the phrase \"shit got real.\" It's well-organized, and the books themselves are all books you'd want to read anyway, and since Andy went to Yale, he knows what's an acceptable level of reading, and scales it back when major things are due for the paper. Writing the paper was relatively easy due to the mini-assignments that were due along the way. This is a good seminar to get used to writing long papers. Other than the 20-25 page paper, your grade is based on one low-key presentation and posting a weekly discussion question. However, I'd probably recommend the class primarily to juniors and seniors, since that's who made up our class, and it was excellent. My classmates' perspective was fabulous. From this class, I learned so much and honestly feel like a different person now. I know I'm a better historian, and maybe a better citizen too. If you are even mildly interested in the life you're living, take this class.",
    "Take it.",
    "Take it. I've never taken a history seminar before and was honestly nervous for all the reading and researching, and found it to be one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.Why? Amazing syllabus if you're at all interested in disasters, America today, or anything in between. Genuine and great teacher and discussion leader in Andy. However contritely, it's changed the way I watch the news and think about disasters and America.",
    "This is a fabulous course covering rarely studied but highly relevant material taught by an inspiring instructor. I can't recommend it highly enough. I was inspired to achieve more than I ever thought I could.",
    "Disasters in America is a comprehensive study of American natural disasters and catastrophes, from America's founding through the twenty-first century and Hurricane Katrina. The course also enables students to conduct term-long research and consult regularly with a Yale expert of this American history subfield, Professor Horowitz. I would absolutely recommend the course to another student; in addition to offering a fresh slant on American history, natural disasters are a compelling topic for all students interested in our country's current debates on global warming, economic management, FEMA, and many other pressing national concerns.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Although the topic might seem a little odd, it's fascinating and very relevant. The course is both historic and topical, with disasters occurring all the time. More than just that, it forces even the most confident American history student to rethink what they know about disasters and their role in US history--which is wonderful! Professor Horowitz is also amazing and makes class exciting and interesting. I always looked forward to going to class and doing the readings (and in fact, the whole class was upset when class was canceled for , ironically, a hurricane).",
    "I would absolutely recommend disasters. The topic is timely, fascinating, and generally under-studied by students of history (and others--not all of us were history majors). Andy was also a wonderful teacher, and I would recommend taking anything he offers; he combined an excellent ability to draw out big historical themes from our class discussions with a friendly and easygoing nature that made seminar a pleasure to attend.",
    "Hands down, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you get the chance to take this course, DO IT.",
    "This is by far my favorite class. Not only does the course cover the history of American disaster policy and how generations of Americans have treated disasters, but it really shows how history is directly applicable to current issues. Never have I been in a class where every individual was so engaged in the discussion. Andy is a great teacher and was particularly helpful in the paper writing process. I looked forward to this class every week, and I'm honestly going to miss it."
