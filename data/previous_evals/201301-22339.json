   "comments": [
    "Advanced Playwriting is exactly what it sounds like- a rigorous study and workshop in playwriting. I would HIGHLY recommend this class to students interested in writing or the theater in general.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is exciting, challenging, and rewarding. Discussions are engaging, the reading material is mostly excellent and informative, and you will be pushed to producean entire full-length play.",
    "Yes--if you're interested in playwriting, take this class.",
    "Whether you're hoping to be a playwright or a novelist, an essayist or an orator, a playwriting class with Donald Margulies will help you to improve your craft because of the emphasis Prof. Margulies places on economy and dramatic structure. You will learn how to hold \"raise the stakes\" within your work in order to impel your audience (or readers) further into your story. You learn how to create images from words, conversation from dialogue. You'll learn a lot, and even more if you make use of Prof. Margulies' office hours. This is course is a great opportunity, don't pass it up.",
    "Unsurprisingly, the success or failure of this class depends tremendously on the other students enrolled. As far as possible, check (ahead of time) who you will be studying with, and who you will have critiquing your work for the semester.As in Margulies's Intro class, the \"read plays, then implement strategies\" format is really enjoyable and constructive. I enjoyed the fact that in Advanced (versus Intro), Professor Margulies gave students a little more room to play with styles or tropes that are far from his own structuralist preferences. Spending half the class on Donald's own early career felt slightly gratuitous - thought the plays are genuinely great! Maybe this could be condensed into 3 weeks instead of 5?Ultimately, if you plan to be a playwright at Yale, not studying with Margulies would be a little crazy."
