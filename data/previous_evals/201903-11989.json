    "I thought the works we read were really cool and different from other English courses I have taken. But, some of the novels were super long.",
    "The reading list for the course was phenomenal. By nature of the genre, the readings were dark and often times depressing, but I thoroughly enjoyed all of the novels and films. The discussion was a bit frustrating at times. I think the early meeting time lowered people's engagement. I found that we didn't tend to discuss what I found to be most interesting or pertinent in any of the novels.",
    "Way too many texts\/books for this course - we could not cover all material in class and it was frustrating to read so many things with no follow up or discussion (made it feel a little pointless). However, the texts themselves were very interesting and were well suited to the class. Discussion was slow and dry, possibly because it was at 9:25, but often no one would speak and Professor Berger would just go on and on.",
    "This class is relatively interesting as long as you engage with the material in some way. Otherwise, you will have to sit through a long lecture. The material and discussions can be quite insightful so long as you chose to engage.",
    "The reading and writing requirements were manageable. Occasionally the in class discussion felt a bit forced."

    "I would recommend this course to English majors looking for a junior seminar! It's a great topic to analyze!",
    "I probably wouldn't. As an English major, I do not feel like I gained skills in writing or reading comprehension that will help me in further studies of English. I read a lot of books for this class, but I do not feel like I grew as an English student. This class might be fun for someone that really enjoys the genre, but it's a hefty workload if that's the reason behind taking it.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course. It is rather boring and you will most likely not get much out of it - I love science fiction and apocalyptic works, but even that didn't help me engage.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who can last the hour and fifty and are interested in this subject. It is a cool class",
    "I would recommend this course to any students interested in apocalyptic novels."
