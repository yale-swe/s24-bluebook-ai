    "Only if you are willing to put in a great deal of time to reading these texts closely, again and again and again. Otherwise, you will not take much away from it.",
    "Yes. This was a very challenging course that I want to praise for its merits - of which it had many - and acknowledge for its faults, although there were few of those. It's a class on Aristotle and the semester I took it many graduate students were enrolled. We discussed De Anima, Nicomachean Ethics, and the Politics intently and faced unique challenges in all three texts. It felt like a trip to another planet. The scientific accuracy of the philosopher's use of language combined with an unfamiliar co-option and reordering of synonyms is dense experience. But you feel happy to know his voice when it's over. Plus, the philosophy: foundational.",
    "No.",
    "This course is a careful reading in translation of Aristotle's De Anima, Nichomachean Ethics, and Politics. Discussion in seminar is open, and Prof. Garsten asks very demanding questions about Aristotle's thinking. This term, Prof. Garsten assigned four four-page papers instead of a term paper, which made the course manageable and which I felt was more productive in some ways. Aristotle thinks hard and argues convincingly about a variety of issues, and I recommend this course for anyone interested in problems of who is included in a society, of the relationship between metaphysics and politics, or of what people ought to do with their lives."
