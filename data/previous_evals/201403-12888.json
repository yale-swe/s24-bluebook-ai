   "comments": [
    "Italian 110 is a wonderful course. If you are looking for an easy language to learn, this one is it. It can be very similar to Spanish, which makes it easier to learn if you already have Spanish under your belt. The professors make the class enjoyable and encourage students to learn about foreign culture.",
    "It's amazing! And I would reserve recommendations because if I recommend level one, I would have to recommend levels one through three, and I've only taken a single semester.",
    "You learn basic Italian. At the beginning, the class can be pretty killer, because it's very much a sink-or-swim kind of thing, and a lot of your fellow students may have already taken the language in high school (something that will happen in all of your language classes). However once the semester really gets rolling you'll end up getting a grasp of everything and it'll be fine. At the beginning of the semester I was afraid that I was going to end up with a C in the course so I got a tutor through the language department (something that is really easy to do and can be extremely helpful), and by the end of the course I had an A- and am pretty comfortable holding basic conversation. I strongly recommend this course.",
    "Yes Italian is a great language.",
    "Italian was a very interactive class that teaches a lot in a very short time. If you are interested in actually learning the language and are willing to put in the work that it takes I would recommend this course for you.",
    "Great class! You should definitely take this, especially if you like languages. Italian is a fantastic language that is not too difficult to pick up, especially if you've previously learned Spanish or French. A lot of busy work but exams are very fair and cover only what you've studied. Instructors inform you what to study and often provide review guides."
