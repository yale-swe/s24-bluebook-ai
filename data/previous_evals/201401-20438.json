   "comments": [
    "It's a cool course, but it's sneaky hard! Theres a midterm, a final (not cumulative), a practical exam, and a final paper (only 5 pages or so). Theres also a lab once a week where you go in and look at hominid specimens. If you take this class, you need to understand that it's NOT a gut, and that you need to study really hard for all 3 exams. The material is so interesting, but there is a lot of memorization involved as well as an understanding of deeper concepts. Its hard!",
    "Take the class for the section, not the lecture itself.",
    "I'd recommend it! Lectures mainly consist of Professor Hill's stories (including more-than-occasional snarkiness) and for that reason alone are a joy. This is a chance to take a class from someone who knows everyone and everything and is a real leader in the field. The workload is not too bad -- two non-cumulative exams, a lab practical, and a 5-page paper.",
    "Definitely worth it for people in the anthro major with a biological focus. Andrew is great because he played a role in a number of the discoveries so you get some good stories. Good overview of human evolution with a good amount of detail for each species",
    "Dry lectures, but pretty interesting material and very easy tests. Take if at all interested in where we came from!",
    "This class is great! I learned so much! The lab bit is especially fun.",
    "Anth 267 is an interesting course. Professor Hill is great and so is the TF Jessamy. Although the exams required a fair sharing of studying, the material is interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload isn't heavy and that allows you to enjoy the class and the material. Professor Hill is great!",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject matter or in biological and evolutionary anthropology in general. The class is a bit too disorganized to recommend it as a 5th class if you only have a passing interest. The workload was very low throughout most of the semester but then we had two tests and a paper due in the last week of class (they were vague about assignment dates for most of the semester so be prepared for this). The lab sections are quite interesting.",
    "Very interesting and deep course covering the full spread of human evolution. The one downside would be a perhaps excessive focus on minute detail never covered in the essays or exams."
