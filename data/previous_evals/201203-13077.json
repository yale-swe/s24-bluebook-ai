    "Teaches you to think visually and helps you identify the most natural mistakes you make in your own design. I have no expectations of taking more art classes at Yale or making art a major part of my career, but the things you learn here WILL be of use to you, whether you're designing flyers for your club, making a powerpoint to impress your boss at an internship, or just sounding clever in modern art museums. If you put work into the class, you'll get a lot out.",
    "Enjoyable class. I took it because I thought I might want to be a graphic designer; now I'm not so sure, but I don't think the time was wasted. Basic principles of design are so much more important and prevalent than you might imagine, and it behooves you to understand and implement them. This class will teach you the basics, and Yeju is both approachable and an honest critic, a difficult balance (but a good one for intro classes).",
    "I would recommend this to any student who wants to think critically about design. We spend a lot of time discussing effective visual communication in the context of our projects, flyers, movies, readings. The final book project was really rewarding. Don't take it if your only goal is computer design fluency; there's a lot of cut and paste, which is what I wanted.",
    "How do people experience art, and how do you make them experience it the way you want? This class has the answer!",
    "Shop the class--get to know the professor and TA--then make your decision.",
    "If you want hands on experience with graphic design, take it! Definitely requires work if you want to do well."
