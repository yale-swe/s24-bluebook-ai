    "I would recommend this class unreservedly. A must-take class for anyone with any interest in modern Japanese history or even Asian history in general.",
    "I would recommend it for people interested in japan definitely. For non japan specialists, it will be useful for those thinking about issues of modernity. Japan's experience provides an interesting comparison to the rest of the world.",
    "Would recommend this seminar to any student interested in East Asian history.",
    "For someone with absolutely no background knowledge of modern Japanese history and the associated literature.Good introductory graduate course not only to the field but also to the framework, techniques, perspectives and problems of historiography (the writing of history).I would recommend this to someone who has any semblance of interest in modern Japanese history and is prepared to do heavy reading (1 text per week that ranges anywhere from 200-500pages) consistently."

   "comments": [
    "This class really does a fantastic job of laying out the broad field of scholarship on modern Japan while presenting in depth an exemplary collection of though-provoking works. I walked into the class knowing very little, but I feel like a walk out with a good sense of the history and historiography of 20th century Japan and with the tools I need to go on and navigate the field on my own, knowing which books to look at and how to deal with them.",
    "Japan is an important influence on the region during the time period iwork on so, this is a good start for me to learn more about a state that might not be in my dissertation directly but expands my teaching options.",
    "Very helpful in developing a balanced view on the history and historiography of modern Japan and modern East Asia."
