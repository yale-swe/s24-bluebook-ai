   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who can sing at Yale. It is wonderful. Learning the music can be a bit of work, but in the end it is worth it. It will introduce you to an entire different way of singing. It is great! Take it!",
    "Yes, this is a really fun class for those interested in a choral ensemble. We take on really challenging and interesting music but the environment is really laid back so if you are nervous about your ability, don't be. The professor is so kind and fun, the commitment is pretty minimal as music ensembles on campus go, and the reward is great.",
    "TAKE IT. It is a fun, easy, great class and it covers good material and gives you valuable performance experience. The professor is awesome.",
    "YESSSSSSS. TAKE IT.",
    "Take this class if you like or like the prospect of performing early music!!! Professor Malafronte is great to work with, and you are exposed to some really unique music and manuscripts in Beinecke. Most of class is rehearsal for the concert; outside of class you do readings. After the concert I felt like I had participated in something really special; I got to work with lots of awesome musicians, including fellow classmates and professors who play tons of renaissance instruments.",
    "This class is a lot of fun, and it exposes you to a style of music you have probably never sung before. If you have a vague interest in early music, and read music, I would highly recommend this class!",
    "Take it if you want to learn new music and sing in class",
    "\"Performance of Early Music\" is a fun and relaxed way to be part of a choral ensemble and do some solo work. The class performs 1-2 concerts each term (as the \"Yale Collegium Musicum). Concerts are a mix of full-class choral pieces, small group duets, trios, or quartets, and student solo work (everyone gets a solo). Prof. Malafronte is a knowledgeable and helpful director; it's fun to to sing with her. Find time take this class during your time at Yale if you enjoyclassical vocal performance."
