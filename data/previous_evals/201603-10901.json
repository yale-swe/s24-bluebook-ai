   "comments": [
    "I learned more about identifying rocks in the field, reading and creating geological maps, and imagining deep Earth history.",
    "I learned how to identify rocks and geologic processes out in the field and developed specialized knowledge about current research on the East Antarctic ice sheet through my final research paper.",
    "This was a good companion course to G&G 110, as intended. I learned the practical skills associated with basic geology, primarily identification of rocks and minerals. Philosophically, this course was an excellent way to become attuned to the geology surrounding everyone in everyday life.",
    "I found this lab incredibly useful to help apply rock identification priciples. I also benefited from learning more about topografical maps, and how to make them and how to interpret layering",
    "I improved my geology observation skills. The field trips and lab activities definitely improved my rock identification skills and taught me how to look for features that can be telling of the geologic history.",
    "I learned some good basic skills for geology: how to work with maps, basics of rock identification and formations. Field trips were a great opportunity to test out skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Rye, field trips, manageable schedule and assignments Weaknesses: Friday afternoon time slot, redundant lab assignments or repetition of same skills in one assignment",
    "This course is a gear lab. The field trips were often the highlight of my week and the trip over October break was an exciting adventure through the geologic history of the North-East. I would have been glad to go on even more field trips or potentially a tour of some of the research happening in the geology department, but overall a great course.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it is designed to not take up one and a half credits worth of work while only being worth half a credit. This course remains very interesting and eye-opening without requiring copious amounts of work. Another strength is the passion of the staff and the teaching assistants who are extremely helpful in providing aid.",
    "The course's strength lies in its interactive nature. We were constantly examining rocks and minerals both in the lab and in the field. The regular, repetitive practice was a good way to get students thinking like geologists and allowed us to get past the initial unfamiliarity and insecurity in examining specimens. By the end, I was significantly more comfortable being given an unknown sample and looking out for important factors in identification and applying that knowledge in order to reconstruct the geological history of the area. The October recess field trip was excellent on several fronts. Great food, great weather, great company. Most important, having a few days devoted to geology all day, every day allowed us to get huge amounts of practice and very in-depth exposure to the geology of the region. I wish the course covered a bit more content; for example, I wish there were more structural geology or use of principles such as strike and dip and taking those measurements in the field. I am not sure if this is covered in a separate lab course, but if not, it should definitely be included in this course. I also wish there were more introduction or guidance into the final paper, which I was aware of from previous course evaluations and the syllabus, but nonetheless somewhat unprepared for.",
    "I really enjoyed the field trips and getting to examine rocks first hand and get feedback on the observations because that made it easier on the self done labs to think critically. Overall I think I would have prefered more discussion over more power point slides, but I think it was a well taught class.",
    "Overall, I felt like the lab was interesting and worthwhile. One thing that I thought could change was the timing of the lab meetings. We met on Fridays, and for the first half of the semester we met more or less every other week, but towards the end we met about every week. The relaxed pace worked really well for me!! I felt like this class filled but didn't exceed a half credit of work. But I felt like it would have worked better if we met a bit more frequently in the front half of the semester instead of the second half.",
    "One strength of this course was its flexibility. It was doable. The best part of the course, hands down, was the field trip over October break. That really helped me to be more confident with the skills I was supposed to be learning. Other local field trips were also a highlight. The portion of the lab that took place on campus was drier and harder to get through. I was less engaged than I should have been on the days we stayed on campus for lab. I also don't feel like I learned a lot from each individual lab, but came away from the whole semester feeling a little more accomplished."

    "This is a really fun and relaxed lab course. You learn some interesting things about rocks and local Connecticut geology-- take it with the lecture!",
    "Take this lab! Take it even if you took the intro seminar the previous spring. Professor Evens and Rye are both extremely knowledgeable geologists and a third of the benefit of this lab is the ability to talk to them about geology and their wild research adventures. Another third of the fun of G&G 111 are the field trips, especially the field trip over October break. The final third is the only significant workload for that class and this is the final research paper. I personally enjoyed this a lot because you gain a great deal of cutting edge knowledge about a particular topic.",
    "Yes, this course is an excellent, low-key companion to the excellent G&G 110. It improves the understanding of concepts learned in class immensely and is very much worth the small amount of time it takes up.",
    "This lab was incredibly worthwhile and I would do it again in a heartbeat! It was a great way to spend a few hours friday afternoons and the field trips were spectacular! I may or may not take the corresponding class, however.",
    "Yes! A fun, informative class that teaches practical skills to geologists.",
    "I would recommend the lab portion of the class to students interested in geology, natural sciences, or jsut curious about learning more. The time and the effort are likely not worth it if you are just taking the class for a science credit, except for the field trips."
