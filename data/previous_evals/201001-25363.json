   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course. It is very free-form and sometimes confusing, but was very rewarding by the end of the semester. It was wonderful to have a class that involved movement and the exploration of the world through body as well as mind.",
    "I preferred the Advanced Dance Repertory Class because I felt that the videos and class work combined better with the final showing.",
    "As someone who has danced practically my entire life, I must say that this class has changed the way I look at dance and choreography. While the course will not necessarily solve all of your choreographic questions when working on pieces for student groups, it is definitely a new and interesting take on process, and it will come in handy for future work. As a dancer or as someone who cares about dance, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Definitely take this class, it will teach you how to think about all types of creative endevores in a different way and it will change how you approach your personal artistic medium."
