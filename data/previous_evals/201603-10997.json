   "comments": [
    "This is truly the best class I have ever taken at Yale and I highly recommend it. The coursework is immensely interesting, and it really changes the way you see the world.",
    "I developed a much more complete understanding of the history of science fiction and the ways in which our conceptions of the future shape the future when it does arrive. I particularly appreciated the analysis of literature along with secondary sources, which helped me draw parallels between the goals and effects of both fiction writing and academic writing. This class also helped me refine my writing skills, and helped me learn to draw connections between course material, current events, and wider themes in science and the history of science.",
    "Read various extremely interesting books and pdfs, had wonderfully engaging in class discussions. Learned to be a better speaker and writer. Amazing class, amazing professor.",
    "I learned how to ask really, really important questions about what kinds of knowledge get prioritized in the worlds of science and medicine.",
    "This course provided nontraditional approaches to the analysis of science fiction and how it affects, mirrors, and can enhance the understanding of real events and technologies. It is incredibly eye-opening and especially significant for highlighting the importance of engaging with these topics in diverse ways.",
    "This course allowed me to consider the modern implications of historical representations of biomedical futures through a different and refreshing lens. The selected course readings were enjoyable, which made weekly discussion that much more exciting and engaging. I now have greater appreciation for the science-fiction genre and feel inspired to continue to investigations on the topic in the future."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was very well done and I would not change anything.",
    "The strengths of this course include the small seminar style, and the literature. However, I often felt that some of the secondary readings were superfluous and repetitive, especially since they were rarely discussed in depth. In addition, while I enjoyed the emphasis on larger themes in the course, there were several weeks where I would have liked to discuss the literature or secondary sources a little more directly. It sometimes felt as though we could have had many of the discussions without having done most of the reading.",
    "Great books, lots of work, great professor and class.",
    "This class was one of my favorites. The obvious strength is Professor Radin- I am forever in awe of what an open, creative thinker she is. I really appreciated the more free structure of the class (at least compared to the STEM classes that I'm used to). I loved that we were able to do practically anything for our weekly reading responses because that allowed me to explore a subject in deeper ways. I thought our weekly discussions were immensely thought provoking. When I left class, I was often unable to stop thinking about what we had talked in class. The only criticism I can think of is that there were quite a lot of readings, but even this isn't really a real criticism because I thought all the readings were insightful, and they were so interesting that I wanted to do all of the readings. Although this was sometimes a challenge, I loved that (for most weeks) we read a book a week.",
    "Strengths: very self-guided. You get as much out of the course as you want, so there is great potential for personal growth. Additionally, the readings are all pretty decent and the volume of them is not incredibly demanding. Weaknesses: none inherent with the course and its structure",
    "It is difficult to think of weaknesses for this course! It might have been useful to extend the Monday @ midnight deadline to submit reading responses to Tuesday @ 8am (although I know Professor Radin needed time to review and comment on all responses before 1:30pm class). Additionally, days when multiple assignments were due could be stressful for the crammers of the world (e.g. reading response + annotated bibliography), so perhaps one deadline on Sunday, the next on Monday would be helpful. Her weekly comments allowed me not only to improve my writing, but also think more critically and engage with the material on a deeper lever with each passing week. I appreciated the freedom that was provided with respect to the final project, as it granted students opportunity to take what had been discussed in class in any direction of their choosing.",
    "Such a great course!!! Take it if you can. Really interesting material, engaged class, and I felt like I made friends!"

   "comments": [
    "This is truly the best class I have ever taken at Yale and I highly recommend it. The coursework is immensely interesting, and it really changes the way you see the world.",
    "If you enjoy literature and science, this course is definitely for you. The reading load is very high, however, it is definitely manageable. Come prepared to seminar every week, and you'll have a great, interesting, and eye-opening semester!",
    "100% take this class",
    "Wow. It's no exaggeration to say this class changed my life. It was truly a pleasure. We were pushed to ask such important questions, the reading is so much fun (science fiction novels!), and Professor Radin is seriously the kindest, most thoughtful person.",
    "DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE THIS CLASS. I absolutely loved this class! If you're at all interested in science fiction, take it. If you're not interested in science fiction, just know that this class is more of using the lens of science fiction to ask broader questions about science, medicine, technology, and society, rather than writing sci-fi. As a STEM major, I got so much out of this course about the way science impacts a society that I wouldn't have gotten out of my normal STEM classes. Professor Radin is also fantastic- I am constantly in awe of what an open, creative thinker she is. The readings are slightly on the heavier side (a book a week plus ~50 pages of extra readings), but they're all so interesting that you WANT to do all of the readings. There are weekly reading responses (~250 words), but because Professor Radin is so awesome, they can be practically anything, as long as you put in effort. I loved how creative Prof Radin allowed us to be in all of our assignments. This class was hands-down one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. I've been telling all my friends to take this class throughout the entire semester, and now I'm telling you, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale thus far. It's especially if you have a keen interest in science-fiction, or if you want new perspectives on how to make sense of the world around us. The workload is very manageable and Professor Radin does a nice job guiding the weekly conversations. If you are looking for an HSHM seminar, keep this one at the top of your list.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The material and discussions are not only relevant for HSHM\/history majors, but also students in STEM, engineering and the arts. Anyone can benefit from consideration of historical science-fiction from a modern lens.",
    "Class is super super great! Definitely take this if possible. The works we read are extremely interesting and very pertinent to our modern times. It's probably the most important class I've taken, since it explores the hard ethical questions in our modern technological age. These questions may be the only thing standing in between ourselves and inventing our own doom. So yeah, take this class! Save the world?",
    "Yes 100%.",
    "Yes, 100%"
