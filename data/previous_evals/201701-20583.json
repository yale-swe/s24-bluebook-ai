    "How to view a directors body of work from both a close reading and a competitive point of view",
    "Definitely honed skills on evaluating Hitchcock through a primarily psychoanalytic lens.",
    "I learned a great deal about the way in which Hitchcock employed key techniques throughout his career to craft an aesthetic and style of film making that still reverberates today.",
    "I learned about Hitchcock's films and his legacy. I learned how to better appreciate his works and recognize his influence on others.",
    "Increased film analysis skills and familiarity with the Hitchcock cannon",
    "In this course I was able to refine skills in analysis and writing. I learned a lot about Hitchcock's career and influence as well as film technique and criticism more generally.",
    "This class was my first proper film class, and so taught me the fundamentals of writing a film paper and also taught me to recognise different characteristics of films.",
    "This class is an excellent introduction to Hitchcock's wide-ranging and complicated canon.",
    "Close analysis of film, writing",
    "As a non-FILM major, I definitely learned a lot about film analysis and Hitchcock! I'll never watch a film the same way again. I also learned how to write about film, which helped me develop skills in close analysis and scrutinizing details."

   "comments": [
    "Strength is format, with screenings and meetings. Weakness is aimlessness of lecture",
    "Class was too large. Also, the readings weren't focused on. This was nice because it allowed the class to revolve around student discussion but I think for a lot of people the concepts introduced in the readings were new so it would have been helpful to go through them and analyze both Hitchcock's films and how they have been historically viewed - ie through popular culture, psychoanalysis, auteur theory, etc. I know that a lot of people took this class because its a light workload. I totally get that. But a lot of these people did not contribute to discussion so the result was a huge seminar but with only a few people talking a bunch of others just doing other work on their laptops. That's all good for intro to film or something but when it's a seminar that's annoying so I wish Prof. Peucker called them out.",
    "This course is very interesting and provides an opportunity to think about film in a much more analytical way than you might naturally. The discussion-based nature of the course is very effective for learning through the perspectives of others, and the mix of background of studies of the students allows for very different focuses within discussion. Though the class was somewhat lopsided in terms of engagement (of the class of around 30, only around 12 contributed every single class), perhaps due to size, this class was interesting and a nice \"break\" from more concrete studies.",
    "This course's greatest strength is the class discussion of the films. Its greatest weakness is that it was only 13 weeks long.",
    "The films are enjoyable and Professor Peucker is very knowledgeable about Hitchcock.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is the combination of the instructor and the quality of the discussions that take place after the films. The course has no weaknesses to note.",
    "The strengths of this course are its rich content and thought provoking assignments. The major weakness is that due to the number of students in the class, the discussion sometimes could feel scattered.",
    "The only weakness was that it was somewhat oversubscribed.",
    "The class is a fantastic survey of Hitchcock's films -- you'll watch many of his classics and some of his lesser known films and develop a keen sense of his narrative\/cinematic trademarks. Hitchcock is really a minefield for theory of all sorts, so discussions are often very lively, and Peucker is an excellent professor. The course is NOT, however, an in-depth \"film studies\" approach to Hitchcock. More an introduction to the intersections between his films and some of the great critical theorists.",
    "I would've liked to see the readings better integrated into the course. They were assigned, but nobody did them, and we never really discussed them.",
    "I loved this class! I thought the workload was very manageable, the discussions were always very interesting, the readings added to my knowledge of Hitchcock, and of course, the films were fantastic. Sometimes, I found that it would have helped to have some context on other filmmakers of the time, just to fully grasp how ground-breaking Hitchcock truly was, but that is not a criticism of the course or the professor, given that the course is specifically a Hitchcock film course."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the material, the class is not difficult and very rewarding. Basically just watch the movies when you want and write about them in weekly responses and 2 papers",
    "I would definitely recommend this class whether you love Hitchcock, hate him, or are unfamiliar with him. I grew up watching Hitchcock films so loved him in a very earnest, innocent way - ie I loved Psycho and the Birds because they were scary, Family Plot because it was funny, etc.. Getting to view these films that I had loved since a child in an academic setting inevitably changes how you relate to them but I was able to understand his films on a different register. This class does a very good job going deep into the ideology of Hitchcock films - especially in terms of feminism. But goes beyond \"Hitchcock hated women\" to really what ideology is Hitchcock presenting\/critiquing\/etc.. It gave me a newfound respect for him and gave me better tools to critique him.",
    "This is a pretty relaxed course that doesn't ask much of you - short film response each week and a viewing of a film, two relatively straightforward papers. Course is based around class discussion, which for out course was about half of the class. Not difficult, but requires you to think pretty critically about small details in the films - if that's not your thing, you'll probably be pretty frustrated.",
    "Yes! If you're looking for a chill course in which you get to watch some of the best films of all time, discuss them with an expert in the field, and write a couple of interesting papers, take this course!",
    "The Films of Alfred Hitchcock is a great class if you have an interest in film and film history. It says a lot that even with one film screened a week, some of his most notable movies don't make it on the syllabus. It's largely discussion based, led confidently and encouragingly by Professor Peucker. Not every film holds up and there's plenty of room in the class for discussion about Hitchcock's flaws. If you put effort into the class (even just watching the films), you can get a lot out of it. Otherwise, the workload is very light.",
    "If you are interested in the work of Hitchcock you should take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this corse to any student interested in film who will commit time to actually watching the movies. It is also a great fifth class",
    "Not a ton of work, and Peucker is really kind and understanding. Also, Hitchcock movies are really cool to unpack, especially because Hitchcock was a bizarre person.",
    "You should definitely 100% take this class if you like film or Alfred Hitchcock or literary analysis. It's really what you make of it; if you like speaking a lot and reading into things, this is such a nice way to spend two hours on a Tuesday. I left feeling like I had exercised my brain, and learned something about an important cultural contributor.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in learning more about Hitchcock!!",
    "Yes. You get to watch Hitchcock's greatest movies and then discuss them with a really insightful professor. What could be better?",
    "Absolutely take this class! I thought I would be like a fish out of water, given that I'm a STEM major, but Professor Peucker makes this course so enjoyable and accessible. I was hooked every class, the workload was very manageable, and the readings added to the discussion. I had always wanted to take a film class, and I'm so glad that this was the film class that I ended up taking. It was a very chill class, but also extremely enjoyable at the same time! Take it!"
