    "We built a robot that finds and deactivates \"mines\" autonomously in a hallway in under 5 minutes. It was a lot of work, but the project was successful. I would recommend this class, but odds are you have to take it anyway.",
    "Mix of what 348 should have been and koser's 325.",
    "Definitely take it. Its just very different from any other engineering class offered at Yale.",
    "If you have the time and it's not required, take it. It's a good experience. Otherwise you really have no choice.",
    "Gotta take it. Have fun :)",
    "Yes. Perfect end to the engineering career at Yale. Get hands-on with equipment. Sky is the limit in terms of how much you can learn from this course."
