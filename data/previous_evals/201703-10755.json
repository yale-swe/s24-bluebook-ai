   "comments": [
    "I left this course with the ability to interact with texts and find compelling and defensible thesis statements from insights I have derived from the text. This may sound like a simple task that I have acquired, but I assure you it was not. Prof. Bender consistently pushed me and my classmates to look beyond the simple meaning of the text and \"discover\" insights. Also through having conversations with the class I learned many technical terms to describe literature which I was previously unaware of and helped me to better interact with literature with the precise terms to describe the phenomena I was observing.",
    "I gained a much more complete sense of the progression of ideas in Western literature from ancient Greece until the Renaissance, especially regarding the ways in which authors draw on one another's works in the creation of their own. I feel much more confident in my skills as an analytical writer, particularly in terms of structure and use of textual evidence.",
    "I developed new analytical skills to use when reading, and the ability to do more efficient close readings of texts.",
    "Close reading, taking risks in writing papers, and a bit of Greek and Roman history along the way.",
    "I improved my literature writing by a lot and read some awesome texts. The syllabus is really great and I especially improved in how to do a close reading, an important skill for future literature classes. The writing is tough but all students improved.",
    "This class with Prof. Bender is absolutely fantastic. I'm a STEM major and I never was too particularly interested in literature, but I wanted to learn more about the field so I participated in DS, and it paid off because of this class. I gained such a deep appreciation for literature because of Prof. Bender.",
    "I developed the ability to write an essay which reflected a very close reading of a particular excerpt from a text. I also developed the ability to read closely, noticing patterns and details that I would previously have dismissed.",
    "The class not only acted as an introduction to key ancient western texts in literature, but taught close reading, analysis, discussion, and writing skills all useful for a freshman year writing seminar-style class. It encouraged students to track patterns and develop individual ideas, all while teaching key-concepts.",
    "The continuity in ideas and conversations in the Western texts was enthralling to read; Prof Bender also really helped us learn to \"discover\" ideas and patterns in the text, instead of reverse engineering an expected theme."

   "comments": [
    "This class was simply outstanding. It was far and away the best course I took this semester, and I hope that I am able to take other classes of this level during my time at Yale. Bender had the perfect mix of having a lesson plan prepared but letting the class organically come to the topics we were interested in, and always served as someone who allowed people to develop their own ideas and consistently had way more background information about the texts than you would expect from a professor, let alone a scholar of Chinese literature. I think the improvements in the course would be on the lectures. I infrequently went to a lecture where I was moved to a new understanding of the text or given much insight. They sometimes felt like forced attempts to see how clever the presenter was with turns of phrases turned into 50 min diatribes. While I understand that literature requires close reading, and while there were several examples of good lectures, the lectures on the whole were more miss than hit so if I had a magic wand I would change the lecture system. I would also change the works read and amount of time dedicated to them. DS is basically college-level book club and therefore very dependent on the quality of people at the table discussing the works.",
    "This course was very well-organized within the larger DS curriculum, and expectations were always clear. Content matter, writing skills, and seminar discussion strategies were all addressed thoroughly. I wish that we could have spent more class time on each reading assignment, because our discussions often felt rushed, as if we only touched the surface of what could be said about our readings.",
    "I think that the Directed Studies program is structured efficiently and that all of the classes fit together well. I enjoy the lectures as well as the small seminars, and think that they facilitate great conversation between students and professors and allow for many different readings of texts to come together. There is a good balance between professors teaching the students about aspects of the texts and their histories and the students being able to discuss their own views and how they interpret different aspects of the literature that allows for more open and interesting learning.",
    "I really appreciate how in literature, we usually read the texts in their entirety, which is better than reading shorter excerpts of more texts. Some of the works-- like The Iliad, The Aeneid, and Dante-- I didn't appreciate until we went over them in seminar. But after discussing these classic works, I better appreciate the intricacy and precision of the prose. I would definitely advise that professors continue to incorporate weekly reading responses into seminar, as Professor Bender did, because it helps us both practice close reading and address some of the themes that there is not time to address in class.",
    "The strengths lie in the syllabus which includes really important texts and the writing rigor, which really helped me develop my skills.",
    "Strengths: captivating reading selection Weaknesses: not enough time spent on readings",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely the writing benefits. The weakness is the selection of literature. I feel like every piece we read was basically the same. I just think certain pieces were unnecessary; perhaps less than three Greek tragedies could have done the job.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in its wonderful selection of texts and discussion-style seminars, but can be very difficult for a student with a limited advanced-level literature analysis background. Once settled into the swing of things, the course's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "It all depends on who your professor is. If you are able to get Bender, then go out of your way to do so. I left every single class with a deeper understanding of the text I was interacting with and a period in which my mind was blown. I would sometimes be so profoundly impacted by what was discussed in Bender's class that I would tell people in other classes about the insights we had in class so that I could similarly blow their minds. As for DS in general I'm hesitant to make a recommendation due to my conflicted feelings on continuing the program. Is it worth it? Who knows I can't speak to the future. It seems like a worthwhile endeavor, but so do other sequences of classes. I would say that your experiences the first two weeks of class are fairly representative of the rest of the class and would emphatically recommend that everyone doing DS shop another set of classes that you would be equally happy with, and if you don't like DS in the beginning things will not get better, but if you do then go ahead full speed and run with it.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I feel much better able to closely analyze literary texts on a deep level, something that I think is essential to a true liberal arts experience.",
    "I think that the assigned workload (weekly readings and five-page papers) is manageable, and allows for students to become more familiar with the books of the classic western canon, as well as develop their paper writing skills. The small seminars keep the class engaging, while the weekly lectures allow for new insight on specific portions of a text that a seminar doesn't typically discuss\/delve into.",
    "I would recommend this course to the student who likes to read, and would be willing to commit to doing all (or at least the vast majority) of the reading. It's my opinion that half assing the reading doesn't get students very far, and anyone who wants to sign up for DS should know that in advance.",
    "I would simply because the books on the syllabus are must reads and I really appreciate how much my writing improved. Even if you are not planning on studying English, the skills developed in Literature were very important.",
    "Take this course if you have Prof. Bender. You'll learn so much. Can't really say anything about the other professors.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS to certain students. Its not for everybody, but its what I wanted. Understanding what DS is and what you will be learning could probably be better explained, and I will surely enlighten kids interested in a DS curriculum next year.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because of the profound ideas discussed, the brilliance of the texts selected to represent the western cannon, and the encouragement of students to take risks and develop their own ideas about the texts.",
    "Enriching oneself with knowledge of the classic literary texts is not only an endeavor to increase one's cultural capital, but we also witness the thought process and development of beliefs (in the west) be expressed through the canvas of literary art it enhances one's ability to read to empathize, and understand the cultural beliefs in the hotel today."
