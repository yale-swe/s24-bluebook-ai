    "Great summary of skeptical thought and atheism through the ages. Prof. Behre really knows how to get awesome conversations started. The reading is not insignificant, but I'm also a science major, so I'm a bit biased on that front. I hope they offer this course again - I'd highly recommend it! It's definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale - got me thinking about big things.",
    "Good class, really a historical approach so make sure that's what you're looking for. Work load was totally reasonable and content was interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student."
