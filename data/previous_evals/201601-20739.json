    "Yes, especially if you are interested in watching tv\/film.",
    "Even if not in your major or area of focus (it wasn't for me), still a great class and very interesting.",
    "Go for it!",
    "Take it. Take it. No seriously, take it. The class doesn't have too much work other than two 5 page papers and a final longer paper of 10-15 pages, which is honestly fun to write because you get to choose which movie you write on. I didn't have any experience in American Studies or Film and found the class to be very enjoyable and manageable. Professor Muller is a gem and one of the sweetest people you'll ever have as a professor. The material is important and difficult (think, you'll be watching Schindler's List while your friends are at a Woad's pregame) but highly recommend the class.",
    "Very interesting material. The class is really what you make of it, if you enjoy the material and take the time to read it, you can get a lot out of it. For me, I really enjoyed this topic and the material, so I read everything and I feel like I learned a lot. Also, like with any seminar, the quality of the discussions depend on how engaged the other people in your seminar are, but Prof. Muller always steers the conversations very well and gives good prompts for us to bounce our thoughts off from. The workload is very manageable, and the essays aren't too bad and graded generously. Also: what other class lets you watch the Walking Dead?",
    "This is a really solid AMST seminar, and if you're at all interested in the subject matter then you should definitely shop it! When else will you get to watch The Walking Dead for class?",
    "Yes 100% recommend take it",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. Professor Muller is a fantastic and engaging teacher. The class was incredibly interesting and applicable to so many areas of life.",
    "I think this is a great class for any consumer of American media, and for anyone seeking an accurate and compassionate language for describing violence and its aftermath. It was taught on a rigorous level, but in such a way that people new to clinical psychology, sociology, and film studies could get a lot out of it."
