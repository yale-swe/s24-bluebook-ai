    "Class overview of the major spectroscopic techniques for the characterization of metal complexes- useful for analysis of literature articles for people not directly involved in inorganic research.",
    "Bioinorganic is a course with a specific focus as befits a graduate course. It really supplements the physical methods in inorganic chemistry course well by covering techniques that are used in inorganic that this course doesn't cover as it focuses primarily on diamagnetic systems whereas most of these techniques pick out the paramagnetic center.",
    "This was an in-depth class on inorganic systems in biology with a focus on metalloenzyme function. Several inorganic spectroscopic techniques were introduced. Overall, this course was very good and I enjoyed it. It was taught at a rapid pace and with high expectations from the students. It is taught with the expectation that you have previously taken some form of inorganic chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "Will help if the study of an inorganic component is needed- and helped in a better understanding of biological systems",
    "This course taught me a lot of things that I don't know and has made me think about pursuing bioinorganic or coordination chemistry by exposing me to these techniques.",
    "An increased understanding of instrumental techniques and biological systems is essential to chemical research and interdisciplinary collaboration. I enjoyed the course and expect to use the taught principles in future academic interactions."
