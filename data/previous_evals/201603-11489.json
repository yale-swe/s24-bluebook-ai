   "comments": [
    "Professor Huber did an incredible job teaching us the statistical methods and concepts necessary for an understanding of political science, as well as forcing us to be critical in the best possible way.",
    "This course was a great opportunity for me to get to know the major findings in the field's scholarship. It's really cool to learn the different theories accounting for ideology formation while being critical of the experimental designs. A cool thing about this class is indeed that you gain insights about how the scholarship goes about justifying its claims. I wish the class provided a little more background in statistics so we could appreciate the methods at a deeper level.",
    "This was a great class for learning how to analyze and interpret scholarly research in political science. The class taught me how think critically about the methods and concepts behind data collection and interpretation, and I was able to understand statistics a little better as well. One of the most informative classes I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "I learned a lot about research methodology and trends in political preferences. In particular, I feel better versed in reading dense academic articles.",
    "Learned how to correctly identify the shortcomings and strengths of political surveys and experiments."

   "comments": [
    "I've never taken a more complete or comprehensive course in the political science department here. For anyone with any desire for any understanding whatsoever of American politics, this course is a must-take.",
    "The class was very engaging and the material very diverse. Professor Huber does a great job at making the material accessible and relevant. The final project was an original task that I enjoyed doing. The class could be made more interesting if we had conceptual wrap-ups from time to time: at times, it feels like the class is mostly about delving into individual pieces and it'd be cool to draw a broader picture once in a while.",
    "Strengths: Professor Huber knows the topics well and guides section in an effective manner (especially when he asks clarifying questions when student's initial comments are vague). Weaknesses: I was a little unsure of how I was doing in the course which led to some anxiety about whether I should take it for a grade or not (as opposed to CR\/D). In addition, the mix of graduate students and undergraduate students led to some knowledge gaps (none major - it just felt like the graduate students would reference tangential knowledge rather than the course's readings)",
    "Learned a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of polling."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student with any desire for an understanding of politics. This course, with Professor Huber, is truly excellent, and should be a departmental requirement. I've never felt that I learned more or thought in a more rigorous way than I did in this class. Take it.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the quantitative side of American political behavior.",
    "If you want to learn more about polling and surveys, yes you should take this course."
