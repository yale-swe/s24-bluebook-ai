   "comments": [
    "Overall I did not like this course. The homework can be assigned a day before it is due and ask questions that you have to make up the answer for. It does give you a good introduction not linguistics, but I didn't really like it.",
    "I would not recommend this class to any freshman like myself who have no background in linguistics. If you do have experience in linguistics I would still not recommend if it is still offered as a freshman seminar. You will most likely be annoyed and\/or bored with the other students who know nothing about linguistics. Take this class if it is offered as an upper level linguistics class because it would probably be very interesting at a higher level. Professor Pinango is extremely knowledgeable and accomplished so I think she would be a good professor for students who are much more familiar with linguistics so she doesn't have to cover basic ideas.",
    "AUGGGHHHH!!! STAY AWAY! Even if you are passionately interested in the subject material, this is not the class for you, I promise. Professor Pi\u00f1ango is extremely knowledgeable and a great scholar of cognitive linguistics, but she does not know how to teach undergrads. TAKE AT YOUR OWN RISK!",
    "Don't take the class if you aren't really interested in going in-depth on linguistics. While it starts out general, you get into specifics of structures and different domains of linguistics. It's not just an easy survey course.",
    "I definitely walked away from LING 018 with a lot of new knowledge on topics I knew nothing about before taking the course, but the course itself often felt frustrating. It's very difficult conceptually for a freshman seminar, and I felt like I just didn't have enough basic knowledge to understand the concepts so I often found myself guessing and disappointed. That being said, Maria Pinango is an incredibly warm and kind professor with so much passion for her topic and for her students!",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend it - at least not as it exists as a freshman seminar. Maybe if it's offered as a lecture and you've taken LING 101.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I found it to be much more technical than expected and felt as though a student really would have needed some background in linguistics to get the most out of the class. The disorganized teaching style and confusing instructions from the professor didn't help.",
    "This is a fascinating course about how people first learn languages. The readings may be a bit dry and long, but the material you learn is not something you see every day. The class is small enough to bond with the professor and the other students."
