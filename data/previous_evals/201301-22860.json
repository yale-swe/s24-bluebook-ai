   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it with the caveat that it was a very rigorous amount of reading. That being said, literature was my favorite of the three DS sections.",
    "By now you know what you're getting yourself into with DS. Literature is by far the best seminar and Professor Connolly is amazing -- unbelievably encouraging and thoughtful, though sometimes not quick enough to shut down section assholes -- but please ask yourself: is DS really right for me? If you're sure it is, then stay in Connolly's section!",
    "Second semester DS Lit is one of the best classes I've ever taken on Literature. The material covered is great, I just wish I have more time to read Don Quixote, War and Peace, and Paradise Lost. The course somehow manages to be at the same time a great western literature survey course and instills in students close reading skills and really delve into each book.",
    "Too much reading, so you'll probably not finish it all. However, everything on the syllabus is so incredible that you should absolutely take the class, and also make a priority of finishing everything you had to skim through at a later date.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "This is a fast-paced literature survey course. If you want to read a staggering quantity of great literature, and still be able to discuss various works in detail, then this course is for you.",
    "You read texts picking up from where you left off in first semester. Be expected to had a lot of reading during winter break. This year we read War and Peace, so it was definitely worth the time! I would definitely recommend this to other students. You read the best literary texts of the ages!",
    "Take it if you can really get into the material. If you can its gonna be really rewarding. I'd you can't then you'll be hating life. I personally really liked it and glad I stuck with it second semester.",
    "Absolutely. Of course, by second semester you know what you're going to get from DS. If it's for you, go for it.",
    "I'd recommend DS Lit if you're really interested in Western Literature; don't take DS just to take DS, but only if you're really interested in learning about what it teaches.",
    "The second semester of Directed Studies: Literature is different from the first in that the texts become more modern and involve \"new\" mediums (including prose and non-epic verse). Additionally, the syllabus could probably be considered more vast and widespread than that of the first semester. Whereas the first semester was dominated by the Greek and Roman classics, this semester spans the literatures of Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Russia and England. The result of this wide scope is a rich syllabus that offers something for every student to latch onto the reflect upon on a personal level. In this sense, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. I feel that this course has opened many windows into authors and genres that I want to study further in the future, and has sparkedmy own potential desire to major in literature. I would definitely encourage other students to come and see all that this course has to offer!"
