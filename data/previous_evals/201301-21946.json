   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you want to have fun and learn stuff.",
    "It is a great class. The professor is very knowledgeable. The readings are not bad but very interesting.",
    "Yes definitely take it if you like American history and especially this period.",
    "I highly recommend this course for all students who love America because they willbe very moved",
    "This was a great course! Professor Freeman is a wonderful, engaging lecturer. The material is incredibly interesting and the workload is quite manageable! Take it! You won't regret it at all.",
    "The class is not just a factual overview of what happened during the first 50 or so years of the United States. It is more an overview of the broad but incredibly important changes that occurred in the country during this period. This is basically the period in which America defined itself.",
    "Absolutely! Even if you aren't a history major it is a great source of background material and information about this country.",
    "Really great course. I want to take every course Joanne Freeman ever offers. Well-structured lectures, learned so much. Workload is moderate - not a gut but definitely manageable.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Freeman is a great lecturer, and I really enjoyed taking her class!",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the period. Professor Freeman is a wonderful lecturer with lots of great stories.",
    "Needing a four class, I signed up for this class at the last minute and rather randomly. While I have always loved American history, I never thought I would be particularly interested in the early periods of our nation's history. But this course proved this judgment wrong -- I really enjoyed it. I think the course's biggest strength is its emphasis on the themes of the period, rather than straight-up facts and historical events. Of course you learn a lot about the events of the early national period, but Professor Freeman always frames these events in the context of larger themes that characterized the time. These themes are traced throughout the entire course so that you get a very good sense of how uncertain our nation's early history was -- the nation was an experiment that many viewed as fragile and likely to collapse at any moment. I thought all the reading was good and, compared to other Yale history courses, there wasn't an overwhelming amount of it. It was very doable, and all of the reading felt relevant; none of it felt like a waste of time.",
    "Yes - it's a great pre-industrial credit for history majors. Prof. Freeman is engaging, funny, and so knowledgeable about the time period. She references a lot of primary sources in a way that is easy to understand even for freshmen or students new to history, and talks about figures like Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, and Jackson in a way that makes you feel like she's talking about old friends. The reading is mostly interesting but manageable (not more than 1 book + some course packet readings per week). Take it if you like American history and\/or need a pre-industrial class!",
    "It's a fine course. It's a lot about dead white guys, and personally I don't really need more info in my life about dead white guys, but I know there are plenty of people who love this stuff and that's great! Prof Freeman is clearly one of those people in the best way. She's awesome, she tells great historical anecdotes, and she's very nice and entertaining.",
    "Take this class! If you're even considering the class, you should definitely take it! Professor Freeman doesn't try to be tricky when structuring the class or writing test questions or paper questions so it's not supposed to be a super stressful class. The anecdotes that are told in class about George Washington, AndrewJackson, and everyday citizens make each period fly by!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others, no complaints!"
