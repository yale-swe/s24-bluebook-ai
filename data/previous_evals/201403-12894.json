    "I'd recommend it, it's a nice way to get 1.5 credits and heck, you probably need to take it to finish your language requirement!",
    "It's a fun class. Largely a review of concepts from L1\/L2.",
    "L3 helps you strengthen and internalize the grammar and pronouncing of words.",
    "L3 is a lot of review with Italian culture added in. It is required if you are taking Italian for your language course, which I highly recommend. But if you have the opportunity, I would do a summer abroad during your language req. If you have the option take one of the courses with Michael Farina.",
    "Great class! ITAL 104 will have you speaking italian in no time! Take it with Farina!!",
    "Very straightforward review of the concepts you've probably already learned in levels 1 and 2, with a few new things thrown in. You can handle this. You go to Yale.",
    "A review of L1-L2, with more emphasis on writing and an introduction of some new concepts."
