   "comments": [
    "It was great. The assignments got me to be engaged and I learnt a lot. It'd be great if there were more thorough notes though; sometimes I had a hard time following the lectures.",
    "Well taught course. No real weakness, everything is as stated in the syllabus which is pretty comprehensive",
    "Ran out of time to to Pthreads computing, would have liked to go deeper into GPU computing but was rushed at the end. Really appreciated the detail that went into OpenMP and OpenMPI though.",
    "The early time was not ideal, although I suppose there do have to be some classes starting at 9 AM. The professor was extremely responsive and willing to sit down with me in his office and go over concepts I was confused about. The assignments gave a good overview of the techniques presented in class. However, they were not graded very quickly, which would have helped me with feedbacvk.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is very practical; I can see myself actively applying the skills I learned at a job or for research. I feel the weakness was in Omega, as students occasionally had to fight for compute nodes. Regardless, support was readily available if you're willing to take an advantage of it (Piazza, email, office hours)!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Well, mainly if you're in CS.",
    "The lectures are a bit dull, but Sherman puts the slides online. There are 6 problem sets, a midterm, and a final project (or final). Some of the problem sets were a joke and could be finished in about 3 hours, others were much more involved taking over 15 hours. The midterm is very straight forward. Sherman allows a lot of freedom with the final project, which was the best part of the course. Also, learning the parallelization libraries is a very important skill, so this class is one to take.",
    "If you're interested in scientific computing, new ways of thinking about designing algorithms for practical purposes, and high performance computing, take this course! The homework assignments (6 for the semester) are challenging but reasonable, they ask you to write reports about how your code functions and why hardware makes it perform that way, not just pass some test cases.",
    "Great professor, love the material.",
    "Yes. Especially if you are interested in doing HPC work, this course is extremely useful.",
    "Yes, I think some of the larger concepts learned in this class are very important for all Computer Science majors to learn, even if they are not interested in parallel programming.",
    "This course is actually practical- I can see myself applying the skills I've learned here to a job or research. You learn how to parallelize algorithms (essentially you take advantage of using multiple computers to work on a single task) and these algorithms are used to render game graphics, animated movies (hello Pixar), calculate weather patterns and a whole lot more. Yale has a supercomputer called Omega that we did all of our problem sets on- it was pretty dope. Anyway, so here's a rundown of how I felt about the course. You learn OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA which is cool. The course is all about computer architecture and writing and optimizing parallel programs. It was a 9am and even though the lecture was a bit dry at times, I always felt like I was learning something. There were 6 problem sets, one midterm and then you could choose to either take the final exam or do a final project (I did the project). A note on the midterm: it felt as though literally every lecture slide was on it so STUDY UP and try not to get bogged down by other midterm studying if you can. Also, the last problem set's due date makes its way into Reading Week (where the final project is due soon after) so you need to work in advance. Finally, the problem sets in this class are essentially \"1) write this program that does this thing like you normally would (serially\/with one processor), 2) now parallelize it using OpenMP, MPI and\/or CUDA\". After that, you write up a lab report about the performance results you found and you discuss why you saw those results, etc. There's a bunch of support through email, office hours and Piazza (the TAs and Professor Sherman respond quickly and are usually up almost 24\/7) which was superb; I was able to get good help when I needed it. Anyway, I hope this was helpful. I'd recommend this course- parallel computing and optimized code is becoming increasingly important this day-in-age. I learned a ton from this course. Just be prepared for the workload (everything I mentioned before.)"
