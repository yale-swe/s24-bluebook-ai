    "I honestly think this lab was more interesting than 355L",
    "You have to take it (I'm sorry). It sucks... The equipment doesn't work and the labs will cover topics that you haven't seen in your 352 class yet. Just grit your teeth and bear it, because everyone is in the same situation. Work hard on your lab reports so you have less pressure going into the final. And read the procedures\/prep materials before lab -- it will help for the final immensely.",
    "A definite improvement over 355L, although there were still equipment issues. Some of the labs overlapped up with topics taught in 352 (though not at the same time), which was nice.",
    "Labs are old and not applicable to current BME technologies. That being said, the labs aren't too bad. Some take the full two weeks but others only take one. Exam is fair and straightforward.",
    "One of the only labs I've taken here where you lose points because of your raw data, which is something you cannot necessarily control.",
    "BENG 356L was a terrible, terrible class. Tied with 355 for the worst lab--possibly the worst course--I've taken at Yale. While it could be a helpful course with functioning equipment and instructions that actually instructed, the course in its current form suffers from malfunctioning equipment, confusing instructions, and ambiguity in expectations when it comes to the lab reports. The only saving grace is that Prof. Levene is a nice guy and very helpful, unlike Themis, whom I saw maybe once last semester. Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "BENG 356L is required for BME, so you'll take it at some point. It's a pretty good lab -- each lab is 2 weeks long, so you don't really have any stressful weeks. Lab reports are due every 2 weeks, and they don't take that long to finish. The final was very fair, and is probably easy with a good amount of studying. Overall great course!",
    "Well, you're taking this if you're BME, but don't feel like this is an unhappy requirement. At least with Levene, and the TAs we had, it was a pretty good lab course--much better than last semester's half. This was likely in part because the professor actually showed up to class and we had much more help and direction on the labs so we spent time learning concepts rather than trouble shooting.",
    "Overall this is an interesting course. It is a very manageable course and has a fair amount of course work. The final is difficult due to the amount of information covered throughout the course.",
    "I would describe this class as one of practical applications for the material learned in the BME classes. I would definitely recommend this class because it teaches knowledge that I think every BME or even engineering student should have.",
    "This course has so much potential to be really great, but it often falls short due to equipment malfunction or professor\/TA confusion. Experimenting with microscopes, ultrasound machines, xrays, imaging software, etc. is so cool! But, it is really frustrating when the microscope never displays the image of your cheek cells because no one realizes that a light bulb is covered or when a whole two-week lab gets cancelled because the equipment isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t working. I think that this lab could really be great with some new equipment and better TA training. Also, this lab is great because it does not require very much work outside of class. But, the final exam is really hard.",
    "A great lab if you love imaging."
