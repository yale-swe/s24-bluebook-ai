    "a good explorationvaluable for people who want to think about theater and what it is and how it is made. even if you don't love all the artists we look at, there's value in thinking about them and talking about what they were investigating and experimenting with",
    "Great but some of the artists are just painful to sit through. It opens you up to new theatrical possibilities but I would say 60% of the time you are going to hate hate the artist - but learning what you hate can be useful!",
    "THST 398 is a survey of the American experimental theater tradition. While I'm really glad I learned the material, I was not the class' biggest fan. I think it is important to learn about this kind of theater, but it can be somewhat boring and bizarre.",
    "You will read about, watch, and write about some amazing theater. You cover a lot of ground in a semester, and the work you see is sure to give you strong opinions! It was great to talk and debate about experimental theater with such a creative and insightful group. I found myself thinking about our discussions long after class ended.Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time on viewings (watching experimental theater for homework!). Also, the readings are usually really interesting! There's a fair bit, but it doesn't feel like a slog at all.You have two papers of 8-10 pages (and a WR credit!) and 8 blog posts. Overall, an interesting and engaging class on a great topic with a very manageable workload. Highly recommended.",
    "If you are interested in making theater-- take this course. It is a really wonderful survey that will force you to question any and all conventions. The seminars are great, and Professor Robinson is a wonderful teacher.",
    "This course is for serious theater artists who want to expand their awareness and toolbox."
