    "Seminar style is great. One thing that can improve this class is splitting up the class to two days. one focusing on guest and another on the readings for methods.",
    "The methods section of the course heavily favors ethnography or historical analysis - and this makes sense, as the bulk of majors are engaging with these methods. However, as an interdisciplinary and radical line of inquiry, gender studies ought push students to think critically about \"methods\", urging them to push against the rigidity of the academy.",
    "I really love that the WGSS major prepares you so much for doing your senior project and writing a proposalI know that many other majors do not, and just expect juniors to submit a proposal by the end of the year. So I really love that, at the same time, I feel like this class could have definitely been more? Like I wish that we could have been more systematic about writing the proposal, or designing your project. I wish we could have gotten handouts like the one from NIH or whatever detailing what the actual components of a proposal should be, and with the outline detailing why proposals usually get rejected. I think reading more stuff like Umberto Eco's book, which is about the nitty gritty of actually writing a proposal, rather than all that angst about transnationalism and subject position etc etc etc. Not that that isn't important, but first of all, there was a BIG focus on ethnography, which wasn't what everyone was doing, and I also think stuff like that should be covered elsewhere, like in our methodology requirement. Which leads to my next point: I think this class would be much stronger if everybody had taken their methodology requirement beforehand. I mean, we take this junior spring, so I don't think it's out of question to require students to do so by then. I also think a part of the problem is that it's very vague? As to what counts for a methods class? So if we made that clearer that would be helpful. Because I feel like at times our class was just abstractly ruminating on the potential problems that MIGHT arise IF we CHOSE to pursue this particular methodology, hypothetically. I mean I love theory, don't get me wrong, I eat that stuff up, but I wish for this class, there was more concrete stuff for methods. Again, maybe if everybody has to take a methods course beforehand, we wouldn't have to, but maybe we could spend a week or so on different methodology, I don't know actually DOING some archival work, or interviews, although I can see how the latter would be more difficult. Relatedly, another problem is that everyone's doing different things, right, in different disciplines, and like sure interdisciplinarity yadda yadda but it's hard to care about the IRB when you're doing literature studies or art history or whatever. Again, I think taking a methodology class beforehand, which would focus on a specific field of our interest, before taking this class would help with that. I also think it would have been really helpful to read other, finished proposals. In fact, I don't know why we didn't do that? Is that stuff confidential? Lastly, sticking to the syllabus, and having actual deadlines, instead of having things up in the air and changing the deadlines willy nilly, would have been awesome. Seriously. Also, I hate using facebook for classI never go on there, so I would actually miss out on a lot of announcements. Anyway, I really really liked the peer review, and talking over other people's projects in class, and I loved the having the professors\/grad students visit, that was super cool\/helpful.",
    "Many of the methods were not applicable to my thesis, so I wasnt that engaged with them. On the other hand, the course inspired me to think about using methods I hadn't considered before and helped me develop my thesis topic.",
    "Strengths- forcing me to work on my thesis and start considering what I want my research to look like Weaknesses- didn't find the readings helpful"
