    "Take it for the distributional requirement.",
    "If you know you need to take English 114, then you can't go wrong by taking this class. The workload is generally pretty reasonable and the readings are not long. The assignments are pretty typical of an English 114 class - 4 papers, out of which one is a longer research paper; something different is perhaps an oral presentation you have to give on your research paper, but it was pretty fun. Julia Yost is a very good and witty instructor and I'm sure the class wouldn't have been as great if we had a different instructor. The grading seemed to me pretty generous compared to what I usually hear about English 114 classes, so I guess that's nice. The class is a good way to develop your writing skills while finding out more about madness\/mental illness from many perspectives (historical, sociocultural, medical, artistic). Awesome way to secure a writing credit.",
    "English 114 is a good course overall. If your goal is to improve your writing of critical essays and research papers at a fairly basic level, this is a good class to take.",
    "The real name of this class is \"Madness and Civilization.\" This name is good for describing why the class is interesting. The boring name of this class is, \"Tracking Changes to the Definition of Mental Illness,\" because the definition of mental illness and the way ithas changed is its primary topic of study. It starts with talking about Freud and his definition of mental illness, carries on to Foucault, Laing, and the anti-psychiatrists, and finishes with a few more-modern writings.Although the course strays very near to interesting and over-politicized questions, like, \"What exactly led psychiatrists to change the definition of homosexuality from 'mental illness' to 'normal mental functioning'?\" it nevertheless manages to completely avoid addressing the topic, despite the fact that homosexuality is the most obvious and prominent recent example of a significant change to the societal definition of mental illness, changes which as noted above are the course's primary topic of study. This demonstrates the one inherent bias in the course (or perhaps just the people of the course); a dogmatic aversion to any serious inquiry of one relevant component of the homosexual movement, its shift of psychiatric opinion.Manageable workload and readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 114 12 for a fellow student. The required readings for the course are always interesting and rarely redundant, making for eventful class discussions. Ms. Yost also does the favor of providing the readings online.",
    "This course has been the best class I have ever taken. It's the kind of class I thought might exist when considering coming abroad to America. Its strengths are that the professor has an incredible way of interacting, the material is very vivid and expansive and exciting, and the freedom is inspiring. Julia is an incredible instructor. She makes class very stimulating by involving a number of types of sources and a sense of humour. She is meticulously prepared, incredibly knowledgable and extremely approachable.This has been a thoroughly excellent course.",
    "I didn't like it. The way it was graded was stupid. Paper grades were totally arbitrary. The teacher was disorganized and unprepared. In class, she totally ignored the assignments we had in class, and didn't bother to take the time to explain what she was looking for. This, in turn, hurt your grade significantly."
