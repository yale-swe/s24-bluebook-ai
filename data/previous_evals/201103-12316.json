   "comments": [
    "If you don't have to take this class, don't. The labs are not difficult, but they are tedious and the data collection process is not great. Lab equipment is poor, many times for no fault of your own the equipment simply won't work until you try multiple connectors and luckily find one that works. But if you have to take it, it's not that awful -- workload is pretty low since you essentially only have lab once every 2 weeks.",
    "Yes.",
    "Cool course. The labs were all pretty interesting and the lab reports were not too bad. The first one is pretty long, but don't let that scare you. The rest of them are actually not too bad and kind of cool.",
    "If you're looking at this, you're required to take it. Boring labs with old equipment, but that's life. Too bad Nicha won't be TFing.",
    "This course was much harder than it needed to be. The lab equipment was always faulty and the TAs and the professor never tested it out beforehand. This resulted in students spending an hour troubleshooting only to discover that something was broken. Also, we didn't get our grades back for our lab reports until the right before the final. This resulted in a lot of confusion about how to write the reports. And we were never taught how to use LabView, which is a program pretty much used in every lab. Overall, it wasn't the greatest, but if you're BME, you have to take it.",
    "This is a nice lab which is quite interesting.",
    "You basically have to take it for the BME major and its not the worst thing ever so thats good. It is fun at times - like shocking people in the neuromuscular lab etc. And you do learn interesting things that kind of pull some of the other BME material together. Good stuff.",
    "The workload isn't too bad, but the way the labs were run wasn't well planned. Be prepared to ask the TAs for a lot of help. Fortunately, most of the labs are two-week labs, so if you can finish it in one week then you get a week off of lab.",
    "If you're reading this, then you probably have to take it, but it's a decent lab. The short form lab reports aren't all too bad, and most of the labs are two week labs that you can finish in one week, so you don't have to go in to lab at all some weeks, which is nice. Professor Fan and the TAs are helpful, so there's typically not too much frustration.",
    "the labs can get tedious, but a necessary class for BME",
    "I really liked the labs. Professor Fan was great and Nicha was wonderful with all my ques",
    "You have to take it if you're a BME major.",
    "If you take the class, try to pick a group that you'll be able to work well with, and ask questions when you don't understand the concepts!",
    "Only take it if you're a BME major. Some of the labs are interesting-particularly the physiological systems lab. Taking the computation class will definitely make the lab easier because you'll know how to use LabView. It's way more work than a 1\/2 credit, though, so just be prepared."
