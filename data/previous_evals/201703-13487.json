    "Great survey course of FDA law and current issues regarding drug safety and efficacy. Aaron is an engaging professor, and I loved that we began each class with a discussion of relevant current events. Overall, I learned a great deal, not to mention it was such a relief in the semester to have weeks where class was not held. I also didn't mind the extra class sessions at all. Overall, a great class!",
    "I think the instructor is the main strength; he is an expert in the field and so knowledgeable. I wish the class met more often, but I understand that Dr. Kesselheim's schedule could make that difficult.",
    "The course is a great introduction to how FDA works and the thinking process behind this public agency.",
    "This course was a smaller discussion course which was nice, Dr. Kesselheim's lectures were interesting, current, and relevant and provided a good overview of the FDA and current FDA activities. It would have been nice to focus a few lectures on the \"Food\" in FDA instead of just drugs.",
    "The class is good but a little difficult to keep up on the readings without a good understanding of law jargon."

    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0very passionate about all FDA subjects and very knowledgable.",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0He is a god among men, the absolute leader in his field. Was very approachable, made classes almost seem like a conversation between him and the students. Always brought Crazy Donut to class, which was great!",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0Aaron is a great professor!",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0I really liked Dr. Kesselheim. He is knowledgeable, approachable, and encouraging.",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0Aaron is very knowledgeable and informative.",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0The instructor is great!",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0Great professor! Very engaging and interested in helping us learn about the FDA and think critically about current FDA-related events. Might have been interesting to have students present during a week, or for part of a class to facilitate more discussion and engage those who are not as familiar with the law side of the FDA and public health.",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0Very good at discussing the topic",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0Super nice, helpful, and knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Aaron S Kesselheim \u00a0Professor Kesselheim is AMAZING! He is extremely knowledgeable and has written everything out there about drug-related policies! He really cares that you learn from the materials. This is my first course at the Law school and I really enjoy it! I learn a lot and love the reading assignments!"

    "This is essentially a seminar class. It meets once every week or two for two hours, and the only assignment is a paper at the end. I think it is interesting material and worth taking.",
    "I highly recommend the course",
    "The course is great!",
    "This course was a great way to start Monday mornings (especially with the donuts Dr. Kesselheim brought for us), the readings and discussions provided a thorough overview of the FDA's activities related to drugs (food topics were not discussed) and current events related to the FDA. I would recommend this course, even if you do not have a law background, to learn more about public health law and consider how your interests are related to the FDA and laws.",
    "This is a great course to get some working knowledge of how the FDA works",
    "Take this course!!!!"
