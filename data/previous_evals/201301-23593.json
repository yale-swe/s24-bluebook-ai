    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone else. The readings are really interesting, and it gives you a chance to write essays that are very different from typical academic writing.",
    "English 120 is a definite must do for people interested in writing, who enjoy writing, or hope to polish their non-fiction writing skills. It has a pretty different aim from 114, and definitely is less directly applicable to academic life, but is so useful for any budding journalists or individuals who want to contribute in some form to any publication.",
    "TAKE ENGLISH 120!! If you even think you might want to take it, just do it. While the essay format is different from most other academic classes, it really clues you in to what \"good\" writing really is. I can already tell I'll be better prepared for future writing seminars.The class is tons of work, but you really get out what you put in. And if you can take it with Prof. Klemann, do!! She's the absolute best.",
    "The class is a good amount of work, and you will probably be writing about a paper a week between rough drafts and final drafts of your essays, along with reading to be done for every class. The discussions are really enjoyable and interesting, and Professor Klemann provides great writing advice and definitely does a good job keeping the class engaged with the material. It's not an easy course and you should think twice if you hate to write, but it will help you improve a lot in your writing and is a great experience to have at Yale in the long run. Definitely recommended, and Professor Klemann is an awesome teacher to take it with; while she's not necessarily one of the famous 120 professors, she does an awesome job with the class and is very energetic and easy to talk to.",
    "Take it!",
    "Great class! One of my favorites at Yale so far. Professor Klemann is great, but I hear most of the teachers for this class are. It's intensive reading and writing but not too much, and it's fun so you want to put time into your work. Take this if you want detailed feedback on your writing and ideas -- this is hard to get in non English department classes."
