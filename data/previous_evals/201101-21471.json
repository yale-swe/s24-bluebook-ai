   "comments": [
    "A very cool course working with a very new field, so there's lots of room for exploration and input--you can't just repeat the standard theories in this course! I would absolutely recommend it because the wide variety of source material we worked with offered a great opportunity to learn about different analysis, and the global scope (with more specified case studies each week) meant that even if one week's topic was less interestingthe next week was bound to be more so. Gene and Bruno worked fantastically together and did a good job of combining lecture, discussion, and presentations each week. Definitely one of the best classes I took at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it to someone interested in the subject topics, a history major, an environmental studies major, or any other major with any interest in the topics covered.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is less work than some other junior history seminars (only the final paper) and Cabanes and Tempest both lead discussion very well. The class mixes in a variety of different types of reading and primary sources, which is very helpful in preparing for a senior essay.",
    "War and the Environment is a very interesting survey course (in the form of a seminar) on personal experiences of war throughout history. The discussions are very interesting and the instructors are very enthusiastic, approachable, and helpful. The reading is quite manageable. Sometimes there is a lot of reading, but it is usually very interesting and doable, especially considering the lack of reading responses or otherassignments. Yes, there are NO reading responses, just a 10 minute presentation and a 15 page final paper. Therefore, it is pretty easy to get away without doing all of the reading, but you will probably find yourself doing it anyways because the readings are so interesting! My only caution: if you are looking for a typical \u0093Environmental Studies\u0094 course, this is not what you are looking for: it is essentially a history seminar. But still worth taking \u0096 the discussions are actually something I looked forward to every week!",
    "Yes because it is very relevant to your life. We are currently in wartimes and thinking about how past wars shaped people's lives really can influence our thoughts and actions for the present and the future. Perfect history class.",
    "Great class. New angle of approaching history. For example, instead of learning about WWI in the traditional way, we read accounts mud's debilitating and restricting role in the trenches. We also cooked food from WWI recipes to better understand how people used substitutes during war. Each week two students present a set of primary documents to the class, which can be used for the final paper. Both Gene and Prof. Cabanes are very accessible.",
    "This class was great! Professor Cabanes and Gene are very knowledgeable about the material and helpful in researching the final paper. The syllabus is great and fun to read. This is a good way to earn a WR credit.",
    "A great class on recent warfares in history through case studies of specific events\/aspects of war.",
    "I would recommend it. War and Environment tackles with a less-dealt-with field and we covered from the First World War to the U.S. occupation of Bagdad, focusing on the impact of war on the environment.",
    "There were a lot of readings but few assignments so it was hard to gauge where you stood in the class but the material was definitely interesting and I would recommend it for any History major who needs a junior seminar.",
    "War and the Environment is a great class on wartime environments that takes full advantage of the unique materials available at Yale. There is a reasonable workload and many of the readings and discussions are fascinating (on topics such as barbed wire, chemical weapons, and the atomic bomb). The Professors integrated video clips, photos from the YUAG, posters from Manuscripts and Archives, and even wartime food into the class. I really enjoyed the thematic approach of the class and I would highly recommend it to those interested in warfare beyond major battles and diplomatic efforts.",
    "Covers the relationship between war and the environment in the broadest sense, in other words you rarely discuss war's tangible and often detrimental impact on the natural environment but will often explore things like the micro-environment of the muddy trenches in WWI and its effect on the psychological health of soldiers fighting there. You've got to do the majority of the readings or discussion won't be that interesting. The material was great but the quality of in-seminar discussion was quite low (which might be a product of the students who happened to take the course, I'm not sure). I would recommend it if you've never taken a course on war history, regardless of the quality of the course you'll be exposed to information that everyone who lives in the modern world should probably know which makes taking the class worth it.",
    "Highly. The kids in my class were brilliant, Gene and Bruno were such caring and enormously helpful mentors, the topics are fascinating, the primary source presentations were an excellent idea well-executed by my classmates, and the readings show how you really want to write war history. This was by far my favorite seminar at Yale. Besides the ongoing, semester-long paper (15-20 pages), the reading wasn't heavy and the presentation wasn't difficult. If you get in, don't hesitate, just take it."
