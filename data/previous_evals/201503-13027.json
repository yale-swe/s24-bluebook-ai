   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in feminism or theater (or even if you're not), take this class!! You'll gain a greater understanding of both feminism and performance and an expanded vocabulary for talking about both of those things. Professor Morrison is an amazing discussion leader - we had an unusually large seminar, but she still made every class feel like a real conversation. The readings were interesting and varied, and classes always left me with a much more solid understanding of the material than I did before.",
    "Feminist Theater and Performance is an incredible chance to look at ways in which feminist theories are applied in performance, in concrete ways, which was great for me as a WGSS major who deals a lot of the time with theory essays in the abstract. Each week we would read a play\/performance piece written by a feminist artist and analyze it in conjunction with theoretical essays. Each week pairs of students did a presentation on a theory piece and a presentation on a performance piece. Through this class I got to hear about a lot of less well know but amazing female artists whom I might never have discovered.",
    "Basically, we read a lot of feminist theory and a lot of experimental feminist plays. The theater stuff was super weird and cool, and much of it was pretty niche stuff you probably wouldn't find elsewhere. There's a big presentation component to the class: about half of each class was taken up by two different student presentations, so the quality of the course definitely would depend on the quality of the students. I'd recommend it if you're especially interested in the material. Definitely was not a revolutionizing class but it did expand my vocabulary for how to talk about feminism in art.",
    "Yes! Definitely take it. It'll make you look at theater\/performance in a whole new way, and it feels good.",
    "A broad sweep through the intersection of feminism and performance art, with texts ranging from contemporary feminist thinkpieces to dense theoretical classics (Donna Haraway, Laura Mulvey). At the very least, the theater texts that are assigned weekly make for good jumping off points for one's own theater consumption.",
    "if you're looking for a course where you're going to primarily focus on theater, this might not be for you since a lot of time is spent talking about theory (which I loved). but if you're looking to educate yourself about feminism while looking at examples of feminist work in the theater as opposed to else where I'm this is a great choice. That's why I was there.",
    "I really enjoyed Feminist Theater and Performance. It's a good course both for people who know a lot about feminist theory and for those don't know anything about it. For THST folks, the focus is definitely more on the theory than on the plays, so be ready to immerse yourself in scholarly writing. There's a lot of reading, as well as reading responses every other week, two presentations, and one final paper. Professor Morrison knows the material really well, and makes sure that it's clearly explained. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "EVERYONE NEEDS TO TAKE THIS CLASS - you become comfortable with basic feminist theory as it has shifted through the years, and investigate how theater and performance work has enveloped and reflected those shifts. It's empowering, frustrating, exciting, challenging, and SO IMPORTANT. Plus Professor Morrison is an incredible teacher. The class has enough breadth to encompass theater, literature, and various kinds of visual and performance art, so its themes are inevitably directly applicable to daily life.",
    "This was such an unbelievable class. Professor Morrison is a wonderful seminar leader, and our class had phenomenal discussions about the text. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in feminist theory or in theater--or simply to anyone who wants to be introduced to fantastic texts that you're unlikely to find on another syllabus. It's not too much work, and the work is all very interesting and feels purposeful rather than just for the sake of evaluation. Take it!",
    "Very white. Like super white. Almost all the students of color dropped the class during reading period. That's indicative of a lot. Read some cool work though, but very little by non white women. Also very academic in the way that prevents the class from feeling personal."
