    "This was my first anthropology class (and I've never taken linguistics) so this was chock-full of information! You learn about the nation-state (macro) movements and changes in language and bilingualism and the individual (micro) phenomena of bilingualism. I also gleaned a lot of insight about patterns of bilingualism and sociolinguistics from all the readings.",
    "I learned a few major takeaways about bilingualism.",
    "A lot of interesting things about bilingualism",
    "I learned about bilingual theory and various ways to interpret the social, economic, and political conditions which lead to bilingual individuals and societies.",
    "Thinking about the different messages that our use of language can convey, language at the macro and micro scales"

   "comments": [
    "I think one of the greatest strengths of the course is that it's self-directed. The project you choose to work on the entire semester is born out of your own passions and interests, which is what helped make this class so enjoyable. It is a little nerve-wracking to have your entire grade (basically) balance on this one paper, but it feels more rewarding to work on the same thing all semester.",
    "I would have rather there been more discussion. I wonder if we could do maybe an hour lecture and an hour guided discussion? I didn't anticipate it being a lecture but it really was. I loved reading Mendoza-Denton, but didn't love a lot of the heavier linguistics readings because I don't have a linguistics background. Maybe if the course continues to not require linguistics background in the future there could be more ethnography incorporated. I also would have liked if the research updates or our participation were graded before finals. I just turned in my final paper and I have absolutely no idea what my grade is going to be at all.",
    "More interesting readings",
    "Great readings and topics but discussions were a little dead at times."

    "Absolutely take this class! Whether your bilingual or not, whether you know anything about anthropology\/linguistics or not, Prof. Errington is amazing and the class is so insightful. I had never taken an anthropology course and took this because I'm bilingual and I found it very interesting and manageable, without being a \"gut\". The workload consists of about 40-50 pages of reading a week, some progress reports on the project, a presentation, and a paper, but is all very chill. There is a large weight on this one paper, which can be a little nerve-wracking, but it's totally manageable. Take it!",
    "If you need an easy fifth class, this was definitely interesting. You won't be blown away by it, though. Also beware that your only graded assignment is the final paper. I just turned in my final paper and I have absolutely no idea what my grade is going to be at all.",
    "Take the class if you like bilingualism",
    "Yes, it was fun! but beware, final essay is basically your entire grade (yikes).",
    "Absolutely! Interesting material, great professor. Take it if bilingualism interests you."
