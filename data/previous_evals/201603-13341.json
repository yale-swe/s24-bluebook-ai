    "Great course, I strongly recommend it",
    "Professor Toensmeier is wonderful. One note is that I wish participation was taken. It seemed that many people attended irregularly, or left early. I felt that there needed to be more strict expectations about attendance.",
    "This class is most useful for people who want to start a carbon farming operation. Since I'm not going into that (probably), some of the material felt a bit like reading an encyclopedia. Regardless, this was my first class in any kind of agriculture so I learned a lot about the mindset around designing farm operations and all the constraints and considerations that go into it. If I end up more in the climate policy world, or even investing in different kinds of mitigation approaches, I now have a more well-rounded understanding of the agroforestry angle. I also liked that it was a mix of content and modeling exercises to help us get a sense of what the tradeoffs really feel like. Great field trip to see some practices in action too.",

    "The field trip and Eric's lectures. They were well-prepared and he clearly put a lot of work into them. In addition Eric is exceptionally attuned to students.",
    "-I was fairly disappointed by the course. It was not unpleasant, but the caliber wasnt high enough for me. I understand that Eric was dealing with personal\/family issues, and can empathize; not sure whether this affected the quality, but overall, the course was not rigorous by a few metrics: -Those of us with backgrounds in agroforestry were largely filling in blanks, rather than mastering the field in a more rigorous way. For instance, Id never been so aware of systems like Short-Rotation Coppice or various industrial crops. But these felt like snippets rather than gaining a whole new set of skills or knowledge. -Scientifically, there was far too little critical work on agroforestry included (e.g., journal articles questioning the effectiveness of various C sequestration agroforestry techniques). In general, the first primary scientific literature I looked at was for my final paper\/presentation. I found the articles I read for that way more specific and helpful than the massive IPCC reports that Eric assigned early on. -Eric could do some more work on the various spreadsheets he had use for the exercises in class. The second batch was way better than the first, but of course there are always improvements to be made. This also could have assigned as homework and then students could have been asked to do a little research for their model (e.g., 1-2 journal articles for each) and present on them. -In general, the amount of work required for the course was pretty low. Erics textbook could have been assigned (the entire thing) as the first months worth of readings, as a baseline, but then he could have asked students to do more individual research\/reading before each session. The reading responses didnt feel so rigorous. -I did find the process of researching for my paper and presentation really valuable, and felt like I learned a lot from that process. I wonder if there are way to incorporate this kind of learning earlier in the semester?",
