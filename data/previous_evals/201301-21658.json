    "This is a great class to learn how to critically read papers! I'd highly recommend this class, though students should be warned that Prof. Zhong has a distinctive rapid-fire questioning style that is intimidating at first. However, it helps you think about science and designing experiments from different angles. The course load is great: 3 papers a week (though you MUST read them thoroughly), a midterm (5 pg), a final (10 pg), and a 20 min presentation. The main problem with the class is that the work expectations were never laid out in writing, so we were surprised to find that we needed to do a final presentation. This is a great class, but be aggressive in getting Prof. Zhong's expectations for the class overall and for each assignment.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to students who are interested in pursuing serious careers in research. You will be forced in this class to re-evaluate how you think of scientific investigation, learn how to read scientific literature effectively, and tear apart arguments made in these papers. Professor Zhong is definitely a character and may not be the lecturer for everyone, but I had a great time in this engaging course.",
    "Great class - you will learn a lot and there's not too much work required on a daily basis. Lots of different lecturers makes it interesting. The small setting focuses more on really analyzing research papers, so if you're a bio major and\/or thinking about grad school, this class will probably prepare you for that with a greater return than the other upper level bio courses.",
    "If you want to become more comfortable with primary literature, then YES. This class goes over 2 papers a week with different experts in the field. That summarizes most of the workload. There was also a small 1000 word News and Views, a short presentation with a partner on 2 papers that contradict each other in the field, and a longer 2500-3000 word literature review on a topic using papers in the last 3 years (this is your final paper).It is unclear what the grading system for the class is (we've only received grades so far on the first paper), but for the most part, what makes this class great has nothing to do with its 3 assignments. The papers and discussions (if you have the time to read 2 papers and annotate for Wednesday's discussion) are really what make this class so useful to anyone pursuing science. I can honestly say that this class has made me exponentially better at reading primary literature.If this class becomes a bit more organized and the grading becomes clearer, it may be one of the best classes I've taken.",
    "TAKE IT. Covers seminal and crucial discoveries in neuroscience, especially developmental. Best-organized science discussion by requiring all students to participate by describing aspects of each week's papers. Division among professors was great (though some seemed out of sequence) and it was nice to have two core professors. Most professors were extremely enthusiastic and encouraging, and it was especially interesting to get a sense of how each different professor approached scientific problems. The projects\/presentations were meaningful and the workload was manageable. Best higher-level bio class EVER!"
