   "comments": [
    "Very good course; a strong seminar and obviously great poetry. I found Brisman's overemphasis of Wordsworth extremely trying; not only does WW take up by far the largest spot of the syllabus, but Brisman insisted on using many of the Coleridge, Keats, and Shelley seminars to discuss their relationship to Wordsworth. Keats for one seemed consequently to get rather short shrift as an independent thinker and innovator. I also found the strong preference for longer-form poems to make holistic discussion challenging at times.Professor Brisman is quite brilliant and is a caring, thoughtful, and and thorough teacher. Quite high standards, but not unfair. Know going in that he teaches poems as works of philosophy; if you care about poetic form, this is not the class for you.",
    "English 250 is one of those courses you come to Yale to take. Professor Brisman is similarly one of those professors you come to Yale to study under. The content that this course covers seems initially narrow\u00e2\u0080\u0094a smattering of Romantic poets\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you soon realize that this course is about broadening your imaginative outlook, about understanding just how broad the experience of Romantic poetry can be.",
    "I certainly feel like I learned a lot about Romantic poetry, but I don't think I would take the course again if I could magically be returned to the beginning of the semester. The discussions could be exciting, but often I came out wondering why these issues were at all important, not because I am not interested in poetry but because the distinctions brought up seemed very remote from the experience of reading the poetry.",
    "A satisfying walk through the great Romantic poets. Reading load is extremely reasonable, and Prof. Brisman is a sensitive seminar leader. The material is fantastic. If you enjoyed Wordsworth in 125 and want more, or if you're in love with Milton and are interested in his legacy, take this course.",
    "Great reading list and professor, but the discussion is sometimes a little out there. Windbags become insufferable when discussing this topic. Take it Credit\/D if you don't want to worry about Professor Brisman's exacting grading.",
    "English 250 is a great class to take if you like poetry; if not, it can be fairly difficult. That being said, it's still possible to learn a lot about the subject -- but the material can be challenging and the discussion sections downright intimidating. Still, I feel that I learned a lot from 250, and would certainly recommend it to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who loves English. Even if you do not love poetry in particular, I think this course will give you an appreciation for the tradition of Romantic poetry. Professor Brisman is an incredible professor who will not only guide you through the incredible reading list for this course, but will also challenge your ideas and readings. I have never felt my ideas about a work of literature were pushed and challenged as much as they were in this class. You will be asked not only to give your thoughts on a certain text\/poem\/passage, but asked to consider numerous different possible ways of understanding that text. You will also be asked in at least one of your papers to read and respond to a work of literary criticism written on the subject you are writing about. I had never done that before this course and I really appreciated that Professor Brisman made it a requirement because it helped me push my own ideas\/writing further. If you want to think hard about poetry and like great disucssion--take this course! And if you do take the course make sure you go to meet with Professor Brisman about your papers because he is extremely helpful!",
    "Yes, for all students of English! Necessary class!"
