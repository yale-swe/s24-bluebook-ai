   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would 100% recommend this class to anyone who is interested in history or literature, or anything really. It's a great class that exposes you to a brand new area in Spanish culture.",
    "An intro course to the spanish middle ages. Some difficult readings but also periods of no homework.",
    "A great course to take if you're interested in medieval Spanish literature, especially with regards to Christianity.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! SPAN 327 is a great course to round out your schedule. Not too difficult, great professor, and interesting material. This is one of those rare courses at Yale where you learn a ton without getting stressed or overwhelmed at any point in the semester. Discussions are open and fluid and might verge away from the established topic, which makes the class very student-directed. I appreciated that the assignments gave me a chance to think more about topics that interested me without adding to my stress level. Take home exam truly encapsulates the spirit of the course: some humor, open ended questions, and reflections on central social themes of the Spanish Middle Ages.",
    "I really recommend this course because it is a fascinating subject to study.",
    "This course is an absolutely amazing experience! The workload is very manageable and what your learn is fascinating. Poole is a brilliant lecturer, extremely dedicated to his students, and overall an awesome professor! Anyone who can take an L5 course with him should do so! #longlivethequeen",
    "If you want to take an L5 course in spanish, take this one.",
    "Take it. Poole is great and makes the material very interesting."
