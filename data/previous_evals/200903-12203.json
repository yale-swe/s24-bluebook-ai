    "A course with a lot of potential that falls sadly short of what it could be, Folktales and Fairy Tales is a class that offers a fascinating reading list but not much else.First, it should be noted that a background in literary theory is almost imperative; despite the fact that it's a course about stories, you almost never end up talking about any of the stories you read. It's a huge disappointment, since the tales on the syllabus are fascinating - but class discussion is ALWAYS centered around the critical readings, and if you come into the course without a solid understanding of that, it's extremely frustrating.Your grade is based on participation, three papers, and a presentation. Participation is self-explanatory; the presentation is merely regurgitation of one of the week's readings, and you're allowed to read directly off a sheet of paper, word-for-word. As such, it doesn't really require any deep analysis - or even anything beyond an ability to summarize.The papers are a different story. The first is two to three pages and you're given topic options. On the 5-6 and 10-12 page papers, though, she does not help you at all, despite the fact that the syllabus said she will offer topic suggestions. The guidance is minimal - for instance, you're supposed to include a \"beautiful title page,\" but there are no specifications for what that actually means (and someone DID get penalized for an incorrect title page). The papers are simply so wide open that to me, they didn't do much to further my understanding of topics in the course - simply because I had no idea how to approach the papers and so stuck to a topic I already understood.Professor Kaliambou knows her subject well and is fascinating to listen to. However, she rarely leads discussion beyond asking questions, which was a disappointment (though with a participation grade, I understand why). She is a tough grader as well. She also shows some favoritism toward certain students and some prejudice against others that could make the classroom atmosphere very uncomfortable.With more guidance on assignments, the chance to look at stories and not just scholarly articles, and some help from the professor, this could be a great class. I'd only recommend taking it, however, if you're willing to put up with a lot of frustration for the sake of secondary research on fairy tales (mostly Greek and German). If you don't absolutely adore the subject - it isn't worth it.",
    "I think the strength of this class was in its expansiveness - we covered a huge amount of material and methodologies over the course of the semester. If you are looking to spend a lot of time in class discussing in depth analysis of primary texts, it maybe isn't the course for you, but you will learn so much about the genre of folk and fairy tales, as well as so many ways of thinking about the literature.",
    "Take it if you are interested in fairytales, in learning a lot and being able to develop eloquent arguments. This class leaves you on the path of excellent knowledge towards a good fairytale scholarship",
    "It is a very interesting class and you learn a lot, but be weary of Professor Kaliambou's blunt sense of humor which can be offensive at times. The material is great and you will find that there is an extensive academic field that covers folktales, making you consider what you took for granted in different ways.",
    "I would recommend this course to every student because this is a wonderful field of study that has many aspects most people do not understand. It is so thrilling to discover just how deep a field folklore is.",
    "Don\u0092t be taken in by the course title: this is a course about academia and cultural studies rather than actual fairy tales. In fact, the fairy tales might have just as easily been any other common aspect of European culture. I was somewhat disappointed, as I had been expecting actual discussion of fairy tales, but those who enjoyed reading a great deal of academic essays found the class rewarding. I suppose it depends on your expectations and interests, but I found the course disappointing.",
    "The class sounds great in theory, but it was very focused on apparently unaccepted theories and there was also a strong emphasis on Greek tales (which makes sense, since Prof. Kaliambou is Greek) but I was hoping for more of the Grimms and Perrault and Andersen tales that I am so accustomed to. We did discuss Grimms, but it would have been interesting to see more inter-cultural analysis. Maybe a comparison to the Disney-fied versions of the popular tales. I just didn't connect with the material. It was exactly what I was expecting, based on the course name \"Folktales and Fairy Tales.\"",
    "It is a class that analyzes folktales and fairy tales from various perspectives: historically, anthropologically, psychologically. You really get to see every facet of the folktale, from the basic structure of the fairytale to the effect the genre in modern society.",
    "Yes, quite a lot of fun. We do read theory, it's not all about reading fairy tales. But the theory is quite interesting. Professor Kaliambou is very enthusiastic",
    "Its a pretty interesting class, although some topics are dull, well taught and gives one an opportunity to write about areas of interest",
    "If your interested in fairytales this give a good background to the literary genre. However class is not always interesting and i didnt feel that i learned as much from this class as i expected. it is hard to sustain discussion through the 2 hours of class at times. however the papers are an interesting opportunity to explore folk or fairy tales that interest you.",
    "This is a great course to take because you get to read about fairy tales and folk tales. The readings are wonderful and the theory really changes the way you look at literacy and the genre as a whole. The discussions are often interesting and the papers give you enough freedom to really explore different areas within this topic."
