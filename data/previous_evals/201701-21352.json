    "A great seminar and one of my favorite classes so far at Yale. The topic is super interesting and it always brought out great discussions. I think the seminar format is especially effective for an engaging topic like the female sociopath.",
    "The course could be improved by better spacing of the essays.",
    "It was a well-organized course that explored the female sociopaths through the lens of works from various time periods. It could be improved by spending some more time at the end of the term to sum up various aspects of the subject matter.",
    "I don't think I liked the particular theme of this course. I think there was a level of insensitivity that was difficult to overcome when dealing with different texts and other course material. Lots of material was provided to detail the essentials of writing a paper which definitely aided in the process. I am not sure, though, if I improved in my writing. The class discourse was also a little arbitrary and didn't really seem to reach different conclusions to drive the course forward.",
    "I loved how small the class was. I was able to participate and wasn't scared of it!"

    "Absolutely. Take this class to learn more about female characters I. Literature in an engaging and interesting format. You'll also hopefully be able to improve your writing and analytical abilities.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. Not only is it a wonderful way to improve your writing skills, but it's a fascinating class taught by a talented instructor.",
    "yes!!! The Female Sociopath was so interesting and engaging and I felt like my class really bonded over the course of the semester. I loved reading the course material and having movie screenings.",
    "This course didn't really impact me in either direction. Class was interesting because the topic was interesting.",
    "yes! It was a great class to take freshman year because I learned how to participate."
