    "I think that class is a really necessary class to take for a math major especially, however I think that the course could be at times unclear: if you are on the edge about it, I think a lower class would be a good idea, rather than this class which could be potentially discouraging to a prospective math student.",
    "Take it, but only with Miki, Yu-Wen or Nathan Kaplan. The course review sessions and peer tutors are helpful if you are unable to get these professors - count on those. And make friends in other classes with good professors. That'll get you through this course if anything.",
    "Math 120 is one of those courses you kind of haveto take. My suggestion would be to shop multiple sections. The course is curved (not that strictly though) against all sections, so if you have a better teacher you literally are at an advantage to get an A. Pimenov is not the worst from what I have heard, but he is definitely not the best. I went to a review session with Havlickova, and in a few minutes she was able to explain a concept to me better than I had understood it from multiple classes. So I would make sure to shop all the options, and I'm pretty sure Havlickova is the best. Some students recommend taking ENAS 151 instead; but I think it's more important to just see what you're interested in majoring in before deciding rather than just from hearing from your friends; for instance, I think econ and definitely econ\/math prefer\/require math 120, while engineering majors are better suited for Enas. All in all, math 120 isn't a terrible class, just take it with the right professor.",
    "The material itself is a lot less challenging than the Math 115 material, but there's just SO MUCH of it, especially in the final, that it will be hard to recall all of it, no matter how much you study. Be sure to keep up with the homework and GO TO MARKETA'S REVIEW SESSIONS. She goes straight to the point to the material you need for the exam. Beware: there are a lot of really brilliant people taking the course, so there is basically no curve; grading ended up being on a>90% = A, etc. scale for both midterms.",
    "A hard class, but very interesting. More memorization than conceptual understanding.",
    "Math 120 is more in-depth than the multi you took in high school. Take it unless you really know what you are doing.",
    "Yes, you need the class so you should take it sooner rather than later.",
    "The strength of this class really depends on who teaches your section, so shop a few different ones or at least look at the reviews. There was not much work (probably about 2-3 hours a week) and the material should have been easy, but Slava made it incredibly confusing and hard to conceptualize.",
    "Yes, because it is a necessary math class in order to further the study of such topics. However, be warned that you will be a doing a lot of self teaching.",
    "Multivariable Calculus. You probably have to take it. But I do recommend this course over the ENAS equivalent, you get more out of this course. Math 120 has a problem set due every week, not too much stress."
