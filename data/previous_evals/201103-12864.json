   "comments": [
    "Pretty standard -- you do research, get to know your mentor and lab better, and write a report at the end. Works for me!",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys working in their lab. It just gives you a lot of unstructured time (i.e. the 15 or so hours per week you would have been putting into another class) to go to lab and work on your research.",
    "really amazing if you love what you're researching. it is definitely what you make of it.",
    "Sure!",
    "Good experience! Everyone's experience in the course will be unique, but if you are involved in a project and a lab that you enjoy, then research for credit is great.",
    "You conduct research in a lab. In terms of hourly commitment, it is 10 to 12 per week (or at least that is what is required according to the syllabus), but it is variable depending on what you are doing from week to week.",
    "Research for credit is a great opportunity to do intensive research while getting Yale credit. You go to lab 10 hours\/week. I wish that MCDB would consider including it as part of the senior requirement, as many other majors do for research. Make sure your PI\/grad student knows about the paper in advance and don't leave it until the last minute - scientific research papers take much longer to compose than other research papers, especially if you're writing one for the first time!",
    "MCDB 475 is exactly what it is, research for credit. Your experience depends entirely on your PI. There is not much guidance provided by the MCDB department regarding the expectations for your research, other than that it has to be real research (not chart review or just doing work for someone else) and that you have to spend at least 10 hours a week doing it. The hours and work schedule depend entirely on your project and your lab. Writing up your research methods, results, and discussion in a paper is a good experience, as long as you have adequate guidance from your mentor and you start it well in advance of the deadline, since it's due the last day of classes.",
    "It's research for credit so it largely depends on your lab and PI and what you arrange with them. Final paper at the end but should be fairly manageable although keep in mind it's due at the end of the last week of classes, not reading week."
