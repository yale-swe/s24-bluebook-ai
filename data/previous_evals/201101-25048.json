    "yes.",
    "Yes",
    "The resources for the course were entirely adequate besides the library, which as usual, felt entirely inadequate. Between the short hours, the one book policy, the 24-hour lending policy, and the fact that books are often missing, hard to find, or the library doesn\u0092t own them at all, the Arts Library is lacking in many ways that, at a school of such purportedly high quality, should be absolutely embarrassing.",
    "yes, all was available.",
    "The arts library's terrible circulation policy made it very difficult to do research for the final paper, and resulted in a great deal of money spent on photocopying."
