    "I would recommend the course to another student. I think I've improved in critical thinking, presentation skills, as well as reading primary literature during the course.",
    "This course can give a new PhD student the instructions on how to understand the meaning of a paper and how to develop ideas from existed research. I think it will be helpful for not only the academic life as a PhD student but also the future as a postdoc and professor.",
    "PHAR 502 is definitely a class worth taking. Every week we read primary research article and discuss its credibility as well as its place in the greater picture. It helps students to start thinking like research scientists.",
    "Although this course made my Saturday nights and Sunday mornings very busy, it was very helpful in the long term."

    "This course can give a new PhD student the instructions on how to understand the meaning of a paper and how to develop ideas from existed research. I think it will be helpful for not only the academic life as a PhD student but also the future as a postdoc and professor. In this course, I have a lot of papers to read so it elevates my academic reading. Also, I write a critique after reading some papers about a topic, so it improves my critical thinking and academic writing. All these capabilities mentioned above are important for me to succeed in being a qualified PhD student.",
    "I've gained valuable insight into what data to include within a publication to convey a complete story. I have also gleaned general do's and don'ts of publishing in the fields of neuroscience, structural pharm, and hematology. Through exposure to these fields, I learned about new techniques and concepts, which has helped me gain a more well-rounded scientific perspective. Some of these techniques may be useful in the future in my own research.",
    "Did not really contribute to my research but certainly helped me think and write more critically."
