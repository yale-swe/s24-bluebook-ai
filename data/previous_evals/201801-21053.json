    "This course uses books that state that the student should be able ti use them in a year to be able to understand them. But the whole course meant for a year is compressed into one semester, making it extremely fast-paced and difficult to keep up. But overall it is worth it if you can keep up. Given the time available, it's the best method of learning french.",

    "Absolutely. This course uses the capretz method which according to me is a very effective approach at gaining fluency in French.",
    "Yes, French is a hard language to master. One should memorise each conjugation, pronunciation, complicated grammar, and vocabulary (especially idiomatic expressions that do not have English counterparts). But, this course lets you improve your French skills through diverse ways of training, like presentations, conversations, grammar explanations, and well-organised exams."
