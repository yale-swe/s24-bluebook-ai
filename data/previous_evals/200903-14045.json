   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this course very much. I particularly liked the use of primary journal articles to illustrate the subject matter and the ecological perspective that is not present in other courses I've taken here.",
    "The class was incredibly interesting for me (the EMD-heavy topics) some weeks and incredibly not engaging others (the modeling\/math-heavy lectures).Considering this is an EMD class, I think the focus was too ecology-heavy, as well as too narrow in focus considering how many super interesting vector-borne diseases there are out there. I mean, we didn't even touch the encephalitis diseases or chagas!I really liked the student presentations.The remote sensing lab definitely needs to not be 4 hours-worth of work!The mid-term was very fair and helped me solidify my understanding of VBZD and ecology.To this point, I wish we had slowed down at the beginning of the semester to really ground the entire class in the basics of ecology, vectors, entomology, etc. that are necessary for the rest of the semester.Instead of the weekly brief paragraph overviews of assigned papers, I think that actual question-answer assignments (to make sure the class is all on the same page and getting the basics down) would be helpful pre-midterm. After the midterm, writing up paragraphs on the assigned paperswould be fine then. Better though may be writing up paragraphs on the topic that the final grant proposal assignment will focus on.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but you will likely find it most rewarding. 2-3 readings were due each week with paragraphs, and the mid-term was a lot to study for (especially if you have not taken any related courses before).Strengths:It was really a good crash course on vector diseases and you learn to think broadly about issues in this area and how you would design and carry out a study on these diseases. Very interesting.Weaknesses:Students' presentations varied in quality and there was not a lot of time for class discussion due to the packed syllabus each week.GIS and remote sensing labs should have been longer to give a better grounding, instead of just one week each.",
    "The subject matter was really interesting, and addressed topics that are underrepresented in other EPH classes. It would've been better to offer it second semester, because the material was rather challenging, and there was a heavy emphasis on methods, which were completely new to the first year students. A textbook would've been a very useful supplement to the concepts presented in lecture.",
    "The course was great. I learned a lot but it was quite challenging as a first year student. The information in this course is quite specialized, and much better suited to someone with an adequate background in the field. However, even as a first-year student with no experience in this field, I really enjoyed the course and felt that I learned a great deal.",
    "The course is designed for second year students who have already completed most of the core course work. However, I found the topic interesting and decided to take it as a first year student and probably ended up being more work for me then others. The class required me to do more background research to grasp the class concept.",
    "Good course on the basic concepts in understanding the epidemiology on vector borne disease."

    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Professor Diuk-Wasser is a wonderful teacher. Although the lectures and assignments were at times a bit disorganized, I came away with a clear knowledge of the subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Like any first-time taught class, there are likely to be bumps along the way. Maria is exceptionally passionate about her work and has A LOT to teach. She just needs to slow down, ESPECIALLY at the beginning when we are learning the basics that will set us up for success or failure all semester. Slowing down at the beginning would also help some of the difficulty I had the first few weeks in understanding her.I really appreciated the feedback she supplied throughout the semester though (e.g., in preparing for both the midterm and planning the final project). I just wish she had been more clear about her expectations of us for the final grant proposal project. The scope of project changed scale significantly, which made my group throw out our original idea entirely.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Maria's really nice professor, and extremely approachable. My only advice is to go to her as soon as you have any doubts or need for clarification, and don't wait till you are totally lost in class.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0The instructor was great. She makes herself available to her students and takes a keen interest in their success. It would be good in the future in slides could be posted before class.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Maria is a very knowledgeable professor in this area of research. She really wanted us to learn the breath and depth of the research field so the class included an excellent mix of scientific journal articles, group projects and labs to help grasp an understanding of the material."

    "Jennifer was a great TA. She remained very approachable for questions and reviewing of material outside of class time. She was able to help work through concepts and ideas.",

    "This course summarizes the current theory on and studies designed to research the ecological determinants of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases.",
    "With some refining, this is a great overview class of vector borne and zoonotic diseases. First year EMD students without some substantial exposure to the topic beforehand need not register without taking Melinda Pettigrew's course.The assigned papers, in general, are quite interesting and definitely *should* be read prior to class.If you have specific VBZD interests, there is a place for you in this class to explore those interests.",
    "Yes, if you have an interest to learn about vector diseases and research methods. This is also a pretty easy class when it comes to grading (although you do have to put in that extra ounce of work for mid-term).",
    "Definitely recommend the course if you are interested in disease ecology and zoonotic disease. Course is heavily biased towards vector borne diseases.",
    "I would tell another student that this is an excellent course if you are interested in pursuing research in vector borne and zoonotic diseases. However, it is probably not the best course for students who are not greatly interested in the field or who haven't any experience in the area.",
    "This course very relevant to the spread of diseases however it might be received better by second year students.",
    "The use of GIS and Remote sensing as part of the learning process was good.It was nice and straight forward enough for people without that background."
