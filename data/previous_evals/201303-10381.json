    "Czech 110 is a low-key class that's great for people who are either legitimately interested in the language or people who aren't particularly adept at picking up languages and are looking for an approachable class.",
    "The class gives you so much information about a new and very different language, but at the same time, it doesn't bombard you with an unbearable workload. Professor von Kunes is brilliant and kind. Take this class!",
    "Only if you actually want to learn Czech.",
    "To another student I would summarize Czech 110 01 as a rigorous yet manageable entry point into Czech language and literature. I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning Czech or even to students interested in learning Russian or other Slavic languages, as Czech provides a phenomenal foundation for them."
