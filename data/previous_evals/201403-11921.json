    "Yeah I would recommend it if you need a language credit. Margherita is great; you will definitely enjoy her class. Having class five days a week is not that bad because the homework does not take that long.",
    "SPAN 110 was an enjoyable and intense experience for me. As someone who has never studied spanish before, I found the pace of the class a bit too fast for me but I was able to catch up soon enough! I wanted to learn a new language and I'm happy I decided on spanish because I found that I have learnt much more spanish in these 4 months than my friends who have studied it in high school for a year!",
    "SPAN 110 is an amazing class. Take it! It really helps strengthen your Spanish skills!",
    "Fast-moving intro course. You will learn a lot in 3 months."
