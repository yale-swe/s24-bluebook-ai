    "A great way to do the research you want to do and learn about something that you're really interested in. I recommend this if you have a project that you want to work on and advisor that wants to work with you on it.",
    "Having had no research experience, I was very wary of dedicating a year to research, but it was a fabulous experience! I was so grateful to the kindness and patience of those in my lab, and in spite of the numerous frustrations research entails, I feel I learned so much from trying so hard to succeed. I really felt like this incorporated everything I'd learned throughout my years in EEB. The senior symposium was a wonderful culmination. Don't be afraid to get a BS - do research!",
    "It is great and allows you to pursue your passion, whatever that may be! Very rewarding, albeit time consuming :)",
    "It is independent research (10 hours a week) for the EEB major. The experience obviously depends on what lab you're working in, but I recommend it.",
    "Definitely"
