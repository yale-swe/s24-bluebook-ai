    "This is a great class that teaches you how to effectively propose a global health intervention in a powerpoint presentation and in a strategy brief. It's quite a bit of work but definitely worth it.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. At times it did seem like a lot of work, and the presentation was probably the most stressful thing I have had to do this semester, but looking back it definitely is one of the most usefulclasses I have taken at Yale. It's very practical and I will always use the lessons I've learned from this class when making a presentation or working in a group in my life.You will never look at a powerpoint the same way again (in a good way)",
    "Do it! Incredible real-world advice about how to do policy, really solid insights about how to think critically and do problem solving, very interesting material in global health field, lots of great guest speakers, and a teaching team that really cares about you and wants to see you do well. It's not as hard as everyone makes it out to be; there's a group project which can get pretty crazy, but just keep it in control with your group and all will be well. Also don't be scared if you have no experience in global health; this course also provides a great introduction to the field.",
    "This class provides a framework for solving large problems that people face in the real world. Much of the course is focused on learning concrete steps in a particular method of solving problems that the professors wish to teach. I would definitely recommend this class. Especially for someone who wants to work in politics or public policy, this class teaches great skills for interacting in collaborative, problem-solving situations.",
    "STGH is a practical (NOT theoretical) course in developing strategies that effectively address issues in global health, according to Prof. Bradley's 7-step model. If you understand that this is going to be a semester of learning how this 7-step model works, interspersed with a range of interesting lectures by fascinating people in the field of global health, then you will absolutely love this course. If you are looking for a highly academic, theoretical, and rigorous discussion of various issues in global health, you will most likely be disappointed. So choose wisely according to your interests.Another great strength of this course is your classmates - the 30 people from Yale College and YSPH (+ some from SOM and African Studies, IR, etc) bring an incredible diversity of viewpoints to the class. Further, because most everyone is engaged in the material and chosen by the professors for their unique experiences and interests, the classmates are an incredible part of the experience.",
    "Take this class! The professors, TA, assignments, and students are all great!",
    "Great class! Very practical and relevant to global health policy.",
    "I would take this class if you want to learn practical skills. That being said, be prepared to know a great deal about public\/global health first. If you're iffy\/uncertain about being involved in this area, then this is not the class for you. The instructors and TA assume that you already have a strong basis for general public health knowledge--from the policy side of things.",
    "This a very unique course at Yale in that it teaches you some very practical skills that should be useful even beyond the field of global health. While challenging, the course is definitely manageable. Be aware that the final group project will require a significant investment of time.",
    "If you get into the course, then you should definitely take it.",
    "Manageable, but certainly challenging. If you're an undergraduate with little to no public health \/ global health background, you will feel out of your league sometimes. But at the same time, the course is pretty interdisciplinary and students with a wide range of backgrounds (medical, social, quantitative, organizational, political) will each have something to contribute. With some hard work I\u0092ve held my own and done quite well. In general it\u0092s a great course and I really appreciated the level of sophistication and professionalism. It\u0092s an excellent alternative for those who want to study strategy and leadership but prefer a flavor different from Grand Strategy."
