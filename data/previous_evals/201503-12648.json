    "Even if you're not crazy into US politics\/elections or a \"hack,\" if you're interested in the topic and really do want to learn more about the way democracy works (or doesn't) in the US, this is a great class! Professor Hersh is a homie.",
    "This is a good course for anyone interested in an academic analysis of elections. This class will not teach you how to manage a campaign. Rather, you will learn about things like nominations, voter turnout, and campaign finance from a theoretical perspective. Professor Hersh was great each week; the articles he chose and questions he asked were very interesting. The big thing in this class is the paper. Start early on this, or it will be hard to do well in this seminar.",
    "Interesting and fun class. I would recommend some level of r or Stata experience because there is a 30 page final paper that involves data analysis."
