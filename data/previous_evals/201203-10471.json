    "Very useful course. Yes, definitely",
    "basic overview of crystal structure, and models for the behavior of crystal (e.g. how do their electrons behave, how do the atomic nuclei behave, how do the two interact). then some device physics.",
    "I would recommend this course anyone who thinks he needs to learn physics with its beauty with not much mathematics.",
    "The course provides a nice approach to the topics at hand. It covers most of the required introduction to the subject and the examinations are appropriate for those who are not directly in the field. I would recommend this subject because it covers interesting topics at a level that any engineer\/scientist could study to broaden their knowledge.",
    "Most interested students would find this course useful, if not directly applicable, to something they have encountered or may encounter in the future. The course introduces a student to crystal structure, bonding, periodic potentials in crystals, thermal and electronic properties, phonons, metals, semiconductors, and devices. In some ways it is a survey course, but much basic physics is covered. Therefore, information can be gleaned by students from many backgrounds.",
    "I think this was an excellent class.",
    "Absolutely, NOT for anyone. Not without a restructuring of the class.",
    "very useful must to take for a person working in Condensed matter physics"

    "I now under why metals conduct heat and electricity and how few of the many semiconductors work. This course isn't quite related to what I have started at Yale, but I wanted to learn the way physicists think and I think Prof. Henrich was the best person to learn that (just from his class, I have never had any informal help sessions with him).",
    "I work with metals. It does answer the fundamental aspects of my research\/discipline, but it does not relate directly. I don't think I will study my samples at liquid He temperature, but I am genuinely interested in the topics the course has to offer. It is overall a tangent to what my research, but within the area I would like to explore.",
    "Much of the material in this course was useful, and some directly applicable, to my research. I would say, however, that the majority was just simply a good foundation to have learned\/strengthened.",
    "I found this course to provide the information I had hoped to gain from it.",
    "IT DID NOT WHATSOEVER. I THINK I KNEW MUCH MORE WALKING INTO IT THAN COMING OUT OF IT. Incredibly horrible experience. The worst class I've ever taken in my academic career and I felt so unable to make it different. There was no help given.",
