    "SPAN L3 is significantly more manageable than L1 and L2. Although it is mostly recap of the previous semesters, you will feel much more comfortable in Spanish by the end of the course.",
    "Not too bad if you took L2. Expect a lot of review, really you're just expected to improve using the grammar, vocab, etc. that you already know.",
    "I would recommend it to complete the language requirement.",
    "Only if you REALLY want to learn Spanish would I recommend this course. Otherwise you are wasting your own time and the instructor's time. It's likely that if you are here, you are attempting fulfill Yale's extraordinarily intensive foreign language requirement and you will be frustrated by the way it blocks you from taking an awesome 50 minute lecture at some point in the morning. Luckily, there is no final exam, and it is a way better and more fun course than Spanish 120.!",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Prof Reymundi is a quality professor. She is unbelievably helpful if you seek out her guidance. She is a fair grader. And in class every day she strikes a nice balance between seriousness and playfulness. This is my final Spanish course (yay). I'm glad I took her class.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking SPAN 130. It was a fantastic class. I really enjoyed it."
