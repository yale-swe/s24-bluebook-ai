   "comments": [
    "You cover a lot of material on the nature of rights, what it means to live the good life, citizenship, borders and concerns about culture. TAKE THIS CLASS CREDIT-D unless you love writing philosophy papers.",
    "It's a bit heavier on the political philosophy than I expected it to be - if you're into that, you'll like this course. If not, you'll find it difficult.",
    "No doubts. Solid in both its political and philosophical elements. If you have any interest in immigration, evolving definitions of citizenship, or distributive justice, it's essential.",
    "Borders, Culture and Citizenship is a good class, although I do wish we applied the theory more to practical situations. We probed about the meaning of borders and citizenship a lot, but I think we could have benefited more from seeing how this actually works in other countries and maybe writing a final paper on a specific country.",
    "I would recommend it, especially if the TFs change (the other might be fine, I don't know). It was a really interesting course although I found that I lost interest as time went on and the course became less theoretical. For someone less interested in the theoretical, though, it will be more interesting. I think this was a good class. Definitely recommend.",
    "This course presents an interesting thematic progression from a historical understanding of citizenship to modern immigration issues. The class is organized as: one third historical works, one third modern philosophical analysis, and one third legal and modern applications of immigration issues. Weekly section for this class allows branching out into more specific analysis of the detailed texts we read. The reading is advanced and thought-provoking. Especially early in the course be prepared for a substantial amount of reading every week.",
    "This class is heavy in reading, and the lecture component was lacking. Prof. Benhabib clearly has very interesting ideas about the texts, but that was masked by her reading from the Powerpoint slides and summaries of the text. I feel as if I learned very little from reading her lectures -- rarely did she add anything beyond a simplistic summary and critique of the texts we read in class. I got very little out of Seyla Benhabib throughout the course of the semester.With that said, the readings, especially the first two-thirds of the course, are great. Take this class only after an intro political philosophy course, but you'll still get a lot out of reading the classics, and also the contemporary works, especially if you have a good section leader. My section leader was what saved the class for me; otherwise, I think I would have dropped it half-way through.",
    "This class is very philosophy heavy. I came to expecting the class to be focused on immigration politics and policy, but instead found out that the approach was quite different. To some extent, I was a bit disappointed that the class was structured this way, because in my opinion many of the texts deal with philosophical scenarios that were highly unrealistic and not worth bringing up in contemporary debates. That said, if you ware interested in questioning the issue of what makes up a citizen, what defines a border, etc. then this is the class for you. Personally, I don't find such questions exciting, but if you do, then take this class.",
    "This is a great class that has a good balance of theory and empirical readings. It touches on very interesting issues and gives a wide range of perspectives on controversial questions on immigration and cosmopolitanism.",
    "I would NOT recommend this course. All it is is a playground for DS douches to show off the big words and dead white men they know. It's pretty much entirely based on theory and philosophy as opposed to current border and immigration issues. This is not the course to take if you want to learn about borders, culture, and citizenship. It's the course to take if you want a forum to intellectually masturbate and give yourself big pats on the back in view of others. This basically ruined my semester, and it's scared me away from future political science courses. Stay away.",
    "It's buzzword-beware course title, but the class packs a fair amount of substance. It's a somewhat awkward blend of a month of classical political philosophy, a month of contemporary liberal nationalism (with a sprinkling of communitarianism), and a few weeks of discussion over minority communities and national culture, but it all ties together a little bit better than you'd think.The students in the class, as reflects the last two months of readings, are center-left and over, and any claims for borders and local cultures generally were treated as an amorphous counterweight to the project of articulating a liberal position of somewhat open borders. That said, and to those to whom that appeals, the class waded through interesting and rigorous arguments on that topic.",
    "Definitely if you're interested in the material. Expect to work for it, although only 3 papers and section is very doable. Reading is A LOT, but worth it, if you make\/have the time for it. Do it if interested only. Lectures can seem dry."
