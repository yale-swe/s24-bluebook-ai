    "Yes.",
    "Good",
    "This course is an overview of two areas of informatics, both clinical and biological\/translational. The clinical informatics part of the course is well suited to students who are interested in designing computing systems for clinical medicine. The translational\/biological informatics part of the course is a terrific overview of systems involved in evaluating \"omics\" data, which is well suited to students who are interested in translational research, e.g. in genomic medicine.",
    "Yes",
    "CBB740 is an overview course describing the pertinent aspects of bioinformatics. It is divided into to major areas, clinical bioinformatics (electronic health records and barriers of instituting efficient and effective EHRs for both health care and research purposes), and the basics of translation bioinformatics, with an introduction to high-throughput data analysis.",
    "This course is pretty good for getting a good sense of a bit of the medical side of CBB. However, since one's research may not necessarily touch on these things, this course may at times feel like a drag. Nevertheless, you do learn a lot from this course, so it is still a valuable experience, especially for the field trips.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course.This is a good course to know the knowledge and research in clinical and translational area.",
    "I would say that it's exactly the kind of class you'd expect for a CBB core class, and since it is a core class, CBB students should probably take it."

   "comments": [
    "Good",
    "The translational informatics part of the course was more relevant for my research.",
    "Very helpful especially the \"omics\" part.",
    "I wish more time was spent on translation bioinformatics as this would contribute more to my research.",
    "This course was good for the perspective, but it remains to be seen if this will make any contribution to my intended line of research.",
    "My major is CBB. This course is very closely related to my research. It is very helpful.",
    "I think a lot of the computational tools discussed will come in handy down the road, and in a more abstract sense, having some idea how the medical world works will probably help with some of my research."
