   "comments": [
    "Definitely yes! Take this especially if you are interested in history, as this class is very different than the lecture on Environmental Politics and Law. This course looks at historical trends throughout the 1970s, and is interesting and well-taught. Professor Sabin is very helpful, and your writing skills will definitely improve. Very highly recommend. Excellent junior seminar, especially because there were only 8 students in the class, so everyone participated and made the class move quickly.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in environmental law history. However, this class has a lot of reading and takes a lot of time.",
    "EVST 301 is really great if you're interested in studying the birth of the environmental movement. Just be aware that this is a very concentrated topic--you will really only study the one decade the whole semester. Overall I really enjoyed this course--Sabin is great!",
    "This was the first year the course was being taught, and it could use some work. As you might guess from the title, the subject material is extremely narrow. I felt that there wasn't really enough there for an entire reading-intensive semester. This year, the class was really small, so discussion was tepid and didn't go anywhere. Part of this was that Professor Sabin didn't seem to do much to prepare for discussion. In contrast to that, he's phenomenal as a reader and advisor of research papers. Start early, and find something that seems really interesting and important to you."
