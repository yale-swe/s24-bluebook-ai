    "Literally nothing",
    "lol. i guess i memorized 350+ flashcards for a final that contained only 12 building IDs. so, i got better at rote memorization.",
    "Good overview of recent history of architecture, but it was very euro-centric.",
    "Learned a bit about modern architecture. The lectures were mostly enjoyable.",
    "I learned so much from Craig and Eeva-Lisa. Before this course, I didn't take much heed of architecture or the space around me, but this class taught me how to analyze buildings and read them as texts.",
    "Looked at images.",
    "In this course I learnt about important movements in architecture and famous architects and their contribution to architecture. I learnt about architecture during different time periods and in different countries, which stimulated comparing different types of architecture. This course covered a wholistic image of architecture's progress in the last three centuries. It consisted of a lot of important and interesting facts that helped understand the main principles of architecture."

   "comments": [
    "Terrible course. It's just about white male architecture and how gr8 it is. Could be improved by replacing it with the \"Expanding the Canon\" course.",
    "this is a weaknesses of all courses in the yale school of architecture; they cling to the canon like its the only body of work that gives architecture value. this class was so yikes when it was whitewashed histories of the creation of suburbs, histories of imperialism, the atrocities of ww2. Also eek @ there being only 1 non-male architect featured, with their own slides, not in relation to a man.",
    "Both the midterm and final were originally scheduled for the day after the junior studio reviews... in a class that is required for junior architecture majors. The professors were very nice about it and pushed the final exam forward, but the midterm was a disaster as a result. The only two required courses for architecture juniors should coordinate!",
    "Course strengths were definitely the professors, as Craig and Eeva-Lisa are both expert lecturers. Weaknesses were the sections, which were often disorganized.",
    "The strengths of this course are: the the way the material was conveyed; it was constantly changing and interesting; it was never boring. Secondly, the amount of knowledge one gains from taking this class, about both architecture and other historical events was incredible. One weakness of this course however, was how fast material was taught, I would have preferred to take more time to learn about specific topics in depth instead of learning many small topics. One big weakness was having to know the year each building was built (up to two years of accuracy), that was just incredibly inefficient and hard. With the number of buildings in the lecture slides, and the short time that we had to both study the material and answer the question, that was certainly difficult. One more weakness was changing the date of the second midterm or final from before reading period to finals week. It was really hard to write a 12 page paper that counts for 40% of the final grade and study for a final only for one course (specially when you have two or three other finals). The syllabus and the prompts for the essays were not as clear; it was a great course (and has the potential to be even greater) but needs to be more organized.",
    "Loved this class -- i thought lectures were great, material was interesting, and assignments were fair and helped me learn. I especially loved the short writing exercises. The final paper seemed a bit excessive given the final exam as well. I almost wish this had been taught as more of a seminar (or at least in a smaller room). The days that we did have a bit of discussion were definitely my favorite, and I think this class could be far more engaging as a more interactive class. It was a shame that attendance was often so bad, because I really thought the material and lectures were fascinating."

   "comments": [
    "Would absolutely not recommend. Even if it's required, try to get out of it.",
    "no. take this if you are required to, but otherwise avoid. they're practicing some real revisionist history and erasure in this class.",
    "If you're an architecture major, then the course is required. I think the lectures are fairly interesting, but your experience in the class will depend on your TF.",
    "Interesting enough for an architecture history requirement.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It can be conceptually challenging, and the workload is a bit more than other introductory art history courses, but it's worth it. The lectures are inspiring and you'll walk away from each class feeling like you've gained something. I learned how to speak the language of architecture, which is a good skill to have.",
    "Do not take this course if you are interested in learning about the history of architecture. Sure, you'll get to sit through class and see slides with old pictures of buildings (often with incorrect spellings and dates) and hear about the movements they were part of, if you can keep up with them going through greater than or equal to 50 slides in a fifty minute lecture that often goes overtime by 10 minutes. They also expect you to do 4 500 word architectural analyses (when are they due? who knows), a 12 page final paper (of just text), a midterm, and final exam. For the exams, you're expected to memorize all the buildings covered in lecture, their architects, the year built (+\/- 2 years), and their location. For the first midterm you had to do 18 slide decks worth of information; for the second, you get a bit of a break with only 8 slide decks worth of information. In addition, the course is incredibly disorganized, with assignments being pushed back weeks and having several assignments back to back, after we had long completed those topics. We would also be unsure of when we would receive the prompts or the resources needed to complete the prompts, as they aren't in the syllabus. You can get the assignment on Sunday evening or Monday morning, which is fine if the assignment is due the next week, but it's more likely that it'll be due in your Tuesday\/Thursday\/Friday section that week, which is completely unreasonable. This is not the best way to learn about the history of architecture, and only covers the standard canon, and there are much better ways to learn.",
    "Yes, if a student is interested in architecture I would highly recommend this class, it is a great and rich introduction to architecture.",
    "Yes! Craig and Eeva-Lisa are great lecturers and the material is definitely interesting. Workload is very doable, with 5 short papers, a midterm, final, and final paper."
