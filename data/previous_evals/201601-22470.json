   "comments": [
    "Summary: Great intro to behavioral finance, but not a course if you don't understand basic elements of finance -interest rates, equity premium, the concept of valuation, stocks, etc.",
    "Incredible experience. Amazing overview of the behavioral finance taught by a true master of the field. The material can be complicated at time but is thoroughly interesting. Accessible to College students if properly motivated. With three assignment and a final, the workload isn't terrible, but you get out what you put in on that front. Excellent course overall. Highly recommend!",
    "This course is important for young scholars to take early in their education to understand the myriad of assumptions being made in the rational, frictionless framework. The focus on models is what makes this course special as compared to behavioral courses offered in other programs.",
    "Any student interested in finance (either as an academic or a practitioner) would benefit tremendously from this course. If you have taken a course on classical finance and the EMH, this course will be a great complement.",
    "This is a fantastic course for anyone interested in finance or behavioral economics or, ideally, both. The focus is on intuition and understanding the main ideas and the big picture, rather than on the mathematical details.",
    "Highly recommend. You not only get familiar with behavioral finance theory, but also learn many facts in finance.",
    "yes",
    "It's a good class because it connects AP\/CF\/HH finance, introduced many facts and applied BF to each field. It serves as a review for the past classes and offers a new perspective as well.",
    "Anyone interested in either behavioral or financial economics."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It greatly improved my knowledge of the discipline of behavioral finance and although I probably won't use much of the material in traditional finance, its the kind of course that makes you question the basic assumptions we make about the markets.",
    "I am not interested in pursuing academic research, so I'm not sure how relevant this question would be for me. I am interested in fundamental discretionary investing, but I did find many of the topics in class to be highly relevant to my understanding of investor psychology and the dynamics of the market as a whole. I definitely feel like I have a deeper understanding of asset pricing, investor behavior, and corporate finance than I did before. And in that sense, it was a great success!",
    "After taking this course, I feel that I have a clear understanding of the entire roadmap of asset pricing, whether it be behavioral, rational, or frictional. Now, when I read (any) paper, I know how to place them in the field and how to compare them by the assumptions they carry. Specifically, when looking at the myriad of results return extrapolation can explain, I now realize how limited the habit, long run risk, and disaster models are.",
    "Coming in, I knew some finance and some behavioral economics, but I had never considered the two together, and did not even know that behavioral finance was such a big field. This course made me aware of a number of areas of future research.",
    "As a economics student, this course gives me a broad picture about asset pricing and behavioral finance. Not only did I gain some knowledge in finance, but got some sense how to do good research.",
    "it introduced me to a new field that potentially complements research at my home department",
    "The course definitely contributed tremendously to my research because when covering a specific topic, the instructor would first review the literature in the field and point out the questions left to be answered, so I generated many thoughts\/ideas from the class."
