   "comments": [
    "We gained an intensive knowledge of phonetics, from acoustics to sociophonetics and everything in between. I now know how to use a variety of online phonetics programs, such as Praat and MatLab, and got to work with real people in real time, analyzing speech in an array of languages.",
    "This course gave me a deep understanding of phonetics. Whereas LING 110 might be a broad survey of linguistic concepts, LING 220 really dove deep into phonetics and incorporated current research\/questions that are still being answered today.",
    "Great course on the methods and theories behind phonetic research. Thought students more than the material thought how that material is gathered experimentally.",
    "I learned a lot about human speech sounds, but I also learned a ton about the scientific method and research--that was an unexpected, but excellent, facet of the course.",
    "In addition to the course content (phonetics), this course was also my first exposure to Matlab and Praat. I gained experience learning how to write phonetics\/linguistics papers and now feel more comfortable researching and reading papers on phonetics and related topics in linguistics that may interest me, such as language documentation and dialect variation.",
    "I learned about the basics of phonetics and how to write in the International Phonetic Alphabet.",
    "A sense of the breadth and interest and applicability of phonetics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course was how widespread yet intense the curriculum was. We learned a lot in a condensed period of time and got to implement our knowledge through labs, in-class quizes, and our epic final project. The class could be improved by having more in-class listening quizes because those quizes were excellent training for actualy phonetics field work.",
    "This course is not for non-linguistics majors or people with no prior linguistics experience; the material is interesting but a lot of effort is required to keep up and complete the relatively heavy workload.",
    "Great and engaging course but the workload was too instense for an undergraduate course. The amount of work required for labs and other assignments was extreme in some cases and actually made it more difficult to critically engage with the content due to the fact that it needed to be done quickly and without much reflection if it were to be completed on time.",
    "This course was quite a bit of work--most of it was worthwhile, but I thought several assignments were a bit longer than they needed to be (a lab involving the transcription of Icelandic consonants comes to mind). A major strength of this course was the final project and the labs, which really helped me get a feel for how phonetics is actually *done.* That said, science credit would be nice!",
    "Strengths: Good use of combined lecture and section times; labs were easy to understand and helpful; homeworks\/labs\/midterms\/lecture\/section were all very nicely integrated and made sense in the order and arrangement of topics and assignments. Things to improve: Lecture often felt boring even though the content was interesting. I often found myself drifting off when multiple slides in a row were on some study or another and the thread of the main point got lost in the discussion of nitty gritty details. Perhaps try to condense those parts of lectures (or hand out a worksheet on the study as a case study to discuss in class separate from the lecture) Assign the final paper earlier; we can learn the necessary content along the way but if I had read the example papers and been given some guidance as to finding a language and starting recordings a couple weeks earlier that would have been helpful. Give one week to complete lab assignments instead of one weekend.",
    "I think that this course overall had very interesting material and helped me get a good insight into the different areas in Phonetics, but there was a very clear disconnect between the material learned in class and the standards expected of students for assignments and exams. In addition, there were no assignments the second half of the course (and after the drop date), so there was little to no room for improvement, which was a bit frustrating.",
    "There was not enough time to do the assignments which were all very time intensive.",
    "Super comprehensive and interesting material, readings could have been a bit better integrated into lecture"

    "Phonetics is a fascinating subject, so take it if only for that. It was rigorous and difficult but intellectually engaging throughout the entire semester. Looking back, there wasn't a single topic we covered that wasn't interesting in some regards. It moves fast, but if you're interested in a somewhat niche but also incredibly applicable knowledge base, take it.",
    "Yes! Highly recommend it to anyone interested in language or psychology.",
    "Absolutely if you like speech! It's fascinating. Be prepared to do real *science.*",
    "Yes, if they are interested in the linguistics major. I would primarily recommend the course based on the final project, which was one of the more rewarding and interesting parts of the course.",
    "This class was really hard. Super interesting topic, but has a lot of work and be prepared to learn a lot on your own as well.",
    "Yes, I loved the material"
