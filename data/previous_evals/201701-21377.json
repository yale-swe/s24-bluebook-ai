   "comments": [
    "This course definitely helped me develop my ability to analyze fiction and different writing styles tremendously. Also, my ability to formulate an essay in general was largely improved even just from three assignments.",
    "This course helped with developing my close reading skills and my ability to analyze literature with regard to historical context. Reading books by authors who were all of different backgrounds and time periods but who were all American and discussing what qualities characterize \"American Literature\" was very interesting and new to me.",
    "I received very substantive feedback on papers. While there are definitely courses more focused on improving student writing (114, 120), for a literature-heavy course, there were many opportunities to work through drafts with Palmer, and his comments are some of the most thorough and helpful I have ever received. Additionally, I developed a better framework for appreciating and contextualizing different American authors. We read a very nice collection of works, and I appreciated how an introductory American literature course did not simply rehash the high school classics (To Kill A Mockingbird, Great Gatsby, etc.). Whitman, Dickinson, Faulkner, and Moby Dick were obvious concessions to those \"big-name\" works, but we also read interesting, lesser-known books such as Winesberg, Ohio and The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, which I found to be important and insightful. The addition of Claudia Rankine - a current faculty member - was great fun, as well. Any seminar lead by a good instructor - and Palmer is a great instructor - will help you develop your critical thinking and your ability to express ideas concisely and cogently. Palmer is very receptive of student ideas, and this aids in developing our ability to express ourselves well.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really think this course followed through on its goals. Writing about great literature became a more approachable task, and we read and thoroughly analyzed challenging works. Class was never boring, and I would definitely recommend it. It expanded my view of what American literature is and could be. The reading list is a very exciting reason to consider an American literature course at Yale, even if you've been reading American literature for all of high school. Some food for thought for the 127 team - not just for my instructor - would be ways to incorporate lessons from the books into present day. We read books from all over the country, and contextualizing their lessons to present day - how do we relate to those sympathetic to the Confederate flag? (Faulkner), how do we address disillusioned workers in poor towns? (Sherwood Anderson) - are questions implicitly raised by books we read, and we tackled them as literary questions, but I think taking a step back and discussing them as pressing real-world concerns would be great. This could take the form of gathering the 127 sections together once or twice for guest speakers, or just short lectures by the instructor, etc.",
    "Strengths: Read lots of great books, really good job of analyzing certain sections of the books that instructor deems important, interesting discussions Weaknesses: Sometimes we didn't really discuss aspects of the texts that seem interesting or ready to be analyzed, instead focused too much on seemingly-random sections. Could use more concrete feedback on papers go to office hours to help with this"

   "comments": [
    "If you enjoy reading fiction, then you should definitely take this course. I enjoyed the seminar; the 75 minutes went by pretty fast.",
    "I think I would recommend this to another student if they were interested in reading some classics of American literature but unsure of how to tackle them without guidance.",
    "I definitely would recommend ENGL 127, if you are interested in the subject matter and seminar-based nature of the course. Any literature seminar will be more focused on student ideas and discussion, whereas a lecture will focus on prevailing critical readings. It really depends what you want. Palmer did a good job of incorporating the two, but this will always be an inevitable distinction to make. If you want a seminar environment, definitely give this course some thought.",
    "Yes, but make sure to go to office hours to get more feedback on your writing, otherwise it's hard to know what to change or how to improve."
