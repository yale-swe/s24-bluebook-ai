   "comments": [
    "You should take this class if you would like to learn more about Roman culture (and history!) in a thorough fashion. This was a great humanities class.",
    "A very interesting class, whether you are a seasoned Classics major or totally new to the Romans. The literature we read from the ancient world sheds light on many facets of Roman life, culture, and religion, and the lectures deepen that knowledge with interesting discussions. Overall would highly recommend.",
    "Don't expect much critical engagement -- a genuine introduction to elements of Roman culture at the most basic level. Not always easy to focus in lectures: facts are often recited without much effort to connect them through meaningful analysis. The themes are a bit broad (e.g. \"Lect. 15: Women\"). Very little work. Professor Lenski is great, though.",
    "Would recommend for people with little or no knowledge of Roman culture.",
    "This class reads a lot of Roman literature (in translation) and does some social history. If you want a heavy-duty roman history course you are probably better off with the republic and empire sequence; if you're taking it for the major it's probably better to take it earlier, or the methods (if not the content) will feel a little like review. But Professor Lenski is really great, and Noreen was a terrific TA!",
    "A relatively laid back, but enjoyable survey of Roman civilization (mostly late Republic and Empire). The work is quite manageable, with readings mostly in primary sources, which provide some of the best inputs into Roman civilization\/culture. There were many fun and unexpected elements addressed over the course of the semester, ranging from government to Roman sexuality. There were also several (quite entertaining) reenactments, like a bit of a Roman play, a Roman Wedding, and Roman cooking at the Yale farm. Overall an informative, interesting, and entertaining class with a professor who knows almost everything there is to know about the subject."
