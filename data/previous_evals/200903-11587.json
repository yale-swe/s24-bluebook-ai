   "comments": [
    "It's challenging- you read a lot and write a lot. But it's also a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Based on my experience in this class, I would recommend section with Professor Levin to a student who prefers a forum where students mostly express their own ideas to one in which the professor provides significant guidance for discussion. I would have preferred slightly more guidance myself, but it seems to be a matter of personal preference, and Professor Levin is certainly attentive and personable and willing to discuss papers and such with students who are interested in her help.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Fast-paced overview of the first few millenia of the western canon. Good if you want a VERY general overview (i.e. the entire Bible only got 2 weeks worth of study). The majority of the lectures contributed NOTHING to the understanding of the average student who is new to the material, but were extremely esoteric and tangential--clearly written for the benefit of colleagues rather than students.",
    "I would recommend this class for those who are willing to read a lot, and also are capable of figuring out when it's okay to skim, skip, or sparknote, saving the full assignment for a later time if necessary. Though the reading is mostly manageable, there will definitely be times when you're swamped. That's ok. You can always come back to it later in preparation for the exam.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Levin cooked up a mean section twice a week. My biggest regret was missing Luke's Gospel for swine flu.",
    "Directed Studies is really not as hard as everyone says it is. If you do the reading over the weekend and write a rough draft of your papers by Tuesday, you can go out Wednesday or Thursday for sure. The literature section was definitely one of the better sections in Directed Studies. I think most students are better prepared for writing literature papers than they are for writing the H& P or Philosophy papers. If you take DS (and you should, but don't expect to get a deep education on the western canon, it's pretty basic, but still important and interesting), you should try to meet with your professors about your papers. You should also be prepared to do a lot of the analysis on your own to get a lot out of the books. There isn't enough time in class to discuss everything (obviously), but the books are amazing and taking reading notes and reading essays online supplements your sections nicely.Also, Jane Levin is absolutely fantastic. Not only is she brilliant, she is also approachable. If you have an opportunity to be in this section, it will really help make the literature come to life. (Oh, she's also really funny and loves making rock music references!)",
    "I loved DS Lit and HIGHLY recommend Professor Levin's section. She's brilliant, articulate, and engaging. She leads a fantastic section, facilitating excellent discussion among students and providing an illuminating conceptual framework for understanding the works. A lot of reading is assigned - you get the most out of the class by doing all the reading but you can still get a ton out of the class without doing all the reading. Some advice for Professor Levin's section - meet with her before writing papers. Papers do the best that are not only persuasive but also best fit the complexities of the work. Professor Levin has a tremendous understanding of the complexities of the work, so it's worth checking with her to make sure your thesis isn't contradicted by elements of the work you're not considering in the paper.",
    "It as a very intense, rapid survey of the early western literary canon. I use the word survey intentionally; perhaps the only downside of this class is that the pace of the curriculum prevented us from delving deeply into the material. Nevertheless, you will learn a tremendous amount, and come away with a thorough understanding of the large picture and meaning of these books and how they fit together.",
    "The DS Lit course was a good summary of a handful of the major works in the Western literary tradition. I learned an incredible amount about not only the evolution of literary thought but also the evolution of subject matter and conceptions of the world; it has definitely changed my perception of Western thought.At times it seemed like we had to read an unfair amount, but the reading was always rewarding. As long as you stay reasonably on top of the reading, you can get a lot out of the lectures and sections.Recommending it is the same as recommending DS, which I do, but only if you are willing to read a lot more than anyone else and get ground down by the paper-a-week shenanigans, sacrificing your Thursday nights for the sake of awesome professors and a great foundation for the rest of college (and life, I suppose they would say).",
    "Don't do DS if you aren't going to be fully invested in it and enjoy participating a lot in section and entering in heated debates among your classmates. Levin's Lit section is probably the best one you can get! Switch in!",
    "DS Literature is a rigorous introduction to many of the most important texts of the Western canon, from Homer to Dante. I would recommend it to another student, but not all other students. I think one has to be of a certain type to be able to appreciate the scope and the workload of DS.",
    "This course provided a comprehensive survey of major works of Western literature from Homer to Dante. The course encourages students to examine the relationships among the texts as well as across the disciplines. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Western literature."
