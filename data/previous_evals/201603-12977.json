    "Through this course I entered the world of Social Cognition theory and experiments. I was able to understand about Social Cognition theory, not learning about what every process means but by reading sudies on practical experiments that illustrated each specific process, discussing what is the stage of the theory now and how it is being applied.",
    "The great reinforcer",
    "Through this course we sampled a wide variety of papers under all popular topics in social cognition, with an eye to the history of development. We learned to connect and synthesize papers to the larger body of literature and understand what theoretical milestones they are under the influence of.",
    "Knowledge about the history and current work in social psych.",
    "I developed my knowledge of cognitive and social psychology (which are outside of my research area), both in terms of current work and history.",
    "I read a number of foundational texts in social cognition. I especially appreciated the readings focused on knowledge accessibility, impression formation, social judgment, motivation.",
    "A good survey of the social cognition literature with a special attention to the history of the field and where it is heading.",
    "I developed important insights into the history of social cognition research and how to apply cognitive principles to social perception and judgment.",
    "This course helped me think about the different sub-disciplines of social psych and how they relate and how they differ."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the class discussions a lot! Prof. Bargh encouraged us to discuss ideas and that made the class very engaging and interesting.",
    "Prof. Bargh is vivacious, interesting and knowledgable. The only thing I can think to improve the experience is a smaller class, and maybe for people like me who came in the class without any previous knowledge of the subject and no previous knowledge of social psychology, a required basic textbook on the theory previous to the class would have helped me.",
    "The course topics are extremely interesting and cover the whole range of subfields that anyone interested in getting a sense of or delving deeper in areas of social cognition should be happy about and inspired by. Professor Bargh is also extremely erudite and eloquent in this area of his expertise. The exam method is also very friendly to grad students. If any improvement can be made, I would love to submit more weekly responses just to engage more with the readings.",
    "Instructor is very knowledgeable; could have encouraged discussion more.",
    "This course deepened my understanding of a number of important social psychological phenomena. I wish it had been a bit smaller, as I think a smaller class would have fostered better conversations. Also, it wasn't clear for a while that all of the readings would be covered on the midterm exam, and I wish we had known that sooner.",
    "Really great overview of the existing literature; the discussions though were a bit lackluster but that was probably due to the class size. Professor did a great job in lecturing in a clear way.",
    "More in-depth discussion of topics and concepts could have been fruitful.",
    "I like that the course is a broad overview. I think it might be improved by having a bit more dialogue with cognitive and neuroscience perspectives as these areas are becoming increasingly integrated."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, and this course is particularly well-suited for an interdisciplinary crowd.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend the course for people in the area.",
    "I highly recommend this course since I am able to learn very much without having to do a lot of petty works. The midterm and final exams are also better than writing a paper, which wouldn't have helped me broaden my scope of learning as much. Overall, this course is enjoyable, non-demanding, but have also facilitated learning in great ways.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yep! It's a good introduction\/survey course in social cognition.",
    "Yes, because it is very informative and one can leArn new information that can be used in one's work.",
    "Yes."
