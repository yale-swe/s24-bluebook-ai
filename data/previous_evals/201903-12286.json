   "comments": [
    "The strength and weakness of this course, as with most L1 language courses, lie in the amount of material and speed with which you move through it. The class moves at breakneck speed, which means you're learning a lot fairly quickly, but also means it's easy to fall behind considerably.",
    "The strength is the intensity of the course.",
    "tatiana is the biggest strength. she's absolutely phenomenal and for that i believe there was no weaknesses during my time in this class.",
    "Strengths: Speaking opportunities, feedback, opportunities to receive help.",
    "The biggest strength is that the course meets every day, so we are engaged with the language. It could be improved through more song and movie recommendations for the students to listen\/watch in their free time.",
    "The pace of the course is a bit too fast and it's hard to catch up, but the course promises students to learn and get some Russian out of it.",
    "I learned so much in this class. I thought that the layout of the course was very straightforward. My professor was super kind and amazing!! I wish that the tests had been on paper because sometimes I found I took longer and made accidental mistakes when typing."

    "Yes, Russian is a fascinating language and the professor was really good.",
    "yes!!! you learn so much and get genuinely invested in the language and culture by the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course if it's with Tatiana. It seems overwhelming sometimes but looking back not so bad.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Definitely! If you would like to learn Russian, this seminar is great.",
    "Yes if they want to learn Russian",
    "Definitely!!! I loved this class and if someone had any interest in Russian at all I would certainly recommend it."
