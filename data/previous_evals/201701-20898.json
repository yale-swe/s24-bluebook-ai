    "I know so much more about biological experiments. I came into this class having just learned normal high school biology, and I felt as if I were very far behind my classmates in their knowledge of experimental biology. This class allowed me to catch up and surpass other people in other classes who I share biological interests with. We talked about topical subjects regarding cancer and pharma, and I learned so much more about molecular processes within cells.",
    "This course is a deep introduction to cancer biology and scientific research. You will learn the fundamental underpinnings of cancer and learn how to analyze scientific literature.",
    "Molecular pathways of cancer. Reading primary literature.",
    "I gained an incredibly in depth knowledge of the treatment and recent research on Cancer, as well as a certain amount of background on the history of this disease.",
    "reading a scientific paper, writing science, visualizing science, patient diagnosis",
    "How to look at the world scientifically and analytically and all the associated skills therein.",
    "I learned some of the major breakthroughs in science research and the detailed pathways\/mutations that cause cancer. I also learned how to analyze a scientific paper, how to present a paper to the class, and how to write a grant proposal.",
    "I learned how to efficiently read and analyze scientific papers, a very useful skill for anyone wanting to do research.",
    "This class is a great way to learn about the mechanisms behind cancer."

   "comments": [
    "The course is taught wonderfully and the set up between lecture and discussion is well thought out. The only thing I could recommend is to make the tests a bit shorter. The final paper is also a wonderful learning experience.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Sandy and the course material both shine in this class. You will discover a love for research and a deep interest in the mystery of cancer. The class lecture and presentation format with a problem set format is a lot for a seminar class but is reasonable considering the course material. Weaknesses: None.",
    "strengths: unique topic, good literature, great teacher, great assignments, average workload weaknesses: N\/A",
    "It is an incredible course, the only weakness I can think of is that I think class participation could be diversified so it wasn't always the same voices.",
    "A strength in this course was Professor Chang's lectures and questions. Furthermore, teaching a class and getting taught by other students was valuable. The only weakness I may see in this class is that it seemed to require previous biology knowledge, so those with previous biology\/lab experience had an easier time with the material.",
    "The only strengths of this course are its unique content and its basic structure: lecture with some discussion. Weaknesses include that one must know or investigate a lot of the lingo involved in the scientific papers\/research, because the professor does not does go over it. The course does not teach the individual vocabulary which may make it difficult for a student, eager to delve into the world of research, to understand the paper. It is implied that you have a strong biology background when you apply for this course. Additionally, a student excited to learn more about the research side of science might be disappointing in that most of the course is only analyzing scientific papers and nothing more.",
    "This class mostly consists of reading research papers and then discussing them in class. For someone who may not have had a strong background in biology, some of the terminology and the methods used by the researchers, and then discussed in class, can be confusing."

   "comments": [
    "This is the favorite class I have taken at Yale. I felt like I was learning things that actually affect people's lives and that I could possibly use in the future. The workload time-wise is not that bad at all, but the amount of brain power you put into it is large.",
    "Yes. If you have an interest in cancer research, conducting independent research, and just want to learn more about cancer in general, this class is for you and Sandy is your guy.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you get in. You will learn how to read primary scientific literature and the course culminates in a final \"grant proposal.\" By far the most well organized class I have taken at Yale so far. Also, Sandy is a fantastic resource.",
    "Yes, especially if you are into science. This is a refreshing change from the intro science courses and goes into depths about an interesting topic. The teacher is great and really into the topic.",
    "This course was incredible. Sandy Chang is fantastic, and if you're interested in medicine or biology or research in general, this class is excellent preparation.",
    "yes! a great topic, a great teacher. Sandy really cares about your development as a scientist, which is great. good lectures, nothing too heavy on the workload but when there is a lot, its clearly for a reason (i.e. writing a grant proposal at the end of the course)",
    "TAKE! THIS! COURSE! It is incredible, Sandy Chang is a god, and you will learn so much from it and it will be incredibly fun all at the same time. Also, it doesn't matter if you are a STEM student or not. I'm a Theatre Studies major and this was my favorite class my freshman year.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. I'd particularly recommend it to those who love bio and research. I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for an easy Sc credit or to someone who doesn't enjoy reading scientific papers.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that might be interested in doing research in the future, as it forces you to analyze scientific papers with detail. This course could also be a source for connections. However, I would advise that participation is very important in this course. You must participate actively in every discussion or else your grade will suffer.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is strongly interested in the subject."
