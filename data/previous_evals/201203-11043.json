   "comments": [
    "You move at warp speed through three American genres of music, with attention to the attendant discourses and modes of analysis for each. There is an emphasis on archival research, though the ends to which that research my be put are pretty wide open. It encourages you to think about what specific skills and insights musicologists can bring to this repertory that scholars of other disciplines might not have.",
    "The course is fun. It has a ton of reading. You should absolutely take it.",
    "I would recommend the class for fellow students. It is challenging, time-wise, but definitely worth it for the intellectual stimulation.",
    "MUSI 842 is a tightly focused course on American Music based on case studies of Ives, the blues (particularly Robert Johnson), and Cole Porter. The course is essential for any student interested in studying American music, though I would recommend it without reservation to any graduate student in the music department because of the excellence of Hepokoski's teaching.",
    "The class consists of three snapshots of American music history. In order to get through a number of genres, the class moves quickly. However, a student learns much through the exposure to such a diverse collection of musical styles as well as archival sources."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "As I have alluded, this course thought me to survey the state of research on a particular topic, and think about how to generate questions and locate my own research interests within the broader discourses. If the information gleaned didn't contribute directly to my research, the ways in which it taught me to think critically about musicology writ large have helped me grow as a scholar and a thinker.",
    "It broadened my knowledge of Ives and Porter immensely. It probably did not contribute to my dissertation\/research at all, but it was still deeply worthwhile and enjoyable.",
    "This course covered some gaps in my knowledge that are often overlooked in traditional music programs (popular music and musicals) - I feel better prepared to discuss these topics.",
    "In my opinion, the archival research component of this course will probably prove the most helpful to my future research. The course provided indispensable training in conducting archival research and gave me my first exposure to archival material. For practical reasons, I think it is important that this aspect of the course be retained if it is taught again.",
    "The archival research is invaluable to our experience as musicologists. There are few classes that allow for so much time in the archives, which makes this class a gem in that sense."
