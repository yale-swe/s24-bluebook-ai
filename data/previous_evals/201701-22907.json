    "The class is a bit of a grind because it's a two-hour seminar at 9:25am. It's also on Hegel and on dense text, so it's not the most engaging class unless you are very interested in the material. However, I was really engaged in the material so I really liked it. But be warned, this is not your average philosophy class. If you are not excited about Hegel, don't take it because it can be painful and confusing. It requires weekly reading responses and two papers, as well as a huge amount of reading each week."
