   "comments": [
    "It's a pretty good class to take as a 5th credit because it's not too much work.",
    "I'd recommend it. it's different and interesting",
    "Take the class if you need a relaxing fourth or fifth class. You'll have papers and readings, but no exams, so it's a relaxed, non-cutthroat environment. There are a lot of readings about chimpanzees, and less about human anthropology, so be prepared to learn more about chimpanzee behavior than anything. Overall, though, it's fun, it's interesting, and it won't be a class that you worry about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student (I already have!)",
    "It wasn't exactly what I thought a freshman seminar would be, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good class. Professor Watts is extremely knowledgable about great apes and the material you go over in class is very interesting. It's definitely a class where you get out what you put in, so if you're interested in human evolution and comparative psychology, and you actually read the papers and contribute in class, you'll learn a lot.",
    "I'd recommend ANTH 040 to another student. We read a few really interesting books and professor Watts (a fantastic professor who knows an immense amount not only about his specific area of study but also about many similar fields that his students are able to branch out into with his support) talked to us about humanoid primates as models for early humans. It was a really cool class.",
    "Evolution of Human Uniqueness explores the various behavioral and physical differences between modern day humans and our hominin ancestors including chimpanzees and Neandertals. Although reading the texts gives a lot of information, participating in class discussions is the best way to benefit from this course."
