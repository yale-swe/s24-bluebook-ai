    "The course was very interesting and the professor did a great job of using different styles of teaching, with a great blend of discussion, writing, presentation style, exams, and quizzes. The professor was also flexible in his teaching style and even asked for a course evaluation mid-course. The course also offered a lot of breadth in the course material. I didn't feel that all of the homework assignments were very conducive to my learning. The expectations for the final projects were too high and the feedback was harsh. The quizzes were also very difficult."

    "The individual assignment and the field trips",
    "Shimi is an expert on the topic, namely at tying management with science. This is the kind of thinking that the business and environmental communities demand, and Shimi elicits great thinking form his students.",
    "Shimi is one of the best teachers at FES. He does a great job explaining the material and answering questions.",
    "The general overview, we also had a lot of time to get to know our fellow classmates.",
    "Professor is very engaging and covers range of topics well in a way that caters to different learning styles",
    "The material was very interesting and covered so many different topics which was great.",
    "For me the best aspects of this course came through the useful application of technical water resource science and engineering concepts to policy and management decisions. This approach led to a deep understanding of various water challenges ranging from water supply and quality to issues like flooding. However, the blending of technical and management focuses also introduced a variety of strategies for addressing these challenges. I also appreciated the input from other students in the class. Shimi does an excellent job of encouraging productive and pertinent discussion amongst the students in the class. Also, since each student has a different background related to water, the diverse perspectives provide a valuable learning component to the course."

    "The class discussions, but its sort of the nature of the beast since it's mostly a bunch of like-minded individuals talking to each other.",
    "The farm field trip seemed less relevant.",
    "I think some of the economic concepts (specifically game theory) could be better explained. At times, it was hard to keep up the workload for the class. Also, it would have been helpful to have a rubric for some of the assignments so we were aware what we were being graded on in advance.",
    "More guidance and help on writing the paper for the class- it was very open ended and there was minimal feedback, but the grading scheme- which was never provided- was difficult.",
    "The feedback and expectations on the final paper were unrealistic and caused me stress rather than allowed me to learn. Also I'm not sure how much consideration was put into the difficulty in the material and subject that students were choosing in their papers and how that could affect their feedback. Some topics were clearly more complex and difficult than other topics and I'm not sure if this was taken into account."

    "My background in environmental policy helped me in sections of this course but the ability to connect the science to policy and economics as well as management was really helpful.",
    "A great step for anyone interested in water resources.",
    "As an MESc. student with research projects focused on stormwater management, flooding, and water quality this course provided a valuable link between my research and the management implications of my findings. This translation of science to management was also valuable to me since I came into the course with an engineering background and therefore had a fairly firm understanding of the technological aspects of water management but less familiarity with the policy side of these issues. Therefore it was helpful to see how legislation, regulation, and general management decisions tie into the application of the engineering and science focuses on water resources. Also, my work prior to taking this course was largely focused on urban stormwater management. Since this was only a small part of the course, it was valuable to broaden my understanding of water resources to encompass other sectors such as water supply, agriculture, and industry."

FES 712 provided an applied and holistic understanding of the issues that I am researching while also introducing other important considerations that will be pertinent to my career moving forward. 2. Shimi is one of the best professors with whom I have had the pleasure of taking a course (both undergrad and grad). The passion he has for the material is palpable and it leads to active class discussions and a wonderful learning environment."
