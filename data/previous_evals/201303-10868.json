    "ITAL 120 is an excellent introduction to Italian language and culture. Students learn every verb tense in Italian and conclude the semester by reading a selection from Boccaccio's Decameron and by making several short presentations on Italian art and culture. Students write a short essay once a week (no more than 250 words) and take a test every week and a half. While I do not know much about the other instructors, Prof. Iacovella was amazing! She brought Italian coffee, pastriesand treats to several classes. She took us on a visit to the Yale art gallery and to an authentic pizzeria in Guildford, CT. Not only is she from Italy and well-versed in Italian culture, she is extremely kind and eager to help students learn. Take the course!",
    "At first it might seem overwhelming but in retrospect, I feel like this is one of the best taught languages on Yale's campus. Take Italian if you want the best experience learning a language at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has some experience in Italian. The class was fun and informative. I would recommend it to someone who would enjoy conversing in italian and doing presentations."
