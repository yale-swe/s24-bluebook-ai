   "comments": [
    "It feels empowering. You learned nothing in BC calc.",
    "A difficult class that is well worth your efforts.",
    "The material can be dry and the lectures are not always interesting, but the course gives you a good foundation in multivariable calculus topics.",
    "MATH 120 is a hard course. Buyer beware and proceed with caution. For ECON majors: take a lower level math like MATH 112 if you are looking to merely fulfill the math requirement; no need to stress yourself out since you will probably take this in freshman year--it's just not worth it. The only teacher with whom you should take this course is if you are lucky enough to get into Miki Havlickova's section as she is in charge of course content and exam content. The other teachers are likely to be grad students who have had no experience teaching MATH 120 and who are thus liable to teach material not on the test, largely ignoring what will actually be tested (and it is hard). I would not recommend this unpleasant course.",
    "Math 120 09 is a great class if you are interested in math, but does require a lot of self studying because the material covered in class is not always explained fully.",
    "I would recommend it. Weekly problem sets provide practice for concepts gone over in class. The exams are a reflection of these lectures and the problem sets.",
    "Multi variable calculus It's difficult if not enough effort is put in to study. It's not recommended if you're not into math.",
    "The class is difficult but manageable. However, the tests are unpredictable and even if you know the material, you may encounter new things that you won't be able to do on tests. I would recommend the class, but only to someone who was interested.",
    "It is a pretty hard class that requires a lot of time outside of class to thoroughly understand the material.",
    "I would say MATH 120 is a great multivariable calculus course with ample theory and applications. If you are interested in math and science or think you might be, you should take this class. If you are lucky, you will have a teacher as great as Tarik. The material is very neat when it all connects at the end everything is just an iteration of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The computations are straightforward, and you feel like you know all of calculus by the end. The workload is also extremely manageable. This was my favorite class this semester.",
    "If you are interested in theories, just go for it.",
    "It's a lot of work.",
    "Math 120 was strongly influenced by which instructor you had, and as most instructors were graduate students with limited experience in teaching the class, you really had to actively move around during shopping period to find the right instructor for you. For students who have never taken multivariable calculus before, the vast amounts of material that need to be covered in a single semester can often lead to students being confused unless they spend lots of time going over the material. Also, because it's a prerequisite for many classes\/majors, many students who already have experience with multivar calc will be in the class, thus leaving a minimal curve for the rest of the students. However, despite these difficulties, I still recommend students take Math 120 as it is still an important step to further one's mathematical inquiries. Mathematics can only be mastered through time and practice, so a student who wishes to receive an A in this class should be prepared to spend a decent amount of time learning the material.",
    "Probably what you hear most is that your MATH 120 experience depends on your instructor. Tarik is awesome. He brings an energy to a topic that most people aren't enthused about that makes you really want to understand and be engaged. Unfortunately for you, future student, Tarik won't be teaching here again. As an engineering student, I shopped MATH 120 and ENAS 151, and chose 120 because I preferred Tarik to Sohrab. If you're considering both, shop both. If you do take 120, be sure to keep up on making sure you understand what's going on, or you will feel lost towards the end of the term. Make some friends to work on problem sets with. Go to office hours. If you don't like your professor, and you have friends in other sections who do like theirs, go to their office hours (I didn't try this, but it's probably fine and basically what I'm saying is office hours are really important and helpful and you should find a way to go). You'll be fine."
