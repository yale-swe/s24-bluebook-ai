   "comments": [
    "It's an average course. Not too heavy, not too light. Not too confusing. It's just doable.",
    "I think I would have rather taken ENAS 151, but definitely take one of the two. It's a good class.",
    "Take it if you need it for your major - it's a well taught course. I wouldn't take it for intellectual curiosity - linear algebra is cooler.",
    "The course is not proof-based so there's a lot of memorizing involved which gets boring at some point. Also, the biggest challenge in exams is not to know the topics of 120 itself, but not to make mistakes when evaluating integrals of really, really ugly functions after applying some theorem.Still a much better option than 230. (unless you love spending friday and saturday nights in the library...)",
    "Not a bad class. The material is pretty boring, but I liked math and needed this class to move on to more advanced material. Igor is great; take his section.",
    "Take it if you haven't already taken Multivariable. If you've taken multivariable already, it won't be a very challenging class. If you take it, though, take Igor's section! He is probably the best teacher for this class.",
    "Math 120 is probably the last calculus course I will take. It covered what seemed to be all of the important topics of multi-variable calculus, and is directly applicable for my physics major.",
    "Good class - multivariable is something you have to take at some point. Your teacher matters A LOT. Either try to get into Igor Rapinchuk's section or Havlickova's. The final was WAY harder than both midterms.",
    "It's not really a course you take for pleasure. But if you need to get ahead in your math career, I think it's integral to understanding higher-level mathematics.",
    "It was a well-organized, nicely taught class on multivariable calculus. Completely managed even if you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take any multivariable class before (if you took BC calc and got a 5 you will be fine). The weekly problem sets aren't too tough but make sure you study hard for the midterms and final. Your whole grade basically comes from these three test (weighed 25% per midterm and 40% for final), and just doing the homework will not prepare you. Do all of the practice tests online and go to review sessions. Igor was a great teacher. MAKE SURE you get a teacher that you can understand, because the concepts will be challenging enough you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be confused as to what the teacher is saying.",
    "You sit in lecture and then you do weekly problem sets that require a lot of collaboration and help. Its not too hard but still challenging.",
    "A good multivariable calculus course. Anyone with a good grasp of calculus BC should be fine.",
    "-Good class for math, a little bit slow at times but well paced usually",
    "Math 120 has a lot of theoretical formulas and math. It is well structured and well presented. There is a lot of memorizing, which can be frustrating because I would rather understand the formulas conceptually rather than memorizing them. But if you like math and solving formulas, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "If you pay attention in class, learn the concepts well, and do your homework, you should do fine in this class. It is quite a bit of work if you want to do well though; not only does the homework take a while but it does take some time for your mind to digest the material. The latter half of the semester was definitely much more challenging than that first half so expect to put in more work later on in the semester. I would recommend the class only to those that find math interesting; the material could seem like a drag otherwise.",
    "Definitely, not only will it help as a prereq for a lot of majors but multivariable calculus is something that everyone should be able to do.",
    "It is a pretty good course. It is pretty much calculus that deals with 3-dimensional objects and things that relate to them. Eventually you will learn things in 4-D, which truthfully don't make sense and the course does not really even try explaining what this fourth dimension is geometrically.I will say, however, that the course material does come together wonderfully at review sessions before the exam. The last month of the class is without a doubt the hardest. The first month is pretty challenging also if you haven't worked with multi-dimensional mathematics, like vectors, before.1. Go to review session before exams.2. Take all the practice exams and understand fully their answers.3. The course is more harshly curved in the fall because it is full of overachieving freshmen.",
    "I would say it is a difficult math course, but I would recommend it to my fellow students.",
    "This is a tough class. The final was the hardest test I've ever taken. Never start psets the night before. Work on them with a friend if you can.",
    "MATH 120 is a decent multivariable calculus course. Coming out of BC Calc, which was hard for me, MATH 120 was doable, but only with a significant amount of work and practice problems. The 2-time a week 1 hour and 15 minute lecture format was not too conducive to learning the math. I often found myself zoning out during lecture, which went at a quite fast pace. It would definitely benefit from a different format, one that is interactive and in which students actually learn the math during class, perhaps through a supplemental section or something as many intro science courses have. Compared to stories I heard of other professors who didn't care at all and had incomprehensible accents, Professor Rapinchuk was a fine professor. He was clear and understandable, and answered questions well. However, he spoke in monotone during lectures and went quite fast, which was not conducive to students actually understanding the new material he was presenting. This was a decent course, but as a potential biology major, I sortof wish I had taken calculus for the biosciences instead. Take it if you think it's the best calc option for you.",
    "I would take this class if you need it for higher levels of math, physics, etc. I realized after taking this course, I probably won't have much use for it in my major\/career path, but it was definitely worth taking!",
    "It's what you expect a math class to be.",
    "Great multi class! Not too difficult.",
    "This was a great course. Started out very fast, which can be overwhelming at first, but then the pace relaxed a bit for the harder material and we did more examples in class and things improved a lot. The tests and problem sets are all very straightforward and fair, but it is a lot of material. Igor is very clear and answers questions directly. If you're going to take this course, only take it with Igor, Miki (the course head), or Susie Kimport.",
    "Considering that it is a big, introductory course, Math 120 is a pretty decent choice. If you want to take multivariable calculus without too much work load, math 120 would be the right choice.",
    "dry but good",
    "Mathematics 120 studies multivariable calculus in a way that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very accessible to anyone who is comfortable with the material covered in a typical high school BC calculus curriculum. In particular, the course covers the major topics in differential multivariable calculus and then spends much more time delving into the major theorems of integral calculus of functions of 2 or more (really 2 or 3) variables. Those theorems are Green\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theorem, Stokes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Theorem, and the Divergence theorem, which mean nothing to anyone who knows nothing about anything beyond single variable integration.Would I recommend this course to another student? That depends on what the student wants from the course and what he plans to do with what he learns from the course. Taking this course is like getting a whole truckload of wood. You can do a lot with it if you want, but you need to know what you want to build. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a perspective econ\/math major so this class is a good one for me to take. I think many people who are interested in furthering their knowledge of math beyond their high school curriculums will want to take this course.For those trying to decide between taking 120 and 230\/231, if you want to take a course that it proof based, do not take this one. In 120, you can read through the proofs of theorems in the text, but you will not work on proving them yourself. Take 230\/231 if you want a course that focuses on proofs. That said, people spend significantly more time doing math homework in 230\/231 than those that take 120. This course most likely not be the hardest course in your schedule. 230\/231 likely will be the hardest course in your schedule.",
    "I think multivariable calc is something really interesting that everyone should take if they are interested in the math or sciences. MATH 120 covers all the topics thoroughly, but does move very fast. This can be a problem if you get behind. In general, it was pretty easy though. It is really important that you find a good instructor.",
    "The class itself is not very interesting, as math classes go. It's pretty dry stuff, taught as a lecture, problems sets that are occasionally challenging, but largely doable. The midterms were fairly easy, but then the final was hard (I think our class average was pretty high and the professors needed to curve the grades down somehow.) Igor was the bomb; if you're taking this class, definitely try to get Igor. He provided clear explanations for the sadly pretty uninteresting material.",
    "Take Igor if he's teaching, he's an awesome teacher that is amazing at explaining difficult topics, knows his stuff, cares about students; no accent, speaks good English. Miki is good too, but her pace was a little too fast for me sometimes.Tests: just do the practice exams and that should be enough, there isn't anything particularly difficult or tricky.Definitely go to the review sessions, they helped a lot to clear up areas of confusion.You don't really have to know Calc I&II, just basic derivatives and integrals, so feel free to take this class even if you're rusty on those.",
    "Math 120 is a pretty straightforward calculus course. It's not much harder than AP AB\/BC, if you get a good professor. The problem sets are reasonable and the midterms were fairly easy; the final was more difficult. If you take it in the fall, there are a lot of annoying kids who already took multivariable in high school and make the curve harder.Take Igor if you can! He's great and drops in little jokes. Seriously, he's awesome.",
    "Multi-variable calculus, for me, covered almost entirely new concepts, but I was generally able to follow along and eventually figured things out -- though that was largely due to a great teacher and an amazing study group (form one of these asap). I would recommend this class if you genuinely enjoy math, especially if you don't want to take ENAS.",
    "This is a good class as long as you get a good sections (I would especially recommend Igor, though I heard Marketa Hacklikova is also erally good.) In a good section, I felt the material was explained far better than the ENAS version, with a lot of good proof given as background. (You didn't need to know these to do well in the class, but they helped you more fully understand the material.)"
