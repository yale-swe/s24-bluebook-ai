    "The complexities of the issues in the Middle East and how all of them are interrelated. Also, how it is extremely difficult to come up with a solution for these issues.",
    "I learned about the complexity in transboundary water management issues in the Middle East. I learned about the nexus approach that was pursued after a broaden idea of \"security\" that includes social, environmental, and emotional security (beyond just physical or war-driven security. I also learned\/was exposed to a new style of writing - that of domestic and international think-tanks and organizations (ie the UN, UNEP, FAO, World Bank, IMF)",
    "In this class I learnt a strong background about the Middle East and the environmental threats that are specific to this region of the world. We analysed leaders responses to climate change impacts such as the shortage of water and why bad decisions were made. I really liked how this class was set up with a gradual process of learning more about the region while having regular short papers every 2 ish weeks to collect my knowledge.",
    "I learned a great deal about the sociopolitical landscape of the Middle East region, as well as about the many environmental problems that endanger the health and safety of MENA residents. I developed an understanding of the complexity of and interconnectedness between the environmental problems in MENA, and the underlying incentives for the bad decisions made by policy-makers.",
    "A broader understanding of environmental security topics with a specific focus on the MENA region. A specific area in which I gained more insight was surrounding water issues in the region, and more broadly about Iran and the dynamics of the Iranian government."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Kaveh's wealth of knowledge from both lived experience and academic readings. The course material is really interesting, and I found the readings to be pretty cool. Weaknesses: Even though Professor Madani knows alot, and is a really interesting person, his classroom management style is different from my ideal learning environment. As an undergraduate in a class that was majority graduate (mostly Jackson, some Forestry) students, I felt that often some of the graduate students would go off on soliloquies that lacked a direct or even tangential connection to the readings or discussion. I wish that Kaveh could have moderated the discussion a bit more towards the material that was prepared in advance of that class (especially because I spent 4-8 hours a week prepared the readings and watching the assigned videos for class). When that material was not addressed in class, I felt like I had little to offer. However, Kaveh's decision to have a more \"open\" classroom was probably prompted by the constant material and news coming out of the Middle East about environmental security. Because there were so many new developments even over the course of our semester, much of our discussion focused on current events.",
    "The strengths included Kaveh Madani's teaching style which made the talking environment very open and comfortable to discuss a wide range of things. Although the reading assignments were quite a lot, I liked how they were all collected into the different week's themes.",
    "The course felt disjointed and bounced between topics without producing a strong overall takeaway at the end. It does provide a broad introduction to middle east topics though, and issues around water in the region. The classes can spark interesting conversations about current affairs."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course with a few words of caution. 1. the weekly assignment are a lot. expect 200 pages of dense reading a week plus 1-3 hours of documentary films or speeches to watch 2. if you are easily intimidated by graduate students, do not take 3. the classroom environment is honestly bizarre. there is not real direction to each lecture (ie. there is not a clear take away at the end of each lecture), but by the end of the semester, looking back I can say that I learned a lot. 4. this course and the way it is run assumes a lot of prior knowledge about the region (both in geography, and history). kaveh always reminded me to speak up if I did not know what the grads were talking about, but it was tough at some points in the semester. do your research and establish some sort of baseline knowledge if you want to get a lot out of the course. however, despite these drawbacks, I really did learn a lot about the region",
    "Yes. I can not find a class quite like this at Yale so I really enjoyed learning about environmental security specifically in the Middle East and how it can relate the rest of the world. I really liked the professor and the assignments as well as the opportunity to take a class with Graduate students.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel like I learned a great deal about environmental studies in a short semester. While the course focused on the Middle East, the lessons and solutions to environmental problems are truly universal, and Professor Madani's experiences in the MENA region made the course material much more tangible.",
    "The readings are a mixed bag - some are interesting, some painful. The discussions in class were the most interesting component as people brought in multiple perspectives, from undergrad and a few different graduate programs. The instructor has some unique insights since he was actually part of the Iranian government, but he also has strong opinions that influence the messaging. There is quite a lot of work, 4 papers and a presentation and term paper, so if you commit to the work you can learn a lot in the process through doing the work - but the classes don't necessarily link up well. Its a chaotic class, and not for everyone."
