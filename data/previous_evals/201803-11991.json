    "I improved my writing and conversational spanish, but also my daily academic\/study habits.",
    "I improved my writing and speaking skills.",

    "More preparation fro grammar",
    "Strengths: lots of small group discussions learning vocab consistently effective review of some grammar without making it too big a deal some really fun classroom activities clear feedback Weaknesses: conversations could be forced, like any language class, but this one handled this well teacher could be sticklerish but in the end I quite liked her"

    "Yes, if a student wants to better their ability and confidence to communicate in a Spanish, this course is needed.",
    "Yes but only if willing to put in some work. There are easier and more interesting L5s but I really wanted to improve my speaking skills, and I think I was able to do that in 150. A lecture will never do that for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Totally - a really good way to get consistent Spanish conversation in throughout the semester without overextending. Good if you can communicate complex ideas in Spanish but want to increase fluency. I liked my classmates and so enjoyed the small group discussions."
