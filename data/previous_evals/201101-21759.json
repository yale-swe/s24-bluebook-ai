    "I wouldn't really recommend it if you're not an econ major, because learning it under stress is not efficient at all. But I definitely encourage anyone to audit this class.",
    "A very easy course, lectures were not really worth going to if you have any common sense and do a very small amount of reading of the text book, but the sections were well worth it.",
    "Your basic introductory micro course. Not as dry as some people say; I actually enjoyed it. Karlan is an interesting lecturer, workload is steady and moderate, and the quantitative aspects of the course are not difficult.",
    "Very interesting textbook, lectures were only good if you read textbook beforehand. Recommended but stay on top of it and do practice problems to really understand the material.",
    "Dean Karlan is the worst teacher I've ever had. The midterm was so unfair and ridiculous. Everyone was like WTF while taking it mainly because it was 3 times the length of the average Yale midterm. It was almost impossibleto finish. also, I can't describe how vague, poorly written and unimportant the questions were. I would totally start a petition to get this guy off the yale faculty. Just because he is qualified to teach doesn't mean he should. I wasted my Yale tuition on him and I'm upset about it.",
    "Takeit to fill a QR. It's not that heavy a workload and as long as DK isn't your teacher I'm sure you'll be fine.",
    "Yes, especially if you took AP econ in high school. If you haven't don't take the class with Dean Karlan. He's a great interesting teacher, and I surprisingly, really enjoyed this class. But Dean really doesn't teach much material and takes a lot of basic understandings for granted. (although he applies them to real life, which is interesting).Go to section to learn actual, concrete material. Dean's lectures were interesting, but it was unclear if we were expected to take anything away from them...",
    "I would recommend Micro Econ, but I would not suggest taking it with a different teacher. The mid-term exam was extremely long and difficult, thus there was a hug curve. Overall, take it, but be prepared to read the textbook.",
    "Yes, if you've taken economics before and thus don't really have to go to lecture. He's a fine speaker\/teacher, but sometimes it just got really boring.",
    "Take it with someone else.",
    "This class is not terribly interesting, but it does lay a good foundation for higher level econ courses and doesn't swamp you with too much work. Problem sets can be tough at times, but you are allowed two drops for your lowest grades. Overall, I would recommend this class for anyone interested in Economics.",
    "Karlan is a horrible lecturer. He would arrive late to every lecture, and then struggle with his microphone for the first five minute. He would try to kick off every lecture with a fun, educational money game involving student volunteers that inevitably became confusing, time consuming, and dumb. The lectures themselves consist of disorganized rambling, grainy YouTube videos of Seinfeld, and short time-outs in which Karlan corrected errors in his own PowerPoint slides. The problem sets are just as sloppy. The most recent one asked us to draw isoquant curves and isocost lines, topics which were not mentioned anywhere in the textbook or the lectures. When I emailed my TF about this, he sent me a link to Wikipedia and suggested I get reading. You are paying too much for your education to put up with this. Take it with Berry.",
    "Only take this class if you can have a different professor. Prof. Karlan seems like a great person but he is a dull lecturer and unprepared to teach introductory materials.",
    "This course feels absolutely brutal, impossible, difficult, enraging, etc., etc. Then you take the midterm, think you failed, and then find out that the curve is so generous that it doesn't even matter that you got a 65% because that's an A-. Lectures are difficult to follow if you're not that engaged with economics, problem sets range from tough to impossible, and the midterm was difficult. But like I said, the curve ends up curing all your economics-related ills. If you need a QR and can tough out a semester of feeling lost and confused in exchange for a sweet curve, then go ahead and take it.",
    "I would recommend it only in that it satisfies important basic requirements for the Economics\/Economics& Mathematics major, and that you learn of the basic principles of Economics. If you're looking for an engaging lecture class, then forget it.",
    "Although Professor Karlan was a good lecturer, I felt that the problem sets had little to nothing to do with the material covered in class. They were a constant struggle to complete. Also, tests were very hard (I believe the average grade was below a C), which may be telling of the discrepancy between the coursework and the material covered.",
    "I neither recommend it nor discourage other students from taking the course. It's not particularly fun, but the workload isn't heavy, and there are lots of interesting games that usually tie in with the lecture. It's not a bad course, just not particularly engaging.",
    "IT SUCKS i don't understand it at all. but that's just me. the curve was really nice",
    "Try to take it when Dean Karlan is not teaching it.",
    "I think normally, Econ 115 is a decent class. I enjoyed the material that we covered over the course of this class but it was really the professor that made this class rather unpleasant. I would recommend it because it gives you the bare minimum knowledge of economics that everyone should know, but don't expect the class to be very enjoyable.",
    "I would not waste your time with this class. Didn't actually learn anything, but if you're a prospective econ major, take it in the fall.",
    "Intro Micro is a good class, but don't take it with Dean Karlan",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise skip it. Not a very difficult class, but not worth the time.",
    "This was a very interesting course that was administered very poorly. The TA's were uninterested and mostly unavailable, and Dean Karlan chose to give a lecture on a topic the week after the homework was due so that we had to struggle through every single problem set, and despite multiple complaints to Dean Karlan about this issue, this was never resolved. If you are interested in economics, take this course because it will be worth struggling through. If you are just looking to fill credits or distribution requirements, go somewhere else; it simply isnt worth it.",
    "I would recommend it. Although it is a big lecture class, the sections allow you to get all the help you need. Also, other students seem very helpful if you are ever confused on a particular subject.",
    "Yes- it is a solid, basic introductory econ class that you will have to take if you want to major in econ. It's interesting and has a great curve.",
    "This is a great class which is well taught. I learnt so much this semester and I would encourage anyone to take it.",
    "Take this class if it is not taught by Dean Karlan.",
    "Yeah. Necessary introductory course to economics.",
    "A background in economics is a good thing to have. If you're thinking of going into public policy probably a good course to take.",
    "Professor Karlan's ECON 115 was pretty good - this is not the class of your friends' horror stories. That said, it's definitely difficult. Overall, the class is informative and engaging, and you will learn a lot if you pay attention.",
    "Econ 115 was a typical intro econ class. I found the material interesting and thought it was well explained in lecture and in section. However, I felt that the professor didn't make a connection with many students and was often not in touch with what the students were thinking. He seemed to put minimal effort into getting to know hisstudents, but he did do a good job presenting the material.",
    "Take home final was long but much better than an in class final. Professor starts class late and let's you out late, which is very frustrating. Psets could be ridiculous at times, but most of the time they were pretty easy. TAs could be very obnoxious.",
    "It's an intro micro class: a problem set a week, a midterm, a take-home. This particular professor was well-intentioned but self-aggrandizing and unclear in his teaching of what is literally an intro class.",
    "I would not recommend it.",
    "I recommend Dean Karlan's lectures. They were super interesting, generally including a lot about his field of economics of the developing world. If you actually want to learn microecon, you should wait to take this course from someone else. Dean Karlan did not cover any of the microecon information in the sort of detail with which he expected us to understand it.",
    "If you are going to be an Econ major take it.",
    "Don't take it with Dean Karlan. Just don't, trust me. Dean Karlan was terrible professor. In addition to being exceedingly arrogant, his Powerpoints were often unhelpful, especially if you needed to go back through them. They need more explanation. His lectures were not related to the problem set, and if they were, it was after the problem set was due. The midterm and especially the final were ridiculous. They hardly tied into the class and were exceedingly difficult (probably for that reason...). A great mistake of mine.",
    "Great introduction to Economics, changes the way you think. Covers supply and demand of labour and goods, game theory (great subject), market types, opportunity cost and fixed costs, and all the rest.The professor, Dean Karlan is very good. He has a background in behavioural economics and shares many greatexamples from his work. He is pretty interesting and very clear, but occasionally stumbles over his words or when drawing graphs on the overhead. Also, he plays Seinfeld clips and gives out free stuff in games to illustrate game theory.The problem sets are fairly easy, but do take an hour and up. The sections are optional and vary in quality and can be really helpful towards the problem sets. Don't worry if you don't get into the one you wanted, as you can go to any section. It's just that your Psets are marked by the TA you choose.",
    "A course everyone should probably take just to understand the basics of economics. Lecture can get boring very easily however.",
    "It's kind of a course a would recommend because I think the material is important to know. But try to take it from a different professor because there are others that are far more effective at teaching material. The work-load is very low, except around exams and the night before problem sets are due, but I don't feel like I learned very much, and I'm definitely not confident in basic micro-econ concepts.",
    "I would recommend it as a good introduction to Econ.",
    "It's hard to mess up Introductory Microeconomics, but Dean Karlan managed to do so. Lectures were boring, not well organized, hard to follow, he messed up a lot, etc. Basically, this stuff really isn't that complicated, but he makes it really confusing. I guess if you need to take this class you need to take it, but definitely don't take it with him. And with a better teacher it might be worth taking even if you don't have to.",
    "I would take this class because I believe the material is useful and something that everyone should learn. However, do not take it with Professor Karlan. I have heard Professor Barry is much better.",
    "It's one of those necessary classes if you want to get to higher level economics. I'd recommend it, but I heard that the professor that taught it first semester was a little better.",
    "I would recommend it, however be prepared to spend a lot of time and effort on problem sets and outside of lecture work,",
    "I feel as though intro microeconomics should be a very fulfilling class, but this was not the case with Professor Karlan. There was an awful disconnect between the material on the exams\/problem sets and the material taught in class, which made it a frustrating experience overall.",
    "I would not recommend this course to you if you really want to learn economics. Either take it earlier or make sure you already know it before you come in here.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class to anyone. It's impossible to study material on your own if you don't have the slightest comprehension of what you're supposed to be doing. Perhaps with a teacher other than Professor Karlan, the class would have been less miserable for me.",
    "I recommend Econ 115, but if Karlan is teaching it, don't take it. His lectures are awesome, but the tests are crazy. You might want to sit in on his lectures for fun though!",
    "It is a good class to understand the basics of Microeconomics. I would recommend it only under the condition of having a good Teaching Assistant.",
    "Would recommendbut warn student that they have to be self motivated. Preferably, they will have already taken AP Micro Economics in high school.",
    "Take it if you're interested in it. The material, once you actually learn it, is cool, but lecture is not helpful at all.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not too difficult and is useful whether or not you are majoring in Econ.",
    "Bad class, which is still challenging. You don't learn much yet you are expected to know everything in detail.There is poor organization and it is difficult because since you learn nothing in lecture and section is confusing after such poor lectures, you need to learn a lot by yourself with the book which doesn't explain the math behind some essential concepts.i wouldn't recommend this class.",
    "Take this class. It gives you a new way to look at the world, and a better understanding of how people make decisions in society. In particular, take this class with Professor Karlan. He is awesome. The tests are pretty tough, but the material is rewarding.",
    "Make sure you enjoy the lectures and actually get something from them. Get yourself into a good TF section before it's too late! It makes all the difference in a large lecture course.",
    "I really respect Dean Karlan as a professor and I think he's honestly a great and sincere individual, but I think he needs to be more realistic as a professor. A take-home final in a class of 200+ people was not a good idea, especially since there was no check on what people could do outside of class. Moreover, the final should have been better written; many of the questions were vague and there were at least five separate emails sent out with clarifications\/corrections for typos on the final exam. It almost feels as if there was no review process whatsoever when writing these tests. Also, Prof Karlan's lectures tended to be really windy and off point (we focused too much on examples and things that Karlan specifically had done than on the quantitative part of Econ, which is the actual difficulty in the subject). Otherwise, though, I really respect the professor and believe he truly cares about his students.I think I learned a lot from this class but probably more because I didn't have any Econ knowledge going in than because of the strength of the course's organization.",
    "Very interesting, but please take Micro Econ in the fall. I do not feel as if I have a good enough grasp on the information to move on to Macro Econ.",
    "If Dean Karlan is teaching the class, don't take it. There's no point. The man is clearly an econ genius, but you'll learn more about introductory microeconomics by buying a textbook and reading it yourself. And the final exam was the worst test I've ever taken.... EVER",
    "Interesting class with a large number of students. Great professor.",
    "Confusing, difficult, and not particularly exciting. I had enjoyed microeconomics in high school and thought this would be a continuation, perhaps even a more difficult class than what I had taken. However, it ended up being more of an intermediate econ class, which was difficult to do, since we had not been taught any microeconomics. I would not recommend this class with this professor if you actually want to get a good foundational econ class.",
    "If you can, take the Fall course. Economics is an interesting subject that everyone should have a basic knowledge of, but it might not be worth it if you're not interested in the major at all. This class was so disorganized and it was an overall pain in my schedule. I don't regret taking it, but there were lots of issues.",
    "I would not recommend econ 115. The class is boring and so is the material. I ended up having to teach most of it to myself because it was not explained well.",
    "It was an okay course, which really came together when taking the final. The problem sets were a good mix of conceptual questions and math questions. I would recommend it to a student who was willing to go to all of the sections, because lecture does not always cover everything in the problem sets and midterms.",
    "I took an intro level econ class because I believe that everyone should understand some basic econ, but if econ is not your thing, this course can be excruciating. This class is necessary if you are considering econ as your major, but if you just want to learn a bit about the subject I can't say this is the class for you. As a humanities major, I don't think I'll take much away from this course.",
    "Take it if you must. If you need Intro Micro, try your best to get Steven Berry. You will not regret the decision.",
    "Take the course to understand the basics and if you want to be an econ major",
    "Dean Karlan is a fine professor. He had not taught the class in a while and I am unsure of whether we will continue to teach the course in subsequent years. We had problem sets each week (graded on a check plus to check minus scale), one midterm (that was fair), and a take-home, open-book final (which I believe was a bit difficult). I think that everyone should have some general knowledge of economics and, therefore, should take this course at some point in his or her Yale career. It is also required for many majors (mine being EP&E). People say that the course is easier in the Spring because most prospective economics majors take the class in the Fall as Freshman. This is probably true, but only to a certain degree.",
    "Not when taught by Dean.",
    "To be honest, I took the class as a requirement. It was a bit difficult for me - a surprise, since AP Microecon was much, much easier to follow and covered mostly the same material. Take it if you need the class or have interest in economics and how they can be applied. Do not think you need this in general.",
    "This class was uninteresting and really turned me off from pursuing econ as a major. I would recommend taking this class in the fall if you are interested because the class is better taught and not as hard.",
    "Don't take this with Karlan. He doesn't really care about the lecture so you basically don't learn anything except for the fact that he visits lots of developing countries and is involved with helping solve poverty. Which fine, good for him, but it doesn't teach you economics. Psets\/exams had basically nothing to do with lecture. If Brian is TAing again I would really recommend him, he was a sweetheart and really helpful.",
    "The lectures are engaging and very interesting. Its great how Karlan incorporates his own work into examples for the class. He makes the material very interesting. That with the generous curve make the class worth it. However, the sections, incoherent problem sets, and the naive and incompetent TAs make the class almost unbearably frustrating.",
    "Basic intro micro. I would recommend it to people, as it is important subject for people to know.",
    "Absolutely not. Maybe you should take this with another professor, I don't know. All I know is that Professor Karlan, while seeming to be a nice guy, has no idea how to teach another human being basic economics. He probably just knows it so well that he immediately wants to jump to the advanced stuff. Great, but you must spend all lecture time on building our conceptual foundation. The problem sets were abnormally difficult, even some TAs did not understand select problems. This course, taught by this professor, with these TAs was an embarrassment.In this course I felt like I had no control over my fate. No one taught how to apply math to the concepts, which was an integral part of the course. I felt frustrated in the first five minutes I tried to do each problem set.With poor organization and poor teaching ability, I give this course a rating of abysmal. If it were a book turned into a movie, it would be \"Misery.\"",
    "No. Do not take this course unless you hate yourself.",
    "take it. its a demandig course. you'll learn a fair bit. but you'll have to work.",
    "Great course; you'll never stop thinking opportunity cost for the rest of your life, and while the concepts at this level are admittedly oversimplications, they're immediately applicable. Whether you're continuing economics orjust taking as a QR\/survey course, it doesn't get much better than this. When I took the course, Dean Karlan was a somewhat polarizing: some loved him, some hated him; I think he did well, but taking it with Steven Berry has the slight advantage of experience. Don't delay it a semester just because of that though.",
    "Dean Karlan is a terrible professor. He goes on tangents and the psets are about the future material. He gave a take-home final that was useless because even though we had a lot of time to take it, it was 23 pages of completely random stuff that was too difficult to understand. I needed to take Econ 115, so I took this class. It's whatevs.",
    "Take econ 115 - the subject material is pretty interesting. Just not this one, with Dean Karlan. There are other lecturers who are much better.",
    "It's an interesting course, but if you took it like me not because you required it but to learn, keep it Credit\/D.",
    "This is an intro econ course, so it there really isn't much choice on whether you take intro econ or not. I do suggest that you try and take it with another professor if you really want to learn the material. I felt that while Dean Karlan was interesting, I did not learn as much as I wanted to during lecture (not even enough to answer the problem sets without TFs).",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 115 to another student, though not for the quality of teaching. Rather, I think it's just important enough of a subject that anyone at Yale ought to take it.dean karlan is a sweetheart but he is not the world's greatest teacher - on intro micro topics that is... when we were talking about microcredit and poverty alleviation, he was much more engaging... basically you can plan on teaching yourself the material if karlan teaches this again but its still worth itI really enjoyed section, but I know that most people in other sections didn't - Tf quality definitely varies, so I think it can kind of be a toss-up, especially since you dont know who is your TF before you choose a section. However, I really appreciated that Tae took the time to come to class with a lesson plan prepared. The topics he discussed always ended up being very helpful for the problem sets without directly giving away the answers . Especially since the prof apparently didn't mind that we did the problem sets before learning the material in class, having a good TA definitely reduced the amount of pain the p-sets caused. He was also very prompt with emails, etc, which sounds like it's not that big of a deal, but when you're sitting over your take-home final at 11pm the night before it's due and the head TF [Eric Becker]hasn't responded to a question you asked more than a week ago, this will definitely be a huge plus. so if he TFs this class again, definitely try to get him.",
    "you kind of have to take the course before taking anything else. it gives you a good introduction of many topics and is generally interesting.",
    "OK introductory class, but if its Karlan and there is a take-home final, do not take it. The test is brutal and some kids spend of 30 hours during finals week on it, ruins the class.",
    "A really fun introductory economics course, not just for the QR requirement. Would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in an economics major or in the social\/behavioral sciences.",
    "Economics 115 01 was a course that introduced the basics of microeconomics. The instruction of the course could have been improved but all in all my knowledge of economics was increased.",
    "The material is pretty interesting and lecture is great. However, the problem sets are often not related to the material covered in class so you will have to figure a lot of things out on your own.",
    "I recommend taking it with Karlan if you are interested less in the math and more in the concepts and concrete, real-world examples. The math is often not explained and only necessary for the p-sets and parts of the final.",
    "Take it, because it treats important concepts which are relevant to everyday life and help understand lots of events happening in the world. Also, I find that everyone should have a background in Econ, despite the major. Don't be prepared to take either the best or the worst class out there - take it because it is important and relevant.",
    "This course was hard to follow and difficult to sit through. The tests were way harder than the material we learned in class, to the point where it was mind boggling why the professor would do this to us (and I actually studied and read the text book). Still, there were some really stellar TAs that were very helpful. You HAVE to find a good tutor and go to tutoring. With tutoring, however, you'll be sure to do fine in the class.",
    "Don't take this course with Professor Karlan if you can avoid it. Take the seminar or take it with S. Berry. It does not do a good job of explaining concepts clearly and gives you very little incentive to learn the material with a take home final and absurdly inflationary midterm curve.",
    "I think it's really important to know about economics so even if you don't like the class I think you should take it to know the information.",
    "It depends on whether or not you mind reading a textbook.",
    "I would not recommend that any Yale student take this class.",
    "Take it if you need it, but be warned it's not an easy A. The teacher, though not incompetent, often makes mistakes and you often have to teach yourself.",
    "Do not take Intro Micro with Dean Karlan. There's nothing wrong with the material -- economics is great to take at some point in college -- but Karlan was one of the WORST and MOST AGGRAVATING professors I have ever had, and it simply isn't worth it.Problems:1. Very disjointed lectures that are hard to follow.2. Inaccessible professor who lacks self-awareness.3. TAs who really don't want to be there and simply don't care.4. Zero communication between the TAs and Prof. Karlan, so lots of internal administrative confusion and mistakes (THEY LOST BOTH MY MIDTERM AND SOME OF MY PROBLEM SETS!!)5. Ridiculously confusing and difficult problem sets that had absolutely no connection to lecture. It really just felt like random mathematical stuff they felt like throwing onto the problem set. I never once learned anything from a problem set.6. Absurdly LONG midterm and final exam. These people are crazy if they think that is appropriate. It was almost laughably long.If this isn't enough negative stuff for you to stay away from this course, I don't know what to tell you. Yes, it is good to take micro econ at some point. I just really hope you don't have to take it with Prof. Karlan.",
    "I've heard better things about the fall course. The class can be unnecessarily confusing and longwinded.",
    "I'm sure it's a good class but do not take it with Dean Karlan.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. Karlan is not a good professor and the problem sets are super annoying. You don't learn what you need to know for the midterm or final, so just do yourself favor and stay away. Seriously, I could've learned more economics at the community college in my hometown.",
    "This class covers the basics of micro: supply\/demand, utility, budget constraints\/indifference curves, labor, consumer choice, basic game theory, etc. It's not a hard class but it's not a joke either. Go to sections and you'll be set.",
    "Good intro class",
    "I would not recommend it. The disparity between lecture and section, the rushed nature of section, the in-approachability of the TFs, the disastrous take-home final which invited cheating and took far longer than anticipated - all make this class NOT worthwhile.",
    "Wait until there is a better professor, I guess it's somehow useful to know something about economics",
    "Terrible. Dean Karlan gave us a take home final that was the most ridiculous, most ambiguous thing ever as some sort of sick game theory experiment. I didn't learn much at all. You are better off taking another lecture class taught by a more sane professor.",
    "I feel like I will always use the information I learned in Econ and that it was a necessary course. It was generally interesting, although some lectures felt superfluous. Dean Karlan knew his area of expertise (poverty and econ) well but often got caught up in exceptions rather than focusing on the basics and that math. Tests were difficult but curved generously.",
    "No, I would not because the information was difficult enough without having a teacher teach it, and most learning is done when not in class.",
    "I mean, it's intro econ.",
    "If you are a prospective Economics major, ECON 115 is a requirement; however, if possible, I would recommend taking it in the fall with the seminars. If you are not taking ECON 115 as a required course, however, I highly recommend not taking it with Dr. Karlan. Although you will learn to view the world through the lens of economics, much of your knowledge will be self-taught, as Dr. Karlan is, to be frank, a poorteacher. The class has no connection to the homework assignments and midterm\/final exams; in fact, you can perform reasonably well even with a shoddy attendance record.",
    "I would recommend the course for a good QR, provided you take it with a professor who understands that he\/she has to teach the basic concepts in order for his\/her students to understand them. I've heard Steven Berry is very good. With Dean Karlan I did learn a fair amount of interesting stuff, but it was not at all intro micro economics, but rather developmental econ (what he's interested in). In any case, yeah, take it!",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!",
    "Never have I found a class so simultaneously interesting and frustrating. Karlan uses a development framework to make econ more engaging, but what he teaches in class is void of material that makes this class a QR; that all came from section.",
    "Overall I felt like the course was really unstructured. Therewas little relationship between the textbook, the lectures, and the problem sets, and thus it felt like the problem sets were impossible at times and there was just a lot of disconnect between what we were learning. The material that was covered in the problem sets were also often covered in class after the problem sets, again creating a strange disconnect in learning the material. It definitely would have been improved if we were using a textbook that related to the material in the problem set, since I also often had trouble understanding parts of the lectures.",
    "Yes. everyone should know how the market works.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Economics 115 was a good class and I learned a lot. However, lecture was boring, and the problem sets weren't too fun either. I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in economics. If you're not, there are other easier QR's to take.",
    "I enjoyed this class. Karlan was an interesting professor. He did tests on the class to prove different theorems, we watched funny video clips, and he was very good at explaining different graphs.Not too much work, just one problem set a week. Make sure you go to section\/get a good section teacher because this helps with the problem sets. With Karlan the psets were also just graded on a check\/check pluc\/check minus system which removed a lot of stress from psets.",
    "Covers the basic principles of microeconomics. I would not recommend this class to other students, solely because the teacher and head TA were terrible. I think that it is important for students of any discipline to have a basic knowledge of economics, but definitely do not take this class with Dean Karlan. I have heard that the fall instructor is much better - take the class with him instead.",
    "Only take it if you have to!",
    "Econ 115 is an introductory course, meaning it lays down principles and basic ideas of econ. There are times when it is extremely boring and confusing but that just comes with the territory. If any classes beyond intro to micro interest you than take it to get beyond it by all means.",
    "While I personally liked the material presented in this class, Econ 115 was not well organized this semester. Lecture topics often carried over into the next lecture and picked back up without much review, and Professor Karlan often skipped from topic to topic without much connection or clarity. The TFs did not seem to be particularly organized during lecture and there were many mistakes made during class activities and in problem sets. Even the final exam had to be revised multiple times after it was sent out to students. The problem sets were frequently unfair and covered material that was not presented during lecture\u0097I would have been lost if not for my great section leader. However, I liked the class overall. Professor Karlan always started lectures with activities involving students that were fun and kept me interested. Karlan would also insert videos throughout his lectures that were a nice break and a good connection to class material. It took a few weeks for Professor Karlan to find a comfortable style, but once he did, he was a good lecturer with many years of expertise and many examples of cool research to connect the class topics with the real world. Finally, if Brian Baisa is a TF for this class or another economics class, choose him as your section leader! He was very clear and always willing to explain things in a different way. He volunteered his time to hold review sessions and was extremely quick with e-mail responses, which were always elaborate, complete, and extremely helpful answers to any question I had.",
    "I'm not sure how it is with other professors, but expect to learn most of the material on your own through the textbook. Sections are generally disorganized, but the TAs can be somewhat helpful.",
    "Take this class, but try to do so with another instructor.",
    "I would not if Dean Karlan is teaching, he is pompous, dreadful, patronizing, and incompetent. But otherwise, econ can be a fun course, and I learned a lot (if only from the textbook).",
    "if you wanna do the econ route, its intro micro, so no way around it. helps if you took econ in high school.",
    "ECON 115 is a good introduction to the subject of economics. I would recommend it to most students at Yale who have reasonable abilities in mathematics.",
    "Personally, I loved this class, but I know most other people didn't feel that way. I took econ because I needed it for my major and I thought it might be interesting. Most people say that Steve Barry is the better lecturer, but I am truthfully glad I had Karlan instead. He's not the most organized prof, but he is genuinely socially conscious and for me, that made a difference in how I experienced econ. He truly cares about stuff like poverty and he teaches econ with a bend towards how econ can be used in everyday life to fix large world issues. He's also just a really chill guy so, honestly, I really liked this class. Lectures were generally (though not always, I almost feel asleep a few times) interesting. Psets were impossible to do without help from the TF's and the final was very hard. However, there is a pretty hefty curve that tends to make up for how hard PSets and the tests are. If you do your work, it should be fine. And if you are interested in international relations, government, or just in how econ applies to bigger issues, econ with Karlan might be something you enjoy.",
    "Take this if you need to for your major, otherwise, DO NOT. In retrospect, I would rather have gotten three vaccinations for malaria daily than to take this class.",
    "Solid course. Felt like I got a strong foundation for the rest of my courses."
