    "I would recommend CHNS 132 to a listening-proficient Chinese-American who would like to improve his\/her Chinese. Previous reading, writing, and speaking experience would be beneficial, but are unnecessary. CHNS 132 is a fast-paced but manageable course with a stellar professor; Liu laoshi is extremely gracious, and generous with sharing her own experiences and listening to ours during class conversations and oral presentations. Text& reading and grammar& structure are reviewed separately for each lesson(\/story in the book). There are exams every three weeks, a daily quiz on the words and text from the night before, homework every day, a short essay and accompanying oral presentation approximately every week, and a final exam.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's not difficult to do well if you try, and it's a good way to get your basic reading and writing started.",
    "If you're taking Chinese 132, you were probably placed in it and you should definitely take it. It is a bit time consuming, but none of the work is really too difficult. Everything is straightforward and you'll get a good grade if you put in the time.",
    "Chinese 132 was sooooo much fun! It's really not that much work (hw and memorizing characters would be ~ 1 hr outside of class, not bad!) and class itself is fun and engaging. I can tell my chinese has improved already and it's only been a semester!",
    "Yes, 132 is a great class if you are a native speaker and want to learn Chinese.",
    "Great class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students who were in the same position as me: unable to write chinese well, but speaking it semi-regularly at home."
