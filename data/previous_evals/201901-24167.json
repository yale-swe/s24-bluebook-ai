   "comments": [
    "Strengths - bolstering my scientific communication skills and allowing me to form bonds with my PEB cohort Weaknesses - some of the faculty choices were not great, made some of the sessions dry or otherwise intolerable; the time (4 hours a week is a LOT for a graduate student trying to manage research and four other courses)",
    "Strengths: - Covers a wide range experimental techniques - Discussing experimental results with researchers who work in the field is insightful in understanding their significance Weaknesses: - Given the wide range of backgrounds of students in the class, it was regularly an issue that we were unsure of what components of the paper were critical to understand, making the student session entirely unproductive. A simple bullet-point document highlighting what is considered significant in the paper before reading it would be helpful for this and would make the learning process much more effective. I understand that a write-up mentioning what components of a research work are significant and should be read carefully is not representative of reading research papers in a professional setting, but one also doesn't usually read papers in fields completely foreign to them.",
    "Out of the six weeks, I only found two of them to be particularly interesting. The neuroscience week did not seem very relevant to the rest of the class."
