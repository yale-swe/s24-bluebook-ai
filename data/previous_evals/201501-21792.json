    "This is a perfect continuation of the fall course. With less focus on history, and more on politics, you learn a ton about the origins and development of modern political theory. The course builds well, and is definitely worth taking.",
    "DS Historical and Political Thought covers thinkers from Machiavelli to Arendt, from the fifteenth century to the twentieth, from the Renaissance to World War II, exposing us to a sequence of writers whose ideas influenced each other and were influenced by thinkers we discussed in the fall semester. I would recommend it to all students curious about the origin of our political ideas today and how ideas impact other thinkers and reflect the course of history, as well as to those who feel that they would like an expanded knowledge of intellectual history to accompany the political, economic, social, and military history that is common in high school.",
    "The books are excellent, and relate to each other in extremely powerful and important ways. Professor Slanski is a capable and experienced reader of the texts, and you couldn't ask for anyone better to walk you through them. Section discussions are very structured. On the one hand, that's a good thing, because the insights Professor Slanski pushes us towards are always valuable. However, it can also feel a bit stifling, and it sometimes feels difficult to get your own ideas on the table. Also, be warned: there are clear favorites. Some are called on immediately, others only as a last resort. This can be a bit frustrating. The papers were graded hard, but she did everything she could to provide support and guidance as we wrote them (writing workshops, etc.). Intense, but a great experience if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "Yes! Take it with Professor Slanski if you can.",
    "Quintessential Directed Studies class.",
    "Professor Slanski will push her students and challenge them. She did so for me, and for that I am thankful."
