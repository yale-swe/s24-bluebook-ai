   "comments": [
    "Super easy to get a B+\/A-, hard to get an A",
    "Yes. Its a class you must take while at Yale.",
    "A good course for anyone with little or no experience in international politics that wants a basic understanding.",
    "I would recommend it to someone only if they are interested in the subject of international relations. If you are not, it will be pretty boring and there is no way you will do all the reading. That being said, even if you are interested in it, it is difficult to do all of the reading (because there is a TON) but don't worry - you don't really have to. I found myself picking and choosing which readings to do, and that was sufficient. As a class, it's definitely a great overview of international relations. If you want to understand the New York Times international section, take this class - I definitely feel much more informed about what is happening in the world today so I would say that made this class worth it. Some people will say it's a gut class but realize that you still have to do some work and actually study a lot to do well on the exams.",
    "Take it...easy no work",
    "Lots of reading, but interesting subject matter. If you already have a strong interest in the information though, it might not provide much for you.",
    "A decent enough course; light workload, and Professor Howorth is an interesting lecturer.",
    "It is a good class to take if you are wondering about current events in politics and how we have gotten there.",
    "i really liked this class and now enjoy taking a role in dinner politics, it really got me up to speed....",
    "Polisci 111 is a great class- take it if you have any interest at all in the subject, and consider taking it even if you don't, especially if Howorth is teaching it. The lectures are great- both well-delivered and interesting. There isn't too much reading assigned, and what is assigned is covered in lecture anyway. No papers are assigned, but this means that basically your entire grade (except for section participation) is based on your test scores. Not that that's a bad thing- the tests aren't too hard.",
    "Solid. After taking this class reading the newspaper is like reading a soap opera--every day you understand what's going on and you can follow it and get it.",
    "I found this course to be very interesting and would certainly recommend it.",
    "This is an overview of international relations. I would recommend this class. It's interesting and not very hard.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for another student because it truly helped broaden my knowledge about the international stage.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "The course starts with survey of the theory behind IR and then goes into case studies that show how IR actually works. We would usually have about 100 pages of readingsevery week. Most of the time they were interesting and not too much of a pain. The most important thing is that they are always up to date and reflect the most recent events on the global scene.We had a few guest lecturers and that's always nice.!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One thing that you should know: all the grading is done by the TAs, not only the participation part. The exams are in-class essays and all of them will be graded by the TA of a given section.",
    "This was a nice way to learn about the world, how countries interact, and really understand the theories and bigger picture ideas behind IR. Not teribly hard, but also not as big of a gut class as it used to be.",
    "A broad overview of the major theories\/topics in IR. Essential to understanding the current situation and a must-take for anybody who is interested in IR.",
    "Intro to international relations. pretty much it",
    "I would recommend it as a basic overview course that doesn't require much time outside of lecture.",
    "Yes because its very interesting",
    "YES! Please take it.",
    "A worthwhile course to take if you want a good introduction on foreign policy and relations as well as if you want to learn about current events.",
    "YES. It's a class everyone should take.",
    "Helps you to understand the basic dynamics of current events now.",
    "An excellent course to get a sense of international relations in our modern world. I learned a LOT and feel like a much more aware citizen. You don't need to know everything covered in the class for tests \u0097\u00a0just a couple things very thoroughly.",
    "Class consists of a series of powerpoint slide lectures. It seems rather monotonous after a while, especially since the professor does not enrich the lectures with any video clips....which seems odd in that a class about world issues might want to include current clips about world events happening at the moment. It's one thing to incessantly read about leaders interacting and nations negotiating and grassroots activism and another to actually see it happening. 2 midterms and 1 final, all specific and ALWAYS about IR theories, which seems like overkill and too much extrapolation and speculation when it comes to evaluating actual events.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in international relations. It' straightforward, interesting material.",
    "Take this class: lectures are engaging, readings are minimal but interesting, tests are easy, and Howorth's British accent is fantastic. But, you will still learn a lot: the class strikes a good balance between theory and fact. You get a good, more holistic understanding of what's going on in the world and why, filling in holes in your knowledge. NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS: most of you know much more about the world than the average American, and most international students seem to already know almost all of what we learn. Howorth also brings in great guest lecturers, whose names you will begin to regularly see in the New York Times.",
    "study of how international states operate with one another. yes, would recommend",
    "I recommend this class as a nice introduction to international relations and current events.",
    "Really good overview course, doesn't really have any drawbacks if you're looking to understand more about how the world works and where international relations is headed.",
    "A great introduction to what is going on in the world through the lens of international relationships",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro to International Relations because I feel much more comfortable talking about controversial global issues now that I have a good background knowledge and opinion on many issues than I did before. I feel more in touch with the differing theories and conflicts that have occurred or are occurring in our international system. Very helpful and a must take!",
    "Yes, you learn a lot and its not a lot of work at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend IR to anybody. Unless you feel like you already have a good understanding of the international system, take this class. you will learn a lot of important stuff. especially if you are a poli sci major.",
    "A good overview of international relations that was not too hard. If you dont keep up to date on current events or would like to know more about IR theories, takes this class because it is not too much work and the tests are fairly easy",
    "if you don't understand what's happening in the world at all, take the class. if you have a basic understanding, don't.",
    "Great course if you're interested in International Relations and know nothing about it. It's an overall awesome course because it's interesting, fairly easy, and Prof. Howorth is cool. The midterms weren't as long as you did some of readings and paid attention in class. Some may find this class a little too boring and simple, though.",
    "It's a typical Intro IR course. Not difficult. May be too easy for a person who's already been exposed.",
    "Necessary to provide foundations for motives for international relations, good-class if you operate well without hands-on assistance in learning the course material",
    "intro I.R. is a class you need to take for other political science classes and you should take it.",
    "It is an easy class. There are only three tests including the final. Definitely take the class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I looked forward to lecture everyday, as the material is fascinating. The readings aren't too long, and they are engaging. Anyone who wants an opportunity to increase their understanding of the world in which we live should take this class. You will enjoy it.",
    "You learn about the world powers and how they relate through political and international theory. Good class for freshman.",
    "I would say that it is class about the broad concepts of international relations. I would recommend the course because it is very comprehensive but yet not too demanding in a busy schedule.",
    "Yes. Take it",
    "I would recommend IR to students who don't know very much about current events. It's a great intro class because Professor Howorth is a very engaging lecturer; he covers many interesting topics that can be seen in our world today.",
    "Intro IR opens you up to the present ambiguity of modern global politics by taking you through the past century that has led us to where we are today.Take it.",
    "yes, easy class",
    "This is a great introduction to international theory and the international system. It helps to have a knowledge of the history of conflicts such as the Gulf War, the Iraq War and the Cold War but it's not necessary. If you're looking for an interesting and informational class where you learn worthwhile material and it doesn't require much work, this is the class for you. I took this class in order to be a more informed citizen of the world and feel that that is true. I find myself reading the news more and think I want to major in Poli Sci.",
    "This is a good introductory political science course. The TAs worked hard this year to make it less of a \"gut\" than it has been in the past. Howorth is very knowledgeable and entertaining, but lectures don't go into too much depth about the topics he discusses (simply because of time constraints.) Overall, an interesting course.",
    "It's a good intro class to take Freshman or Sophomore year, but if you're older, it's really only useful as an easy 5th class that you don't want to really go to that often (cause he posts the lectures online and there are a ton of notes for it).",
    "Interesting, not too difficult, take it if you are at all interesting in the subject.",
    "I recommend this class for anyone who hasn't had the opportunity to take a politics class before and is interested in international issues. You will not get a lot of depth or a deep understanding of all the topics covered. What you will learn is how the international system has evolved over time, as well as theories that have been formed to explain observations such as the presence of war (and also why major wars are on the decline). This is a great foundation to understanding world news and it is up to you to take what you have learned and form your own analysis and opinions (something that you don't have much of an opportunity to do in this class, in my opinion).",
    "It depends. A lot of the information you really could learn just by keeping up with the New York Times and Wall Street Journal with regards to actual relations between states. However, the one thing which this course helped elucidate was the basis of actual theories which have shaped international relations. So, if you are more interested in the theoretical foundations of IR and how such have been, are being, and might be applied this course was very interesting.Similarly, although this is an intro course and I'm a senior with a lot of political science exposure, this is not an easy course. I studied a pretty good amount and still was just barely getting by at the low A level. The exams are graded quite difficultly unless you cite the reading material which I often did not do.",
    "It is a great international relations course. You learn about a lot of current topics and feel like you have a better understanding of world politics and leaders. I would definitely recommend this intro course because I really enjoyed it!",
    "You might hear of this as a gut class, but it's actually very very interesting and the professor is very good. You can get by without doing a lot of work, but if you have a good section and you actually want to learn the material, the readings are interesting and the subject matter is very engaging. I feel like I came away with a really good basic understanding of world affairs, which is what I wanted. It's also a good schedule balancer because you can totally get by without doing much if you need to, and all the slides are posted online. I would say if you're looking for a class to make reading the newspaper more interesting or you feel like you need to know more about the world and want a good grounding in one semester, this is the class to take. (This term I heard bad things about Intro to Global Affairs, so choose this over that.)",
    "I would recommend the class to someone looking for a general summary of current events. The class was very enjoyable and the readings were generally interesting. This was especially true towards the end of the class, when we started to move off the textbook.",
    "Yes, it gives a good basic foundation for political science by explaining the roots of ongoing conflicts. You leave more knowledgable about the world and current issues.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in the general understanding of world politics and relation between countries. The lectures can get boring, however, the coursework is not too demanding and the class is helpful for understanding the general standing of world politics at the time.",
    "I would recommend it if someone is looking for an introductory class for a poly sci major.",
    "If you want to have a basic knowledge about the Middle East, Russia, China, the European Union, and the United Nations, take this class. It's not too challenging, but if you put in enough effort, you can learn. If you're looking to cover these topics in depth or at a challenging level, keep searching.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class particularly because of it real world applications.",
    "Really easy class - most of the material should be general knowledge for anyone who reads a newspaper.",
    "yes. You learn a lot about current and recent events",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class while you're at Yale. It isn't too time intensive and is an easy A if you put in the effort and study for exams.",
    "I would absolutely recommend for someone to take this class, because it forces you to learn a lot about what is going on in the world.",
    "Intro to IR is not a gut. You have to go to section, know what's going on, and work your way through some debates and assignments. It really depends on your TA. I had Bonny, or Yang Lin, who was a little tough with requirements but a FANTASTIC TA who reviewed all of the material before tests. Other TAs just covered topics briefly, but Bonny sent out review notes and held helpful office hours where she walked through essays. Her sections always had the highest averages, and she likes to she her students succeed. I heard Adif is also good. Be wary of the easy TAs; when tests came around, those students did much worse than those in other sections. Overall, I loved the course, and while I don't think it was a gut class, it was not that hard at all. You really don't have to do much of the reading, but you should be familiar with the major articles that come up like Kaldor's New Wars orMandelbaum's piece or some Nuclear Non-Proliferation article. Joloyn Howorth is also a brilliant and funny man!",
    "It's an easy class. Only two midterms and a final. Interesting enough material.",
    "Introduction to international dynamic and specific cases that shape the international sphere today, yesterday and tomorrow.Yes I would highly recommend taking this class as I feel it is knowledge that all students at Yale should have about the world in an increasingly globalized world.",
    "Yes-an interesting course that anyone remotely interested in its topics should take.",
    "This class is a great introduction to international relations. If you are considering a future in political science, this is a great starter class. Otherwise, it was an incredibly interesting class that I really enjoyed going to.",
    "Yes. I feel that most people should be aware of international relations.",
    "This class is very interesting and includes a number of very current topics, such as Iraq, China and Afghanistan. The work load is more than manageable and a lot of fun. Definitely take this class.",
    "This course is a great way to become more knowledgeable about current global affairs, and it allows you to look at the world's relations with a new analytical view. I would recommend PLSC 1111 to another student because it is interesting and the work load is definitely manageable.",
    "Great course if you're looking for a class that's really interesting, applicable to real life but not too hard. There is a lot of reading if you choose to do it, but it really makes no difference because the lectures are very comprehensive. However, I found the readings to be very interesting and recommend doing them if only for the sake of learning a lot about international relations. One of my favorite parts of the course was that it wasn't at all US-centric as many other ir-classes at yale tend to be, it gives a perspective that is much more European. Warning: there is a lot of history and especially theory involved, so don't take this class as a substitute for reading the economist, it is much more about gaining a deeper understanding of ir than learning facts and current events.",
    "It's a good class. Not too much work and interesting lectures.",
    "Depending on your interest in the material, it can be a great class. It's an intro level course so everything is very basic and can seem dull at times. Some people will tell you to either go to lecture or do the readings--go to lecture. The readings can be done a few nights before the midterms and lectures are much more interesting. It's a great 5th class and you'll gain a better understanding of international relations and conflicts such as US\/China, Israel\/Palestine and Iraq.",
    "No. It's way too broad and it covers way too many topics. And the reading is so overwhelming that most of the class doesn't even do it.",
    "take it and make sure you have a good TF.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for a fellow student. It is a really good intro to current topics in IR, and as a bonus one learn about the big theories in IR today.",
    "Must-take class at yale - low workload, you'll learn a lot about the world around you. And if you already know a lot, it'll be an easy class that reviews relations between states across the world.",
    "Absolutely, necessary to understand what is going on in the world.",
    "Intro IR is a great intro class to the Poly Sci discipline with a smaller amount of work compared to other classes.",
    "Yes",
    "I recommend this class if your only criterion is that you want a class that isn't very difficult. Otherwise I'd steer clear of it.",
    "The class is interesting, but Prof. Howorth is amazing. He is the most engaging lecturer. The class isn't difficult, go to class and take notes on the fascinating lectures and you will do fine. This was my favorite class I've taken this semester. It focuses on theories of IR pretty heavily the first part of class then focuses on different case studies and institutions.",
    "The course was great, providing a great introduction to IR field. The first half of the class deals a lot with theory and certain broad general issues such as humanitarian intervention, and international law. The second half was more geared towards the more practical affairs and global issues. The exams were not too diffilcult and the readings interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It gives you a good background into the study of international relations. Also, it is based on current issues that everybody should be familiar with.",
    "I absolutely loved this course and I would recommend it to anyone. The topics are interesting and relevant and its a great general overview of international relations. There's not too much work and Professor Howorth is phenomenal. My warning would be that most people took as a joke and didn't do readings or even attend the lectures. It may seem feasible but trust me, it reflects in your grade. They were left disappointed every midterm.To get an A, you've got to put in the effort. There's two midterms and a final, which aren't bad at all, and there's always so many options that you're guaranteed some degree of success.",
    "I would summarize the class as an introduction to world politics. Unless you feel comfortable with your knowledge of abroad affairs, I would definitely recommend this course simply to be a well informed citizen. It certainly peaked my interest in international diplomacy. Also, the course is only two mid terms and final that are not too challenging if you just go over your lecture notes.",
    "It's an easy class, but a very interesting one. It goes over the basic issues in IR and is great ust as one to explore them with. Despite the large class, Professor Honworth remains engaging.",
    "This class was interesting as an intro class. I didn't know anything about international relations, and now I feel that I have a much better sense of where things stand with regards to many different issues. Sometimes the lectures seemed a bit obvious or simple, but I felt that there was a lot of interesting information there as well. The class is practically no work, and the grading is very easy, so this is a great class if you're looking to fill out your schedule with something light. If you do all ofthe readings (there is a very reasonable amount of them), you will be extremely prepared for the test, nothing much more is necessary. If you don't do all of them, you can still probably manage. I definitely felt that I got something substantial out of this class.",
    "Only if you're really interested and do the readings and apply yourself. if you dont do all that, its super easy to get an A-, but you will feel like you didnt learn anything.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in politics or international relations and you like essay tests. The course is not too difficult, but if international relations dosen't interest you then it will be very monotonous I'm really glad I took this course; I feel like I can read a newspaper now and understand what's going on. Professor Howorth is passionate, but he does not make his lectures super intriguing. Lots of readings are assigned, but you don't need to do all of them.",
    "I would summarize Intro to IR as a great introductory class to political science theory and some current applications. I would definitely recommend this class to another student if Professor Howorth was still the lecturer. His lectures were informative, funny, and dealt with current events. I would let another student know that this class, while a good class, is not necessary to take if you are seriously interested in pursuing political science as a possible major.",
    "This class was very doable and was a great introduction on how the international system works.",
    "Good to take"
