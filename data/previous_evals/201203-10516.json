   "comments": [
    "CHEM 527 was a good supplementary organic class. On its own, this class might not be the most informative. However, this class does depend on previous knowledge and reinforces connections between concepts.",
    "Good practice and refresher for various organic reaction mechanisms.Yes, for practice.",
    "Read topics before going to class in order put perspective on problems.",
    "Meet once a week for two hours, work on some mechanism problems. Self-explanatory.",
    "This course must be taken by all chemistry grad students.",
    "I would recommend this course to any organic chemistry student. It provides exposure to a lot of basic and advanced chemistry concepts and reactions, and helps develop problem solving and presentation skills.",
    "Because we weren't tested on anything in this class, I didn't end up learning very much. It was also pretty stressful at times. However I still think this is a valuable course for first year students, maybe in their second semesters.",
    "I would recommend this class. This class provides some insight into how reactions are working behind the scenes but you will have to do extra work outside of class if you want to really learn the reactions. Many were seen just one time through out the year and none of the classes really built off one another making it difficult to remember many of the named reactions.",
    "In Fundamental Organic Reaction Mechanisms, students solve three to four organic mechanism problems in the first portion of the class period and then review the solutions in the second half. I would not recommend taking this class as it is not a thorough mechanism class, but more of a study hall for organic mechanisms often lacking in depth discussion of why mechanisms occur the way they do.",
    "too easy.",
    "I would recommend this course to any graduate student or upper-level undergraduate seeking to pursue chemistry as a career. This course is highly useful not only for organic chemists, but for all fields of chemistry.",
    "This course required no extra work, but was fairly anxiety provoking. I would recommend it to students interested in chem bio, organic chem, and inorganic chem."

   "comments": [
    "Although this class did impart some new knowledge, this class is useful because it ties different concepts together, and encourages a greater understanding of reaction mechanisms.",
    "Better understanding of various reaction mechanisms and a useful refresher of those I've learnt before.",
    "Practice writing out organic reaction mechanisms. It's good practice, even though not many mechanisms were covered.",
    "It helped me in understanding reaction mechanisms better.",
    "This class helped me understand some reasons why reactions occur the way they do which may help me explain why similar chemical reactions are working as they do.",
    "good way to review some kind of reactions.",
    "This course was very useful toward the advancement of my understanding of reaction mechanisms, and without a doubt will help me in future courses as well as in my research throughout my time at Yale."
