    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Great discussion leader, but the amount of grading was a lot for one person, so feedback was a bit slow, but that isn't against against Chelesa, just a reflection of the ration of number of students in the class for one TA.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0The teaching assistant was very knowledgeable, articulate, and put a lot of time into the sessions and helping students. I went to her office hours, which were very helpful, and she was always very response to emails and gave great feedback. I learned a lot from her.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0I believe she needs to be more confident to be a better teacher. She seems to have a lot of knowledge she could share.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Chelsea is a great TA. Great teacher in section, responsive to questions, and provides feedback on written work.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0She can recap what Ben discusses, but did not really go much beyond that in terms of explaining concepts. Then again, the concepts weren't that complicated and didn't necessarily need more explanation.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Chelsea did a really good job of condensing the concepts discussed during lecture. She organized useful exercises to apply what we discussed in class. She was also very open to answering questions.",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Chelsea was great!",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Chelsea was knowledgeable and an effective leader of group discussions. Her sections were always well organized and thought-through. However, the feedback we received on our quizzes\/policy memo was insufficient, in my opinion. Her feedback didn't further my understanding of the topics.",

    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Strengths: -Between her knowledge of the subject matter and ability to better understand Professor Cashore, Chelsea was a good translator of the readings and lectures. -Chelsea was always flexible in the sessions she led. Based on the desires of the class, she would choose to do the planned activity or review topics from class. To work on: -Would it be possible to better help Professor Cashore organize his thoughts and lectures?",
    "Instructor: Chelsea Elizabeth Judy \u00a0Chelsea was very good at explaining very complex concepts from class in discussions. She was very creative in using non-environmental examples from current events to illustrate the concepts and this fostered good discussion in section. It was a nice complement to the often abstract and sometimes convoluted class lectures.",

    "Professor Cashore is clearly very brilliant, but sometimes it can be hard to follow what is going on in his head. I don't think he talks too fast, but sometimes he talks without giving proper context, so it leaves students feeling a little confused.",
    "This class was helpful for getting to know the actual framework for developing and designing policies to solve problems, but some of the conceptual material was hard to understand. I really like Prof. Cashore's lectures, but they were a little disorganized. I think a more organized schedule for the class would have been helpful for maybe making the class \"flow\" a little better. Other than that, I really enjoyed the material we covered and Prof. Cashore's stories and analogies.",
    "Good to know how policy is created.",
    "The professor was very knowledgeable and I learned a lot from his lectures and readings.",
    "This class had a lot of potential--important topics, somewhat interesting readings, and relevant assignments. However, I thought the instructor was rather disorganized during lectures, which made the course disorienting. He tried to fit way too much material into lectures and slides, so by the end, he would be pounding away at the space bar just to get to the end. As a result, it was difficult to understand what lectures were about at the end of classes.",
    "I think this class in theory is incredibly valuable to students interested in advocacy or policy-making, but it was not delivered in an effective way. Ben is a brilliant person who I suspect is great in one-on-one interactions and problem-solving, but his lectures were scattered, way too focused on tangential anecdotes, and lacked any kind of concrete or \"actionable\" takeaways. Likewise with the reading - I understand the value in having people read political science theory but I also think this class was misrepresented, especially by being labeled a foundations class. It should have political science in the title so people understand what they're going to get into.",
    "The professor might consider re-tailoring the reading selection for the course-- the readings were often very dense and not necessarily the most relevant. Additionally, the evaluative assignments, including the reading quizzes, midterm, final, and policy paper, should be reconsidered. It might benefit the students to focus primarily on the policy paper.",
    "I did not get a lot out of this course. I felt that the classes were very disorganized as the semester progressed. Many times I was not able to follow the professors' lecture. I do not have a background in policy and this class was more geared towards people who do have some background."

    "Found section to be not particularly useful; would've preferred not to do so many simulations and group exercises",
    "If this is a foundations course, there should be more applicable concepts rather than theoretical concepts. It was hard to understand some of the theory without previous policy experience.",
    "I think that this course is too theoretical. I expected to learn more about how environmental policy works in the real world, and not just how it works in the minds of academics. It is good to get some theory, but most of us are going to be practitioners, so a more practical approach would be appreciated. I liked what was covered in the policy primer, because it was a good and simple way frame of how policy is made. However, I didnt find much value in the other readings. Some were good, but most seemed to be the work of academics who have never made policy. It is good to have a theoretical framework to rely on, but often I could not find how the theories connect with reality.",
    "Cover more topics of environmental policy.",
    "A bit disorganized and hectic at times. I think there were approximately 4 or 5 different versions of the syllabus released throughout the semester.",
    "Cover more of the lecture slides in each class. Assign reading that is actually discussed in class. Little motivation for doing some of the extra long readings.",
    "It would be useful to have more guest speakers, since they were really great to hear and helped illuminate some of the concepts we talked about in lecture.",
    "The instructor needs to learn how to effectively teach (i.e. be more organized during lectures) the materials of the course. Otherwise, the course was fine.",
    "More clarity from the Professor. Although this improved very much in the end. Too many readings to do well. More help in \"digesting\" the readings would be useful.",

    "I think case studies carried out over the course of the semester would be really helpful. Reading direct policy texts might also be an interesting exercise.",
    "The class was disorganized and the readings were dull and dry. Professor Cashore, who is clearly a brilliant researcher, was disorganized and his lectures were all over the place. I thought the assignments were not graded well. This was the class I was most excited about during shopping period, but it ended up being my least favorite class. I don't think I learned very much at all, except for some \"policy jargon.\" The readings focused too much on the history of political theories and were not very practical.",
    "The second half of the course felt a little disorganized.",

    "The public policy primer, the main textbook, is an extremely good text for practical education. I found it provided a lot of good advice that mid-level managers at any public institution would find helpful.",
    "Very much so"

   "comments": [
    "If you are looking to use the framework of policy to learn about environmental issues, you should take this class!",
    "Know that this course is for people who have never worked in policy; don't expect more from it than what it can offer.",
    "I'd recommend having some policy experience before taking this course. I would also recommend it if you are looking for a more theoretical understanding of environmental policy.",
    "Do the readings.",
    "Worthwhile, with some learning that goes into which readings are worth doing.",
    "Make sure to attend the sections that involved role playing different policy processes. They were really informative.",
    "Just be aware that this is a political science course. There is very little actual discussion of on-the-ground \"politics and practice\" aside from a few random anecdotes delivered in lecture.",
    "Focus on the most relevant readings, because they can get overwhelming. Clarify questions about the fundamentals early because everything ends up building upon previous material throughout the semester.",
    "This class is very theoretical and dry. If a student is interested in learning about natural resource management from a purely theoretical perspective, I would recommend this course. If he\/she wants to learn about the practical aspects of environmental policy, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "If you are looking for clear easy-to-follow structure, look somewhere else. If you learn well through stories, tangents, and creative thinking, this may be the course for you.",
    "If you have had prior public policy experience, I think this course will definitely help you further understand the underlying complexities of power dynamics that exist in any institution. It is extremely helpful to draw back on your own experiences to reinforce some of the more abstract aspects of this course. However, for anyone still interested in gaining insight into policy at just a broader level I think it is still very useful. Definitely read the text, it is extremely easy and practical and I predict it will actually be a reference guide for me in the future.",
    "Keep up with the readings, and be sure to get as much as you can possible out of section. Meet with your TA and Professor Cashore, they are very helpful on a face-to-face level"
