   "comments": [
    "This class was really cool. We read a classic Sanskrit text each week, and discussed it in class. Dave knows everything about everything and our class was pretty chill. There was a 1-2 pg reaction every week and a 10pg final paper, so pretty manageable load. I learned a lot about India and Sanskrit literature. The only real criticism is that class was disorganized sometimes, but other than that it's great.",
    "Great class. Weekly readings and reading responses with a super friendly, expert professor. I took this class CR\/D because I really didn't feel like I was doing justice to the readings, which were often quite time-consuming, and doing so allowed me to appreciate the topics we discussed without having to be worried about grading. Professor Brick is honestly THE man. I'd highly recommend this course but warn you that this is totally one of those \"you get out what you put in\" kind of courses. Take the time to do the readings, and you'll enjoy it a lot more. Also, take the time to get to know Professor Brick. He's super knowledgable and very friendly.",
    "This course is a very laid-back but thorough approach to sanskrit classics with a strong course reading list. If you have any cultural familiarity with the literature, reading it firsthand will definitely enlighten you about a lot of misconceptions. For more people approaching the course from a more rigorous literature background, the texts are ripe for the picking."
