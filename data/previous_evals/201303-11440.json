   "comments": [
    "The lab is required with the course and although the course is good, the lab is so bad that it makes the class almost not worth it. I didn't feel that it did much to supplement what we learned in class and the labs were dull and tedious.",
    "If you want to take G&G 140, you have to take this as well. It is an easy additional half credit, but I personally did not enjoy it because my TA spoke almost no English.",
    "It's okay - not as highly recommended as the main course, but if you take 140 you have to have 141L.",
    "EVST 202L is required for the course, you have to take it. I felt ambivalent about the lab the entire semester. The lab was not particularly difficult, especially if you worked with your lab mates, however the material can be dry and the lab reports time consuming.You will ultimately do well if you put a little bit of effort into it. Studying for the lab exam at the end is easier than studying for the class because the test questions come directly from four out of the five lab reports, which are easy to study. Make sure you are very detailed in completing your labs.",
    "I cannot really recommend or not recommend it to someone else since you have to take the course if you take EVST201, but I can say that you will only enjoy it if you get a good TA. The labs were very unorthodox in the sense that you get to do non-laboratory based work and I learned a lot of useful skills in meteorology. You'll probably like it!",
    "shitty ass lab but mandatory",
    "If you're taking the course, you have to take the lab, so you don't have much choice. That being said, the lab is terrible. Really, really terrible. If you are on the fence about taking the course, this lab is a good reason to pursue some other interest.",
    "it's ok. not as great as the lecture, but still somewhat helpful.",
    "I would not recommend this course, which is characterized by weekly and demoralizing 2 hr sessions in Kline Geology lab. The TA treats you like a statistics monkey, and I will walk away from this course with very little added value to the lecture material. I would not recommend this, but if you are EVST you probably have to take it.",
    "While the material in this lab was interesting, lab sessions were long and tedious. If the lab was not required along with G&G140, it would not be worth taking.",
    "I have to say it's kind of boring, but you will learn a lot from it.",
    "As far as labs go, this one is pretty exciting because you go to \"the field\" at times, meaning there is a bus trip along the Quinnipiac River and some visits to the rooftop weather station.The experiments are interesting and very interactive. The final debate presentations can take some time to put together, but it's a nice result and makes for a good memory.",
    "The labs themselves are interesting, but my TA instructor was so terrible it made it rather unbearable. The lab is minimal work, most of which can be completed in class. My #1 piece of advice is shop for TAs if possible! It is worth the hassle during shopping period to get a good one!",
    "EVST202L is a required lab section, so you have to take it. Buckle down and do your best.",
    "Not unless absolutely necessary",
    "The lab is required to take the class; it's not as fun as the lecture but it is still informational. There are only 5 labs, each taking two weeks, so it's less work than many other science labs. The first lab teaches you about meteorological measurements and instruments, the second one is a field trip where you take water samples on the Quinnipiac river, one is an Excel project with climate data, one is a weather balloon launch (plus more Excel analysis) and the last one is a global warming debate. The Excel labs were pretty tedious but not too hard. The debate was way different from the other labs but pretty fun. Overall, if you put in the work on the lab reports this class is not hard.",
    "You have to take this class if you're taking EVST 201. It's not a bad lab to complete but you will definitely want to create study groups and work together outside of class otherwise this can be a royal pain.",
    "It's the lab. It's not a fun lab and its not particularly enlightening.",
    "This lab was not great, but it shouldn't dissuade you from taking G&G 140. The idea behind the class is actually really cool: you get to launch a weather balloon, take a field trip down the Quinnipiac River, and debate the evidence for global warming. There seemed to be a lot of communication problems between the TA's and Professor Smith, which sometimes made it hard to gauge the expectations for the course and to get clear explanation of the more confusing concepts. I really hope that the design of this class improves, because it has a lot of potential.",
    "It's certainly a better lab than my chemistry lab. Many of the lab meetings are quite fun. You learn how to use meteorological instruments, take a trip to locations on the Quinnipiac River, and launch and track a weather balloon. Some of the work is tedious, but it's not that bad.",
    "The lab is relatively short, only an hour and a half compared to typical 4 hour chem labs which is nice. It deals a lot less with experiments and recording of information then with analysis of existing data. The lab takes a few key concepts from class and goes into them in considerable depth, which definitely improved my understanding of the material in EVST 201.",
    "A great lab, especially compared to chem lab! Very hands on; I thought it complemented material covered in EVST 201 really well. Not too difficult either.",
    "It's a terrible lab. Most of the lab is data analysis and drawing graphs, and involves very little lab work. Writeups are not educational...it's just a bunch of work in Excel.I learned nothing in this lab, and it was a complete waste of my time.",
    "This course does not compare to other labs at Yale! You learn how to use the tools of atmospheric scientists, go on a field trip to study the Quinnipiac River, and participate in a global warming debate. Definitely enhances the lecture course.",
    "It's required if you want to take 140... 140 is great though.",
    "Why would you take this lab unless you need it for your major? Most days are spent in mindless data analysis or confusing explanation. That said, the two days that we got to be outside (once to take samples of the Quinnipiac River, the other time to record the flight of a weather balloon) were fun and engaging. And at least lab is less than two hours long.",
    "This course was poorly run, and consisted of a lot of busy work that seemed unnecessary. The lab TAs often seemed like they didn't really know what they were doing, and the activities were not useful in understanding the material. The lab final was also very difficult and it wasn't really clear what would be on it. But, it is mandatory with EVST 201 so you will probably end up having to take it.",
    "Only take it if you have to take the class. There are more fun, more useful lab credits.",
    "Depends completely on your TF. It can be fun or miserable. Mine was miserable, and an embarrassment to Yale. I mean, my section blew beyond belief. God help my section."
