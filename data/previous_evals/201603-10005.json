   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin is an excellent teacher. When a student had a question, he challenged him\/her to think about the answer rather than just giving the answer. His use of visuals and drawings in teaching the course material was particularly helpful. He also responded to e-mail in a timely manner and on more than one occasion I had last minute questions or changes to paper topics and he was more than helpful.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0I wish he could be my TF for the entirety of my Divinity School tenure. No weaknesses. Pure brilliance! Upon completing his doctorate, I recommend hiring this gentleman. If you don't, I have a feeling you will regret it.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin is the next reason that this class had such a positive impact on me. He is a brilliant complement to Professor Tonnstad. He is motivated, intelligent, theologically fluent,and inspirational. Sections were a delight to attend. For his unassuming and affable personality welcomed complete participation and often motivated me to persist in untangling the often complex material. It is my belief that Justin's efforts made all the difference in the assimilation of themes presented at lecture.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin was such an excellent TF. He did a very good job balancing presenting and clarifying information, and asking for our interpretations and understandings. Section was always very valuable time spent. His feedback on papers was always detailed and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin is perhaps the most universally admired teaching fellow I've encountered. He has an obvious command of the material, and is able to convey complex information in a way that is digestible for students of all levels. More importantly, though, he is admired because of his unflinching kindness. He is avuncular in a way that simultaneously communicates authority and experience, but doesn't intimidate and brings out the very best in students. His sections were my favorite fifty minutes of every week.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin is approachable, patient, kind, and eager to help all of his students. He brings a wonderfully curious energy to class and finds a great balance between keeping our discussion on track and accurate, and letting us discover the answers.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin is fantastic! He does a great job of clearing up any confusion that may have followed lecture. Furthermore, he was very knowledgable about all of the material and is a talented teacher himself. All of his sections were extremely focused, yet allowing room for discussion. He knows the balance between open discussion and a more directed discussion that is more fruitful. He was very energetic in every section. Justin had a great attitude and gave due attention to all of the students. His paper comments were extremely helpful. Overall, Justin is a great TF!",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin gave really great feedback on papers and I could tell he was really willing work with us to better understand the material. Section was extremely helpful because he broke down the material and wanted to provide encouragement for us to share what we thought about the readings.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0I relied heavily on section and Justin to explain to me what was covered in lecture. Justin was very patient and kind with us and the feedback he gave on our writing was valuable and instructive. I greatly enjoyed my sections with him and appreciated the joy he got out of the material, teaching it to us, and facilitating discussion. I often felt not quite prepared to discuss the material, so his patience as our discussions (very) slowly got going was admirable.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Incredible! He knew the material. He knew how to make it plain for us. He took his time and was VERY responsive! I hope to have him again in anoth",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin was by far the most engaging TF I have had at YDS. He understood the material, which many of my past TFs have not, he was engaging, and has a passion for teaching. Justin always communicated clearly and effectively with us. He came to section prepared, answered our questions, and offered quality feedback on papers.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin is a fantastic teaching fellow. I am hoping he will be doing it again for Systematic Theology. He is a tough grader, but that is to be expected, meaning he was always clear on why he gave a particular grade.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Wow! A first-rate teacher! Arrived on time, ended class on time, did not stare at a phone or clock, looked us in the eye, smiled\/laughed\/acknowledged the joy of the topic as well as the complexity and challenge of it. He made frequent heads-up alerts to forthcoming assignments and spoke often about what was down the road. Justin is a professional: well-attired and always attentive in class and with emails. He explains things well and is able to answer questions with questions that do not come across as dismissive or obtuse. He excels in leading discussions that keep an emphasis on the context or thought of the author. I would have dropped the class had it not been for Justin because he had a rare blend of motivation, empathy, and encouragement for me through greeting me in Friday section by name and on my written assignments as I had no exposure whatsoever to systematic theology. He is going to shine as a tenure-track professor somewhere in this land upon his commencement.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Strengths included his ability to make the course material accessible and engaging. He had a deep sense of humor that also engaged discussion around the material. He was very knowledgeable about the material and offered careful and critical feedback on each of our writing assignments.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin was phenomenal! In truth, he was the most engaging, approachable, and knowledgable TA or professor I have had in my time at Yale thus far. His class discussion facilitation in sections was well organized and supplemented our lectures to our benefit. I do not think I could have been any more impressed with him.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0JUSTIN IS THE GREATEST TF. He was SO helpful to me. He led sections that were INCREDIBLY illuminative and constructive. He clarified distinctions between theologians with diagrams, drawings, charts, tables, and discussions. He had a good grasp on the material and conveyed it to us in an amiable and interesting way. He fostered discussion and kept us focused. His paper feedback was unparalleled. It was clear, and fair. I always felt that I had clear steps to improve my future work. He made a tremendous effort to be available to his students. I met with him at least 3 times, and he was incredibly helpful. I worked in the refectory, where I constantly saw him with other students. He was also willing to stay late after class or section to answer questions and responded promptly and thoroughly to emails. Justin started his first day of section by requesting an introduction from each of us that included our pronoun preferences. I have never been asked that question and I really appreciated his awareness and receptivity. Several of us joked with him that we wanted to know what class he would be the TF for in the Spring so we could follow him wherever he ended up. It was only partially a joke. His students all seemed to love him. For good reason.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Best TA I ever had. So warm, so open, so understanding.",
    "Instructor: Justin Ernest Crisp \u00a0Justin was one of the best TFs that I had here at YDS. He always came to section prepared and excited to talk about theology, no matter the author. He was very charitable towards authors, forcing students to engage with theologians on the theologian's own terms. This was very helpful for me. He was also incredibly accessible to students and seem exciting about talking with them. Finally his feedback throughout the writing process was extremely helpful. He clearly wanted those in his section to achieve a high level of theological thought and so he was very critical of arguments, but in a good way. No complaints, great section leader.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Personable knowledgeable in love with the subject matter happy to offer outside help interested in student ideas great TF",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Strength - allowed for group conversation without having to force it Weakness - sometimes his comments on my papers were sarcastic",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross was very helpful in section. He clarified (as well as anyone could) some of the questions we would have after class and encouraged us to carry the discussion in the way we wanted. His comments on assignments were beneficial in preparing for the next paper, so we were able to improve.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0This semester was incredibly difficult for me. My father has been sick with cancer and there were days when I did not know how I was going to make it but I look forward to working with Ross. He really helped me to understand theology better through this tough season. His sections were so engaging. Although the topics were tough, he would even stay after to talk to me and others. I am so thankful for having him as a TF. He is a hard-worker. His comments on my papers were very helpful and he pushed me this semester to write, theologically.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Strengths: Knew the subject matter well. You can tell that Ross enjoyed the subject Weakness: I wish we had more context of who we were reading",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0STRENGTHS: - In tune to what the section wanted out of our time together - Flexible with meeting outside of section and class - Took the time to write involved comments and suggestions on papers WEAKNESSES: - More structure to section",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross was helpful in teasing out and exploring\/explaining many of the difficult concepts in the course. He was available and helpful. I have no complaints with his work.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross responded to questions in a timely manner.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0I felt that sections were not planned. Conversations were organic and often did not help me with understanding the course material.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross was very attentive and did a good job facilitating conversation in section. I really enjoyed our discussions.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Strengths: facilitated students working out ideas in conversation with each other, able to clarify the doctrines of theologians studied (when possible), played devil's advocate when appropriate to enliven discussion, responsive to the expressed needs of the group. Weaknesses: though the TF clarified and helped to systematize the theological doctrines read, this was often a slow process and I felt time was wasted on non-central themes.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Ross is gifted in the field of theology. He is clearly dedicated to it by how well-versed he is in theological readings on and off the syllabus. Additionally, I think he is extremely well suited to the profession of teaching: not only does he extend section hours, which grants students the opportunity to further question and engage, but the instructor organizes in-section contributions in a dynamic and acute manner, often through charts (helpful for those who are more visual than audio learners). While I understand Ross had to attend to many papers, I think he ought to intervene more rigorously in the body of the student's essay to increase the intelligibility of his comments at the end.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0I really appreciated when Ross was open to drawing diagrams on the board. They were really helpful and helped me solidify a number of issues in the coursework.",
    "Instructor: Ross McCullough \u00a0Mr. McCullough was a professional through-and-through. He was extremely knowledgeable in the field, willing to wrestle difficult questions, and highly skilled in both leading our discussions in section and clarifying\/reviewing class material that students found difficult. Further, he was both personable and open to feedback, and he made himself available as needed for questions and concerns about class material and class assignments. I have had a number of teaching fellows in my time at YDS, and I would say that Mr. McCullough was the most qualified\/highest quality teaching fellow I have had to date. My only regret is that the one day Professor Tonstad came to observe him, he seemed a little nervous and it appeared to have thrown him off his game. I never told him this, but I was sorry she didn't get to see how well he normally does."
