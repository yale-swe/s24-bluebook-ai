   "comments": [
    "Only take this class is you desperately need to fulfill your language requirement or want an easy class. If you have to take it, look for Professor Sabe. Despite the mediocrity of the course, she was absolutely wonderful.",
    "It would depend on what that student wants. For a manageable L5 credit, it's a good pick. For a more meaningful course, I would probably suggest that they consider other options.",
    "I took this class not having spoken Spanish for two years, so it was pretty rough; I wouldn't have taken this class if I could do it again. I was able to restore my Spanish speaking to its high school level, but it took a lot of outside practice and studying.Profe Sabe is very nice and approachable, but as a grader she is quite picky. Proofread your essays like crazy and make sure to participate every day. It's quite easy to get an A- in the class, but an A requires diligent effort.",
    "Yes, it is a good L5 course to take, but your Spanish won't improve markedly.",
    "This class really helped my conversational skills. The workload isn't too hard if you're good at Spanish, as the class is mostly about participation. However, some of the vocab given was a little random, although I enjoyed reading the book \"The Invention of Morel.\"If you're good at Spanish, take this course. I had the misfortune of being a little behind, and I struggled a bit, so make sure you're up to the task.",
    "basically this class delivers what the name suggests- advanced conversation. I found it very helpful in improving fluency.",
    "Advanced Conversational Spanish is a class that emphasizes conversation and really encourages a greater understanding of spanish beyond grammar and its written component. I would recommend this class especially if you are looking to strengthen your communication skills and to reinforce the language.",
    "Spanish 150 is an okay course. I took it because I'm studying abroad and also because out of all of my Spanish skills, I want to be able to SPEAK. This course has less work than previous one and probably more meaningful work. However, your Spanish is probably not going to improve unless you are intentional about making it happen. Many people criticize the course for its lack of ability to improve your Spanish. After taking it, I'm honestly not sure if it's the course, or if it's the fact that once you've been studying a language for a while, only you can take the initiative to correct your bad habits. If you take it with Prof. Sabe, she's great and it will be laid-back and low-stress.",
    "I don't think I would. I took L1-L4 not for a requirement, just because I liked Spanish. But this class was pretty dull. It's not really conversational (actual vocab words included \"straw hay\" and \"rotating wheel\"), and the grading is pretty arbitrary, based mostly on participation, oral exams, and some difficult vocab quizzes. I'd say it's a very easy class to get an A- in, but hard to guarantee you'll get an A, even if you're trying hard. And I didn't feel I learned much in the process. Maybe try a different L5.",
    "Spanish 150 04 is a good course to take if you took Spanish for all of high school and want to continue improving. I would recommend it, as it helped me solidify what I learned in high school, and now I feel comfortable taking more Spanish, perhaps literature courses.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to get out of your language requirement fairly painlessly. It's not too difficult (even though there are daily homework assignments), and it's always good to maintain your Spanish speaking skills. There also aren't any native speakers in thiscourse, so I didn't feel too overwhelmed by the level of conversation since everyone was a non-native speaker making grammar mistakes just like I was.",
    "A relatively easy class, but take the grammar class first or at least do it alongside this one to do better.",
    "Take it if you want to improve your speaking and writing skills. Take it if you are already at a proficient\/intermediate level in those areas. If speaking is your weak point, you will improve. But if you have trouble in other areas, like grammar or reading comprehension, you might improve a little in this class, butyou'd be better off taking an intensive grammar\/writing course. There's a lot of reading that you need to stay on top of for daily class participation points and for tests. Don't hand in your essays late and if you can, send them to your prof to check for you before the deadline. It's a lot of work but it's manageable."
