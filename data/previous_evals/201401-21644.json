   "comments": [
    "International. Yes.",
    "It's a little boring and not super important. The workload is not too much. As long as you go to section and class, the readings are not super necessary though can be a little bit helpful so that you are familiar with what is discussed in class. I would only take this if you are really interested in international law, as it is just not that important. Nevertheless, you do learn a lot about how courts make decisions and get better at analyzing cases.",
    "Not an easy course. Look elsewhere if you want a lecture with standard workload. Dense legal readings but his slides are helpful and I thought the material was interesting. The final paper and exam was a bit rough. Section was chill - do it with Josh if you can, he is a god among men (his words). Prof Stone Sweet is a pretty big deal in this field. Take it if you have a genuine interest in European and international courts.",
    "I would summarize PLSC 168 as an interesting overview course on a variety of international and global legal systems. I was exposed to a lot, which was great, but I was also frustrated with the tremendous amount of material in the course. I am not sure if I would recommend it to another student.",
    "If you have no law background and want to understand how court cases are decided (in the international framework), are interested in courts or interpretation of law in general, take this!!! Expect a lot of technical court cases and readings, but this class is really worth it in the end. I may not have done well, but I 100% appreciate the skills that I gained in this class and happy to let my GPA take a hit for it.",
    "This class was very interesting - I learned a lot. However, for an undergrad non-law class, it was very technical at times which tended to make it dry. Take this class only if you know you're okay with a lot of case reading, it's more a law class than a poli sci class.",
    "I recommend the class, but you have to do the reading. If you don't plan to read or study then the class is not worth it. It's actually a really tough class so students have to take it seriously."
