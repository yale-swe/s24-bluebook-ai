    "Good class, would definitely recommend taking it with Dustin. A lot of work, at least 1 hour every day. Tests every week with lenient grading on the oral part. You'll learn a lot if you're willing to put in the work.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you are interested in learning French I highly recommend it. It is a great way to learn the language although be warned that the daily classes and homework although not much at first adds up and you definitely work for the one and a half credits.",
    "Yes, I think one comes out of this course with a decent knowledge of French.",
    "Immersion-style introduction to French with a focus on conversation and a strong foundation in grammatical correctness.",
    "Very difficult",
    "FREN 110 is a great introductory French course, especially with Dustin. Although at first I struggled with the \"immersion\" aspect of the class, as I had never had any prior experience with French, over the course of the semester I grew to really enjoy French and the class itself as well. I don't love the fact that the material is taught through the French in Action series, which are short narrative videos through which the vocabulary and grammar are introduced in context, but at the same time I do feel that I have learned a lot through this class in just a semester. The class is hard and moves quickly, but it's definitely worth it!"
