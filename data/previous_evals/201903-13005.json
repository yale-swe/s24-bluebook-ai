    "I gained knowledge of the history of both Wahhabism as a strand of Islam and the origins of the Saudi Arabian state (And particularly relations between the two)",
    "I learned an incredible amount about Wahhabism and Saudi Arabia, a topic which I had never studied prior to this course.",
    "A fantastic course, I gained a thorough and nuanced understanding of the Wahhabi ideology and its origins and a newfound understanding of Saudi Arabia.",
    "Learned so much about the history and use of Wahhabism in today's world. A very amazing survey of the religious practice, along with its deviations throughout time.",
    "I learned about different strands of Muslim and Salafi ideology, the balance of politics and religion in Saudi Arabian history, and the progression of Islamism throughout the past few centuries. I also gained a better understanding of Muslim theology and jurisprudence.",
    "I gained an understanding of Wahhabism as a political philosophy and theology, in addition to an understanding of the history of Saudi Arabia and surrounding areas. The knowledge I gained was relevant and in depth.",
    "I learned A LOT in this course. Professor Macris chose a subject that most students knew little about. As a result, I left the semester with a breadth of new knowledge. I learned about Islam, Wahhabism, Saudi Arabia, and the Muslim world. The class was well-structured and taught us both the content of history and how to think through it.",
    "Historical, theological, and political foundation of the modern Saudi state; the intellectual underpinnings of Salafism and jihad and how they relate to regional geopolitics",
    "This course taught me an immense amount about Saudi Arabia's religious and political foundations as traced to Muhammad Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab. I learned about ethics under Wahhabi-Islamic interpretation comparatively with Western tradition. I learned also about contemporary Saudi Arabia's monarchy and its cultural resistance against Western progressivism.",
    "Linking Saudi Arabia's historical formation and development to wider Islam intellectual thought and contemporary political events",
    "I learned about the theology of Islam and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's interpretation of the faith, as well as how this interpretation shaped the development of Saudi Arabia and its relationship with other countries. I also gained experience analyzing and writing about primary sources documents and comparing ethical traditions across different cultures."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Macris has put together a world class course which can be found no where else. It was a pleasure to take this course.",
    "Really great course structure; it was clear and consistent. The paper assignment was pretty cool and super original. Professor Macris has a great teaching style and always took part of class to give us time to ask question, discuss current events, and learn from his personal experience.",
    "Absolutely amazing class! Arguably the best seminar I have taken in my four years at Yale!",
    "I think a major strength is the comprehensive introduction to Islamic history and theology. One weakness is I didn't think exams were the most effective way to demonstrate course knowledge.",
    "The courses strengths were in the Professor, who was one of the best Ive ever had, and in the syllabus, which was well-thought out. Professor Macris did just about everything right. Sometimes, seminar discussion turned into a lecture, but we still learned a ton.",
    "Professor Macris is an excellent professor. He is an expert in the field and I feel privileged to have learned from him. I thought the syllabus and its chronology was well-thought out. I don't think the discussion question format was the best way to facilitate conversation. I think that perhaps three questions, discussed as a class at large, would have been better.",
    "Everything about this course was great! Would not change a thing. The insights that the prof. brought were invaluable, and our exposure to important sources made for an incredible learning experience. Some readings might be able to trim down, but it's not an overbearing workload.",
    "Strengths: Amazing professor with wide-breadth of personal experience in the material, diversity of audiovisual and educational tools, organized learning and extremely well-outlined syllabus Weakness: perhaps smaller class number to facilitate greater discussion among students.",
    "The weakness was how content heavy it was, which meant less interpretation. Often it was very lecture style as opposed to a seminar. Strength was the depth of professor's knowledge.",
    "One huge strength is getting to learn from Prof. Macris, however one way in which this course could be improved is if we had more time for free-flowing discussions about the material."

   "comments": [
    "I would really recommend this course for Professor Macriss unique perspective. Since Saudi Arabia has been and will continue to be a major player in the Middle Eastern and global politics, it seems incredibly important to learn about the history of the Saudi state and its clerical establishment.",
    "I would recommend this course to absolutely anyone at Yale. It was fascinating, and challenging in the best way.",
    "Absolutely, but Professor Macris is returning to the Naval Academy, so not going to be offered again.",
    "Absolutely, Professor Macris is amazing and deeply knowledgable about the topic. He combines his hands-on experience with the source material with the readings quite often and quite helpfully. It provides deep and important insight into a barely understood topic in the West",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to understand more of the ideological roots of modern Islamist movements, as well as Saudi history. I thought it was a well-balanced course in terms of weighing different frameworks against each other--from political to ethical to theological.",
    "I could not recommend this enough, but unfortunately the instructor is leaving. Someone else should teach this relevant material!",
    "I would recommend this class. You learn a lot, have access to very unique archives and materials, and leave wanting to learn more.",
    "Yes! One of those great, classic courses that students should compete for. So interesting, so important, so engaging, and, dare I say, even fun.",
    "Yes, please take this course as it provides a window into understanding Saudi Arabia today.",
    "Yes, but that is only if you really love the content of the class.",
    "Highly recommend! Prof. Macris is amazing, the material covered in this course is studied by very few people so it was great to learn about something I would have otherwise never have been exposed to."
