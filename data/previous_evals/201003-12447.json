    "I would recommend Modern Greek as a fun new language to learn. It was interesting, especially after coming in to the class with no knowledge of the language at all.",
    "Greek was a lot fun, and I learned a good deal about a language that I was a little intimidated by at first. Maria is great, and if you have any interest in the language you should check it out.",
    "Greek is a great class! I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Fun and not overbearing with the amount of work. Would definitely recommend.",
    "A great class to take. You learn a lot, and quickly. It's really quite surprising how soon you start understanding.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn a new language. Its fun but you still learn a lot!",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to the Greek language and is not too hard."
