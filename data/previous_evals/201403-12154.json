   "comments": [
    "If you really just want to be done with your language requirement, it's a fine course. But it's certainly not fun or enjoyable.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you have a fascination with the origin of Rome, or if you sincerely love translating Latin. Be prepared to work hard.",
    "I would recommend this class. I took it to fulfill my language requirement after years of high school Latin, and it was fun to briefly dive back in. The texts are interesting on the whole. The translations can sometimes feel a bit long, but on the whole they're manageable. And stay ahead on the other assignments, as they creep up on you! Make sure to bring your questions to class - Professor Solodow really will answer them and give aid for any difficult passage, but as the course progresses, you increasingly HAVE to ask about a specific passage to go over it.",
    "I would say that it is a good introduction to college-level latin that provides experience translating and analyzing a wide range of authors and literary styles. I would recommend it, and I would say that it is a good setting in which to gain experience analyzing and writing about Latin literature. I would say that if you need more practice in grammar or translation skills, maybe take a different course, because this one was more focused on literary analysis rather than mechanics.",
    "Latin 411 is basically AP Latin on steroids. You basically take well-known stories from Roman history (Birth of Romulus and Remus, death of Romulus, Rape of the Sabine, etc), and translate different author's descriptions (Virgil, Livy, Ovid). There are two 4-page essays, each a comparison of two author's accounts of a certain story. There is also a big 12-15 page paper, along the same lines of the other two prompts. The daily homework is 60-80 lines of translating, which was tedious. The homework definitely could've been cut down to more concise and necessary translations; it's an awful lot of homework to be only secondary to the analysis expected in class. There are also occasional pop-quizzes at the beginning of classes (probably around 5 during the semester), and he randomly calls on people to translate, so you have to do the homework every day. Solodow is a really nice guy, who genuinely cares about his students and would meet to talk about anything, anytime you need. He goes on tangents sometimes, but there always on things he seems genuinely interested in. His paper grading seemed a bit random at times, and the questions on quizzes were sometimes very grammatically specific (hard if your previous Latin experience wasn't grammar-heavy). The midterm and final were both pretty difficult, which some oddly hard questions, and slightly random essay topics. Overall, not a bad way to fulfill the language requirement, but be ready to dedicate time to it.",
    "Pretty good class;the translating hw takes a decent amount of time but the class dj pretty relaxed; I enjoyed it!",
    "I would recommend Latin 411 for a student looking to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "A good class to take in order to satisfy your language requirement. I took this course as a freshman having taken Latin for four years in high school. While I enjoyed this class and certainly learned a lot from Solodow, I only took it to satisfy the language requirement. Grading is straightforward and it's fairly easy to do well if you put the necessary work into the course. You will not be able to get by without doing the translations for each class and preparing for quizzes. The paper is the hardest part of the course. The midterm and final exams both required a significant amount of studying. It's a hard class, but you should take it if you only want one semester of a language.",
    "This class was trying to do a lot, which was sometimes difficult to keep up with. My recommendations for the Latin bridge: do as much language work on your own as possible. We did very little in class unless a student brought up an issue, and we were expected to know the texts very well before we discussed them. We spent class time translating in the beginning, but by the end of the semester had transitioned mostly to discussion. Also, take notes on what Professor Solodow writes on the board! There may be more of an emphasis on cultural\/historical information than you expect, and it will be on the final. Take advantage of the written assignments to really dig into the texts literarily, because your class discussions may or may not be illuminating.",
    "If you are a student seriously interested in the stories concerning the early history of Rome, then this class is for you! The most interesting part is to interpret the opinion and approach of each author towards important myths, such as the foundation of Rome. Otherwise you should maybe look for another Latin class.",
    "If you're looking for an L5 Latin class to get rid of your language requirement, this is the one to take. Be warned, though, that the topic of this bridge class apparently has a lot to do with the difficulty. My friend took the 2013 \"Roman Food & Drink\" and said that that class was low workload compared to the one I took. Professor Solodow admitted this year (2014) that \"From Aeneas to Romulus\" had too much translation, and I hope he takes this into account when designing the next syllabus. The class had translations each night that were the equivalent of between 60 and 120 Vergil lines, and there were three papers (two three-pagers and one ten), two small translation exercises, a midterm and final.",
    "Joseph Solodow's class on Rome from Aeneas to Romulus covers readings from Vergil, Livy, Homer, and an anonymous 4th century author. It focuses on Roman history and what it takes to be truly Roman. The class covers quite a bit of history, but be aware that it's not a history class. The focus is mainly on Latin. I think that there could have been a better balance of the two, but that one can certainly get a good idea of Roman history by paying attention in class. I would recommend this class for someone interested in reading great authors in Latin as Prof Solodow picks excellent works and great sections of those works to read from (with one exception...).",
    "It's a bit repetitive, but it's good exposure to a bunch of different authors and it was interesting to learn about the history of Rome through the language itself."
