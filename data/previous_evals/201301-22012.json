    "Only take this section if you really want to learn Italian. If you're in it for the language credit, there are better sections for that purpose.",
    "Italian 120 picks up where Italian 110 left off and finishes the grammar, with assignments and tests at first similar to those from Italian 110. After that, students read a work of Italian fiction and watch Italian films, including an opera. I would recommend this course to a fellow student. You learn Italian very quickly and thoroughly, but you're never really overwhelmed by too much work.",
    "The course is self explanatory. You're learning how to speak italian. Take italian. It's a beautiful language, and you will not regret it. If you want to be fluent, you will probably need to go to Italy, but you can do that!",
    "This is a straightforward continuation of Italian 110, but it has less grammar. It includes a short book, some movies, an opera, and a visit to the art gallery, which diversifies the media of exposure to Italian. If you took 110, you probably already know what this is about. If this is your first course, I would probably recommend taking 110 (if you're shaky on grammar) or 130 -- this is a blurry intermediate between the two. Monica Georgeo is highly recommended!",
    "It is a good continuation of ITAL 110 and although there are concepts that are challenging, I found that it's not as much work.",
    "Yes! The Italian Department is very nurturing and I enjoyed extending what I learned in the classroom to outside events such as the Italian Film Festival.",
    "Italian 120 is different from Italian 110 in that it incorporates elements of culture into language study. Once you finish the textbook about halfway through the course, you turn your attention to Italian films, an opera, study at the Yale art museum, and a short novel in Italian - \"Andreuccio da Perugia.\" These activities help to reinforce the command of Italian language that is built in the textbook. Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Besides being fun and enjoyable, the class really helps to increase students' understanding in written and spoken Italian."
