    "I really appreciate the pedagogical approach to this class- flexible in the syllabus based on the students, practical\/hands on projects, grounded in readings and discussion, structure in engaging students (assigning students to give the class recaps, etc). I would encourage Paul to make sure that this level of engagement is equally distributed; I noticed some students were not selected as often and others more often than average. A suggestion on the projects- have what is happening in the projects align more with the material discussed in class, have more opportunities for using the projects as a basis for learning the concepts. For example, our group would have benefitted from breaking down some of the interviews in class, using our framework, and specifically going over next steps in the process.",

    "Professor Lussier's passion! He is a very good professor and person",
    "passion",
    "That it was relevant, a different approach than what is commonly taught, and empowering in a long term sense. The group work was particularly impactful. The flexible material allowed for real learning- more classes should be like this.",
    "I loved the readings and discussions for this class. The readings were very well-selected, applicable to the coursework, and always interesting. The discussions were high energy and inspiring.",
    "I enjoyed the readings a lot. I wish we had discussed them more.",
    "This course revolutionised the way I think about climate science communication, and just communication in general",
    "By far the best part of the class was the class lectures. I couldn't wait to get to class for this reason. It was inspiring, moving, challenging, educational, engaging, and evocative. I also loved the class readings. They were perfectly relevant, informative and very enjoyable.",
    "The readings in this class were excellent, some of the best I've had yet. Paul's engaging and personable teaching style encourages participation yet somehow still offers a safe zone for even the most introvert students (such as myself). The classes are intense but very rewarding. Paul is so passionate and his energy is contagious. Throughout the course I felt as though I was reading a book with twists and turns while realising a transformation in my own perspective. Learning about humanistic communications, really pushes you to become introspective and analyse your own interactions with people through your work."

    "Paul is a sophist with remarkable rhetorical skills. However, he could afford to be more concise in his speech so that more time can be afforded to critical discussions.",
    "didn't feel like the project ultimately was that beneficial to learning humanistic communications",
    "I was confused in some classes as to what to do, sometimes it was hard to follow what was happening in class because it went too fast",
    "availability - out of classroom help",
    "Making sure the pace stays in line with the deadline of the final deliverable. There was a lull somewhere in the middle- I think this was where our group could have used some constructive feedback to keep us motivated and on track.",
    "I think the few individual assignments in the class were very useful and allowed for a good self check on whether or not the material was making sense individually. I would have appreciated more such assignments. While group work is very important, I think it's also good to incorporate different types of assignments for different learning styles.",
    "See above. The class was redundant and often unclear. The random assigning of additional work was also frustrating: students take a look at the syllabus at the beginning of the semester to gauge the workload and randomly assigning work goes against that. There was a lot of frustrating aspects of the project - a lot of miscommunications, unclear directions, and the work did not help us deepen our understanding. Moreover, there wasn't much of a difference between the midterm and final projects due to timing I think so it was silly to fabricate that.",
    "The aspect I liked least about the class was our project with the stakeholder. I found this to be an immense waste of time and there could have been numerous other assignments that would have been much more effective in assisting our learning of the material. I would have preferred a midterm exam or essays on the class topics to encourage the students to review and relearn the course information. The final project could have been a paper in which students wrote a narrative for a partner of their choosing. Working with the assigned stakeholders took an unnecessary amount of time to coordinate phone calls, meetings, emails etc. which did not benefit our learning of the material. My one piece of advice to make this class even better is drop the stakeholder project and replace it with a paper or exam.",
    "I was part of the Virgin project. Although I found the content of the project to be very compelling I felt I didn't get to exercise the concepts and tools learned in class. Maybe the project was already too mature."

Instead of seeing the world as black and white through a partisan lens, I have learned to create communications strategies based on human values that are shared by all. This class has instilled in me a strong sense of realism in approaching the issues in the world. This is extremely helpful for me to possess the ability to navigate the issues beyond the liberal and progressive bubble on campus.",
    "Communications is key to changing the way people live so that we can really make a difference in our climate change impacts. This course had some important concepts that it imparted upon us to that end.",
    "I think this course could fit for anyone as it provides an overview on how to communicate science and climate change.",
    "Fits perfectly, although I've had academic experience in communications, this course is on its own level and frequency. It offers a whole new framework and building blocks of humanistic communications and how it can be applied in addressing climate change. I think this course can fit into any program design as communications is a key (although still under-rated) aspect in solving climate and sustainability issues."

    "I get to know a dozen of students well. Some students are clearly more responsible and committed than others. It is a good learning experience with work with a range of students. It also gives me a good idea about the quality of each group mate and those who I will potentially work with in the future.",
    "So many out of class meetings that felt pretty pointless. As mentioned above, not sure I advanced my knowledge of concepts taught in class through the group work.",
    "It was very complicated to work in a team with 11 people but at the end it also taught us to work togehter",
    "Same as above - great experience working with client but would have been helpful to have the professor more directly involved. We felt like we were swimming around with no idea where we were going for nearly the entire semester.",
    "I was concerned at the size of the groups at first, but this turned out to be an advantage. On the one hand, it was difficult to coordinate schedules, but on the other hand, we were all able to contribute our strengths to the group. I was impressed by my group mates- everyone had their respective contributions that really pulled through, especially in the final deliverable. On the other hand, it was more of a challenge having everyone in a leadership role. We didn't stick with the concept of changing the group leader every week, as we feared this would be too confusing for our clients. However, this meant not everyone had an equal leadership role.",
    "The groups were a little bit too large. It made it difficult to make sure that everyone had a fair share of the work and hard to make sure that everyone was getting same amount of benefit from the experience and practice putting the concepts into action.",
    "The groups of 12 were way too big and unwieldy especially when we were expected to meet as a group in the very beginning. It allowed people to slack and it was unnecessarily frustrating.",
    "I loved my classmates in my group but all of us seemed to resent the project we were working on as it seemed to be a tremendous waste of time.",
    "The group work often felt unstructured, this may be due to the nature of the Virgin project itself and the roadblocks we faced. However the team members carried each other well and ultimately devised a system that worked. In my own limitations I felt that understanding and flexibility from the others really helped me,"
