   "comments": [
    "I strongly recommend to take this class to any students.",
    "I would, the class has something to teach almost anyone. I would recommend that students without a math degree, study as much math as they can before taking this class.",
    "Yes - this is a good survey course for methods that will be useful in many advanced physics courses.",
    "It covers a lot of math that is useful for physics, but it would help to know the material beforehand because it is a bit difficult to learn it for the first time in this class.",
    "The course is very challenging, and the exams are difficult. Homeworks are very time-consuming, and so I would only recommend the class to someone who has enough time to allot to this course.",
    "It highly depends on the interests of the student.",
    "Overall I enjoyed this course.",
    "If you're a physics grad student, you have to take or pass out of this.",
    "Very good class and very important to all experimental and theoretical researchers.",
    "This is a very valuable course for physics grad students to take. Our understanding is deepened on many crucial aspects of mathematical physics.",
    "I would recommend it as a good survey of topics in mathematics that are often very useful in physics. I would recommend it for students who are able and willing to try to learn most of the topics by themselves but have a good guide of what to study and a good source of hard problems.",
    "Covers mathematical topics from linear algebra, differential equations, greens functions, real and complex analysis. There is not a huge emphasis on physical applications but still a very useful course. Yes, i would recommend the course.",
    "Sure, I'd recommend it. I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "While it was a nice review and did touch a few topics I had not seen before, overall I would recommend a different course or at least a different text book. I feel like the overview was a bit too broad for those who didn't already have a good grasp of the material, and the text did little to provide assistance. The homework was nice and challenging for those of us familiar with it, but again if you didn't have a good grasp of the material already it might have been too challenging.",
    "At the end of Physics 506 I can say that I have seen a lot of material which may or may not be useful in my future as a physicist, but I can't say that I am comfortable with any of it."

   "comments": [
    "It certainly contributed towards my knowledge of mathematics.",
    "It does not contribute much to my dissertation, but this math is very useful to know for other classes.",
    "This class did successfully teach me methods of solving problems that are often seen in physics, and so I believe this class was a useful, worthwhile experience.",
    "There are parts of this course that I found extremely interesting, and will continue to read about over break. (Greens functions mostly)",
    "Yes, I now feel prepared to tackle the math section of the qualifying exam.",
    "It has been very important to my research!",
