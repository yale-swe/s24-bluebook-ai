    "This was a great course. How good a creative writing workshop is depends a lot on the instructor and the individuals in the class. Emily Barton was an amazing professor and workshop leader.",
    "Emily Barton is great. Take herclass!I came into this class as someone who hadn't written very much fiction before, but I never felt overwhelmed. It's always scary putting your work out there, but you just get so much out of it. I always put this class before all my other ones.",
    "This is a very good class. Obviously it depends on your fellow students, but if nothing else, it gives you a space to write and get feedback on your work, which is pretty awesome. Professor Barton works towards creating a good classroom community, and she is full of anecdotes and quirky facts that make class interesting.",
    "If you want to write fiction, take this class.",
    "Absolutely! It involves writing three short stories of your own throughout the semester and then a lot of peer editing. Professor Barton is absolutely wonderful! She walks a careful line between wild hilarity and wild expectation. I cannot imagine ever doing anything but my absolute best for her - she's one of those teachers. At the same time, she's full of hilarious anecdotes and mantras that'll make anyone smile. Perhaps, even, laugh out loud.",
    "If you get in, take it. I had never taken a fiction workshop before this class, and I had barely written any short stories, so I was very nervous the first few weeks. Soon, I felt inspired by the quality of work my classmates were producing, and I wrote one short story I am particularly proud of.",
    "Take it if you get in! Great workshop.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Barton is a wonderful teacher and person. If you're willing to do the work and put serious thought into your writing, then definitely definitely definitely take her course. My writing improved tremendously, as did my reading skills."
