I received my first exposure to movement philosophy, and I was able to draw connections between movement and politics\/society.",

    "I enjoyed the breadth of this course, we really went all over the place. The visiting guests were an excellent way of introducing a variety of viewpoints while maintaining a level of expertise. I felt that the different classes felt a little isolated, and would have liked to see them connect with each other more - this was particularly true of weeks with guest artists. I always find studio practice alongside traditional academic work highly effective, so I'd list that as a strength. I think the size of the class was also a strength, because we not only received individual attention from Emily but also became familiar with each other's work as well. I learned a ton from my peers in this course, which I really really value."

    "I greatly enjoyed this class. We were able to do quite a bit of research and then apply what we had found through movement and through writing.",
    "Yes, you should always take a class with Emily if you have the option. This was a great course for movers across the spectrum, not just with dance backgrounds, and the kind of artistic and theoretical expansion that comes from a think tank like this is really enriched by having so many different perspectives."
