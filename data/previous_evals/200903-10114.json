    "no. it was boring for a science major because you want to really delve into the science but you can't because there are non-science majors in it.",
    "This is a great class for non-science majors, I'd definitely recommend it to someone looking for a science credit.",
    "I would not recommend it to a friend.",
    "Cancer, Genes, and the Environment. A class that examines the environmental factors that influence carcinogenesis. We began and spent most of the course looking at molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis--chromium, sunlight, asbestos, smoking, viruses, etc., then touched a bit more on the environmental aspects of it. Really low commitment - it met once a week, with a total of only two 6-8page papers, 3 reflections, 15-30 pages ofreading a week, and a final debate at the end. Take it if you're interested in cancer. It'll either make you a cancerphobe in today's society or make you feel safer surrounded by carcinogens. Science majors probably had an easier time with the course--a basic background in bio is nice but not necessary.",
    "I science based class in carcinogens.",
    "take this class without a doubt, especially if you need a science req.excellent course. practical science with an incredible professor who is very knowlegable of the material. helpful, engaging, an very interesting. readings are not too long and very interesting, workload is very fair, and prof is willing to help along the way...take this class",
    "This course covered the science, medicine, and politics of cancer.",
    "course had potential, but not well taught.."
