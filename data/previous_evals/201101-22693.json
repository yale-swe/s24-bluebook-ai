   "comments": [
    "This is far, far, far and away the most work I've ever done for a class, but the labs were generally very cool and helped put everything I learned in thermo and fluids last term into context. I learned a lot about scientific writing and presentation as well; just make sure you have the time for a lab report every week. Nick is lenient on deadlines, which is good in one sense but also a pain because it's really easy to get behind. So in general...make sure you have enough time, but if you do definitely take it.",
    "This lab is a bit of a roller coaster. Some of the experiments are engaging, some are formulaic. Some are difficult, with easy theory, and some are completely the opposite. The one thing you can count on is ***SO MUCH WORK***. Plan on 15+ hours per weekly lab report, with some going well over that.",
    "This is a lab course in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. You'll spend about 30 mins\/week in lecture, 3 hrs\/week in lab, and 10-20 hrs\/week writing reports. I think a big component of this course is learning to investigate on your own---do your own research, do your own thinking. What you get out of it definitely depends on how much you put. That being said, this class will still be a ton of work, no matter what. It's a great course and definitely worth taking (you'll be better for it in the end), but just be warned it's not for the faint of heart. Whatever you don't fall behind. If you do, this class will become a giant emotional albatross, and it will consume you.",
    "This course is much better than the Fluid Mechanics lecture. Though it is more work than you will do for many other classes, you will learn valuable skills ie. Matlab and writing scientific papers. Professor Ouellette is a helpful guy if you are willing to seek him out. The deadlines are somewhat flexible which is a big help, especially mid-semester. I definitely learned more about fluids and thermo than I did going in, and would advise this course for anyone who wants to do the same.",
    "This class is a lot of work, so prepare yourself. Don't procrastinate on labs, particularly on the data analysis portions. If you can stay on top of the workload, the semester is almost manageable, especially towards the end (which will be difficult as recovering from backlog isn't a pleasant experience). I may be the only person to express this view, but I found the entirety of the lab--workload included--enjoyable and beneficial. The fluid-related experiments were particularly fascinating, giving an opportunity to take what is learned in the fluids lecture and and apply it to a real world setting.",
    "Unless your an engineer, probably not. Definitely a must if you are however.",
    "This class is a great lab if taken with Ouellette. A ton of work, and deserving of a WR credit, but still really good. I came away from the class with a much clearer understanding of all of the concepts in fluids and thermo, some of which I really didn't understand beyond having memorized a bunch of equations before taking 363.That said, do not take this class with a difficult course load. It will be your most time consuming class, and each lab will take you at least 3 times longer than you thought it would. It is a lot of work, but I definitely recommend it.",
    "The highest level lab course in the ABET track. It will force you to write better labs and many of the experiments are excellent."
