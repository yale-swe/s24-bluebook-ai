   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend it. The professor is enthusiastic and is a warm and wonderful educator.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students interested in Spanish literature. It basically cover's the legacy of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca in terms of his major works of poetry and plays. You will spend a lot of time reading Lorca's works, as well as reading essays written by other scholars about these works. Some of the major works covered include Libro de poemas, Romancero gitano, La zapatera prodigiosa, La casa de Bernarda Alba, Bodas de sangre, Yerma, Poeta en Nueva York, and more. Overall, it is an extremely enjoyable course, and you will learn a lot. In terms of assignments, there are 3 short papers (2-3 pages), one midterm exam, and one final paper that is due at the end of the semester (7-10 pages).",
    "Take it if you like Lorca! Professor Valis is amazing, and Lorca: Poetry and Plays is a great way to finish up a language requirement. The work load is not too bad. Just make sure you are pretty comfortable reading and writing in Spanish.",
    "I would.",
    "Most of the work for this class is reading-based, with three short (2 page essays) and one final essay. You will also have to memorize and recite a poem of Lorca's. The work isn't too tough, but it's not a breeze either (especially if you are a non-native speaker). Class is based around participation but in some classes the professor dominates the conversation. There are also relevant movie screenings, sometimes in class and sometimes outside.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! I took it Cr\/D, which was a perfect balance to explore the crazy nuances of Lorca and not have to stress. It's definitely a manageable class to take for a grade, though, too. Overall, it was a really fun course, and Profesora Valis is great!",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic. I took it because one of my interests as a comp. lit. major is queer theory\/aesthetics in the avant-garde, and Lorca is famous for queer\/gender discourse in his oeuvre. I definitely got that and more. Noel Valis is the SWEETEST. She makes every class a wealth of information and insight on the works and life of one of the greatest figures of world literature. The class tends to be small, so my advice is to come prepared and to READ the works before the class (it's never a lot). It makes the class SO much better to do that. She also makes her students memorize and talk about one Lorca poem of their choice. It's not scary at all, and you leavewith the satisfaction of \"owning\" a bit of Lorca in your memory. I recommend this course with all my heart and soul.",
    "This class was a pleasure to take, the work load is very manageable which makes it easy to keep up with the readings and have a productive discussion in class. Professor Valis is a great teacher and person, always aspiring to make you laugh and learn. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Spanish Literature, and it is a great way to learn a lot about a poet that was a huge influence in the field and whose work can sometimes be hard to follow outside the context of a class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. If you love Lorca or are intrigued, take it. Your love will only compound. Professor Valis is amazing."
