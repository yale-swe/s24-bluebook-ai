    "Yes, well, if you're at this level, you'll take it regardless of what I write, but it's a great painting class where you get a lot of freedom.",
    "Painting studio changes with each professor who teaches it. With Anoka, there were actual assignments. With Clint, you're on your own, which presents a new set of challenges that have nothing to do with the class and everything to do with yourself: your committment to your work, your time management skills, and all that sort of stuff. To me, this class was difficult because of those things. This class requires your attention and ignoring it can only end with disaster. Plan accordingly.",
    "This course advances your painting significantly- professor\/TA\/ fellow students give really valuable feedback on your work",
    "It's a great class if you can motivate yourself independently. You get out what you put into this class, so, while the independence is something that can be really great, it's also easy to slack off if you don't keep yourself in check. It's something I think any art student needs to get used to, though, (working on your own motivation), so no complaints in that regard!"
