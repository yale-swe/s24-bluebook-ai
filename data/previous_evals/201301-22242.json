   "comments": [
    "Pretty interesting. Take it if you are interested specifically in energy use. Good fifth class. Mandatory attendance.",
    "Yes, take it. The workload is not great and the material is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class if interested in the subject, as it provides a different perspective and different way to approach the issues of sustainable planning and building. Just know that it can feel somewhat disorganized or confusing to follow the flow from lecture to lecture.",
    "This is an awesome class.",
    "I'd recommend it. I enjoyed it and I think I learned a lot about how to be critical of \"green technologies.\" I wish there were some concrete solutions or takeaways that can be applied, but the world is complicated and sustainability doesn't work like that. Professor Addington knows her stuff and is an awesome person. But not always the most organized lecturer. Very manageable workload.",
    "YES. Great class, mostly interesting material (if you're into architecture or saving the earth), and the projects are very manageable.",
    "Take this course! Professor Addington is great and it will teach you very many things. It feels and is the tip of the iceberg in terms of sustainability, but nonetheless it is a worthy class to introduce you to the subject. There is not much work, but when it comes be weary, it will take you a while to complete an assignment, but if you enjoy it then it won't seem like a drag.",
    "Great class if you have any interest in the environment. No architecture experience required. No drawing involved.",
    "Definitely recommended if you are at all interested in the environmental issues that plague our planet, and are a direct result from buildings and energy use. The class is applicable to many majors, and the diversity of majors within the class clearly reflects this. Professor Addington certainly knows what she is talking about, and really makes you rethink the way that we live and build today.",
    "take it. credit\/d is good but the grading seems to be pretty lenient as long as you put in some sort of effort. easy overall, esp. for an engineering major (prof is only mechanical engineer in arch department). assignments are meaningful and a good break from doing problems in a book (presentations, reports, etc.) lectures can get boring sometimes esp. with lights off in LORIA 351, and they check attendance every lecture (which is apparently a big part of the grade, don't know). whatever, just take it.",
    "YES! Take it. So the easiest reason to take the class is there isn't much work to be had (although it's relatively new and evolving a lot each year - I wouldn't be surprised if she caps attendance lower and adds more work in the future). But there are lots of other reasons. It's the only class recently where I've sat with other engineers, along with history majors, art majors, architecture majors, and others, and we all found the class to be meaningful material and a really important topic to the future. Professor Addington presents the science behind building strategies and exposes things like why we don't consider lighting design to be a sustainability topic or how photovoltaics can be deployed in entirely ineffective locations.",
    "ARCH 163 is a must-take course if you are at all interested in sustainability and energy. I didn't really know anything about architecture, but this class taught me a lot about how to think about sustainable strategies in \"green buildings\" and more informed ways to evaluate new technologies. The assignments were also not too bad, and the midterms and finals were similar. Lectures were also pretty interesting, although some lectures were less interesting than others.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the material. You can get a lot of it if you want to. You can also slide by without really getting into it. It's not very hard though.",
    "This class is not too difficult. There's no memorizing, just analysis and evaluation using tools you learn in class. Lecture is required and I'm really glad because you don't really need to go all the time to write good papers, but you won't learn anything if you don't go, and it's really interesting. You learn about things that are going on all the to,e in buildings you use every day that you were never aware of. It's also a good practical look at what it would be like to be an architect or engineer. The guest lectures were FANTASTIC, the TAs were very responsive and helpful, and this is a laid-back, interesting class that will teach you a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have any interest in the built environment, sustainability, architecture, urban planning, and cities.",
    "A definite class to take if you are interested in environment or energy. Professor Addington is a great lecturer and has a lot of interesting views about the topic of green buildings. The class is very unique; there is no textbook you can follow, and going to lecture is vital, so don't plan on this being a class you can blow off.",
    "An interesting class on architecture and the environment. Take it if you are interested about the information but otherwise it was pretty difficult class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in environmental issues and\/or the environment. This class will really change the way you think about environmentally-related issues.",
    "Interesting and relevant material, but easier for mechanical engineering students or those with any sort of engineering background because assignments deal with specifics of physical\/chemical properties of building materials and their life cycle (for example).",
    "This class brings many students from many different disciplines, and the structure of the work really allows you to take ownership of the material. I would recommend this course wholeheartedly.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to a fellow student- the information is very interesting and makes you think about architecture in an entirely new way. Don't take the class if you want to know exactly what assignments you'll have and when they will be due, though. Otherwise, really great and informative course taught by a great professor!",
    "If you're interested in sustainability and buildings, then you should seriously consider this course.",
    "Good even if you're not an arch. Major",
    "If you want a class that isn't too tough and discusses a relevant issue, take it!",
    "Great class. Truly amazing and exceptional professor, she cares A LOT. I loved the class. Take it, especially if you are interested in issues concerning the environment and energy.",
    "Good class, but sometimes it can be difficult to follow",
    "If you do not consider yourself knowledgeable about the history of energy consumption in the built world, you may find yourself enlightened about the history of energy consumption in building production and the current state of affairs of sustainable building design and construction by taking this course.",
    "I would recommend the class to those genuinely interested in architecture",
    "Yes - great overview. Take it. Four projects and a final, and they're interesting."
