    "Sure-- absolutely! Chaucer's works are of course canonical and familiar to most of us, but Prof. Minnis helped to point us towards some new and interesting ways to approach them that made them fresh.",
    "A semester-long look at various texts of the Chaucerian corpus. The course is discussion-based and students should expect to read critical articles on the topic in order to guide discussions. I would absolutely recommend this course to other students.",
    "ENGL546 requires a strong background knowledge of literature, appropriate terms, and how to engage and interpret it. The reading is not too much but requires a lot of engagement because those also in the course are brilliant at interpreting the tales. It is well led by Dr. Minnis. The assessment is either one 20 page paper or two 10 page papers and Dr. Minnis is happy to help students on the papers."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not a medievalist, so I was really taking this class more for fun than with an eye to my dissertation. However, Chaucer's strategies of narrativization and characterization, and his sense of humor, of course exerted a long influence upon English literature, so knowing more about his works offers a useful background for my own research interests.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to medieval studies and suggested future articles and books one might look to to advance one's understanding of the topic.",
    "I took this course for fun, but it was very interesting and engaging and helped me to think more about how people in Chaucer's time viewed the world."
