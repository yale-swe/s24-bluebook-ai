    "ENAS 151 is a great class. It does involve staying on top of your work, but it is not overwhelming. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take this class only if you need to take multivariable calculus. It's a lot of work as the problem sets are often 25 questions, and they're not particularly interesting questions. The lectures are early in the morning, and don't make a lot of sense, but that could be because I don't think properly at that time of day. In short, take this class if you need to take multivariable - I've heard it's better than MATH120-but don't do it if you don't.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially when compared to Math 120. The material is not only really useful (and usually required!) if you want to do anything in math or science, but in ENAS 151, you never get bogged down in proofs. You get to see the applications much more of what you're studying which actually helped me a lot in my other physics and science classes. Professor Henrich was great, though in general my impression is that most of the ENAS professors are better than the math professors. Problem set every week, but it was never impossible and there the office hours were very useful in getting more help if needed (though make sure to find people in the class to go over the sets with) and the exams were very fair. All in all, a great class given the subject!",
    "I love math, and I would not recommend this course. The class is a lot bigger than the math 120 sections, which makes lectures much less hands-on and very dry. Professor Henrich seems to know what he's doing, but the lectures are very hard to follow unless you read the book in detail beforehand. The biggest problem I had with this course was the grading. The tests were ridiculously easy, so much that it became a test of who could do the best algebra and arithmetic rather than a test of the difficult calculus concepts I spent hours studying and mastering. Expect an obnoxiously high average since they are so easy and everyone's an engineer- which sucks if it's graded on a curve. I'd say take math 120 instead.",
    "This class covers math that is really important to whatever science and engineering classes you will take later on. That being said, there is very little actual material. The first third of the class is review of single variable and vectors. The rest includes lots of simple extensions of single variable. It is tempting to skip this class because lectures are sometimes intuitive and almost all the content is found in the book. Prof. Henrich is not an exciting lecturer, but he is a very kind man who you should get to know.",
    "good math class, very straightforward",
    "This is one of those classes you just have to get through. Be prepared to learn everything on your own--this will be a self-taught math class. That said, the help sessions are good to go to if you don't understand something, though the teaching fellows can be slightly abrasive. The psets aren't too bad and the tests are a fair representation of the class. However, be prepared to compete for the curve with students who have already taken multivariable (and some already done with differential equations.) I had about a fifth of my class get a 100% on the first exam because they had done everything before.",
    "A class filled with people who have all already taken multivariable calculus. These people don't show up to class because they don't need to, attend the tests, get As on them, and completely destroy any hopes of a curve for those of us trying to learn the material for the first time. Do not take this class unless you fall into the aforementioned category. Take Math 120. This was a horrible mistake for me, and I'm dropping the class and taking Math 120 next semester in hopes of actually learning something.",
    "This is a terrible mathematics course. I came into this course having taken multivariable calculus in high school, and was expecting a deeper treatment of the subject along with a focus on rigorous examples of its real world uses. Instead, the course just covers the mechanics of how to do multivariable calculus. That's right-just mechanics. Almost every problem you will do could be entered into mathematica with a little bit of coaxing. If you sign up for this course, expect to be come out very good at mechanics you will never use in the real world.",
    "This is a good alternative to MATH 120, even if you don't plan on becoming an engineer. The text is good, so it doesn't really matter that Professor Henrich is quite boring or that the lectures don't really cover anything that's not explicitly in the text. I'd recommend the class if you don't want to take 120, but it's really all the same. Basically just take this class if you need the math credit for something.",
    "It was a great course with reasonable grading (problem sets are manageable) and the textbook is helpful. Professor Henrich and all of the TFs are great at going over psets. The only difficult thing is that all of the other students do extremely well so the curve can be tricky.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is more interested in applying calculus to physics and engineering problems than in derivations and proofs.",
    "I'd advise against taking it over Math 120. I hear Math 120 has smaller sections that make sure you understand everything, whereas Enas just has the single large lecture. Also, because it is less well established, there weren't any practice tests.",
    "Much better than Math 120! ;)",
    "If you want\/need to take ENAS 151 or MATH 120, I would suggest this class, based on the fact that my experience with the math department has been more than unpleasant. Professor Henrich is a great instructor. The material in this class isn't too difficult if you have the basics of calc down.",
    "ENAS 151 was pretty boring at times because we stuck to the textbook exactly-- straight multivariable calc can get a little dry. The positive side of this is that the course did its job of teaching me the material and it followed a very logical progression, allowing me to do a lot of work on my own. There were some physics applications discussed along the way, and we didn't waste time proving anything, which was nice, but it's definitely not a particularly fun class.",
    "Take it if you need to take multivariable calculus and are planning on an engineering major. If not, I'd say avoid it if you can.",
    "The class is boring, but not unbearable. If you have the will to learn the material, the class won't be difficult. However, if you're looking for an engaging professor and stimulating course material, you simply won't find it here. I would recommend this class only if you're looking for an easier version of Math 120 or if you're just trying to meet a curriculum\/major requirement. Otherwise, stay away.",
    "Enas 151 is like Math 120, except its teaching focuses on the equations rather than proofs. The main problem with this is that knowing how each equation was derived will aid you on the final. Another problem with it is that people who take this class have already taken a form of multivariable, so make sure you're on top of it if you haven't. Lecture is honestly optional with Henrich. The textbook is all you need - it's good.",
    "This is a good course to take to learn multi-variable calculus. I would definitely recommend taking this course to students who would rather not have to learn all the proofs associated with multi. However, even though the course title says \"with engineering apps\" there are almost no applications taught in the course. Furthermore, time spent going to lectures could be better spent catching up on sleep or doing other homework. Lectures are dry and boring and the instructor makes a lot of mistakes on examples and such. It is much better to just read the book on your own time. Problem sets take about 2-3 hours a week and the tests aren't very hard provided you know the material.",
    "I would recommend the course if you have to take multivariable calculus. It is very boring and probably my least favorite course this semester, but I do feel like you learn a good deal of probably useful information. I've also heard that it is much better than Math 120, and after taking 115 last year, I very much can believe that.",
    "Take this class if necessary, otherwise avoid it.",
    "I would recommend this class. The workload is very manageable and the topic is not extremely difficult. Tests are fair and straightforward, so not every often are there tricky questions. The lectures go very tightly with the book, and it goes at a relatively slow pace. It's not the best math class out there, but when it comes down to choosing between MATH 120 or ENAS 151, this is the way to go.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class with Professor Henrich. DO NOT TAKE IT unless there is a different professor. It was the most boring class I have EVER taken. I learned all of multi from the textbook. During lecture, professor Henrich basically wrote the textbook on the board and said it out loud in a monotone voice.",
    "If you can't get into Math120, just take this course. I'm not sure if it's taught as well, but I hear the class is a lot easier in terms of tests and workload in general. Prepare to do a lot of the learning on your own however.",
    "Just as the title describes it Multivariable Calculus for Engineers definitely preferable to math 120 if you're actually interested in learning something as opposed to mere derivations. Yes I would recommend this course to anyone interested in pursuing multivariable calculus.",
    "You're probably not taking this just for fun, but it's not too bad of a class. Half the class, maybe more, didn't show up after the first two weeks, and they did just as well as those who did. Lectures are drawn straight from the book and the grading of tests and problem sets is pretty merciless and illogical. Be prepared to teach yourself, unless you're gifted at either math or staying awake in class.",
    "This class is a lecture that builds on single variable calculus, extending it to another dimension. I would recommend this class if you need it to fulfill a major requirement.",
    "I took this class as an alternative to Math 120, because I thought we were going to focus more intensely on actual applications of what we were learning. This consisted practically of occasional slides in the lecture about some way the theorem du jour is used in engineering, but we rarely did anything specialized in our own work, because all the problem sets followed the textbook. If you are considering this class, it's probably because you have to take it, so I would definitely recommend shopping a few sections of Math 120. If you get a good vibe from any of those professors, it may be better to take that class instead, because Henrich is just boring.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who needs to take math but has a stronger physics background than calculus background. Don't take it if it is not a requirement.",
    "It's a good, not so challenge course.",
    "Usually, students decide between taking ENAS 151 and MATH 120. I can't really speak for 120, because I clearly didn't take it, but I know that that this course focuses more on using the concepts than deriving them. If you're more interested in this application-based type of math over proofs and theorems, this is the course for you.",
    "Not the most exciting class ever, but a good introduction to multivariable and a good basis for future math classes.",
    "This class ironically lacks in applications, you'd probably be better off taking MATH120 where the topics are explained more thoroughly.",
    "I would highly recommend ENAS 151 over Math 120. Essentially it is an easier course. What that really means though is that 151 is taught from a much more practical standpoint that those pursuing engineering are partial to instead of getting bogged down in the theoretical and proof based methods that 120 utilizes. However, for this particular course Victor Henrich did little in instruction beyond going through the formulas and examples presented in the book he found most prudent. You can most likely do a more effective job yourself, going through the concepts presented in textbook examples while working through the problem sets. The exams were remarkably reflective of the key concepts from the p-sets.",
    "You should take 120 if Henrich is teaching, unless you're exceptionally good at teaching yourself out of a book.",
    "It's an awesome course. I'd tell all my bros to take it because I learned a lot.",
    "I would say it is a pretty fair course on multivariable calculus that anyone could take as a substitute to Math 120, even if they aren't engineer majors. I know I shopped Math 120 and chose to take 151 because I could clearly understand the professor's english so I'd recommend this class to another student for the same reason.",
    "If you're intending on becoming an engineer, I recommend you take this course. It'll get your requirements out of the way and teach you what you need to know as an engineer. It gets the job done.",
    "If you are not interested in theoretical, proof-based mathematics, this course is a great alternative to math 120. This course is realistic in that it doesn't demand that you be a natural mathematician, but rather assumes that you're an average person who wants to USE math. The focus on application to engineering means that everything is taught for a purpose, no fluff or busy work. The workload is manageable and the problem sets prepare you well for exams. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot of useful math in a fairly painless way.",
    "Henrich relies too heavily on the textbook, drawing almost all his examples from it. This means that if you do not understand the example he uses in class, you no longer have another place to look one up to try to understand it.",
    "Excellent class, focuses on the important things without getting bogged down in proofs.",
    "I personally wish I had taken math 120. The application aspects which were supposed to be the focus of this class were lacking.",
    "Yes. Any downside of being in a big lecture is easily outweighed by being taught by a great professor (ENAS 151>>MATH 120). Plus, you can always go to office hours.",
    "I would recommend ENAS 151 to a student looking to take physics or engineering classes in the future. It definitely prepares you to take physics classes like 260 that require multivariable calculus, but we don't spend a lot of time learning about the origins of equations, deriving formulas, etc., so the theoretical side of the math definitely isn't emphasized. The class itself is not really thrilling, but it's good preparation and teaches you calculus that will be useful when applied to science classes.",
    "I recommend ENAS 151 to students who have a good background in single variable calculus (BC Calculus is important). The problem sets are time consuming but very reflective of exam questions. Overall, it's a good multivariable class.",
    "This course is a solid introduction to the foundations of multivariable calculus",
    "If you want to get through multi-var with a relatively easy grade, go for this. As opposed to MATH 120, you get equation sheets on the tests, and you are mostly assessed on your ability to use the math directly, rather than on an ability to creatively tackle more complex problems relating to the nature of the math itself. If you want a more thorough understanding of the math, and a reason to regularly attend class, take MATH 120.",
    "I would recommend it simply because it's a large math class and the curve it probably more generous than if one were to take Math 120.Don't expect this to be an exciting class, just one in which you learn your material.",
    "I recommend ENAS 151 as a subsitute for MATH 120, especially if you are considering engineering as a major. However, don't procrastinate on psets. They seem fairly easy but it is good to understand concepts early on. It is a good multivariable class to take. Not too hard if you have taken single variabl calc already.",
    "Recommended over Math 120 (its easier and more straightforward, while still counting for the same credit).Henrich is not a very good teacher. Material is fairly easy to follow as long as you read the textbook (which is basically what he does in class - teach directly from the book). Attending lecture becomes almost extraneous, because hardly anything is presented that's not in the book anyway.Despite claims to the contrary, applications aren't really emphasized.",
    "This course is basically an alternative to MATH 120, though somewhat easier and with less proofs. There are few, if any, applications as advertised in the course description. Henrich is ok, teaches straightforward, but adds little to what you can get from the textbook. All in all, a fairly straightforward, easy course in multivariable calculus.",
    "Better than Math 120, but still a standard multivariable class. Not as much emphasis on engineering applications as I'd hoped. The professor mainly lectures straight from the textbook so you can get by without showing up to lecture and just reading the book (as many people did).",
    "If you took International Baccalaureate or A-Levels then read this!I maxed out IB Mathematics by taking IB Higher Level Math and IB Further Maths (a course much harder than IB Higher Maths) and neither of these IB courses cover \"Multivariable calculus\".Additionally, if you took A-level Maths and Further Maths, neither of these courses cover Multivariable Calculus either.Which means you definitely want to take this Math class if you are from IB or A-level and are looking to go down the Natural Science and Engineering track at Yale. Multivariable calculus is essential to Physics and Engineering and without it, you won't get very far later down the road in these subjects.In comparison to Math 120, ENAS 151 will give you less proofs and more \"computation\" - meaning you will be drilled and drilled with problems to solve using the concepts covered in class. This is what you need especially for Physics and Engineering - so I highly recommend this course!",
    "Pretty standard class, overall. You're probably taking it to fill a prereq, and as far as this class is concerned, it will get the job done. I've heard it's better taught than certain sections of Math 120, but you should shop the two classes to see which one will be a better fit.",
    "It's exactly what you'd expect: multivariable calculus. It's not particularly exciting, but it wasn't bad either.",
    "It's a fine class to take if you need it for your major or as a pre-req. Not for fun, though.",
    "ENAS was a pretty chill class, I liked it because all the tests had formula sheets, the problem sets were pretty decent at teaching you the material, and the book is really good.",
    "Slow and steady introduction to Multi. Take this class over 120 if you're an example learner.",
    "It really depends on the person, whether he\/she likes proofs or applications more. The midterms and finals for ENAS 151 were more straight forward than MATH 120. Go ahead and shop both before deciding.",
    "I took this class because it was reported to have been better taught than the 120 sections. However, Smooke isn't teaching this course anymore, and I didn't enjoy Professor Henrich's teaching which was boring and not very effective. Perhaps I was spoiled having had Michael Frame for 115... but I hear there are other really good 120 professors now. Try to get 120 with a good professor like Frame who loves teaching and genuinely cares about his students. Unless you have some innate love for math, it's the teacher that will help you get through it.",
    "Professor Henrich did not do a very good job of teaching and lectures were hard to sit through. Problem sets can take a long time (it wasn't that uncommon to pull an all nighter to finish one) but if you read the textbook carefully and thoroughly, you can do fine.",
    "I learned a lot from ENAS 151 just by sitting down and going through the problem sets and studying for the exams. That said, this was just what I was looking for in the class: a better understanding of multivariable calculus to better prepare me for future science classes. If you're trying to choose between this and Math 120, as I understand it, the difficulty of Math 120 is higher and it may be difficult to find a good professor in that department. ENAS 151 will remind you a lot of your high school math class.",
    "Great course to learn Multivariable Calculus without getting bogged down by proofs. Recommended for those who want to do engineering but don't like the abstract math parts.",
    "ENAS151 is a multivariable course without belaboring the theory. Applications of the theory are introduced but could be further developed. I was not disappointed with my choice.",
    "ENAS 151 was a good introduction to multivariable calculus. We spent little, if any, time trying to work through theorem proofs, and there was always a brief segment showing why the concepts we learned were important and how they're used today. The weekly problem sets aren't too bad, as long as you don't do them the night before they're due. All the assessments were pretty fair. Granted, I never saw the TAs for the class, so if you need help, you have one less resource. All in all, it was a standard math course. If you're interested in the material, it certainly won't be painstaking.",
    "This is a great course for anyone who's interested in multivariable calculus and doesn't want to go through the pain of doing the more proof based equivalent offered by the math department. There is a formula sheet too on midterms and finals. But beware of the steep curve!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. The course is clear cut for the most part. The tests are over material similar to that of the problem sets. The workload is not light, but there are no unbearable requirements or surprises.",
    "ENAS 151 is similar to MATH 120, but if you had the choice, take the former. If you like being able to follow along exactly in the book, and prefer applications to proofs, then this class is for you.",
    "ENAS 151 is a great course for someone to take instead of Calc 120. It is a completely different setting however, as it is a large lecture. I would recommend it because I personally liked the applications.",
    "I would recommend this course for students interesting in engineering, otherwise, no.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student interested in math and science, but the material is too advanced for a beginner.",
    "Thoroughly straightforward. Just learn the math, do the homework, take the test. Nothing special, but a good class to learn what you need to learn.",
    "This class is a lot of hard work, but I feel like I learned a lot by taking it. I struggled with the course material mostly because math does not come very naturally to me, but lectures were usually clear and easy to follow. Reading the material before lecture is helpful. I would also recommend getting an early start to the problem sets, as many of them will require several hours to complete. I found the midterms and final to be challenging, but they were fair. I would recommend this course, but caution that a lot of effort will be required if you wish to do very well in it.",
    "If Henrich is teaching it, do not take it. Take Math 120 instead. It's a large lecture class with no sections. Also there minimal discussion of any applications that the math is used for."
