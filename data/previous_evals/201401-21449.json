    "Actually do not take this class. I am serious. There are better CS credits and better writing credits than this. The readings were impossible to understand, and the lectures were not much clearer. Papers were hard and confusing and graded arbitrarily. I have no idea what I just spent a semester learning. There is no reason to subject yourself to this. You can do better.",
    "WR credit and CS elective. doesn't get much better if you need a writing credit and are a CS major",
    "I definitely wouldn't repeat this experience. It wasn't the worst thing ever, but I'm sure I could have taken a more engaging writing course. Or even philosophy course.",
    "This course is a study of the philosophy of the mind with tie-ins to artificial intelligence. It has been one of the more interesting courses I have taken in CS here; it is mostly philosophy, though, so I would encourage you to take it if you have interest in philosophy and discourage you from taking it if philosophy causes you physical pain. I had never studied philosophy before this course, but found it enlightening and approachable. I would generally recommend it.",
    "This was a terrible class. Yes, if you are into philosophy at all or are any good at BSing a couple of essays this is a goldmine of gut-tasticness, however, if you want to learn something\/are more interested in actual computer science than in philosophy\/want to know what is happening look elsewhere.",
    "CPSC 471 is a good introduction to the philosophy of artificial intelligence. That said, it doesn't involve any programming and not much quantitative material. If you're interested in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, it's a good class to take. There are weekly readings and three papers. The workload is fairly light. You'll think seriously about some of the philosophical problems in AI.",
    "Philosophy of mind is really hard for me, a CS major, to grasp. I feel that the philosophy and cogsci majors did better at digesting the material, but in the end it didn't matter too much if you could write well and clearly. As long as you didn't get too bogged down in the technicalities of the philosophy, the essays weren't that bad to write."
