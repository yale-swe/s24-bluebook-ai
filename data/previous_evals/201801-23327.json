    "By far the best class I took at Yale. Learned so much about new haven and local governance",
    "Tons of knowledge about city politics and new haven",
    "I learned about the practice of politics as opposed to theory, general life lessons, the importance of looking beyond assumptions, the rich history and cultural diversity of New Haven, and the general theory of what defines the wealth of a city",
    "I learned about how the wealth of cities comes from its people from cohesion, legitimacy, and social capital. I was able to understand New Haven better through multiple functional lenses, from policing to immigration to education. I also feel like I gained several life lessons about leadership, local politics, and decision making from the class discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Could include more diverse group of students and can allow more time for discussion with each other.",
    "I think this class is solid all around! 2 points: sometimes the reading was a lot and a guest lecturer would have been cool",
    "The strength of the course is definitely in the personal stories that John DeStefano provides from his time working in New Havens City Hall. I also feel like I learned a lot from writing the papers and from hearing other peoples perspectives in the class discussions. I thought that a potential weakness of the course is that it did not delve very deeply into any particular topic, and the readings couldve been integrated into the course better.",
    "Mayor DeStefano gives the perspective a politician, someone who knows how things actually work. While theoretical grounding was not a major pillar in the class nor rigorous debate, he primed us to begin to understand how to think about what problems occur in cities. I would recommend that future classes more aggressively try to think about the different ways one could tackle city issues."

    "Yes yes yes",
    "Most definitely! This course has been one of the most intellectual stimulating and real courses I've taken at Yale. It's very visceral, engaging, and pragmatic.",
    "If you are interested in learning more about New Haven, local politics, and building communities, yes. It wont dive deep into the policymaking side and certainly not the theory side of the issues, but rather more of an opportunity to understand holistic themes through multiple topics."
