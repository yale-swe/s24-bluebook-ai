    "Oh yes, Being and Time is one of those texts everyone should have some familiarity with, and after this class you will be a more critical reader of Heideggerian-inflected theoretical writing.",

    "I am a Romanticist, not a student of philosophy. But so much theory and criticism has been influenced by Heidegger and other phenomenological writings (for good reason: they have things in common). Now I can participate better in that discussion and be a more critical reader of the goings on in the discipline.",
    "Contributed very much to my research.",
    "It is a notoriously difficult book to read, and the chance to read it in such detail and to grapple with it is very rare. The course offered an experience of a book that all comparative literature students should know."
