   "comments": [
    "I learned new ways of reading, especially how to discern subtext and texture. I also learned how to use the mainstream as a point of contrast, which was revelatory after having taken so many classes situated squarely within the Canon.",
    "Before this course, I had read a lot of queer theory and thought about queerness in mostly theoretical terms. This class gave me the tools to read queerness on the level of the sentence, and to see how a text itself can create the dynamic of queerness.",
    "I read a lot of really excellent novels. I had the chance to look at the final paper in a way that I hadn't before; I was shaping it around materials from the Beinecke, and found that I was dancing on a line between the more traditional close reading paper I had done for English classes before and a research paper. This was thrilling, and incredibly interesting. That said, I really struggled at the end when it came to forming a vast amount of material from a lot of different angles into a single paper. I don't quite feel at this point that I've learned how to write that kind of paper. That said, I've learned that I have a ways to go figuring that out, and moreover that I want to figure it out, and that's very valuable."

    "This class has an amazing reading list and Warner is a top-notch professor. However, it does have sometimes too much reading and it was hard when Warner didn't divide the book in half so you didn't know how far to read for Monday versus for Wednesday. That was really the only weakness.",
    "This course has a killer reading list--everything is in conversation with everything else, which is rare in my experience. The class also benefits from a great professor. Professor Warner has so much knowledge and wisdom to share that my main recommendation would be for him to make this course a lecture. Very few of us had the context or skills to be partners with him in discussion, and I would much rather have just listened to him lecture throughout. His views on the texts are also pretty settled, so he led our discussion in what sometimes felt like a predetermined direction. Great class overall--take it if you have any interest in the subject matter.",
    "The course offered a great survey in midcentury queer literature, and Michael Warner is a wonderful professor and brilliant reader. The only improvement I would suggest is perhaps reading a few representative writers rather than a lot of different ones. And, more writers of color or minority writers.",
    "I felt that the novels we worked with were excellent, and well handled in the class. I felt overall less competent in working with the poetry and films that were brought in. It highlights a bit of a paradox this is a senior seminar, and I certainly didn't come in expecting an introductory level course. That said, I hadn't worked with any poetry more modern than The Wasteland in my time at Yale, or really American poetry at all. I felt that I lacked a foundation that would have been beneficial. I think, perhaps, that the solution speaks less to the need to change this class, and more to the need to perhaps adjust the English major prerecs, or offer more opportunities within the requirements to take class on 20th century literature."

    "This course is spectacular. Take it if only for the reading list. Professor Warner is absolutely brilliant and the discussions in this class will blow you away. The workload can be heavy, especially when you're reading 400 page novels or what amounts to gay prison porn, but it is worth it. The workload is a 10 page paper and a 20 page final paper, both of which give you a ton of freedom with the texts you've read and ones you haven't. Definitely take this class.",
    "This class is intense. Have a strong English background. Be prepared to vocalize opinions and read long texts extremely closely. Prepare for class or you'll be ripped apart. Not in a mean way, but class discussion is a space of intense learning and you won't be able to participate if you are not prepared. You can't BS your way through classs. Read the texts. Form an argument. And HAVE TEXTUAL EVIDENCE. That's my biggest tip - have textual evidence, have an argument, and be prepared to vocalize and wrestle with that argument.",
    "Yes. Take it if you're at all interested in the subject. I think this course would work better as a lecture, but the background you come away with, as well as the ability to benefit from a semester with Prof. Warner, is worth the sometimes stilted discussions.",
    "Absolutely. Queer literature needs to be valued more, and I think this is a great course that all English majors should have to take.",
    "I would recommend this class. The reading list was great I hadn't read any of the works, or really anything akin to any of the works, in any of my other classes so far. I also appreciated the encouragement in the final paper assignment to branch out from the reading list and use Beinecke materials. If archival research is something that interests you, this class is a great opportunity. I took this class while also taking Chauncey's LesGay lecture, and the two complimented each other really well; if the subject matter interests you and that combo is available, I would definitely recommend it. Professor Warner isn't my favorite seminar leader I sometimes found it hard to follow his trains of thought. He is, however, extremely knowledgable, and patient when you do ask for clarification."
