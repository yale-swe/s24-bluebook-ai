    "If you love yourself, take this class.",
    "This was one of the most fun classes I've taken at Yale. I looked forward to going to class every time. Lectures were super interactive and there was a lively energy throughout the semester that made learning these concepts so fun. I would recommend this course to other students!",
    "Very good course -- starting from level 0, worked through notes, scales, chords, harmony, rhythm\/melody\/form, etc. Also had a few days discussing non-Western music. Greater understanding of classical and pop music.",
    "Extremely fun class! You learn a lot in a short period of time. Homework can get a bit tedious but the class is great.",
    "Would 100%recommend this class.",
    "A great intro course to music theory. Even if you have a basic understanding of music theory, this is still a good place to start in the Yale music program, as it is very comprehensive and really solidifies the knowledge before you move onto a higher level class.",
    "Relaxed environment in which you learn intro music skills",
    "A fun class but might require more work than you think"
