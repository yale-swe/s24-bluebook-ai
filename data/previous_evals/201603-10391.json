   "comments": [
    "I became much more adept at using various materials and translating ideas from my mind into physical works. I realized that art can be used for a number of purposes, and is a different entity for different people.",
    "Great class. I learned a lot not only about not only sculpture techniques but gained a greater appreciation for art in general.",
    "I learned so much -- about art, making things, thinking critically about art. I loved going to class every day. I feel empowered to make the things I set my mind to. I also learned how to talk about art and how to examine a work and derive meaning from it. Sandra is an incredible professor who cares so much about each student, and I learned so much from her.",
    "Learned how to work with new materials such as wood, plaster, cement, alginate, and foam. Learned how to critique others in an insightful way that is beneficial without being too harsh.",
    "I learned some of the most practical skills in this course, more so than in any other I've taken at yale: how to build a wall to code, for example, or how to find the best lumber.",
    "Thinking about sculpture materials-from found objects to plaster and spray foam What questions to ask when looking at art objects How to use materials to communicate ideas"

   "comments": [
    "The course is very good at introducing students to materials that at first seem complicated and unwieldy but that turn out to be interesting to work with. There is also a nice sense of community engendered by the course.",
    "Fantastic overall. Could have used even more short term projects though. I only felt like I was really getting the hang of the concepts towards the end.",
    "Strengths: Sandra, the facilities, the conversations, the freedom, the encouragement that she provides, looking forward to going to class every day Weaknesses: I don't know that I actually felt comfortable enough in the shop to actually go in there and make use of it",
    "Very unstructured which is probably an advantage but it was hard to grab the attention of the professor or TF at certain times throughout the class. Maybe a bit more time looking at pieces of art together instead of on our own would help us notice certain aspects that we miss while seeing things in our own spaces.",
    "I honestly can't think of many weaknesses of the courseit was all great.",
    "Could possibly use collections around campus to get inspiration, though looking at the MFA students work and other artists' work in the classroom was excellent."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in working with his or her hands and expressing ideas in a physical manner. It is enjoyable, engaging, and a wonderful break from the academic rigors of student life.",
    "Definitely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Sandra is a phenomenal professor who cares so much about all her students and helping them learn and make things. I learned a lot about how to take a dream of a thing and make it into a reality. I feel like my art improved over the course of the semester, as well as my ability to think critically about other peoples' works of art. I feel more fluent in a language that was foreign to me before. I felt so supported even though I had no sculpture or art experience, and it was a true privilege to be able to take this class and learn with Sandra!",
    "Would recommend if you're \"afraid\" that you can't be an artist and want to try something new. It's great to get to be in the presence of very intellectual and insightful artists here at Yale, but also be able to do art without fearing judgement.",
    "Amazing course. Professor Burns is the best.",
    "I absolutely recommend this classSandra is a wonderful teacher and the times I spent in the shop were some of the most rewarding of the semester.",
    "Absolutely, the course encouraged students from many disciplines to explore sculpture making methods; it was the perfect intro course to sculpture."
