    "I learned a lot about fan culture and how to write an effective analytical paper.",
    "I learned to succinctly as well as how to properly structure a college essay.",
    "Coming into Yale, I thought that I was an adequate writer, but this class allowed me to hone my skills and improve my analysis.",
    "Definitely one of the best humanities\/english classes I've taken in my entire life; spent a lot of time reflecting about topics I was genuinely interested, and the seminar format of the course allows for people to speak freely and contribute.",
    "I think I absolutely learned how to become a stronger writer all around. I understand the importance of having a clear structure before I begin writing so that I am able to follow a sort of roadmap towards my final essay. I also learned how to comprehend longer readings and be able to discuss them in an intimate classroom setting.",
    "I learned about fan culture within our society and how we interact with cultural objects that we on an individual basis are fans of. My writing and critical thinking skills were challenged and improved.",
    "I gathered a much greater understanding of the English language and how to manipulate it in academic writing. I also further gained insight into the world of fandom in which we emerge ourselves at almost all points in our lives.",
    "I improved my academic writer and, through the readings we did, got exposed to a lot of important theorists in the humanities and their writings. The class discussions we had were always really interesting and made me think about things in a different way."

    "It was a great class with a lot of reading and a heavy workload.",
    "Did not see any weaknesses.",
    "This course is great in that you are reading interesting material while learning how to write. I really loved it.",
    "0 improvements.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course is that it truly teaches you how to become a better writer throughout the 4 essays we are required to write. Because of the small class size I always felt that my opinion was valued and important to the class discussion. One thing that I think could be improved is to have all the resources (assignment sheets, etc.) up on the canvas site.",
    "Strengths were adequate workload and active discussion; no weaknesses."

    "The grading can be harsh but it's an excellent class to advance your writing skills.",
    "Absolutely! I really enjoyed this course and Professor Li made it my favorite class to go to",
    "Yes. Professor is great and the topic is interesting.",
    "English 114 is a great class for anyone to take who wants to improve their writing or get a fairly easy writing credit out of the way. Fans, Culture and Society is a really great topic and was very interesting to learn about. Definitely a *fan* of this course.",
    "Studying cultural movements and consumer culture is important for any academic subject; in my own terms, I'm interested in entrepreneurship, and this class perfectly suited my interests.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a great way for freshman to learn how to write for college essays and get more comfortable with talking in a small classroom setting with their peers. We also did several debates which was an excellent way to get students to engage in persuasive thinking.",
    "Yes absolutely. The topics discussed were interesting and the freedom to write about something that I was a fan of allowed for large amounts of creativity.",
    "Yes. It was eye opening and mind expanding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a writing credit or just a good discussion class. You get good feedback on your papers and the discussions are overall really fun and valuable."
