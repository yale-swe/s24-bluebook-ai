    "I learned how to think and talk about poetry, how to generate poetry on a regular basis, how to read poetry collections, and how to think about the way poetry collections are put together.",
    "A space to practice and receive constructive criticism.",
    "I continued to improve in my ability to draft poems, revise my own work, and comment on the work of others. I also practiced reading and responding to books of poems.",
    "I refined my writing and interpretive skills, and became a more self aware and perceptive writer. I enjoyed the weekly prose assignments. I had never written literary criticism before, and I think I got a pretty good grasp of it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As a workshop, the class structure was set, so I'm not really sure how to suggest any improvements. I actually really like not having a set workshop schedule because I felt constantly compelled to try to create work that was up to par. I loved having prompts in the intro class and do wish we had more prompts this time, but since we had the opportunity to request prompts this wasn't much of a problem. However, I can understand why someone who hasn't taken the intro class might feel a little overwhelmed with the discussion. Louise makes herself extremely accessible and I have a lot of admiration and appreciation for the amount of work she did for us.",
    "Strengths are that poetry becomes an active and encompassing part of your life. Workshop is helpful, and your writing will benefit. Weaknesses are an excess of freedom.",
    "The strength of the class is the ability to read the work of other really talented students, and to work directly with Louise, an incredibly generous reader who always makes herself available to students and whose feedback is sharp and helpful.",
    "Poetry is so subjective that I felt really adrift the whole time, even after private meetings. I just had no idea what was going to land and what wasn't. It's frustrating.",
    "Louise's extensive feedback, incisive commentary, and demanding assignments make the course a great place to develop skill. The devotion of all discussion time to critiquing student poems could feel indulgent, empty, and sometimes tedious. It may have been nice to occasionally have an assigned reading by a distinguished poet to discuss in class, as we did in into verse writing."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I loved being challenged to think critically about the craft of poetry every week in a way that isn't academic, and I loved having the opportunity to be asked to create work on a regular basis. Louise is incredible in every way -- incredibly smart, incredibly insightful and incisive, incredibly funny. You learn so much just from listening to her talk, from the vocabulary she brings to the analysis. It's a wonderful class and a wonderful workshop experience.",
    "Yes, if your love for poetry comes from a Love for poetry.",
    "Amazing class. Lots of laughter, lots of good feedback. I found that written comments on my poems and individual meetings were much more useful than workshops. Buta real joy, and so wonderful to have the chance to sit with \/ write about a book of poetry of your choosing each week in addition to writing the weekly poem.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are individually motivated to improve their own poetry writing and process, as well as who are looking to engage more rigorously in reading the work of others.",
    "Take it if you can.",
    "The weekly critical and creative assignments, and Louise's thorough and insightful feedback, make this class a great venue for becoming a better reader and writer of poetry."
