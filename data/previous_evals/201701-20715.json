   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the history of South Africa. I also learned how to think about race, nation building, and African nationalism in a more complex way.",
    "My understanding of South Africa's present was greatly improved by this sweeping introduction to its history. I developed some primary research skills by working in Manuscripts and Archives for the two papers.",
    "Became a better writer about history, and gained an extensive knowledge on the history of South Africa.",
    "A comprehensive survey of the history of South Africa",
    "absolutely amazing class. learned so much about South Africa and feel like it was so interesting connecting it to other courses at Yale.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Prof. Magaziner is an excellent lecturer and I learned so much. Lots of readings but I actually was interested in the material so I did them all, section was very well run, papers were interesting to write. Absolutely take this course.",
    "An important and under-taught area of history, at least in the US. For someone that knew nothing about SA this was a good eye opener.",
    "I learned a lot about South African history, though perhaps not as comprehensively as I might have liked, and I was pushed to explore thematic narratives in ways I'm not used to doing in history lectures.",
    "Excellent course",
    "I learned about the history of south africa but also about history in general and the many different ways it can be interpreted and studied.",
    "I knew nothing about Africa before taking this class, which is regrettable and perhaps a further commentary of African studies in the American education system. But that's a whole 'nother story. By taking this class, I learned how to think like a historian. I learned how to think critically about the past, present, future. I learned how to understand people I previously understood nothing about. This class really changed my life.",
    "This course blew me away. I feel like I gained general knowledge, research skills, and lasting perspective from this course. That's a rare combination, for few courses can check all of those boxes. Somehow, Magaziner does it with ease. The course arcs over the general political\/economic\/social history of the country, material that Magaziner passes through while elegantly balancing the big picture and the sanctity of the single story. Furthermore, the course teaches decent research skills through its two primary document assignments. I encourage you to use manuscripts & archives or the divinity school's special collections. There some amazing stuff in the library! Finally, the course left me with a nuanced and developed understanding of what history can and cannot teach us, I will carry this realization with me as I move on, for it helps me understand the present with greater clarity.",
    "I learned how to question my assumptions and connect narrative to personal accounts. I feel I have a good grasp on several aspects of South Africa's past, as well as larger themes like the impacts of colonization, justice, and resistance.",
    "I learned about the history of South Africa in a broad way. I learned new ways to think about history and its uses in the present. I learned how to better analyze primary sources for a history paper.",
    "Overall history of South Africa",
    "In depth history and knowledge of the country of South Africa",
    "I learned about the history of South Africa but more generally, how subjective history can be. I learned new ways to approach historical analysis and improved my writing skills.",
    "Before taking this course, I knew vaguely about apartheid and Nelson Mandela. However, upon taking this course, I realized that South African history extends far beyond Dutch arrival and that there is so much to know about natives, Afrikaners, and more. I learned about politics and culture and how all of these elements contributed over time to what eventually came to be known as apartheid. But most of all, I learned that problems in the country did not end with apartheid. Problems sustained during that period have persisted over time and affect a wider audience now. Essentially, white people ruin everything.",
    "Gained a good introductory knowledge of South African history.",
    "I really didn't know anything about South Africa before this course, so needless to say I learned a lot in terms of pure content. I also gained a lot of new insight and perspective into how perceptions of history are constructed.",
    "This class provides a detailed overview of South African history from around the beginning of colonization to the present day.",
    "I learned about a country in the ways that it was defined by race relations, and how that intersected with gender, labor, economics, etc.",
    "nice survey of south african history",
    "This class was a perfect introduction to a less talked about side of South African history. Also a great review of historical methods in general.",
    "Learned to write history papers, learned history of South Africa",
    "I honestly knew nothing about South Africa before I took this course, so all of the content was new for me. I also feel like my ability to write historical arguments improved.",
    "Got better at thinking about history and how to analyze it.",
    "This class was great for learning in detail the history of South Africa as well as interacting directly with primary and secondary sources.",
    "Interesting class on a rarely taught area",
    "I learned an overview of South African history, and also learned how to think about race and colonialism.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. I had a very basic knowledge about South Africa prior to this course. Now, I feel like I can speak about a number of historical events and the importance of these events to major themes like identity and nationalism and their relation to race, class, space, etc.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of South African history. I was particularly interested in learning about the early history of colonialism and the ways in which Africans resisted white minority rule under Apartheid.",
    "This course was amazing. I learned an immense amount of South African history, beginning in the 16th century all the way up to the 20th century. I developed insights into the nature of race and how it was constructed and used by different groups for different aims. I developed more insights into the historical processes that lead up to apartheid system. And I learned a lot about resistance. I am very glad I took this class!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Magaziner is a fantastic lecturer and puts forward amazing arguments. The readings are also pretty good but can be a lot. You will get out of the readings as much as you put into them, but the lectures by far make this class worth it.",
    "The course's strengths are the tremendous amount of care and attention invested in selecting the week's readings, primary sources, and even walk-in lecture music. It could be improved by assigning more primary source material for discussion in section (most of the discussions were based around secondary sources). I also think that on certain weeks there were too many different reading sources to the point that I could not keep them straight, mentally. I think once a student is reading more than 5-6 different sources, she\/ he begins to lose the ability to differentiate between them in productive ways.",
    "The strengths are the lectures. Daniel Magaziner is so engaging and just so absurdly smart, it's really hard not to feel totally roped in during each lecture. My discussion section could have been better, but I think that has less to do with the fabric of the course and more to do with my particular group.",
    "Strength: Magaziner is a very engaging lecturer, perhaps even lyrical at points. He had a strong command of the material and the course (section, lectures, readings, assignments) came together very nicely. Weakness: None I can think of offhand",
    "no complaints. fantastic lecture style, and brilliant TA.",
    "Excellent class, don't change anything except maybe leave a little more time for present day issues like HIV\/AIDS at the end of the course. The only lecture\/reading I didn't find valuable was the Cry of Winnie Mandela reading\/lecture.",
    "His lecture style is hard to follow at times without any notes. If you miss something it's hard to catch up. That being said, Magaziner is a great orator.",
    "The lectures are very good, but the readings felt overwhelming and irrelevant; and even when I did all of them, I felt my understanding of big themes was floundering. I honestly would've preferred if we'd had in-class tests so that we'd be pushed to bring narratives together; it felt easy to get by confused in this class and just discuss themes instead of the actual history.",
    "N\/A",
    "Strengths... I don't even know. Everything. Literally fantastic. Weaknesses: the same. Because it was so good, I often felt disappointed that I was not able to divert the full attention and time to the class that I wanted to. I also wasn't a huge fan of the final paper (probably would have preferred a final exam with IDs and essays rather than a single long paper) but this may also have been my psychological exhaustion post-exams speaking rather than an actual distaste for the final paper. Otherwise I literally could not find a single thing wrong with this class.",
    "Strengths: Magaziner. The man is the best lecturer I've ever had, and that's including Chauncey. Weaknesses: it's a lecture, so it suffers from the lack of buy-in that lectures tend to propagate in this community.",
    "Lectures were great. Material was presented in an engaging way and fit together well. Going to lecture was always interesting, often exciting and fun. I also felt the assessments were structured well. I liked the two primary source analyses and the final. I think it could be improved by changing the reading. To me, the best sections were ones in which we had shorter selections to discuss. I felt like spending 45 minutes discussing a full novel or monograph, especially when we didn't talk about them much in lecture, did not really do justice to the work and made the discussion unfocused.",
    "It is a good course but sometimes puts too much intellectual history on the table when there are students who don't have a good baseline knowledge of South African history.",
    "The course's strengths are its lectures and reading lists. The primary source analysis assignments are a great, manageable way to engage more deeply with the subject matter. The final assignment is misleading - I feel as though I would have been able to produce something more meaningful if the prompts were not as broad. If the intention is to imitate a take-home exam, it seems like it would be more helpful to make the assignment much shorter.",
    "The professor tells the history like a story which I love.",
    "Amazing lecturers, great readings",
    "strengths: Magaziner is the best lecturer at Yale. I found it so easy to pay attention to his every word. material was immensely interesting. weaknesses: the readings were long and I felt like I didn't need to do all of them to get what I needed out of this class. did the sign-in sheet actually matter? no assignments beyond papers, so I was pretty disengaged beyond section. wish we had some type of reading response with completion grades or something, just to be getting feedback throughout the semester.",
    "Lectures are very interesting - Magaziner is a great lecturer. The structure of three papers is nice because it is more relevant to actual historical scholarship (as opposed to in-class midterms)",
    "The lectures were really wonderful and taught me a lot. The reading load, I thought, could have been a but lighter. I thought that the primary source analysis papers were a really productive way, in the context of this course, to explore a specific topic more deeply. The take-home final exam felt a whole lot more like a final paper. I would have preferred an actual final exam, or at least to have known from the beginning of the course that there was a twelve page writing assignment waiting at the end (for the purpose of time management and schedule planning).",
    "Professor Magaziner is an incredible lecturer. His lectures are very well put together, very engaging, and give you all the basic information you need to know for the course. The reading selections are also very interesting. I can't think of much I would change, except, perhaps, slightly decreasing the amount of reading. It's hard to do all of the reading, so if there is less, we're all more likely to do all of it and then will all be on the same page during discussion sections.",
    "The course material is SO interesting, and I love the lectures. However, there's a lot of reading, so it felt really difficult to effectively engage with all the reading for a given week.",
    "nice lectures- could directly reference the readings",
    "I thought this class was all around phenomenal.",
    "Lectures were amazing Lots of reading - couldn't do most of it",
    "Magaziner is amazing and these lectures are a joy to listen to. The syllabus is really carefully designed, and the readings all aim to tell stories that you might miss in the dominant narrative of South African history. I can't really think of any major weaknesses. This was really a great class.",
    "Too much reading.",
    "The strengths are the interesting readings and the level of engagement with such great readings.",
    "Magaziner's a great lecturer. He does skip around in time and space, which is common for history professors but confusing in a class I, and I believe many others, are coming in with 0 background knowledge about South Africa.",
    "The readings do not always seem very connected to the lectures. Professor Magaziner is an amazing lecturer though. The quality of the course really depends on your TA.",
    "The lectures were incredible. Magaziner is a gem, and is what makes the class so great. The primary source analysis papers are actually incredibly fun. My biggest issue was that the syllabus often didn't match the readings on classesv2, so the readings could possibly be more clear, but that's it.",
    "The lectures are absolutely fascinating, especially later in the course, as are the readings. The material feels like it holds enormous gravity, and is often beautiful and always tragic. The final could be restructured so it's not quite so open ended.",
    "The lectures were always engaging. The reading load started off heavy but got better as time went on. I think race, class, and space were all major themes of the course, but there could be a larger\/more intertwined focus on gender.",
    "Strengths - great lectures, very well-delivered Weaknesses - difficulty getting a tangible grasp on the history, more emotion and general sweeps of history + turning points, rather than the who\/what\/when\/where\/why (though I guess this is up to personal preference) but if you asked me to tell you about South African History after taking this course, I would answer with more emotion than fact. Assessment weighting could be reevaluated very harshly graded first paper where expectations were not very clear.",
    "Strengths: Great lectures, interesting readings Weakness: Reading load can be quite significant.",
    "Very strong course - Magaziner has no words on the slides, only relevant and interesting images to complement the lecture. There is also music played before each class! The structure of the course is very well organized and a lecture outline is posted the morning before each class which makes it easier to follow in class and also take notes. One weakness is that on two or three different occasions images shown were too graphic and insensitive. Another improvement which is not directly for this course but for African Studies classes in general would be to hire African professors from Africa as their expertise and insight is invaluable and not comparable to even the best non-African professors.",
    "Professor Magaziner is easily the best lecturer at Yale. The lectures for this class are amazing, but the outside materials and readings can be dull. I definitely preferred readings for his fall course \"African Encounters with Colonialism,\" but I think both classes do an amazing job constructing and critiquing historical narratives."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this class if you are interested in African history, history of colonization, racial formation, or nation building.",
    "This is one of Yale's best history lectures. Professor Magaziner is truly wonderful, though intense and easily flustered. Learn about the subcontinent and its violent, complicated, and important past.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in taking a strong traditional history survey class or if you have a reason to learn more about South African history (which itself compresses many \"transportable\" concepts and historical processes)",
    "absolutely. take it. one of the best lectures I've had at yale, even if you aren't particularly interested in the topic going in... shop it and you'll understand.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Prof. Magaziner is an excellent lecturer and I learned so much. Lots of readings but I actually was interested in the material so I did them all, section was very well run, papers were interesting to write. Thuto is the best TA I have had by far. Absolutely take this course.",
    "Yes but only if you have the time and interest to fully commit!",
    "If you REALLY like thematically-driven history, this may be a good course for you, but I found it to be a bit over-hyped. I don't find that I really got a great grasp on the main ideas, especially because the assignments, readings, and section didn't foster that. The lecture is good and interesting, but I overall found the course unsatisfying.",
    "Absolutely, great lectures and engaging work",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It's a really interesting lecture and the readings are good. Magaziner is really intense, but he rehearses his lectures, so they sound basically like you're attending a one man play or listening to an audio book. 2 short papers and a take home final, so it's a manageable workload.",
    "please take this class. It should be required. Magaziner opened my eyes not just to the history of South Africa but so much else in the world. As much as this class may seem like a niche history of a single country, it is not. Even though I am a STEM student and this was my first history class at Yale, History of South Africa was by far my favorite class at Yale overall.",
    "Without hesitation. This class gives as much as you put in, but you can still learn without taking it seriously (i.e. you can Cr\/D 335 and still learn and grow. That said, you'll get more out of it if you take it for a grade.",
    "Take it. Brilliant class and great lecturer. However, don't get forget that this is a story about South Africa and South Africans. Leave your feelings at the door, if they aren't crying about their lives, you shouldn't be crying either.",
    "yes!!",
    "Yes.",
    "A wonderful class! Do the readings if you can -- they are a great complement to lecture.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes! Professor Magaziner is an engaging and dynamic lecturer and the course material is super interesting in and of itself. Would highly recommend.",
    "Yes - but there is a lot of reading. You learn a lot about South Africa.",
    "Yes! Take it! Prof. Magaziner is a wonderful storyteller and the content is so important and resonates with many different subject areas and fields.",
    "Yes, a great history course",
    "Yes, fantastic course",
    "Definitely",
    "tl;dr absolutely 100% take this course even if you're not a history major lectures are amazing Best lectures I've attended at Yale. Magaziner is engaging and you can't help but listen. I took the course credit\/d just so I could sit there and listen to him and not really worry about writing everything down and that was definitely the move. There is so much to know about South Africa beyond apartheid, and problems in the country still persist following its removal as a system. I read all the reviews before taking this and they encouraged me to shop the course and I'm so glad I did. Can't recommend this course enough.",
    "Yes, this is a great class. Relatively low-key but very interesting. You can get away without doing any of the readings and still get a fair bit out of the class.",
    "The lectures for this course are very engaging, and the content is so important; I've gained a lot of insight on how history shapes itself, and drawn a lot of very direct, often unsettling connections to current events. I will warn that the reading load is heavy; this was not the best choice of a lecture to take credit D. I know a lot of people audited it, which seems like a great idea if it doesn't fit in your schedule. If you're going to take it, I would recommend really making sure you have time to put into it.",
    "I would recommend to anyone who would like to know more about South Africa.",
    "It's an incredible class with really effective lectures and fascinating readings. If you want to know more about how race can really shape a history, it's fascinating. However, there's a lot of reading that's really interesting--albeit sometimes hard to handle. And grading can be bit tough. But saying all that, I'd still take it.",
    "YES! This was one of the best courses that I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would a good class for its lectures-",
    "Definitely! One of my favorite classes thus far! If you go to lecture and stay engaged during sections you will get so much out of this class!",
    "Incredible class definitely take it! Magaziner is great",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's a history of South Africa, but as Magaziner said early in the semester, it's also a story of how society becomes unjust. In terms of work, all of the readings are reasonable and enjoyable. The two essays aren't a big deal and the final is take-home.",
    "Yes, this is a good course. It's hard, but you'll learn a lot, if you pay attention.",
    "Absolutely take this course. I say this without reservation, History of South Africa has been one of the most rewarding intellectual experiences I have had in my life. Do yourself a favor and take this course. The lectures are well-organized and deepen your understanding of the nuanced issues that affected the development of South Africa's history. Professor Magaziner was flawless in his presentation and very approachable. The TA's were well-informed and facilitated great discussion sessions.",
    "Take this course! Super important history that continues to be relevant and not just within South Africa. You will also learn to be a better historian -- good writing and interaction with primary sources.",
    "History of South Africa is the kind of class you come to Yale for; a class that constitutes a unique learning experience, one that teaches you in a way that no book or YouTube video on the subject could have. Professor Magaziner is an incredible professor. His lectures are consistently great and at times border on poetic. He's mastered the use of carefully composed and timed visual presentations to complement and elevate his lectures. While some of his lectures are so dense they're almost overwhelming, you learn a ton. Magaziner doesn't just present South Africa as a chronology of dry facts--he constructs a narrative rich with thematic depth and a human focus that imbues it with a genuine emotional weight. The TAs are excellent, and the reading list is challenging (intellectually and emotionally) and incredible. If you don't mind lectures with a preference for the abstract over the concrete and somewhat tough grading, I can't imagine a better way to learn the history of South Africa. It's a history that you have a responsibility to know, just for the way it reflects so many fundamental truths about human nature. Take this class--it's a gem that shouldn't be missed by anyone, history major or otherwise.",
    "Definitely! Interesting, low workload, well taught lecture class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend. Magaziner's lectures are a gem.",
    "This is a fantastic course and I highly recommend it. The lectures are amazing, the readings are really interesting, and the subject matter is extremely important and makes you think differently about the world, the U.S., and colonialism (and South Africa, of course). It is a lot of work, but the readings are interesting and the assignments are actually very fun.",
    "Yes. In addition to the interesting course material, I feel like this course challenged me to think more broadly about the role of history in past and contemporary processes of race\/class\/gender etc.",
    "Take this class, but consider taking it Credit\/D - the lectures are very well-delivered but it can be a scramble to transfer the emotion of the lectures\/general vibe of history that Magaziner storytells into hard history required for the assessments. First paper is pretty harshly graded so speak to Magaziner\/your TA before picking a topic! Overall however, fascinating history that everyone should know.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I went in with a very limited knowledge of South African history and emerged feeling like I had learned a great deal over the course of the semester. Professor Magaziner is a wonderful lecturer. He lectures in a narrative style and clearly cares a lot about telling the story of South African history in the right way. However, the reading load can be quite significant and the final exam is really a twelve-page final paper. Don't take the class expected it to be a limited amount of work.",
    "YES PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN, BEFORE YOU GRADUATE FROM THIS UNIVERSITY. Your mind will be blown. History, and especially this one, taught by this professor, is so important to learn and I think it will be beneficial for anyone, no matter what major they are.",
