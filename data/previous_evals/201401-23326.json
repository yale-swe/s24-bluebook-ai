   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend this course. The workload is high, but you don't have to read every single page to succeed. Great opportunity to discuss works in the Western canon. I shopped the instructors for each section, and they were all excellent.",
    "The examination of what constitutes an epic by reading 6 epics, from ancient Greece to modern times.",
    "This is a great class. It can get a little old if taken immediately after 129 (because they're the same class with different literature) but I thought it was much more fun than 129, anyway. You get to read a lot of literature from the DS-curriculum, a lot of really famous writing, and talk about it with a group of really cool people. Definitely take this class if you like reading, writing, or talking to people in small seminars.",
    "Solid course, it can be a lot, but every word of the reading isn't always necessary. You get out of it what you put into it!",
    "There's a lot of reading for this class, so take this if you want to read the books. The professors for all of the sections were pretty excellent.",
    "It's a great literature course. I recommend it. Enthusiastically. As long as you like reading. It's not called epic for nothing. But as long as you like the reading list, you will like the class, as I did.",
    "ENGL 130 is a great class, if only as an excuse to read some classic works of the western canon. Readings are fun and incredibly interesting (and not too overwhelming, except maybe with Ulysses or Don Quixote, which require incredible time\/attention to deal with), discussions are largely fun and casual, and workload is moderate. If you want an excuse to read good books for school, take the class! However, don't expect super high quality seminar discussions--seminars were largely vague and undirected, often because they are dominated by freshman who often have strong ideological views that they struggle to detach from the text (they're still learning to look at the meaning of the texts within context). Despite this, the class is worth taking (although I can only speak to my personal experience--I'd imagine other sections with other teachers could be completely different.)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Even if you don't have Professor Prakas, the literature is worth it. You get to read a few pretty heavy-weight but amazing books. Ulysses was really tough but it was great to realize that it would only make more sense the more times you read it. The other books were great too. Taking this class and Tragedy (English 129) was a great decision, because it really goes through some of the best books of Western Culture."
