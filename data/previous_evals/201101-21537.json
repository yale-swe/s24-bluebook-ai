    "The course itself is fine. I look forward to retaking it in the fall with a better professor.",
    "Yes, but not with professor Wang.",
    "Take it. it's not hard.",
    "Do not take it. you learn more from taking Linear and Multivariable separately, and will probably get a better teacher.",
    "This course is pretty easy. The math you learn is useful and interesting but the teaching isn't great.",
    "Don't take this class unless you really need to. The grading was pretty tough and the teaching wasn't too great either.",
    "Terrible, but easy.",
    "not as bad as 115 or 120, definitely easier but will require alot of self-instruction",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to a fellow student as it is the next step in advancing your mathematic knowledge. Hope you can get Yu-Wen as a TA, very helpful",
    "Not if it is offered with Professor Zhenqi Wang. Otherwise the syllabus is interesting and helpful to know. Although, the part of multivariable dealing with Lagrangean is not really covered and you learn that part in Intermediate Microeconomics anyway. It just increases your comfort level with partial derivatives."
