   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you haven't already taken the Age of Disenchantment course.",
    "It is worth taking any course, with any syllabus, so long as Giuseppe Mazzotta is teaching it. Few professors combine his creativity, brilliance, enthusiasm, and kindness. Theory of the New from Petrarch to Vico was a superb course -- the readings were wonderfully rich, and the teaching could not have been better.",
    "I really really liked this class a lot. It was alot of fun. However, I probably could have gotten the just as much out of reading these texts on my own. I don't know what the issue was, perhaps the mixed graduate-undergraduate dynamic threw things off, or perhaps there simply was not enough time to talk about the texts in depth. I just thought the class was too easy. It was enjoyable however, and reading Petrarch and Vico and Campanella is always great.",
    "An intellectual history of the birth of modernity in Italy - a fascinating window into the dialogues that started it all, with a focus on originality, discovery, and the power to create the new. One of the only courses that challenges students to get down and dirty with the texts that reveal the character of modernity. I would most certainly recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would completely recommend this class to another student. It is a fundamental course to understand the Renaissance and the Baroque period."

   "comments": [
    "I don't know yet what my dissertation is going to be about, but in preparation for orals I definitely think that this class helped a lot. It was a good refresher, I took a lot of notes, I thought a lot about the material. I feel as though I have a solid grasp of what we read and would be prepared to answer questions about it.",
    "This is one of the key courses in my study of the Humanities. Prof. Mazzotta's higher expectations of his students to really see the text as a living piece of thinking and originality is an irreplaceable part of my course of study. The analytical skills I have learned from Prof. Mazzotta will most definitely come into play in my senior thesis, as will perhaps many of the works he has exposed us to.",
    "This course constituted a fundamental building block in my career. The research I have done for this class will probably be turned into a publishable article. Prof. Mazzotta was fantastic in helping me shape my thoughts and direct my research."
