    "If you're the kind of person who is good at analyzing very minute details, then this is the class for you. If you're not but don't plan on doing much reading, this class also works since you don't necessarily have to have done all the reading to understand the discussion in class (although its helpful enough that doing the reading would be worth it).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking for a broad introduction to the Western Canon, or to anyone with an interest in literature.",
    "I would highly recommend the class, which is a survey of the western cannon in literature from the Middle Ages to the 20th century with an amazing professor.",
    "Professor Levin is wonderful. She runs a tight class, looking specifically at passages of the texts she deems to be important. Through close study of a collection of small quotations, you get a surprisingly good sense of these works. This is quite a feat, given the length of some of the novels. On that note: the reading really requires effort, much more so than Fall DS. If you do Spring DS, make Lit reading your priority. If you don't get to the H&P or Philosophy readings some weeks, it's not a national tragedy. But doing the Lit reading is crucial. If you keep reading, you'll find that the books really are terrific, and have a great dialogue as time goes by. Homer pops up in Tolstoy, Plato pops up in Borges, Virgil pretty much drips from every word of Milton. It's an amazing ride. Just keep doing your reading.",
    "The material is incredible. At times it's impossible to cover it, such as when reading War and Peace, but the course still remains a phenomenal experience. You really see a lot of the Fall DS lit come to life in very different ways with lots of the authors.Professor Levin is an incredible human being. Very passionate about the material, and very very kind and encouraging. That said, some find her course a little more content driven\/focused on certain interpretations and not as skill driven as they would like -- her feedback on papers, for example, focuses on certain interpretations rather than your methods of analysis.",
    "You are very fortunate if you have Professor Levin for DS Lit. If you like DS and like Literature, you should love this section. Professor Levin brightens up the morning (9am section) and her enthusiasm is infectious. She makes it very comfortable to participate in class. She is a fabulous leader of discussion. However, she could be more open to different interpretations of the text in DS papers. Perhaps this is true of all Lit faculty, but it seems faulty to suggest that there is really only one main way a text should be understood.",
    "It's DS, so you know the deal. The readings this semester in Lit were probably my favorite semester of DS, and there's enough variety that you will find something that you fall in love with. Make sure to start War and Peace and Don Quixote early (read them over break).",
    "I certainly would recommend this course. It is a great overview of the western cannon and is also just an effective literature course; it teaches how to understand works of very different genres and historical periods. Also all the works read are really enjoyable.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is, in my opinion, the best of the Directed Studies classes. It is a little difficult to read some of the works so quickly (War and Peace), but you read such an amazing and varied (yet strangely intertwined) list of books. Fantastic."
