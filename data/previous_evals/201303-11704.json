    "Fantastic class! Wyrtzen is awesome and really works with you, even if you have minimal background knowledge of the Middle East. The workload is not that difficult, with two short papers and a final research paper. The short papers are basically reading responses and quick and easy. Take the classss",
    "I would say take it, but only if you have a grounding in the Middle East already and a capacity to handle theoretical poly-sci and sociology works.",
    "It was a course that required a large amount of reading and effort but was extremely interesting. It provided me insights about contemporary issues in the middle east.",
    "Would recommend! I knew nothing about the region before this seminar, and I left with an educated conversational knowledge. The reading load and paper lengths are fair, and you learn a lot from them. The seminar is not all conversation like most; a lot of times it turns into asking Professor Wyrtzen to explain the concepts even more -and this is how you will learn a lot! Definitely a good seminar to take.",
    "This course takes a look at the role nationalism plays in countries in the Middle East and North Africa. There is a higher concentration on North Africa than the Middle East, which actually makes it even more material since few courses actually cover this area in depth. The first few weeks are on nationalism in general and then you take a look at themes such as transnationalism, the roleof history, gender and minorities, revolutionary nationalism, and religious nationalism. As is the nature of the topic, there is a slight focus on the consequences of imperialism on nationalism. There are two response papers on the readings which you are given sufficient advanced notice for, time to write, and are returned promptly. There is also a final paper.",
    "I would highly recommend MMES 105 to students who already have a solid background knowledge in the Middle East. While background summaries are provided in class if needed, the class is structured on the assumption that students already have these building blocks for discussions, and students who had little knowledge of the Middle East struggled a bit to keep up. If you do have a good grasp on Middle Eastern history and politics, this course is an incredible forum to apply this knowledge to new issues and continue to deepen your understanding of the region in a new light."
