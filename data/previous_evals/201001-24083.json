   "comments": [
    "An engaging look into a period almost always glossed over by American history textbooks - prepare to have some of what you learned in high school turned upside-down. Professor Holloway is an excellent lecturer (he was being taped this semester) and makes coming to class worthwhile. Be warned: a fair amount of reading to do. Take the class as a writing credit, which will give you a more manageable workload and means you don't have to take a final exam.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's a great course that will teach you a lot and you don't have to kill yourself with work to do it.",
    "Take it. There is a lot of reading, but it is all worth it. Professor Holloway specifically indicates which is most important. He is the best lecturer I have encountered at Yale, and he brings in a lot of other resources to help us fully delve into the material. Songs, speeches,clips from movies, even a special outside talk with a member of the Black Panthers in his house, Professor Holloway was a wonderful instructor, and you should really take this course. Also, if Ruth Yow is leading a discussion section, get in it! She was the best TA ever.",
    "An excellent course that teaches AfAm history in an extremely relevant way. It was a pleasure to listen to every lecture, and I learned a lot. Far and away one of the best courses I've taken in four years at Yale.",
    "Lectures aren't actually that great, but the readings are generally solid (though often excessive). The writing-intensive version of the course was very manageable, and it's nice not to have any exams. All of the TA's are very good. Take it if the subject matter interests you - you will feel pretty cool reading Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver memoirs.",
    "You need to take it if you want to be a socially conscious person",
    "AFAM 162 is a good, fairly comprehensive survey course of African-American history from the Civil War to the present day. The class is highly interesting and involves a fair bit of reading, but not too much work, even in the writing intensive version--just a page-long section response per week and two papers. By its very nature as an intro course, you don't get to spend much time on any given subject. Professor Holloway doesn't shrink away from the more brutal aspects of history, so the content is often upsetting in the first half of the course.",
    "Holloway is a phenomenal lecturer, the exams are very fair (put in a few hours of studying and go to lecture and you'll do very well), discussion in section is relevant to today, readings are interesting (even though they're sometimes a long): bottom line is DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS. One of my favorite classes this semester for sure. I also happen to not be a \"history person\" and I loved everything about the lecture\/readings.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Professor Holloway is an excellent lecturer, and the material is presented from an interesting and new perspective. The writing-intensive version of the course is much easier, for those who are willing to write papers.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a general overview of the history of African Americans in the US, but if you want a more specific, in-depth look, or are more interested in one time period than another, don't take it. If you already have a pretty good grounding in African American history, you won't really gain any new insights from this class.",
    "This is a good class to take for a writing credit. Obviously it all depends on the TA you get but it is worthwhile.",
    "I would definitely recommend that another student take this class. It was engaging and pushes you to see history and the present in a new fashion. The work is substantial but very doable and very very much worth it.",
    "good class take it as a writing credit, its not easy but it is rewarding when you are done",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. My only word of advice is to truly respect the course material, and complete as much of the readings as possible. You will gain so much from doing so.",
    "take the class",
    "A must-take course at Yale. Professor Holloway is outstanding and the subject matter is fascinating.",
    "Pretty much what the title says: African American History From Emancipation to Present. Take it, especially if you're an American--it's history you need to know in order to understand our country as it is today. Plus, even the periods you think you know about (civil rights movement, etc), you probably don't know as much as you think you do, and this class will remind you of that.",
    "Good class. Strong readings, and Holloway has a lot of gravitas. He speaks kind of slowly and dumbs some things down, so I sometimes felt we didn't cover as much in lecture as possible. But he provides a consistent philosophical framing of the important themes throughout the class so in the end you really have a sense of what has mattered throughout African American history. All in all, a great introduction to the subject, but definitely an introduction. I see no reason not to take it WR.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. I found that it was way overhyped and not nearly as good as I had been lead to believe. The reading load was on the heavy side for a lecture, and the lecture themselves were a bit boring and monotone. I realize I'm in the minority here and most people claim to have loved it, but I'd recommend shopping it and trusting your instinct about whether this class is or is not for you.",
    "Good class. Take if at all interested in AfAm history or issues.",
    "Yes. Take it if you want to learn about black history.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The material is interesting and not very demanding",
    "It's best taken as a writing credit. Take it for the information that you will learn, or the review of history that you will probably need.",
    "TAKE IT. it's really important to know our country's history, and the class is engaging and illuminating.",
    "This is a good history course. One of the better ones at Yale.",
    "It's a great overview of African American history that will point out the gaping holes that exist in a public school education when it comes to this topic. The information is really significant - learning about how race historically interacted with the American experience and what consequences this has to African Americans' lives today.I took it Credit\/D but shouldn't have. It's not too difficult if you do some of the reading (the is A LOT that you can do part of) - give precedence to the books over the reader if you're choosing which to do. And DEFINITELY get Madison as your TA! He is the absolute best.",
    "An intro course to American history, taught in a way that you've never experienced.",
    "A broad survey course. Nothing is really gone into in great detail, but a fair amount of material is covered. Professor Holloway is a great lecturer and there's almost no work, no matter if you are writing intensive or not. Readings are generally interesting. I think that if you already have a pretty good grasp of black history, this is not really the class for you. I went in with a fair background in the subject but needing a writing credit and I don't think I got much out of it in terms of new material or relevations.",
    "yes! Take this class!!!",
    "Yes if you are interested in the topic.",
    "Yes, but if you took a class on it in high school, you probably dont need it. the amount of content\/thought that we got to do was a little disappointing. but if you do the reading its better.",
    "An introduction to African-American history, with a focus on the history of the Black Power movement and an emphasis on the cultural production of the African-American community.",
    "On that unwritten list of courses that you must take before graduating.",
    "I would take the course if you're interested in learning a bit about African-American history. It wasn't the best course, but it was still worthwhile.",
    "Interesting material that every American should know, but far too much reading expected. Writing section is a good writing credit.",
    "Great class even if you're not a history major. If you take it writing credit there's pretty much just two papers. But, it's no way an easy A, you've got to work real hard if you want to get good grades on the papers. It's a very interesting class though and Professor Holloway's a great lecturer, I would recommend it.",
    "The lectures were good, but not thrilling. The reading is extensive, but if you are in the writing section you don't need to do it all -- we ended up discussing the reading for a total of 10-15 minutes a week at max, which is kind of silly considering the 2-300 pages we would have to read for each section. Take the writing section, there is almost no work outside the two papers.",
    "A good, basic history course about African American history in the United States. You will learn more than you did in high school for sure, but it is not particularly challenging, work-wise or idea-wise. Holloway is a good lecturer, I had a pleasant TA, and the midterm and final (at least this year, it was different the year before) were very easy and short. If you have a strong background in the subject then it might be too easy, but overall it was interesting and Holloway cares a lot about the subject his class.",
    "I would recommend the course on the whole.",
    "Good, easy class for a WR.",
    "This is a class that summarizes the black American experience sine the end of slavery. However, it's not only about the African-American minority, because it also touches on gender, class, racial issues, politics, and just about everything else wrapped up in the fabric of America. It's a great course, but it's definitely not easy. I'd recommend it if you come in focused, ready to attend lecture and work hard.",
    "The title of the course does give an accurate idea of what it is--a survey of African American history post-emancipation. If it interests you as a topic, you should enjoy it. There is a sizeable chunk of reading, though it alternates between primary sources, secondary sources and creative literature. I'm sure a good deal of enjoyment is contingent upon TA and whether or not the class is taken writing intensive.",
    "A LOT of work to keep pace in section, but you emerge with a deep appreciation for the subject",
    "It is a fun and interesting class that highlights the historical significance of some things that may be considered trivial in society today.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student. Even if you think you have an adequate grasp of black history, take the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because it is informative yet very interesting.",
    "AFAM 162 was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale and I would recommend it to everyone interested. Professor Holloway was an incredible lecturer, synthesizing many different topics into coherent and interesting arguments.",
    "It is by far one of the most fulfilling classes at Yale. Because of the workload, I recommend taking it credit\/d if you are not a AM studies\/AFAM major. Take it non-writing intensive as from what I hear, you don't much learn how to write. But everyone should HAVE to take a class like this before graduating. It is an EYE opener!",
    "It's basically what the title of the class says. You'll cover a lot of things you learned in high school but in a different and often enlightening way.",
    "If you know little about African-American history, this will be a great class for you. Many people LOVED Holloway and his lecture style. If you know a good amount of African-American history, this class is probably not that worth your while. I had taken a few US History and Lit courses in high school that focused a lot on black history and there were many times in lecture I felt exceptionally bored. While Holloway is very pretty to look at, it is a shame that he does not utilize other multi-media to look at in the class. I took the writing credit and overall its not too bad with handed in work though there is a fair amount of reading.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Good class. Important history to know. His lectures were not the life changing experience I expected, but they were also fine.I really recommend taking the class WR if you like writing AT ALL. Personally, I find the writing prompts for the non-WR sections kind of irritating, and the WR assignments were totally open and great (oh yes, non-WR students still have to write--not as much, obviously).The reading is really fantastic and interesting if you like cultural studies and primary documents. There is a lot of it, which I basically took as an opportunity to have a good reading list if I ever want to read the important writings of black liberation thought over the last hundred years--for me this semester it was too much to read all the document sets he assigns. But that is not a problem if you aren't taking the midterm and final! It may be a problem if you are--I'm not sure.",
    "Take this credit D and you will love it.",
    "Yes. One of the few must take classes at Yale."
