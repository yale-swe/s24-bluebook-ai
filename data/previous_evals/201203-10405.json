   "comments": [
    "This course is a great overview of early national America from all perspectives. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely would recommend without hesitation. I wouldwarn them though that the work load was a bit higher than expected - but not inappropriately so. Purpose of the historiographical essay was a bit confusing as well - I would recommend that they meet with Professor Freeman and begin work on it much earlier than the point when the Professor brings it up.",
    "This class is perfect for both those with an interest in the time period and those for whom the time period is not their specialty. The readings are all perfectly chosen, and there are clear connections to be drawn between all of them.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any graduate student in History, regardless of field.",
    "Very manageable workload. I would absolutely recommend History 702."

   "comments": [
    "This course not only exposed me to different aspects of early America that I had been unaware of, it also showed me how to write a good book review and the aspects of conducting a good class discussion.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount; the course without question deepened my knowledge of history. However my knowledge on the topic was quite limited to begin with, so my comments on this matter might not be the most useful. There were students in the class who seemed quite well versed with the historiography - however, I suspect the discussions would still have been quite instructive.",
    "Great way to approach topics that I have minimal familiarity with; great way to broaden interests beyond modern history.",
    "Because I work in this field, it introduced me to a few works which I had not yet read. Even during weeks in which we did books I'd already read, it was very interesting to see how readers, who were unacquainted with the work and in outside or related fields, reacted and interpreted the works.",
    "The course helped me to become a more engaged and prepared seminar participant."
