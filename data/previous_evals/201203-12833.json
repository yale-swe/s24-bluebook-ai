    "I would definitely recommend it. Great class",
    "Take it with Juliana. The grading is a bit intense but she's very open and knowledgeable",
    "Juliana Ramos-Ruano is the best!!",
    "Not bad",
    "A great class! If you want to keep on taking spanish take this class! (Especially with Juliana!!)",
    "I would recommend this class because it improved my Spanish so much. The tests are difficult, but you will come out far better at Spanish.",
    "Yes if needed for Language requirement.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot in this class and it's fun. It does have a lot of busy work but it's pays off in the end.",
    "Juliana is awesome. She is charismatic and funny, and really knows how to keep class engaging. I loved having her as a teacher and I'm a little disappointed she won't be teaching SPAN 140 in the spring.The grading policy is a little harsh in SPAN 130 overall, but I think that was based a lot of the fact that Juliana stays very strict to the rubric. Other teachers allow people to fix their work and get more points back, so it is definitely a negative to watch out for.",
    "Too much of a repeat of L2. However, Juliana is great! As long as you are willing to participate, she will put in the same effort."
