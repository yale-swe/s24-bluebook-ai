    "If you like French film, this is the course for you!",
    "Great class, discussion-based but comfortable atmosphere.",
    "I would totally recommend this course! It is a great overview of French cinema. You get to watch some awesome films and Professor Kavanagh is full of knowledge.",
    "French 255 is an interesting and enjoyable survey course of French cinema from its beginnings in the very late 19th century to the present day. You learn about important figures and movements in French - and therefore global - cinema, starting with the Lumi\u00c3\u00a8re brothers and M\u00c3\u00a9li\u00c3\u00a8s, continuing with Bu\u00c3\u00b1uel, Vigo, and Renoir, moving to the New Wave and Godard, Truffaut, Melville, and finishing with the contemporary films L'intrus (Claire Denis) and La Vie r\u00c3\u00aav\u00c3\u00a9e des anges (Zonca). The course has a reasonable workload (5 page paper, 10 page final paper, midterm, and one presentation). Discussions were almost always interesting and enjoyable. There is a weekly Tuesday screening. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is considering taking an advanced-level French course; it is one of my favorite French classes I have taken here at Yale."
