    "Although Professor Spiegel may come off as a bit arrogant at times, he is a very well-read and clear teacher. Second semester is definitely much more interesting than first semester. However, second semester requires you to THINK much more, so be prepared.",
    "take this class. amazing professor and interesting material.",
    "Take it if you have to- it's interesting and you feel like you learned a lot!",
    "It is tough but a good class.",
    "It's organic chemistry. Pretty straightforward. I'd recommend taking it if you have to, but if you have to, take it with Spiegel.",
    "Spiegel is pretty good at teaching the material. Still awful, but not as bad as first semester.",
    "Spiegel ends up teaching you a skill. If it hasn't occurred in orgo I, the material should gel. You get a feeling for molecules; when you're presented with one, you can immediately sense how all the electrons can get pushed. THEN AGAIN, it's still orgo. It was much better than previous orgo experiences, but still not a class I would ever take again if I didn't have to.Dr. Spiegel can be a jerk sometimes, but he can also be funny and is a great lecturer. He's an MD PhD so likes to make things relevant to medicine.",
    "Chemistry 221 is definitely a challenging course, but I got more out of it than I was expecting to. Professor Spiegel is a great lecturer. Although the tests are very difficult, you will walk away from the class having learned a lot and having gained a greater appreciation for organic chemistry. Also, the grading is very generous.",
    "It is what it is. Spiegal is a good lecturer.",
    "Despite what people might say, Orgo 2 is about the same level of difficulty as orgo 1. It can be a review of some topics depending on the teacher you had for orgo 1, but it is actually pretty interesting and fun. The exams are fair, although the grading policy is a bit confusing.",
    "better than first semester. only take it if you have to, duh",
    "Not as bad as first semester, but obviously only take it if you have to. Spiegel is a nice guy and a fair teacher.",
    "course material is interesting if you like puzzles.. but still don't this course unless you have to",
    "It is a required pre-medical course - however I found it less work than the first semester part of the course.",
    "If you're not premed, you have no reason to take this class. If you are, then you have no choice but to take this class. As orgo classes go, this one was not the worst I've had - the material is interesting and Prof. Spiegel did a pretty good job of making it accessible.",
    "You have to take this for med school, so just do it. Try not to load down your schedule with other really hard classes.",
    "Chemistry 221 naturally follows from the first semester of organic chemistry. I would recommend taking it back-to-back with the first semester; even a summer would seem like it was interrupting. You use the basic reactions that you learn first semester as steps of syntheses, so you should remember them.If you have begun to have an intuitive mechanistic understanding of organic chemistry, this semester is not particularly difficult, but it is work, after all.WAY less reading.",
    "Take it if you are pre-med, otherwise not your easiest science credit.",
    "take it with Spiegel!",
    "Take it if you have to--it's a fun course! REALLY hard to get an A, though.",
    "It was good. Speigel makes orgo rational, even if it's still hard for the vocal minority (majority?). Not a bad experience.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this class to another student very interested in science. It is a lot of time but you will enjoy it.",
    "I have no idea why you would take this class if you were not premed or a chem major, so I'm not sure if \"recommend\" is the right word. I guess if you are not either of those things, then DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS, but if you are its really not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Although it is a TON of work, easily the most work out of any class I have taken at Yale.",
    "It's a lot better than first semester orgo. If you're struggling with orgo, you should still give second semester a chance.It's more fun and engaging, although slightly tougher.",
    "A course that is light years better than its first semester counter part, both in philosophy behind the course and because of the professor. If you can take a class with Spiegel definitely do it. Try to to avoid Ziegler at all costs, but try and get Spiegel by any means.",
    "take it if you need it, or maybe even credit\/d just to understand that there are actually decent lectures to intro science courses, and speigel does a great job in this respect",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. But that's a given.",
    "Good class. Interesting material, manageable workload, and I learned a lot. You probably already have to take it anyway....",
    "Yes. Contrary to popular belief that orgo is meticulous and near impossible, this course teaches you the underlying principles of organic chemistry that enables you to attack nearly any problem. Spiegel was a great lecturer and could hold the classes attention at 9:20 in the morning. I would recommend this class not just to pre-meds but to anyone generally interested in science.",
    "I would recommend it, whether you're pre-med or not!",
    "Welcome to second semester orgo. If you're reading this, you evidently passed first semester and as a premed and\/or chem\/mbb major you will take this course regardless of this review. Yes you need to remember all the rxns from 1st semester. Yeah, so w\/e good luck. I'm glad it's over.",
    "Excruciating. Rewarding when done.",
    "YES!!! especially with Speigel, because he focuses on understanding and it is easier to shine if you work really hard...",
    "Only if you have to",
    "It's a typical second semester organic chemistry course. Obviously if you're taking it you have to. That said, Professor Spiegel was a very good lecturer, but be sure to come to class every day because he pulls pop quizzes whenever he feels like it, often when you least expect it. Problem sets can take a while but are graded on completion so you can focus on learning and not getting everything perfect.",
    "Chem221 is Orgo2. It's like Orgo1 in that it's equally complicated, but in a different way. Approach it like a puzzle, like a really really hard sudoku puzzle, and you'll do fine. Don't complain about it and you'll do fine. Studying for days on end won't help you--you have to actually comprehend things and have good reasoning\/logicking skills. Spiegel is good, and fair (except for the pop quizzes). Having a good TA will make all the difference, too. Youleave it feeling like you've accomplished something really big, because you have, because it's orgo. Good luck!",
    "take it if you have to. i thought it was better than first semester.",
    "Professor Spiegel is awful; avoid him if you can and take the classanother semester. He doesn't have time for the students and really appears to dislike having to teach this class. The TAs write the problem sets, quizzes, and tests, and there are pop quizzes to \"make\" you come on time (which isn't effective at all) and really just serve to lower your grade. He lectures relatively well, but his tests are terrible and incredibly difficult. Avoid him as a professor!",
    "If you're pre-med you'll have to take it anyway. Difficult class but possible if you can devote your time to it.",
    "You probably have to take it anyway, so just know that Spiegel gives pop quizzes and is obsessed with mechanisms. Studying for midterms will take a lot of time, but the psets are graded for completion\/not really done at all.",
    "really great course.",
    "Don't be intimidated by orgo; just spend alot of time going through the concepts and doing PRACTICE PROBS so you can apply them to novel situations. Chris Parker is a good TA to have.",
    "Yes. Obviously, the course is required for many science majors and\/or premed. So you have to take it. The materials are not particularly difficult, but you certainly need to spend some time on that. Grading is not harsh, but competition is fierce. Spiegel is a great professor.",
    "If you're taking orgo, it's probably because you don't have a choice. That said, I really enjoyed the class. Spiegel is a great professor, and he tends to emphasize actual understanding of chemical reactivity over straight memorization. Of course, you're still going to have to memorize a ton of stuff, but I found the emphasis on understanding easier and more interesting. One last thing: Spiegel gives pop quizzes randomly throughout the semester, but he only gave us five (even though the syllabus said there would be seven). You get to drop the lowest one, which is great because they can be really hard -- you really have to study and go over the lectures if you want to do well on quizzes. They're not a huge part of the grade, though (10%).",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. And if you can, take it with Spiegel! He makes the material very interesting and relevant.",
    "HELL. Suffering, but once it's done it's done.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it.",
    "This is a great class a much better than the 2nd semester orgo class taught in the fall. Spiegel is great. The tests are hard but then again they are hard for everyone. Very difficult to get an A but nearly impossible to get a C.",
    "This is a great class! Much more fun than first semester organic chemistry. Spiegel is a great lecturer.",
    "I mean, yes, take it. Or don't. Whatever.",
    "Organic chemistry is a very interesting science, that said, it can also be mind-numbingly difficult. The difference between a good student and a mediocre student is really just patience and being able to \"see\" the answer, which only comes with extensive practice. If you plan on feeling comfortable approaching your professor for questions\/comments\/whatever, don't take orgo with Spiegel. He isn't interested in you. If all you care about is having organized lectures, Spiegel is your guy. (Although he doesn't follow the book and never knows which chapters he is covering because, as I said before, he doesn't care.)",
    "The pop quizzes make the course unnecessarily stressful, but it is manageable. Lots of studying is required, but it is doable.",
    "If you weren't pre-med, I'm not sure why you would want to take this course. While this class is interesting, it requires a lot of time and effort.",
    "Only if you need to take it for premed or for your major.",
    "Organic chemistry with Professor Spiegel was excellent. He did a really great job with the course. The workload wasn't bad at all for a chemistry class, and Spiegel was fantastic at explaining tough concepts. I never felt lost or in over my head in this class. You're not going to get a better professor in the chem department. If you read a bunch of evals from kids whining that this class was hard, then they weren't very good students and you're going to eat their lunch on med school apps. Get excited.",
    "Probably a good idea to take for any biological science major",
    "I would recommend this course only if you have to fill out the premed requirement.",
    "Good class, but it is a lot of work. Practice lots of mechanism and synthesis problems to do well. Spiegel was pretty good with summarizing general patterns of reactions and showing their importance of organic chemistry in biochemical reactions.",
    "Second semester is much better than the first. If you got through first semester, stick with it. It is more interesting and seems more meaningful. However, if you don't need it for a major or for pre-med, I probably wouldn't recommend it for a fun course. It's a lot of work.",
    "I found second semester of organic chemistry to be more challenging but altogether more interesting. It really isn't a terrible course as everyone else makes it seem. The curve is generous. The workload is considerable (as expected). But if you enjoy thinking critically and working hard, you won't find this class too difficult. Don't stress out because of all the hype. You'll be surprised by how enjoyable the class and material may be.",
    "This is one of the best chemistry classes I've taken at Yale (and I'm not a chem major). Take it with Spiegel. He is knowledgeable and teaches it in an organized manner that's easy to understand. The material is obviously challenging, but rewarding once you master it. Lots of work.",
    "Chem 221 is a very challenging course. Although I spent a lot of time studying and felt that I understood the material, somehow the tests always tripped me up a bit. The tests were kind of unpredictable; the next test could be quite a different style from the previous one. You can drop 1 of 3 exam scores and 1 of5 pop quiz scores. Don't be deceived by the relatively short problem sets - you will have to study a ton for each exam. It's important to keep up with the textbook reading and study your notes throughout the semester, especially because of the pop quizzes.",
    "Yes i would recommend it",
    "If you are premed, take it.",
    "This course is a must-take. And by that, I mean if you're in it it's probably because you have to be.",
    "I mean my recommendation isn't going to make a real difference since ppl who take this class generally have to bc of their major or premed requirements. overall though the class was stressful but easier to manage than first semester with ziegler.",
    "If you're looking at this review, you're probably required to take this course for a major or pre-med requirements, so there's no point recommending that you don't take it.If CHEM 221 continues to be structured in the same way it was when I took it, it will start off quite slowly with a detailed look at NMR spectroscopy. However, once that topic is complete, the course picks up and becomes very fast-paced. The bulk of the course is devoted to the study of carbonyl chemistry, which can be both very interesting and very frustrating. Problem sets are helpful, but you will need to do a significant amount of other studying in order to keep up with the course.One thing that Professor Spiegel tends to emphasize is a sort of \"chemical intuition.\" I'm not sure if anybody has figured out what he really means by this. Despite this emphasis, though, CHEM 221 is still a large amount of memorization.",
    "If you've taken Ziegler, Spiegel will be a breath of fresh air. At least I far preferred his approach. He depended on lectures rather than the book. In Ziegler, I read every word of the book and had to; in Spiegel, I barely touched the text book because his lectures were actually comprehensible. He also focused on mechanisms, and made sure we understood them, rather than focusing on reagents and throwing a few obscure, complex mechanisms in there to memorize without any rationale at all. Spiegel's tests were very difficult--the average was usually in the 60s--but the final was easier than last year's seems to have been. The pop quizzes were miserable (there were about 5 but they were very hard to predict; we had 2 back-to-back once), but they did get me to class, and class was worthwhile--actually essential. If you're taking it, you probably have to, but you can take heart that your professor will actually teach you the material.",
    "yes",
    "Of course, this is an extremely intense and difficult class. But, if you put in the time, it will be very rewarding and interesting.",
    "This was an okay class - I liked it better than first semester orgo. You probably won't cover the stuff at the end of the syllabus, which sounds more interesting than the stuff in the beginning, but he tries to throw in some interesting topics along the way.",
    "Chem 221 is a required pre-med, and may seem a tad-bit difficult at times, but it do-able and manageable, especially with Prof. Spiegel. His teaching style is great and less stressful than any other chem prof. I have had thus far at Yale. Keep in mind that you will need to put time into this course, but the great thing about Organic Chemistry and synthetic processes, is that once you can grasp the overall basis, and understand the broader idea of each reaction, this course becomes easier. I would like to suggest that you put in the time at the beginning of the course, focusing primarily on understanding rather than learning the material. From here, you will have orgo-chem at its fingertips.",
    "If you're thinking about it, that means you have to take it. It's harder than orgo 1 for sure so be ready to work and actually learn the material, not memorize reactions.",
    "Chem 221 was a fun class where you can learn about many applications of organic chemistry as well as how to manipulate small molecules that have to do with life processes. I would recommend this class. Just realize that it is not a subject that you can cramfor. Review material a couple of days after it is presented in class and make sure that you understand it and you should be fine.",
    "You probably have to take this course if you're considering taking it. A good foundation in understanding how electrons move (ie. mechanisms) is vital, as the course is heavily centered on mechanisms. Make sure you go to class as there are pop quizzes that count for 10% of the grade.",
    "It was a difficult class but I believe I learned a lot. The way Spiegel teaches forces you to review the material constantly and make sure you have a firm grasp of it so you can apply it in new and different ways. If you have to take second semester organic chemistry I would recommend taking it with Spiegel.",
    "Ya it's better with Spiegel. Really liked the class but don't even try to meet with him 1 on 1.",
    "Yes. It is a great course.",
    "Good course, tough material, tough tests but Spiegel was a refreshing professor.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "You'll learn a lot, if only cause you can't get by with just a little bit of learning. Good luck.",
    "Chem 221 is a second semester orgo class. The lecturer for this class was better than first semester in my opinion, and I really enjoyed the heavier emphasis on application of organic chemistry in this course.",
    "Yes- Speigals a good teacher and get Andrew Zhang as your TA. You will do well!",
    "It's organic chemistry and really not as bad as everyone says it is. The class is curved to a B+ you get to drop one of the exams but plan on doing your best for all of them. Beware of pop quizzes but in reality they aren't worth that much of your grade.",
    "This was a great course, even if you have to take the class for premed recs. You have 3 midterms (you can drop one), 5 pop quizzes and psets (which are not graded). Study hard and you should do well especially if you had Prof Ziegler 1st semester.",
    "Had to do it. You'll be fine. Just study and form study groups if you're that type of student.",
    "Not if you are not pre-med, or chem major",
    "Great! I thought it was very well-taught! I actually really learned a lot of the background behind organic chemistry and chemistry, in general. Spiegel was a great professor! : )",
    "you're only gonna take this if you have to."
