    "yes...great way to get the BS",
    "Mostly required but a standard bio thesis!",
    "You don't have a choice... 10 hours a week is terrible design. It's super inconvenient and difficult to schedule, and at the same time, it's not enough to get much done or learn. There should definitely be a way to require research one summer instead.",
    "MCDB 486 is another semester of research with slightly more work at the end-- you need to turn in a poster and longer paper in addition to attending the usual oral presentations. It would be really awesome if food were served at the presentations... the poster session is very low key, and it should not be hard to meet the page requirements for the final paper.",
    "research, presentation, paper. pretty straightforward.",
    "Yes, especially if you are already working in a lab.",
    "Gotta do it for the senior B.S. requirement for MCDB!",
    "Yes!",
    "sure",
    "I think it's worth it to do a second semester of research to get your Bachelor of Science rather than Bachelor of Arts.",
    "Standard research for credit that you have to do regardless. 10-12 hours per week in lab, a powerpoint presentation in either the fall or the spring, and a spring poster session.",
    "Good major requirement. You'll learn a lot!",
    "Research--it was as expected and will depend on your lab.",
    "Research. Try to present fall semester otherwise you'll have to do that, make a poster, and go to the three presentation sessions all in the last three weeks of class. Not fun.",
    "I would suggest taking this course to anyone interested in biology. You really learn how the laboratory environment works and I guarantee your trouble shooting ability will improve. Also you get to practice giving presentations in public. make sure you do research you are interested in and get a nice mentor and PI (ask if they had students in the past and ask them about their experience). The time commitment might be more than what it officially requested of you. It's a great experience",
    "Definitely.",
    "Research for credit will be time-consuming whenever your experiments are at full throttle, and as long as you're taking them seriously. The poster, presentation, attending other peoples' presentations and the poster session, and writing the paper definitely means that the work for this course is skewed to the end of the semester so plan ahead and do as much work as possible on these things early on.",
    "Definitely need it\/do it for BS requirement."
