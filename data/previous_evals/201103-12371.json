   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a good SC credit",
    "Yes. Great Sc credit. But also a great introduction to energy.",
    "This class is not very in-depth, but it will whet your appetite to learn more about natural resources and the political and economic decisions that we will have to make in the future to keep powering our lives! It's great fun to listen to Prof. Ague go on about the science that we have toconsider when looking at different energy sources. I wish I had the depth of knowledge on every subject that I got on my final paper topic, but they might do a better job in future years of covering more ground. This class is one of those science hill classes that a bike is great for since it's so far.",
    "I would absolutely recommend G&G 205 to another student. This was a great class. Jay Ague is an engaging professor who presents the material in an interesting and applicable way.",
    "A pretty easy class, good for a science credit.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. The best science credit at Yale--not excruciatingly difficult, but challenging and enlightening conceptually, and a great professor and TA staff.",
    "I would recommend this class. The lectures were interesting, and the size of the class also allows for discussion. The problem sets are intriguing and often eye opening. The work load isn't too bad at all, and the topics are always interesting. The end project was also a highlight. You are able to pick essentially any topic to research and do a presentation and paper on. Only negative aspect is that it leaves you a little hopeless in the end.",
    "It's a great Sc credit. Not hard at all, the midterm was simply short answers and he gives you 14 questions to prepare before hand (7 will be on the midterm). Even for those who already have a good science background, this is a great class because it helps you compare and puts things in perspective.",
    "This is a great class.",
    "great course that goes over all energy topics, rare and precious metals, and the earth system. a phenomenal geo course.",
    "TAKE IT!! I never really understood the extent of our energy problems. I now feel like I can have intelligent conversations with people on our future in energy resources. It is a great way to get a science credit as well because it is sooo interesting!",
    "Yes, it is a great science credit for anyone.",
    "This was a really great class. Definetely take it. Only 2 of the problems sets were really hard and long. The professor is pretty good, monotone though. You will learn a lot in the class though.",
    "Learn a lot.Manageable.",
    "Natural Resources and Sustainability is an easy science credit that will also give you an overview of all the important resource issues. However it doesn't go into depth and doesn't really teach you anything you couldn't have taught yourself. Professor Ague is helpful and easy to talk to, and the final paper is open ended so you can make that interesting and rewarding if you decide to put work into it.They are looking into incorporating more discussion into the class and if that happens this class immediately becomes more intriguing. Would work well as a fifth class.",
    "A fascinating if (necessarily) somewhat cursory look at natural resources, especially as they relate to power and energy. Not very intense in terms of workload, so if you want a relatively easy way to learn about some very important topics, take it.",
    "This was a survey of issues related to natural resources, including how we obtain and allocate them. I would highly recommend it as a great way to fulfill the Sc requirement, or just because. Jay is an awesome professor, you learn a lot with very little busywork, the workload in general is quite reasonable, you go on a few cute little field trips, and the information you learn is quite useful, especially if you like to think in terms of the political ramifications of these issues (which are obviously huge).",
    "G&G 205 is the perfect Sc for non-science people. It can seem a little bland at times (almost all the 1 hr 15 min lectures tend to, though), but the majority of it is very interesting stuff that is easy to understand. The outside of class reading is a helpful supplement to Jay's lectures, but don't have to be read in too much detail at all. The presentations that take up the last few weeks of class are also very fun and interesting, and the paper\/presentation combo is certainly much preferred to a final exam.",
    "Great SC, and very topical.",
    "fantastic course. really interesting material and prof ague is great. the p sets can be quite time consuming although everything can be researched online. possible questions are all handed out a week before the mid-term. writing the final paper and presentation are really enjoyable. great class.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class, especially for non-science majors looking to fulfill their science credit. It is interesting and the calculations are manageable",
    "This is an class that focuses on the distribution and uses of natural resources from fossil fuels to heavy metals to alternative energy sources. It is wide ranging and engaging, and everyone should graduate having some knowledge about these things because they really are what powers our lives. However, if you already have a solid geology background, a higher level course might be a better option because this course doesn't assume previous geological knowledge. It is, however, a geology class and not a poli sci course although the politics of resources does help contextualize the conversation. Fantastic option for an Science credit if you need one, especially if Prof. Ague is teaching. He is great and everyone should try and take a class with him before graduating."
