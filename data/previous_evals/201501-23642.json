    "This class is a basic introduction to the major parts of Ancient Indian history. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in the subject. The class looks at historical, literary and archeological material. You are allowed to pick a topic for your final essay. It can be on literary texts, architecture, art, etc. It's definitely what you make of it, and you can be sure that you'll be allowed an encouraged to pursue whatever you're interested in within the subject!",
    "This was one of the most fascinating, fun, laid-back courses I've taken at Yale. Ancient India is an intricately complex and endlessly intriguing place to study, and Professor Brick is just an all-around awesome dude. Professor Brick is not a historian by training (he's a sanskritist), which was really refreshing. At various moments, the course felt like it could be religious studies, literature, art history, etc. Lectures were especially engaging. Brick is extremely enthusiastic about the material he teaches, and his excitement is contagious. Just midterm, 8-10 page paper and discussion section, so the workload was quite light (though if you have time, do all the readings... they're worth it). All around awesome class.",
    "A survey course of Ancient Indian history, at times a bit dry, but overall very interesting and not often discussed. Professor Brick is lovely as an instructor and always provides a comfortable learning environment.",
    "Definitely take it if you're looking for a pre-industrial credit",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It provides a great introduction into early Indian history. Both the TAs and Professor Brick did an excellent job of teaching and reinforcing the material. Overall, the course is not too time consuming, but there is so much interesting information to get out of the class.",
    "I really liked the course. It is a survey course so it does not cover topics in great detail. I really liked Professor Brick and enjoyed his teaching style."
