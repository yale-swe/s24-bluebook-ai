   "comments": [
    "A wonderful, practical course for anyone interested in early childhood development.This class is very focused on building skills like speaking to and writing for policy makers, developing policy related to early childhood development, and using technology to translate research into a language that policy makers (and the general population) have an easier time understanding and using.",
    "Emphatically yes!",
    "I would recommend the course for students wishing to explore international relations from the viewpoint of early childhood development. I felt that the professor worked to encourage students--no matter their background knowledge of the subject--to engage and be comfortable with the material. I would summarize the course as a chance to learn about and engage with fellow students about issues in development, and how those issues intertwine. Issues of funding, academia, donor groups, governance, implementation, and how to learn from best practices all overlap with one another at various points, and this course tries to help students parse the issues out, and find practices to deal with the various issues.",
    "Great class- highly recommended.",
    "Class was great - readings were extraordinarily relevant, and class discussions were very insightful and educational.",
    "I would recommend this course to students regardless of interest in early childhood development or not. It is rare to find an academic who is also practicing, and interested in students' learning experiences.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to other students interested in development policy, especially those interested in ECD issues.",
    "Intro to ECD policy.I'd recommend it if a student wanted to learn about ECD policy.",
    "I would recommend this course for students interested in development policy--specifically the process of national policy formulation and the role of research in policy-making. This course is especially useful for students with some interest in early childhood development, since we look at the process of policy-making through the lens of ECD.",
    "If you are interested in policy, especially international policy, this is a good class for learning how policy plays out in practice."

   "comments": [
    "This is one of the most practical courses I've taken in terms of health policy. Also, the subjects covered in this course relate directly to my research in the long term health and developmental consequences of exposure to early adversity.",
    "I come away with a more enhanced understanding of early childhood development's role in international development especially from a health, human capital and poverty reduction perspective.",
    "I had a rather low level of academic study of international development compared to the rest of the class, so I started from a lower bar. I felt I gained comfortability with the language of development academically, and now have that to complement the practical knowledge I have. It did not explicitly contribute to my academic research this semester, although it has helped me to reconsider other options after I graduate, including another degree.",
    "Very helpful in rounding out my knowledge base",
    "I have a much firmer grasp on the translation of science and scientific literature to policy, where it is weak and how to improve the translation.",
    "This course taught me to think in new ways about the way science can inform policy making, and vice versa. It had the students recognize where needs and gaps were in the policy making process, and was very helpful in creating a better understanding of both of these fields.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of development issues related to children\/ECD"
