    "MCDB 135 is a great class if you can get in. DO NOT take this class if you are looking for a gut though. The exams are difficult and require a lot of studying and you can't afford to miss even one lecture. Professor Wells is a fantastic teacher and lecturer. Professor Kundel is really nice, but isn't the best lecturer. If you can get in def take though.",
    "Yes, but its not as gutty as you think!",
    "It's a solid science class for non-science majors who still like biology. It will require some work, but it is worth it. I recommend it",
    "Definitely a doable science credit for a non-science major, and very interesting as well. It's a little confusing having two different professors, but Kundel and Wells are both good and approachable. Three non-cumulative tests, a short-ish final paper, and readings. Not too bad. Good luck getting in! Try as a sophomore if you didn't get it as a freshman - much better chance.",
    "This is a great class! You cover a lot of really interesting material. Sometimes lectures in class are a little hard to follow but it usually all comes together right before the test. Overall, a great introduction to the brain and I really felt like I learned a lot. Great science credit!",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. It is extremely interesting and teaches a ton of information about the human brain and how it works.",
    "This class has lots of stellar reviews. It's a lot of assignments (3 midterms and a paper)-- the paper at the end is particularly fun. The tests aren't hard but you need to know the material covered in class in order to succeed. The material is carefully taught and pretty interesting. I would recommend.",
    "Summary: This course is a relatively straightforward introduction to neuroscience. Despite it being a \"seminar,\" the class is decidedly a lecture--just with advantage that the professors know your name and are happy to answer your questions. The material goes maybe 20% beyond AP-Biology material and is generally very interesting. The readings are not too demanding; however, they're really only useful after lectures since otherwise you don't know what to pay attention to--the readings cover a lot of material, and you're not responsible for most of it. Study the lecture slides closely for exams; absolutely everything on them is fair game. The exams are all in short answer form. If you study hard and vomit everything you know onto the pages, you should do well--they're generous with partial credit. The lectures are not very engaging, so you have to work to focus. Don't count on learning your classmates' names and don't count on having any class discussions. Finally, the last essay is a fun chance to explore an area of neuroscience that you find personally interesting.Recommendation: If you are lucky enough to get into this class, I definitely recommend that you take it. If you genuinely like biology and just don't plan to major in science, then this class is a great, not too difficult course that allows you to explore a fascinating area of science more in depth. If you hate science, it's still worth taking, because it's a small class, with easy access to the professors, and who doesn't think the brain is cool?",
    "How the Brain Works is a solid neuroscience course for non-science majors. Take the course if you're interested in the biology--neurons, neurotransmitters, the basal ganglia, etc.--not if you want a psychology course. However, the course covers the biological underpinnings of many physical and mental disorders, from Parkinson's Disease to chronic depression. Learning how small mutations create gross physical changes is very interesting. There are three in-class tests, a five-page paper, and a participation grade (all weighted equally). When studying, refer to class notes more than the textbook, and you'll be set.",
    "Certainly would recommend it--reasonable course, and very relevant and interesting.",
    "Yes! This is a great course. Not always the most entertaining, but you learn a lot of material.",
    "A nice look at the biology part of the brain--not the psychology. Taken slow, explained so that you don't get lost. Take this class if you're not a science guy, need the credit, want to learn some stuff about the neurons firing and all that jazz.",
    "This class is not a gut, unfortunately. The textbook si really hard to read and I saw that most of people in the class did not enjoy it. It is really hard to get in, but I did not enjoy it at all. I would recommend another science class. This is pretty much all about neuroscience, there is nothing about psychology or any other field. Exams are fair and the paper is fun to write. Just do everything in advance and you should be fine!",
    "It's an introductory class that looks at the foundations of neuroscience (like synapses, and the formation of our central nervous system), and builds upon itself to examine different brain functions and how emotions, addiction, and movement all stem from neural activity. Great introductory course to these concepts, but if you've already taken high level biology, you may be disappointed.",
    "Definitely take this class (or try to get into it). 3 exams and a paper on a topic of your choice. No final which was really good for finals schedule. I absolutely loved this class. The teachers were fanatic, we all learned so much, the tests were fair, and the material was interesting. It was well suited for nonscience majors but we still learned a lot. Best Science credit at Yale!",
    "Make sure that when you take this course, you know what you are getting yourself into. Although the content can be accessible, there are many students with some background in neuroscience, so it can be a bit daunting. Ask for help if necessary, and study for the exams. The reading\/homework is not very time consuming, and the final project is a rather enjoyable opportunity to explore a topic of neuroscience more in depth."
