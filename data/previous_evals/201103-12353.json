    "Good continuation of Hindi L1\/L2",
    "You get out of it what you put in. Still fun and chill. The workload does increase, as well as Seemaji's and Swapnaji's expectations. If you liked L1 and L2, take L3.",
    "If you're going to take L3, make review what you learned in L1 and L2 during the summer! If you have the chance to speak Hindi or watch movies, that will also be helpful. The material is definitely harder, but the topics are really interesting. There were units on topics such as the dowry and caste system, among other things."
