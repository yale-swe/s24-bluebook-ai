    "If the readings intrigue you, and you're in this for a major or distributional credit, go for it. If you don't have any reason to read this stuff in class, however, I'd suggest making it an independent study and taking some notes on what you like. The class discussion adds little to the works themselves, and the papers you write aren't all that helpful.",
    "The papers take FOREVER to write!!",
    "Luck and Justice delves deeply into the question of moral luck. The class is fascinating and enlightening. There are three summary papers that are a pain to write, but extremely helpful when writing the final paper. If you are interested in moral, do take! Professor Lebron really knows his stuff!",
    "Take this class. It is awesome.",
    "It was a class where we did a couple of readings a week on a topic pertaining to the course and then spent the seminar listening to the professor talk about what we had read. It was boring and i don't believe I learned much. I would not recommend it to another student."
