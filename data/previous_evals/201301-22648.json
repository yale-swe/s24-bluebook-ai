    "L2 Spanish is an intense course to follow the baseline Spanish knowledge of L1 that challenges you with readings, film, class activities, etc. It is a great course that I thoroughly enjoyed and I would recommend it to a fellow student. Great preparation for an L3\/L4 intensive summer or any kind of study abroad--or just life.",

    "I would recommend this class. It is decently easy, you just need to ACTUALLY do your homework becasue it is graded and practice speaking and listening with friends. Also, be on time to class!"
