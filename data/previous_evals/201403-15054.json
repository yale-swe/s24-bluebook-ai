   "comments": [
    "I liked the course; there's quite a bit of reading, but Prof. Calabresi is good at leading discussion and is really interested in hearing what everyone has to say. Discussion is usually heavily US-centric, which can sometimes be frustrating, but the textbook chapters are especially interesting.",
    "This was a fun and interesting class that is very generously graded. The readings are a little bit long, but that's not a huge problem. 2 midterm 2500 word papers plus a 4000 word final paper. Calabresi is exceedingly enthusiastic. One quirk to be aware of is that he seems to cold call people in direct proportion to the amount that they talk meaning that the more you talk the more you get cold called.",
    "Excellent course to take following constitutional law. Great professor and extremely interesting material for those interested in the law. I would definitely recommend this as a seminar. Not too much work as well.",
    "Take this course if it is filled with engaged pre-law students as it was for me. If not, steer clear.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a good mixture of political theory and legal training. The strength lies in the reading material and the knowledge of the instructor. Professor Calabresi commands really deep knowledge in all areas he teaches, and makes a really comprehensive and thought-provoking summary at the start of the class.",
    "It's Professor Calabresi, former Dean of Yale Law and former clerk for Justice Scalia, generously taking time out of his extraordinarily busy schedule to teach a group of lucky undergraduates. It's a quintessential Yale opportunity, so don't pass it up if you have the chance to take it, especially if you liked Amar's Con Law class. Half the class is almost a rehash of con law anyways since you compare US Con Law to various other countries. Only two midterm papers and a final paper too. There's so much material to can't possibly cover it all but you can still read it for yourself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! If you are looking for a better understanding of the American Constitution, than there is no better way than through comparing it with those of other countries. Professor Calabresi made even the boring material exciting, and was always ready to answer our questions. We were given the freedom in our papers to explore the topics that most interested us, which was great.",
    "Take this course ONLY if you feel that the group of students will be conducive to meaningful discussion. If not for the students, do not take this course. You owe it to yourself to be reading literature that has been spell-checked and to receive feedback on the work that you turn in. Professor Calabresi is brilliant, but so is almost every other Professor at Yale. Proceed with immense caution.",
    "This course is for someone who is very into law and its technicalities. Do not take this if you are not willing to open your mind to different ways of thinking or are not passionate about law.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The readings are fascinating and eye opening, and there's no other course like it at Yale. While Calabresi doesn't ask the most rigorous questions, he lets students take the conversation in the direction that interests them, and once a good discussion gets going, he always has interesting things to add. The course is also structured in a smart way. Every week is a different theme (positive rights, equal protection, free speech, etc.). With each theme, you look at seminal cases in various G20 nations to get an understanding of how each nation's constitutional approach differs. You have three essays throughout the semester, and you're given a ton of flexibility with two of those. Basically, you write about what's interesting to you. Calabresi is also a sweetheart who really wants to get to know his students and help them develop academically.",
    "Sometimes the best classes at Yale are hidden gems. For some technical reason,this class was never on OCI till the first day of shopping. Thankfully, I saw it, for if I didn't, I would never have had the chance to take this fascinating seminar. For those people interested, I think its important to clarify two things - a) This class is focussed around the U.S, with other countries providing the secondary focus. However, its by no means a seminar version of Prof. Akhil Amar's Con Law - the focus is very much on understanding constitutionalism, but through a US tinted comparative lens. b) Know that there will be weeks in the class that you might not find interesting - because its a survey of constitutional topics, there will inevitably be some topic that interests you less. Still take it though because the weeks you love will make it absolutely worth taking the class ! Prof. Calabresi is an absolutely wonderful Professor - very, very nice and super helpful on coming with paper topics and exploring areas of constitutional law you're interested in. For reference though, this class is much less textual than say Prof. Amar's - the idea is to see what the best ideas on how to structures constitutions are, not to conduct minutia level analysis on specific words in Constitutions. Still highly recommend to anyone who is interested in the material. One heads-up : Prof. Calabresi is a visiting Prof - so he was only in New Haven once a week to meet with in person (the day of seminar). I never found that to be a problem because we communicated well over email, but if its a concern for you ,may be worth thinking about."
