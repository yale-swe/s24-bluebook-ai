    "A departamental requirement that can feel like one.",

    "The syllabus seemed promising, but I did not think I gained much lasting knowledge apart from my notes.",
    "This course encouraged me to think more carefully about the language which provides the foundation for the literary works we study. It has helped me to consider the way in which linguistic developments impact literary expression and to further examine the relationship among language, politics, and literature.",
    "This course is critical to my development as a hispanist. Knowledge of how the Spanish language developed will undoubtedly serve me in my dissertation and future research.",
    "It prepares you well for the doctoral exams."
