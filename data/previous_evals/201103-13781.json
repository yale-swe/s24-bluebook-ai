    "Our studio, the cost of the flight to China notwithstanding, was not very expensive--the on campus housing, the cheap price of food, travel around Beijing and museum admission, the in-house faculty, etc--so it would have been nice if we (like the other studios) had been afforded a few perks like someone covering the cost of our taxis or the one drink we got at (probably) the most expensive bar in Beijing at the top of the tower where we were all asked to meet as a group. It would also have been nice to meet with some other experts over the course of the semester, possibly Yale faculty in other departments.",
    "Yes, the resources were adequate.",
    "Yes",
    "More funding!"
