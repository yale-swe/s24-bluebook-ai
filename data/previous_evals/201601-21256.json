    "A great introductory econometrics and data analysis course! Professor Ryan was really helpful and kept the course material interesting with fun examples in class. There is a lot of work but that is to be expected in a high level class like this. The tests are pretty hard but there is a nice curve applied. Overall I would recommend this class!",
    "very dry course. Weekly quizzes and biweekly psets.",
    "This class was such a struggle. The midterm felt totally unrelated to the pset structures. The class did not explain the topics well enough, and there was not adequate secondary material to bridge the gap between the lackluster class and the material we needed to understand. It almost felt as if you had to have experience with Statistics or Econometrics to even remotely understand what was happening. Professor Ryan seems nice, but he is a terrible lecturer. If someone asked him to clarify something he had just discussed, he would just repeat himself or, worse, re-explain using statistical vocabulary unfamiliar to us. If we had a practice problem presented in class, and none of us responded correctly, rather than working through it with us, he would leave us to struggle for 10 minutes (which should clearly be an indication we don't know how to solve the problem) and then summarize how to get the answer verbally rather than taking half a minute to work through it on the board. We would be left knowing we got the problem wrong, but still not knowing how to answer the question. The TA's are only used to oversee labs in STATA, which is not part of the material we are tested over on the midterm\/final. The relationship between section and the course was questionable, at best. I understand why the department feels it is important for us to learn the program, but it would have been a much better for us to have the TA's as a resource for us who breaks down the material we learned in class and helps us flesh out what we don't understand. We need traditional TA's for this class, possibly more so than we need them for others, and it's truly a shame we did have that resource available to us. If you are prepared for a 45% to be the class average on a midterm, go for it.",
    "Ultimately, I think this will be a helpful class, though I'm not quite sure what makes it different than a stats class for example. Would recommendI feel like I gained some very applicable skills and knowledge.",
    "I thought Professor Ryan was very helpful and his lectures were pretty interesting. You could tell he loves statistics and that made learning the material easier. Really nice guy and enjoyed his class.",
    "Prof. Ryan is a great lecturer! And the class has very organized notes.",
    "You have to take it as an Econ major but second semester is a lot better! Hang in there.",
    "ECON 131 is not an easy course. I would recommend it if you're an economics major or if you're just curious about the intersection of economics and statistics. I would not recommend it if you're just curious about the subject. Although more application based than ECON 136, there is a lot of theory also involved that can be frustrating and time-consuming to understand. That being said, the TAs are generally helpful and Professor Ryan is super smart!",
    "Stat class with some econ applications. Not too difficult if you've taken AP stats before or take the time to review the material. The second half of the course can be summarized down to four to five hours of actual review.",
    "Good overview of statistical analysis with research papers as case studies",
    "This course is required for the economics major and provides an effective and informative introduction to the study of econometrics and data analysis. The course itself was exceptionally well-taught (definitely take it with Professor Ryan) and offers many interesting real-world applications of the material. Made reading technical economic reports much easier. Be prepared to work with statistical software (Stata) on many of the problem sets. Great class!",
    "Intro to Stat and regression analysis",
    "This class is very straight-forward if you come to lecture and do the work. It is definitely easy to follow behind if you don't come and work with a friend on the psets. Really make sure you get the topics from lecture because the topics build-off of each other. Also, I would suggest going to section when you can so you understand the basics of Stata -- this will be very important when you do your research project!",
    "As a non-math person, this was a very challenging course. Exams are so difficult, so keep up with material and don't be afraid to go to office hours. The group project is really interesting a good opportunity to help your grade if you're struggling elsewhere.",
    "Recommend. Teaches some valuable skills for any field",
    "Hard",
    "It's a good course, but I would say hard enough that I wouldn't recommend it unless you need it for your major.",
    "I would recommend this to students looking to learn how to analyze data, specifically using STATA. There isn't a heavy emphasis on proofs.",
    "Interesting but not too in depth; good for overall learning about statistics.",
    "Not great. Pororly organized, mediocre teaching, and the group project is a mess if your group isn't as motivated as you are. If you have Linear Algebra, then take 135.",
    "To be honest, I felt that Econ 131 was a class that many students felt they just had to take because of the economics degree requirements. It was interesting at times, but felt a bit tedious.",
    "Really terrible experience. Professor ryan is robotic. Midterm is awful.",
    "This is an econ requirement, but overall the class was pretty good. If you have taken any intro stats classes, the first half is all review, but the second half goes a but deeper. The second half is challenging enough that it was probably worth taking 131 and not just skipping straight to 132. Also, I highly recommend taking it with Professor Ryan!",
    "Helpful if you have some experience in statistics. Interesting material overall.",
    "Only take this if you need to for the major. A very confusing class (at least with Professor Ryan) and completely unrewarding to complete. It's required for the major, and by the end you will know everything you needed to know, but the journey there is painful and full of boredom and confusion. Overall, not a very hard class in terms of workload or concepts, but just not intellectually stimulating at all.",
    "This is a good course that explains the fundamentals of statistics in the context of social science. Prof Ryan is really good and the material can be boring sometimes, but the examples used in class are pretty interesting. I would recommend taking this class with professor Ryan as he is a breath of fresh air.",
    "I took ECON 131 after STAT 103 and sometimes I still felt a bit lost. However, if I hadn't taken stats before, I could imagine the class being very tough. The problem sets could get trick, go to office hours! The TAs are wonderful. This is Professor Ryan's first time teaching the class and he did a great job. Would recommend taking it with him!"
