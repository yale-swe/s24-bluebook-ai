    "A lot of outside work was required for this course, but that work translated into a level of understanding of the material that would not have been achieved otherwise. This is the best course I have experienced in learning Bayesian Statistics.",
    "Strength: Nice topics Weakness: Lecture notes sometimes are not specifics.",
    "It was often hard to translate the material we went over in class to the homework assignments, exam, and coding.",
    "A great introductory course in Bayesian statistics.",
    "The course was well designed. I was sometimes hard to follow the contents in the presentation slides. The examples Joshua used were helpful to catch up with them.",
    "Concepts learnt from this course were very useful. The course was well organized. Homework assignments related to course material closely. I really like the format of the final projects. It would be better to upload scores assignments and exams to canvas, to I can get timely feedback. And the 8:00am course was too early. :(",
    "strength: cover the bayesian statistics in detail. no weakness",
    "Very useful course for research; highly recommended.",
    "This is a really great class in bayesian statistics. I learned a lot from Professor Warren.",
    "The course was very well taught. The instructor is engaging and extremely willing to be available for questions outside of class time, which was unique and definitely a highlight of this class. The topic of the course is fascinating and useful, and the variety of final projects illustrated this and were very interesting. The only suggestion I might have is that there were many interesting applications introduced in lecture that were not necessary covered on the problem sets - in order to have a better grasp of those applications, it might have been interesting to have some optional problems to think about of the problem sets (perhaps extra credit?).",
    "Strengths: In-depth introduction to Bayesian statistics. Josh is an excellent professor, very willing to explain things during office hours. Weaknesses: Focuses more on theory than application (may be a strength depending on what you hope to get out of the class). Definitely difficult, be weary if you don't have a strong math background."

    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Very good instructor. Knowledgeable and inspired!",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Professor Warren is very friendly and helpful, and very responsive to students' questions. I also like his teaching style a lot, very detailed and clear.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0As I mentioned in a previous question, one of the definite highlights of the course is that the instructor was very available for questions outside of class time and clearly excited about the material he was teaching. This was inspiring and made the learning process very enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Excellent professor. Extremely patient and willing to work with and help students. Make sure to take advantage of office hours. This cannot be emphasized enough."
