    "The best way at Yale to get a QR credit. It's so interesting because the field of math is so new--you are learning it from one of it's original inventors (is that what you call it with a field of math??). Amazing",
    "This class is definitely harder than expected, but for people who aren't strong in math and need a QR it's not the worst (although I'd definitely recommend taking it with a friend so you have a buddy system!). That being said, it's worth taking for Frame alone. He is absolutely wonderful and a great professor - so glad I've been able to be his student this semester!!",
    "It's a survey course, really. You'll move through various subjects and methods, some of which build off each other and some of which don't. Highly recommended, simply because Michael Frame is the Teacher, but also because it's math that, for once, isn't about math. It's math that applies to something other than itself.",
    "Math 190 is a really neat class about fractals. If you don't know what fractals are, then you should take this class (regardless of how good you are at math) and if you DO know what fractals are then you'll probably know if you want to take this class. I think it's a good illustration of how mathematics is basically all over the place, and if you ever thought \"why do people care about math so much\" then this is the class for you! Michael Frame is the best ever and you're missing out if you never experience his teaching. I don't necessarily believe people when they say Math 190 is a gut class, but the homeworks don't take very long and the tests are completely manageable. Would definitely recommend.",
    "A decent class. I took it as an easy class because I had a really tough schedule. The class was low stress and the professor is very nice. However, this class is going to feel a little like eating ice cream for every meal. It is fun and yummy at first, but after a while, you're going to want something with a bit more substance.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. WHY ARE YOU EVEN STILL READING THE EVALUATIONS? Prof. Frame is a genius and the sweetest man ever. You will learn, you will laugh, and you will see the world in a new way.",
    "This class describes the math behind fractals much more than you think (which makes sense because it is a geometry class, but I had though it would go into nature a lot). However, he still connects topics to real life, which can be pretty incredible. The weekly homework never takes long and all of the tests are open note. If you are ever confused on anything, show up to his office hours and he'll explain the homework very clearly.",
    "Best class ever, not hard at all if you pay attention and put in the effort. I would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can. Professor Frame is one of the most amazing professors (and people) at Yale. He is an inspiration and will teach you so much about math and life. Take this class. It's worth it.",
    "INCREDIBLE! INSPIRING! TAKE IT IF YOU POSSIBLY, POSSIBLY CAN! One of the most wonderful courses I've ever taken.Professor Frame is one of the most brilliant, thoroughly kindhearted people i've ever had the pleasure of being in the same room as. There's nothing he loves more than teaching, than helping someone understand a concept that they previously found difficult. Interacting with his students is so clearly a huge part of what keeps him going, even as his health struggles. He radiates warmth and goodness and wisdom. As for the course itself, the information is fascinating, and the math is very simple. The concepts are quite tricky, but the calculations themselves don't require more than some knowledge of algebra 2. A phenomenal course that absolutely everyone should take, regardless of experience (or lack thereof) with math.",
    "if it's offered again, take it! Frame is a wonderful human being. just be sure to drink lots of caffeine before class.",
    "It's a pretty easy QR for a non-mathy person. You don't really even need to go to the lectures to get by with the material, but Frame is amazing and they're always lots of fun. Not the most interesting class as far as material, but a nice, easy QR if that's what you're looking for.",
    "Great course. Highly recommended.",
    "Certainly not a gut, at times the math can be very abstract. Frame is great. Go to the tutoring sessions to do your problem sets and the workload shouldn't be too bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are in need of a QR credit. Most of the time it's pretty interesting, and it's definitely a good way to get a semester of math out of the way. Also, just being in the same room as Frame twice a week for a whole semester will make you a better person.",
    "Fractals is a great class, partially because fractals are super cool and mostly because Michael Frame is amazing. If you are a math\/science major (like me), take this class, because you probably haven't learned much about fractals anyway, and because Frame sometimes talks about being a mathematician (and about life in general) and it's really interesting (plus the workload is very light). If you aren't and you just need a QR credit, take this class, because the math and workload are light AND you get to sit and listen to Frame talk and he's awesome. Just, like, take this class. Seriously. You won't regret it.",
    "Dr. Frame is absolutely fantastic! I took this course so I could have him as an instructor, and it was all that I hoped it could be. The material was interesting once you get into it, and Dr. Frame is one of the kindest, most inspiring professors I have had at Yale. I would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "This is a great course for students who understand pictures better than numbers. Not that there aren't numbers in this class (there are), or that the pictures are easy to understand (they aren't), but there's something about seeing the math presented as fractals and graphs that makes the material more accessible. The workload is manageable, though the math is subtle. You'll want to visit the tutors. You'll want to study for the tests. But I think the experience is worth whatever trouble the material might give you. You'll learn much and yet you'll leave with many questions. This the experience you should have with every class you take, though that isn't always the case. It is here.",
    "TAKE IT! You'll learn about so many new things and approaches to math (although, by the end I had lost sight of what's the POINT in doing all these exercises \/ ways of graphing the same thing that I grew very bored).Mainly, take it because of Michael Frame--he is the most hardworking, caring, and dedicated professor I've ever had. He really treats students so completely differently, I've never been so comfortable hammering out a problem even though I'm afraid I might look stupid. Because I know that Professor Frame does not judge and he genuinely is happy when you figure something out.Do you know how much effort it takes for a professor to have this come across to his students? Frame has 5+ hour office hours every week and time before and after class and during finals period, he works non-stop despite being exhausted and having just had a shot of chemotherapy and having to re-teach students things over and over again that they could've understood if they had paid more attention in class. Frankly, I'm not so awed by learning the content of fractals as by seeing someone love his job so much and caring so selflessly about his students. It is inspiring!",
    "100%",
    "Fractal Geometry is a solid QR class for students who are by nature math-averse (as I was). Professor Frame does a great job in presenting the material in an accessible, intelligible way. He always answers questions, so don't be afraid to speak up. Also, if you don't understand the material, go to his office hours (and, if you want, supplement with tutoring). There is no reason for you to feel disempowered in this class--it is completely doable, though not a gut in my opinion. Plus fractals are super cool, and Professor Frame is a sweet man.",
    "This class is harder than many let on. I think it is often misrepresented, and it definitely presents a challenge. It is very conceptual, so if you prefer practical mathematics, it may not be the right choice. A relatively accessible QR, but be ready for some very confusing lectures.Then again, it is a great \"Yale moment\" to realize your math class is taught by one of the inventors of that type of math.",
    "First of all, this is one of the easiest classes you'll take at Yale. The problem sets are three (very short) questions long and will take you ten minutes to complete, the exams are open-book, and the professor takes notes for you and puts them online. Next, this is one of the most enjoyable classes you'll take at Yale. The lectures are hilarious and Professor Frame is the nicest man in the world. You'll want to go to class even though there's no reason you need to actually go to class to understand the material.",
    "Fractal Geometry is an interesting course in helping to examine the way that we view the world and the intersections between math and every day things. I loved the course and I thought that it was manageable and well taught. Michael Frame is the best!",
    "Fractal Geometry is great! It is conceptually interesting and not too challenging math-wise. Professor Frame's enthusiasm for this subject and his students makes this class a pleasure to take.",
    "Awesome class, especially for an easy QR. Material is pretty interesting. Pay attention in class\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it will make psets and exams a breeze. Michael Frame is legendary for a reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what an incredible person.",
    "An introduction to the field of fractal geometry. Does not require calculus. Fractals have been used to tract investment banks, create computer-images of nature-like objects, and used to generate amazing pictures.",
    "Take it! An easy and fun QR. Prof. Frame is absolutely knowledgable and kind. Tutors are amazing, too!",
    "This class was fantastic! Frame is amazing.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. It is a lot of work in the fact that if you have need taken geometry your eye will need to adapt to looking at things differently but Professor Frame makes the transition easy. The tutors are so helpful as well.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "The class is amazing. Pay attention to Dr. Frame. You will learn so much from this class. It's not your normal math class, but the math is really interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. It is very interesting and is not your typical math class. If you are looking for a QR credit with a great professor, Math 190 is a good choice. The knowledge of math that you need doesn't really go beyond logarithms; there is no calculus that you need to know. Overall, I think Math 190 is a great class.",
    "Fractal geometry is a fascinating subject that explores the math of fractals. I loved this class. Fractals are beautiful and I was really intrigued by the subject. I did, however, find the class conceptually challenging. I was quite confused at some points in the class and wasn't prepared for the amount of math that it would require. I would highly recommend this class! Although it was challenging, I got a lot out of it.",
    "Yes!",
    "An absolutely fantastic course! Loved it, loved it, loved it. I've hated math my entire life, but if I could take this class every semester, I would. Frame is really incredible. During shopping period, I was not super impressed with him, but stayed because I found the course material interesting and needed a reasonable QR. By the end of the class, I was (like everyone else) in love with him, and I also loved the course material. Fractals are fascinating, and Frame approaches them really well. He explains everything clearly and slowly, and uses lots of visuals to help us, and tells jokes in the middle of class to keep us awake and enjoying class (to be honest, it's really helpful). Seriously, you won't regret taking this class.",
    "You simply have to take this class.",
    "Even aside from looking for a gentler QR credit that is manageable for humanities majors, this is a class that you will come away from feeling like you've learned something that you would never have otherwise. Professor Frame is incredible - if you have the opportunity to take a class with him, do it. Visual learners especially should take this class.",
    "A great qr--Great--that gives you all the resources to succeed, and happens to be quote fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this class. Take it if you are interested in the humanities - you will learn math that will change the way you think about the world!",
    "A must take! Fractal Geometry is one of the best courses offered at Yale! Prof. Frame is engaging, funny, accessible, and really cares about teaching. The subject matter itself is really interesting and not something that I knew anything about before taking the course. I am a social science major, but I found the class interesting and useful. Basically, if you have a chance to take this course, regardless of your major, you definitely should! Prof. Frame is wonderful!",
    "Pretty easy math class, and fun conceptually. More philosophy than you would think!",
    "It's a great course! Even for someone who isn't a math person, Prof. Frame kept things interesting and is always available to help! Office hours are always a place to clear things up and Prof. Frame will break down major concepts for you.",
    "If you need a QR or just want an interesting class, this one is a sure bet. You should take this at some point during your Yale career if you can.",
    "I would highly recommend this class as long as Michael Frame is teaching it. You will learn so much about a completely novel topic.",
    "a class to show you that math can be fun all over again. frame will make you appreciate life and all of its little accidents and mishaps. and the class is really well structured.",
    "Absolutely; it's a must-take. Every good thing you have heard about Professor Frame is true. He had to cancel one or two classes this semester to have his left eye operated and in the midst of that, he would send us emails saying how much he missed talking to us and teaching us. He will explain the same concept as many times as you want without the slightest impatience. And Math 190 is the kind of class that makes 'aha' math moments accessible to non-math majors. Take it for that, and take it for Frame. Just do.",
    "This class was great. The material is easy but fun and Michael Frame is an absolute gem. This is a great QR credit for anyone. Doesn't require too much work but is difficult and new enough to be stimulating. Also, most professors care dearly about their subject but Frame takes that to a whole new level. He also genuinely cares about his students more than they care about themselves and it shows. He is a class act and it is a privilege to take any of his classes.",
    "This course was a solid introduction to a relatively new and lightly explored branch of math. I am not good at math and I found this course do-able thanks to tutoring for every problem set. Also, it was a pleasure to be taught by such a dedicated, caring instructor.",
    "I would, it was nice.",
    "MATH 190 is a well taught class (Michael Frame is awesome) that is suitable for both math lovers and those who just need a QR. I found the class easy, having taken three years of calculus in high school, but highly enjoyable and intellectually stimulating nonetheless. Some of my friends who aren't as numerically inclined struggled a little but were able to do well with the help of class tutors. Michael Frame truly wants each of his students to succeed, and there's no reason not to take the class!",
    "Take it - mostly for Frame. I'm a physics major, and I took this because I just wanted to experience Michael Frame. If you're looking for an easy class - I don't even think it was for me, but it was such a fulfilling experience that I think everyone should do it."
