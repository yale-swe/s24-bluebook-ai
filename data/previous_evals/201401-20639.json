   "comments": [
    "Working on dictation, listening, sight-singing. Very challenging, very fun. Taking it Credit D was, for me, a great choice - otherwise it would've been very stressful.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their ear for any purpose. It's a lot of fun as well as being useful.",
    "Definitely yes. If you've ever been interested in improving your ear for chords\/melodies, this is a really relaxing and useful class, and was one of my favorites at Yale. If you already have a good ear, you might want to check out MUSI219 during shopping period just to see where you are.",
    "I definitely recommend 218 to a student who wants to become a better musician, and definitely take it with Sarita if possible. Sarita is an amazing professor. She's friendly and keeps the class moving quickly so it's challenging for everyone. She's really attuned to the different levels in the class, as everyone comes from a different musicianship background, and she's super nice about helping out and accommodating those levels. Also, she offers extra help sessions and is generally really available if you have questions. Class time always flew by in 218.",
    "If you take 218, take it with Sarita. She is the best teacher for 218\/219. However, be aware that depending on the class, you could be more advanced than everyone else, which means you won't learn as much. Get a feel for your classmates and how good they are at dictation\/sight singing\/etc. It might be worth it to just take 219. But take it with Sarita.",
    "Great course, not entry level though don't be fooled by the 1 in Musicianship 1. I would definitely recommend this course; it's not too hard but challenging enough that you really do learn from the drills and repetition.",
    "MUSI 218 is a wonderful half credit class if you think singing in a low stakes environment sounds like a pretty fun time. Speaking as someone not in an acapella group\/anything musical on campus I sometimes felt a little behind my peers in terms of sightsinging ability, but ultimately I found I improved in a satisfying way. My suggestion is if you are feeling behind\/lost, don't try and practice online because there aren't really any tools that are well tailored to 218, but definitely make an effort to go to Sarita's group practice office hour sessions around quiz time, the extra boost will give you the confidence needed to do well (and there's no homework really so you ought to have the time to meet with her). I also found keyboard lab fun, but I think a lot of that had to do with my piano experience (I also heard stuart was the better instructor). Highly recommended, I seriously had so much fun in class every day!",
    "Take it if you want to improve your ear. Take it credit \/ D if you're not confident in your ear to begin with."
