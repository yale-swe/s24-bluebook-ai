You learn how to make decisions with incomplete information, in dynamic situations, and in varying time lengths. Overall, this material is really cool and good to learn for all majors.",
    "While Game Theory can't be applied literally to most situations in real life, it really teaches you how to evaluate your decisions logically. Overall very cool material.",
    "Game theory introduced me to a new way of thinking. A lot of games are very common in life, and through the class I was able to learn the logical solution to them. Some are fairly counterintuitive, which led me to improve my decision process.",
    "Started with the simple nash equilibrium model that most people knew from another econ class and then built on it a ton. Crazy how much more to game theory is than I previously thought.

This class is for anyone who loves to think logically, and it is extremely satisfying and rewarding. I think this class gets you to think about people's decisions in a different way, and I think learning about game theory formally has improved my decisions in life.",

   "comments": [
    "The material taught in class is well-organized and structured. The slides and notes are updated regularly, which is convenient since there is no need to purchase expensive textbooks. The professor has also proved to be available to answer questions not only at office hours, but also at the end of class. Thanks to the supporting material posted on Canvas, I was able to follow what was going on without too many problems. That being said, I am afraid I have to be critical of Professor Saez for how she handled class time and interactions with students in general. The fact that the midterm was designed poorly and led to issues with curving and grading is not so serious in and of itself. People make mistakes. Yet, what was problematic and frankly disconcerting was how the professor dealt with the consequences of her original mistake. Multiple emails were sent out, each making the curve more lenient in an attempt to make up for the first mistake in writing the exam. Of course, some students started complaining that other people's grades were being bumped up, which in turn affected their chances of being in the A range at the end of the semester. While the professor was clearly trying to be accommodating and wanted to help students after acknowledging her error, she ended up making matters worse, to the point that we were eventually advised by one of the TAs not to contact the professor with questions about midterm grading because she was too stressed to respond. I realize she might have found herself in a tough spot, and that she may not have been used to it. Unfortunately, if you choose to teach at Yale you have to know when to be firm and not be a pushover.",
    "The course and material are fine. The professor was NOT (see my comments below).",
    "The teaching of this course feels incredibly over complicated and disjointed. There is no way game theory is actually as hard as this class makes it feel. I seriously learn better from the youtube videos than by going to class or reading any of the material on Canvas.",
    "The examples we studied in class were very applicable to real life, which was a great strength. Another strength were the comprehensive notes the professor published in addition to the lecture notes. This course could be improved by having psets graded more routinely, making the ungraded psets more similar to the graded psets (to give students more to practice), and by showing more work and thinking behind the answers in the slides and notes.",
    "flowed logically, though connections in the second half of the semester could have been made more clearly. slides were pretty helpful though. felt like i learned from it, though it really clicks or doesn't. There should be more communication between the professor and TAs because it was pretty clear sometimes that TAs did not know what the professor expected and so would say things that contradicted what the professor said.",
    "The class needs more practice problems. Only 4 problem sets are graded (which is nice, until the midterm and final exam roll around). Also, it doesn't feel that comprehensive - it just teaches you how to solve a set of specific (and mostly theoretical) games.",
    "Appreciate that the slides and notes are uploaded online and that the sections are used to review psets. Could be improved by more evenly spreading out the graded psets, and more detailed solutions that show work for pset and exam solutions posted online.",
    "The material is very interesting, but the teaching is not great.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Sez wrote very coherent slides for lecture and study notes. Weaknesses: During the class itself it was very hard to learn the materials given the way that the course was presented by Prof. Sez. Although the key concepts for each lecture were relatively few and simple, Prof. Sez would speak very rapidly and progress through slides so quickly that it was hard to absorb the material being presented. It seemed quite often that the TFs hadn't been briefed on the course materials (e.g. giving misleading information on the midterm, not being able to adequately respond to questions about the problem sets). Further, as someone who learns best by active practice, the lack of practice problems (for both the midterm and the final) made it very difficult for me to prepare myself for a class in which exams account for 70% of the grade.",
    "The course was extremely organized and made good use of both lectures and section. If anything, there were a few too many problem sets.",
    "professor was not a skilled teacher and any posted solutions were too brief to get any usable information",
    "The course material was interesting but I did not feel like the material was presented in a very clear way. However, psets and office hours helped to clarify the information.",
    "Hard to follow in lecture but slides from thanksgiving break on were very good",
    "Lectures glance over more advanced material and are sometimes unfocused as a result of that surveying. More focus and depth would make the course more cohesive.",
    "It was truly awful, poorly taught, the TFs were not at all helpful and the material incomprehensible",
    "Workload was not too challenging, perhaps giving incentives to complete all of the problem sets instead of just the required\/graded ones may be helpful. All the slides, homeworks and answers were clear.",
    "In general, the content of the class was taught incredibly poorly. The professor should take some time to restructure her notes and presentation of class content.",
    "Poor lectures, not her fault but can't really understand professor's accent",
    "The material was interesting, and the recommended textbook was very helpful. However, the lectures failed to go through examples fully, leading to a lot of confusion on when and how certain techniques are applied.",
    "could be much more organized",
    "Slides were clear and organized. Only issue was Professor Marti has a very thick accent and quiet voice - be prepared to teach yourself the material, which is doable.",
    "Strengths: Wide-ranging interesting topics. Weaknesses: Very exam-heavy grading.",
    "The material for this course is very interesting, but I found the overall organization of this course quite poor. Often times when I asked clarifying questions, I was given unclear answers or \"I don't know.\" Lecture notes were not posted before the lectures, making keeping up with the fast pace of class impossibly difficult. The tests were created such that getting one question wrong could significantly dip your grade. Also, little to no feedback was provided on graded p-sets, so I found it difficult to learn from my mistakes and improve in the course.",
    "The material was very interesting. One way it can be improved is to have more graded assignments, so that the weight on each pset is lower.",
    "The courses material is really interesting and my TA Satoshi was incredibly helpful during office hours. The problem sets are really well designed to challenge you but still be doable. I found Prof. Saez Marti's accent to be a little difficult to understand, and lecture was not super enjoyable and engaging.",
    "Strengths: The material itself is pretty fun Weakness: The professor How to fix: Change the professor",
    "I thought the course was well taught. It could have benefitted from greater communication between the lecturer and the TA's.",
    "More structure, better help options",
    "The lectures seemed slow sometimes but the professor was very passionate which made it interesting.",
    "Slides and class notes were very solid to the point that I didn't attend classes. Ungraded psets should be graded for good practice and incentive to do it. Exams were reasonable.",
    "Strengths - The material was challenging and there were lots of resources for the students to learn the concepts - Maria always held office hours and was accessible through email for questions - The exams were fair, as the instructor never asked us anything that we hadn't seen in some form on PSETS or in lecture Weaknesses - We spent less time on challenging material than we did on easier material. The easier material was essential to build a foundation, however I believe that the material before the midterm could have been condensed.",
    "More practice questions",
    "The tests were somewhat ambiguous and didnt let us demonstrate our knowledge very well, more multiple choice would be better.",
    "A bit fast in class",
    "Professor is horrible; the other professor was much better.",
    "Strengths: The material is fascinating, and the workload is really manageable. I did not know that Game Theory could be so in-depth, but I feel as though I really do know how strategic players would act in a myriad of situations. The last third of the class was my favorite, because we learned about Bayesian Nash Equilibrium and how beliefs play into shaping strategies, and also evolutionary game theory, which I was able to apply to my psychology classes when asking the question of how innate traits came to be. Workload-wise, there are only four graded p-sets (out of 12 total), and if you work in a group and go to office hours, they're not too bad. Lastly, I thought that the organization of lectures was pretty good, and I was engaged in most classes. I definitely know that some hold the opposite opinion, but I really think its a matter of concentrating during class and not giving up when you don't understand one thing. That, and being able to understand Maria's accent. Weaknesses: This is probably going to get redundant, but the midterm was a little janky for lack of a better term in that one question was weighted way too much and ended up being sort of a trick. However, I was most disappointed not by the test itself but by Maria's response--she did try to fix the issue, but when her fix proved to be flawed, she couldn't handle the critique and ended up just avoiding talking about the midterm. The TAs were okay for the most part, but if you were really lost and had big conceptual questions rather than problem-specific ones, they often didn't quite know how to answer.",
    "Lectures could be rather dry, and often the Professor seemed to have trouble understanding what issues and topics confused the students.",
    "This course is very interesting but the format of the lecture made the material difficult to understand. I would have liked for every lecture to have begun with an overview of the topic and how it fit into\/built upon the previous topics. Often I found myself lost halfway through the lecture, not knowing exactly what we were doing.",
    "Looking back on the course, I do feel like I learned a lot about game theory. But this class was often frustrating: lectures were sometimes difficult to follow, I frequently didn't feel well-prepared to complete problem sets, and the content and grading of the midterm was somewhat unfair.",
    "Lectures could be improved greatly. The Lecture Slides themselves were fine. However, the professor could've been better at lecturing. Individually in office hours she was great.",
    "Strengths: Pretty good workload, Maria's lecture slides and lecture notes were a lifesaver. Maria is also incredibly kind and helpful, choosing to sit with you one-on-one for more than an hour at a time just to help you through some material. She really just wants you to learn and understand the material, as game theory is her passion. Weaknesses: There was a bit of a debacle with the grading of the midterm, so a lot of people (including the prof) were stressed out about these logistical things. Would recommend a clearer grading system from the get-go. Also, I understand the desire for ensure student attendance, but it'd be helpful to get ahold of the lecture slides ahead of time so that we could take notes on them if we so choose, as she goes through the slides pretty quickly in class. I think doing this wouldn't harm attendance, since it's still necessary to attend class to understand the fullness of the material.",
    "The TAs and section are very helpful. I did not feel that the way we learned in class always translated to answering the problem sets. We spent a significant amount of time on the theoretical part behind the material, but not enough of real practical examples done in class. There should be a better balance.",
    "Professor Maria Saez Marti was the strength of this class. She is whole-heartedly passionate about what she does. She loves to teach. She loves game theory. I definitely think her passion reflected in my performance in and enjoyment of the class. I think the range of content is just perfect. The first half of the semester is focused on building your tools and vocabulary, and the second half jumps into more complex games that reflect real life more closely and demand more logical complexity. I love this course. No weaknesses to report!",
    "The course has excellent material and the formats in which material provided to students were excellent, from the slides Professor Saez shows in class to the detailed written notes she presents on Canvas. The course would be improved if there was a change in the way lectures were ran. Professor Saez often goes too fast and provides little explanation of new material the first time around. This meant that Professor Saez had to take a lot of lecture time revisiting material she had originally thought was understood by students.",
    "Strenghts: material Weakness: Lecture Notes weren't precise and lectures were inefficient at times.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is how interesting the material is. The problem sets were also well-designed and manageable. However, I thought lectures were rather confusing, and also did not do a great job of connecting the material to applications in the real world (they were too focused on the mathematical computations-- which are necessary, but not sufficient, in really understanding game theory). The exams felt rather poorly designed, too, and not a good test of how well one understood the material; getting entire questions right hinged on one noticing small details or tricks to the problem."

    "I would highly recommend this class to another student IF AND ONLY IF it is not taught by Prof Saez. IF GAME THEORY IS TAUGHT BY SAEZ DO NOT TAKE IT.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone unless they really like the concept of game theory",
    "Absolutely not. There are other versions of game theory courses that would prove to be more beneficial. Maria could not be a nicer woman and cares deeply about her students but unfortunately, the course and its TFs failed to foster a productive learning experience. That being said, the problem sets were fair and all and were the only chances I had to see if I really learned anything because otherwise, I found myself confused all the time.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who need to take game theory or an econ elective. I would not recommend this course to students looking for a general elective or SO credit. I think game theory is a fascinating topic, and the material you learn especially evolutionary games and bargaining is very interesting. However, there is not a lot of student participation in the material (we rarely acted out games, etc.) and it can be difficult to follow the lectures.",
    "I personally feel game theory either clicks with you or it doesn't. It clicked with me, but not so much for others. Curve is standard econ curve which stressed everyone out. TAs are great, professor really depends, Maria is nice and cares about the students but hard to understand sometimes.",
    "Unless you have to take it for EP&E, I wouldn't recommend. There are a lot more interesting Econ lectures out there, and the material is so theoretical that it won't have much appeal to most non-Econ students (or Econ students, for that matter). Lectures are slow and there's not that much incentive to attend. That being said, the problem sets were sometimes enjoyable, especially if you like problem-solving.",
    "I would recommend taking this class in the spring not the fall.",
    "Noultimately Game Theory is a course with very little intellectual challenge, but one that is taught in such a way that makes its relatively simple concepts seem dense and unapproachable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they are willing to put in the work.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they have to take game theory for credit. The topic is interesting as well, but the teaching staff was not the strongest.",
    "Great course for an introduction and for those without much pure economic background. On the flip side it doesn't go too far in depth on specific theory, but rather decides to survey general techniques. Can be confusing at times if only for the foreignness of the syntax.",
    "Not with this professor she is terrible",
    "I would recommend this class as it is interesting, not too challenging and well organised. It is a topic of interest and applicable to other classes.",
    "Absolutely do not take Game Theory with Prof. Saez Marti. It is one of the least well taught classes I have taken at Yale. Wait to take it with anyone other than her, trust me. The course material isn't inherently challenging--understanding the Prof's expectations and lecture style is.",
    "No",
    "So, imagine you have a professor who is entirely unable to explain *anything* coherently. Now imagine they don't take any questions. Now imagine they're incompetent and can't actually run a course properly. Now imagine every time the class is lost, they say 'this isn't rocket science!' That's this class. If you ever see the name 'Maria Saez Marti' on a course, run. Do not walk, run.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student, as while the material is quite interesting, the format is bland.",
    "no, much easier and straightforward game theory courses available",
    "Never, at least with Professor Saez Marti. I was incredibly excited to take Game Theory at first, but I am disappointed that the subject was ruined for me.",
    "Yes. Just be prepared to teach yourself.",
    "I'd recommend that anyone I talk to learn game theory as it is helpful and applicable to any field; however, this course is an unnecessarily difficult method to learn game theory. Unless you like self-teaching and are a serious autodidact, this course might be more trouble than just taking a different online course or otherwise learning on your own.",
    "Yes. Professor Saez is a wonderful teacher - she is extremely caring and intelligent. Moreover, the course material is inherently interesting.",
    "Yes. It helps you become a more informed decision maker.",
    "Good Econ elective, but by no means an easy class. If you've taken intermediate econ and math 120, this course goes pretty smoothly, but with less exposure to the topics and more complex math (ie. state dynamics), it takes more time to learn and can be tricky. TA's and office hours are really helpful with the homeworks. Midterm exam was relatively easy (even though there was a debacle with one of the questions), and the final was very difficult.",
    "No. But the subject matter is fun so take it if it's not with Maria",
    "Potentially",
    "Yes, the topic is very interesting and has many applications.",
    "I might consider Marina's course due to her increased engagement in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was incredibly interesting and will get you to think in new ways. Maria was great, as were the TFs. The workload wasn't overbearing (4 graded PSETS and more ungraded ones), but it was enough to help students learn the material.",
    "Its interesting, but frustrating in terms of grading",
    "If you need it or are interested",
    "No if the professor is the same. Yes because material is interesting.",
    "I would, especially if Marina comes back to teach it (we had two guest lectures from her, and they were great. She taught it with Maria Saez last year I think). This course is not perfect, but in terms of Econ classes, I really did enjoy learning all the material, and even the difficult p-sets were more fun to figure out because, well, you're solving games! Disclaimer: I took this class with some friends, which I think was a tremendous help\/made the class a lot more enjoyable. Talking through psets and confusing material is crucial to success.",
    "I would recommend it, but it would be on the condition that you were interested in Game Theory to begin with. Those looking for a good econ elective or serious intellectual challenge would be better served elsewhere.",
    "I would reccomend this course, without the same teacher and TA.",
    "I genuinely liked the content of this course, and I wish I could recommend it. But unless considerable changes are made to how the course is taught, I do not recommend this course. Lectures were sometimes difficult to follow, the weekly problem sets vary wildly in difficulty, and I was frequently frustrated by how the course was taught.",
    "I would only for the material. Again the Lectures were rough",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, with caution. I think if you are prepared to attend every lecture and listen raptly to what the professor is saying, as well as be on top of your problem sets (aka doing all of them, even the ungraded ones - only 4 are graded) then you will do well. I went into this class thinking it was going to be a gut and it definitely wasn't!!!! Even though she provides a good amount of supplementary material, it's easy to doze off in class or choose to skip as a result, and if you do so then you miss out on a lot of important material and walkthroughs available only in class. You also really have to pay attention because English is not the native language of the professor or the TAs, and while that's not their fault, it does make communication with each other (e.g. wording on exams, understanding the prof. from the back of the lecture hall) a bit harder. Also, game theory definitely gets more math-y\/econ-y in the second half, so keep that in mind. All that being said, Professor Saez is incredibly kind and patient and will work with you through whatever (content) questions you may have. She does want you to succeed!",
    "I would recommend having some knowledge of econ prior to taking this course. The course also is much more manageable if you speak to the TAs regularly. I would not say this class is easy. It's not especially hard but you really do need to pay attention if you aren't especially savy at econ.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class to every student, and please take it with Professor Maria Saez Marti!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because of the interesting material presented in this course. If you enjoy solving puzzles and\/or problem solving, this course is fun and will keep you interested.",
    "Yes, but if you have trouble understanding accents, take it with Halac.",
    "I'm not sure that I would recommend this course. Unless you need it for your major, I think most people would get more out of watching online Game Theory videos or reading a textbook, since this class both had confusing lectures and was also not particularly easy to do well in."
