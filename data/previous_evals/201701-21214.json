    "I would absolutely recommend this to another student. Through taking this class, you can learn an incredible amount about galaxies and space (most of which are absolutely awesome). Prof K is a bit awkward, but it is in a sweet, charming way. He is a great lecturer and actually takes an interest in his student's success. I would recommend this but with this caveat: If you haven't taken a decent amount of astro or physics classes recently, it may be a tad difficult. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of information to absorb, and if you are hung up in the math or physics of it, it can really snowball on you. If you have some physics (even just 180\/181), some basic multi-variable calc and (possibly) some astro (210 probably), then by all means take this class. You wont regret it."
