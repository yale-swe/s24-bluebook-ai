    "As I said, the class definitely helps keep you on track, and also at one point you get to read the work of other students in your class. Since everyone is an American Studies major, people will have very diverse and interesting products. Also, class doesn't meet every week so that's also another bonus.",
    "Doing a senior project is a great way to end your senior year. You have a ton of free time to do research and write on a topic of your choice--so you become really engaged with the material. I thoroughly enjoyed doing my senior project this semester and I would highly recommend doing one before you graduate!"
