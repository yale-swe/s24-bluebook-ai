    "The class appeared to be somehow irrelevant to students in policy and management track.",
    "IRRELEVANT",
    "Ethics as an area of study is quite engaging. Unfortunately, this seminar was quite onerous to sit through.",
    "NA",
    "good",
    "I like the presented ethical conundrum, but found the course to be a little stretched out. I think that It could have been done as an online program. It should have at least provided some sort of dinner or snack given its timing",
    "good course",
    "I think this course was a good idea conceptually, but it was poorly executed. Logistically, it was held on an evening with lots of commitments and upcoming assignments and exams. It was also held over dinner hours, but there was not any food or any break to go get food.I am generally interested in research ethics and would actually enjoy a course on the subject, but this quick overview was not particularly focused. I liked the discussion, but was disappointed in other students' refusal to participate. I left the seminar without gaining anything, which was a disappointment.The problem with these one-time seminars is that they become disjointed from the rest of the YSPH experience. They become a box to check, instead of a chance to integrate some new material and experiences into our career preparation. This will be difficult to address without some type of ongoing seminar that holds students accountable for preparation and participation. Similar to the professional development seminar, these \"core skills\" don't develop from a one-time workshop. It takes time to develop and improve these skills.One suggestion that would be easier to implement is to have discussions take place in separate break-out sessions with a small number of students and a moderator in each group. Discussions with 100+ hungry, tired, stressed grad students rarely work well, but they are important conversations to have.I also was disappointed that the famous Tuskegee experiment (and other case studies) were barely mentioned. While I can appreciate an objective component to establish philosophical frameworks, how could we take an ethics seminar and NOT talk about Tuskegee?!",
    "",
    "Dr. Jennings is very knowledgeable and gave a good background of public health ethics in the limited time that we had. I don't think the discussions were effective in such a large group. Perhaps have smaller discussion groups, even if there aren't enough instructors\/TA's to moderate the small discussions.",
    "For anyone who has every done research or human subjects work this was not very helpful. Hearing the theory behind ethics is interesting but having already had to sit through a HIC introductory lecture I got nothing new.Rather than a seminar I think people should have to simply complete the HIPAA trainings as they quiz you on your understanding of research ethics or it should be a only based on break out sessions.",
    "Strength: very important topic",
    "Worthwhile and thoughtful discussion, but lecture was a bit laborious and slow. Worth cutting down to maybe half its current weight.",
    "This course is entirely unnecessary as we could have received all of the material online.",
    "This module was quite frankly a waste of time. I did not walk out of the seminar having learned anything new and it was not engaging in the slightest.",
    "I didn't see this course was necessary because we learned from the online courses for the certificates after all.",
    "It was a fine subject matter and an interesting lecture, but please don't have a 5-7 pm lecture with no food! It's fine to not provide food, but don't have it during primary dinner time.",
    "below average. Had good potential.",
    "This class was a joke and it shouldn't have been. It was incredibly boring and I learned nothing. Ethics is a very very important issue and I feel as though the way it was presented made people take it less seriously.",
    "The topic is pretty self-explanatory",
    "I think this course would of been better suited as an online course that we could take on our own time. This course was taught at a very inconvenient time during the semester, and should have taken place earlier.",
    "This was the biggest waste of time of my entire life. Firstly, there was no food even though the course was at dinner time and it went 30 minutes late. Second, the discussion activity was so poorly designed that the complexities of the situation could not be actually discussed. I'm telling you, it is leadership 101. If you want people to be happy and pay attention at something that they don't want to be at anyways, give them food. This class was so miserable.",
    "Good idea in theory, bad in practice.",
    "Having a seminar on ethics is important. I would say that done with all of the students in the class, however, make it difficult to be as meaningful as it should be. One, because students are packed like sardines in an uncomfortable room and two, because non-agressive people are less likely to speak up in such a big crowd.I think the course could be improved without Dr. Jennings as the instructor.",
    "The seminar provided a solid foundation for research ethics. I have studied ethics in the past, so this course was very redundant for me.",
    "Kind of boring... But it was only 2 hours so it was no big deal.",
    "Excellent and very relevant course which should be offered as an elective.",
    "This class felt redundant. I think covering this topics as part of our general coursework would have been far more effective. The example discussion was stupid. In general, I'm not sure I really got much out of it, but on the whole I guess I'd rather have it be shorter than longer. Also, feeding us that late at night when we were there for so long would have been an excellent idea. It would have made me far more inclined to pay attention.They also could have started with an interactive example or a historical example to walk us through as they explained the concepts rather than a very dry initial presentation.",
    "It was adequate. I think the HIIPA and IRB modules were the only useful part.",
    "interesting",
    "Great seminar.",
    "Not very practical in my opinion. The one-session course took material that could have been taught in a year and condensed it down to 3 hours.",
    "Great. Short is good.",
    "Not sure if I learned much from this course.",
    "I think that ethics is really interesting, and I see the importance of the topic. I think that it is incredibly difficult to engage people who do not feel the same way when the class is taught to over 100 people in an auditorium. I think it would be better to have concentration-specific ethics courses.",
    "Do not see the future use or importance of this to my future career path.",
    "Strength- nothingWeakness- Most students already took modules on this topic. The seminar felt redundant..just another check in a box.",
    "Perhaps it was because I had a midterm the day after, but I did not learn anything and was not sure why this seminar was required",
    "The first hour was very theoretical, which could have been cut down. Breakout sessions would help encourage greater student participation.",
    "The seminar was okay. I am happy it was only a one time thing. I wish they had sent out a reminder email to complete the modules. This seminar was during a very busy time for first years. Many of us were in the middle of internship searches and had interviews. It would have been nice to have received a reminder email about the required modules to complete.",
    "The timing of the seminar was inconvenient, which really detracted from the actual material.",
    "Very poorly structured seminar. Disappointing.",
    "Strengths: the one-time structure of the seminar made the course more manageable.Weaknesses: the large section without any group break off time or exercises led to poor student interaction and practice of the applicability of ethics concepts.",
    "Boring. did not need to be a class--better if it was online.",
    "Not truly an effective way of teaching research ethics",
    "Great discussion.",
    "Subject matter was very dry and hypothetical. Taking the online courses alone should have sufficed.",
    "Course did not relate to our summer internship at all. It was too theoretical and failed to address real-world ethical concerns we may encounter for those of us going abroad.",
    "very boring lecture - not relevantinteractive group portion was fun",
    "thought-provoking",
    "I thought that the course did not offer much to the program. It was not very engaging to the students overall.",
    "A nice overview, but there were a lot of heavy topics to cover in a very short amount of time. The large group format made discussion more difficult, but the speaker handled that well. The scenarios were interesting.",
    "The content and instructor were good, however nobody takes this serious. Hardly anyone pays attention and people are preoccupied doing their schoolwork, instead of listening.Improvement: I wish this pointless seminar wasn't require, but I'm sure that won't change. Can we at least get fed. We were starving on a Thursday night. The seminar runs from 5-7pm, we should at least have been given snacks.",
    "It was given near midterms and at such a bad time of year. Also, there was no food? That seems kind of tacky.Have it at the beginning of the year. Have break out groups. Engage students more. Don't let us all play on our laptops the whole class. It seemed rude to the professor.",
    "Waste of time",
    "It did the job of talking about ethics. I think it would have been better if we had discussion groups though.",
    "I think it would have been sufficient for us to just do the online trainings and certifications.",
    "a little be long",
    "It's a waste of time and tuition dollars. I've been a physian for 20 years. I know what informed consent is.You should be allowed to waive out of this class, as is the case for professional skills in Fall semester.",
    "I have no idea how this course is about ethics in research. The lecture focused on history and ethic terms. Absolutely nothing was useful about this lecture",
    "The course was theory based and failed to really connect back to public health. Was overall a waste of a Thursday evening.",
    "Not pertinent to everyone"
