    "This is a brilliant class. It is an amazing step outside of the daily grind and into an exploration of the aesthetic world. Basically, I liked it.",
    "I appreciated the laid-back attitude and the mix of students from different disciplines. It was nice to be presented with so many varied forms of images and imagery\/iconography.",
    "To know more art works and know how they tell a story in different types.",
    "The guest lecturers were great and I love that we touched different topics outside of theatre - art, art history, architecture, illustration, color, etc. I loved it and I appreciate that Wendall really wants us to leave Yale having our own database of artists, etc to tap into.",
    "Great class. Extremely good for boosting creaivity",
    "Professor Harrington is a treasure. Her lectures are film are so full of vital history and important figures I could hardly write fast enough. I'm thankful for this class and the way it has exposed and shaped my artistic senses.",
    "The class is essentially a smorgasbord, which at times is totally fascinating and at other times falls a little flat. What was valuable? Well, I learned about several really interesting figures in the field that I didn't know about or wasn't well acquainted with before (Richard Pilbrow, as an example), and I appreciated having a class that didn't demand a massive amount of outside work. That might sound wimpy, but it's a NECESSITY here. To have a class, just every once in a while, that's about presence and absorption of the material but not necessarily about regurgitation or huge assignments. It lets our brains work in a different way and gives us a break from the massive amount of output we have to generate on a daily basis.",
    "All of the different lecturers that came to speak to the class. Schools tend to become very contained bubbles and it is quite refreshing to hear from people outside of it who do very different things."

    "It would be really great if Wendall could participate more\/instruct more. She was really great, and I got the sense that I could learn a lot from her. Since she was barely there (sometimes not at all, other times just to introduce the speaker), I felt like the class missed out on her. Overall I was disappointed with the class's speakers. I felt like they were often disorganized, unprepared, and even unknowledgable. Anne McCoy, for instance (I think that was her name) was full of mis-information (I happen to know a lot about some of the things she was discussing). Other speakers (like the graphic novel woman on the last day) seemed to have no idea how to give a lecture or presentation, and didn't even know what they were meant to be doing. Many other speakers even mentioned that they were unprepared. I'd say the best speaker, who was very informative as well as engaging, was the older British projection designer (I forget his name). If the whole class could be speakers like him, that would be great.",
    "More interaction with students would be nice",
    "I know it's because she's super cool and famous and always on the road doing her own thing, but it was a little weird to have a class taught by Wendall wherein Wendall hardly ever shows up, let alone teaches. I like her a lot and I was really excited about learning from her, but this was basically a class taught by Wendall's friends and associates. I wish she were in the classroom more. I also think this class is pretty unnecessary for third year directors. Or perhaps should be offered as an elective. It's basically a cultural literacy class, and it would make sense in our first year when we're getting opened up to a lot of new material. But as a third year I didn't really understand why I was taking it. I was familiar with almost all of the material, and what I wasn't familiar with was presented in such a random, scattershot way that I felt like, \"Okay, cool, but a couple of hours in a library could have done the same thing.\" What I actually appreciated most were the film\/art\/photography history segments -- but the woman who teaches the art history sections is REALLY not easy to listen to. This class made me want the directors to have an introduction to Film in our curriculum -- now THAT would be totally fascinating.",
    "I don't know if it's at all possible but getting the blurbs concerning the upcoming speakers a little earlier so we have a better idea who and when and could do some preliminary research on the visitors."

    "While I liked the low-key atmosphere, the gaggle of undergrads who were clearly taking the class because it was an easy credit, and who sat there doing other work on their computers and coming in late all the time, was very distracting.",
    "I may have missed the boat and there may be a list somewhere that I have not found but it'd be great to have links to all the things that were shown during this course (I am thinking of the Eastern European stop motion films in this instance) And it could very well be a student participatory list but I find myself wishing I had more to reference back. Not crucial but it could be nice"
