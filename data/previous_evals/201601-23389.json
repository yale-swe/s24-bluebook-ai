   "comments": [
    "This seminar provides a multifaceted look at some of the \"high-brow\" and \"low-brow\" musical cultures in 20th-century America, the strictly musical properties that went with them, and the cultural, racial, economic, and technological factors that affected them.",
    "This course gives an overview of music and scholarship in several areas that one is unlikely to explore (at least in a scholarly sense, at Yale) elsewhere in the program. As Jim says, it asks the question, \"what would it be like to be a scholar in X area?\" and provides some hands-on experience in the archive along the way. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Ives, the blues, or broadway scholarship, but also to anyone with less connection to these areas but who has limited experience working with archives and wants to get a feel for that process."

   "comments": [
    "See above.",
    "The archival experience was probably the most valuable aspect of the course in a general disciplinary sense, but the issues encountered in dealing with both modernism (Ives) and popular music (blues and Broadway) are ones that will remain at the center of a lot of disciplinary activity for the foreseeable future, and I expect my experience in this course will provide me with a lot of guidance in those areas as well.",
    "Definitely an entree for me into both blues\/early pop scholarship as well as early Broadway scholarship. I hope to follow up on one or both of those threads in the future!"
