   "comments": [
    "It is a great course if you are comfortable with understanding spanish, but have problems with grammar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for those who have good experience in spoken Spanish but who feel their grammar and writing need improvement. It's a really enjoyable class that moves at a comfortable pace.",
    "As a Latin-American Heritage student with an unstable footing in my native tongue, Spanish for Heritage Speakers was and open and nonjudgmental class for students of all levels to improve their grammatical skills and encourage complex conversation. It loosened my tongue and helped correct my errors in speaking and writing.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you want a fun class that you literally look forward to every week. The topics are so interesting and there's a lot of emphasis on culture, which is great.",
    "Yes, I can recommend this class for anyone who views learning Spanish as a chore. It is ok if you cannot write or speak fluently, but do not take this class if you cannot already understand\/comprehend Spanish.",
    "Take it! Especially if you are a native speaker and you cannot write or do grammar to save your life. You'll learn a lot.",
    "Spanish 132 is the place to go if you are (like me) one of those Latinos who didn't grow up speaking Spanish but grew up culturally Hispanic. Professor Alexandrov explains WHY certain spelling and grammatical rules apply to the language which can make all the difference in what a student retains. If you areLatino and want to be a better speaker of your own language, take this class. It's a very manageable (and fun) way to do it.",
    "Take it!! Alexandrov is a great teacher! She's very nice, intelligent, helpful, grades fairly, and gives less homework than most classes.This class is designed for people who need help with grammar, tenses, expanding vocabulary, and improving writing skills. You don't really analyze literature or read long texts -- main focus is on mastering the grammar.And it only meets three times a week!",
    "Totally take this class. Good professor who pushes you to learn a lot, while giving you a manageable workload.",
    "The greatest thing possible for a native speaker whose Spanish is rusty. You learn about Spanish grammar, watch a few movies (they're all wonderful) in Spanish, and the homework isn't too bad at all. Great course: my favorite this semester, and I suck at Spanish hehe.",
    "Excellent course. If you have a connection to a Spanish speaking country\/background, take this course! And make sure to take it with Prof. Alexandrov. She is an excellent instructor. Although, another great thing about this class is the group of students you get to work with.",
    "Take it. Classmates might be at a different level than you, but you can always negotiate something with Professor Alexandrov.",
    "The students in Span 132 probably speak and converse at a level higher than L5. However, other skills such as grammar, writing and academic comprehension are emphasized.",
    "Spanish 132 is very good for students who are familiar with the language in a first-hand experience, such as having the language spoken at home. A lot of the topics covered are familiar, but they provide an understanding that goes beyond \"Well, I say it this way because it sounds right.\""
