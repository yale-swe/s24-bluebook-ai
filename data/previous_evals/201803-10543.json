   "comments": [
    "I learned both about the art and science involved in producing well-created photographs. This course encouraged me to look at my world in a different way and more deeply appreciate the way that light interacts with objects and my surroundings.",
    "Essential camera\/photoshop techniques; a somewhat abridged history of photography; some yet-to-be-refined idea of what makes a good image; experience in how to critique other people's works and how to go about starting my own photography projects.",
    "I learned how to manually operate a camera, how to color correct, and what to think about when taking a picture",
    "I developed artistic skills and learned to see the world in a different light. I also learned shooting, photoshop, and printing skills."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very informative; very accepting and encouraging (in terms of stylistic preferences of individual students); a good introduction to fine art photography.",
    "The prompts for the projects were all incredibly interesting and forced you to go out and find interesting places to take photographs (this definitely becomes a challenge once you have completed a few projects!) We were also encouraged to take out a lot of photo books from Haas which I found to be a great resource. I think if we spent a little more time talking about how to dissect a photograph, I think our critiques would have been a little more helpful. I am still unsure of how to get the right shot, but I think the only answer to that is more practice and reading.",
    "I liked that this course was less about learning from books and more about taking photos and gaining experience. It also depended heavily on student critiques. It would have been helpful to get more concrete feedback from the instructor on how we were doing in the class, but I suppose not knowing our letter grade was freeing in its own way."

    "not supposed to be taken as a \"teach-me-how-to-use-camera\/photoshop-so-I can-post-nicer-photos\" class. If you want to learn camera techniques there are tons of online resources available. This course is more for people who want to approach photography as an art, with an emphasis on developing personal voice\/style in the medium.",
    "Yes I would, it was fun and challenging. The workload wasn't horrible if you didn't wait until the last second. The art school's printing lab having limited hours was not always ideal especially around finals period. I think there should be more high quality printers accessible on other parts of campus. Taking pictures is definitely a lot of fun, but if you are perfectionist like me, you make hate color correcting and printing.",
    "I would definitely recommend, even if you are a complete beginner at photography. This course is different form most at Yale, and will push you out of your comfort zone. It will help you develop your own artistic style and give you a deeper appreciation for photography as an art form."
