    "Good class, interesting readings. Definitely a survey course so sometimes you may wish you were going more into depth on specific thinkers (and a little too much skipping around locations and centuries) but the final paper gives you a great chance to do just that.",
    "Amazing class! Take it if you want to learn anything about the theological discourse throughout Islamic history. Places a lot of current Muslim debates in context.",
    "Frank Griffel is great, enjoys teaching and makes it easy to understand pretty difficult philosophical concepts. Would probably be best to have some sort of background in Islam before taking this class though, as a certain level of familiarity is assumed.",
    "Definitely take this if you have any interest in the subject. Even if you don't, it's very interesting and I'm sure you'll benefit from it.",
    "This was a very interesting class on the development of theology and philosophy in Islam. Sometimes I couldn't quite understand the reasoning, but overall I've really benefitted from this class.",
    "If you're a religious studies major, or want to choose a great elective TAKE IT! The course is extremely interesting, extremely well taught, and will teach you how to think about Islam and Religion differently. There is a lot of reading, but it's all relevant to the lectures. It's one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale."
