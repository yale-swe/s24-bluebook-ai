   "comments": [
    "If you want to engage deeply with agrarian - I would argue the forgotten - history of Africa, then this is a great course for you. No other courses offer this much on agrarian history.",
    "I would recommend this especially to students interested in approaching agrarian history from a somewhat interdisciplinary perspective.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that deals with the confluence of many different strands of life around agriculture. How race, class, gender, power, economics, ideology shape agriculture, and how agriculture in turn shapes them.I would recommend this to students interested in these topics. Otherwise, I would not.",
    "The class provides an overview of some of the critical issues in agrarian history of Africa from a range of narratives, case studies, and histories regarding the impact of the slave trade in Africa, colonialism, and modernization on agricultural practices. The class is very useful for students studying development issues, but who could use a stronger grasp of the role of agriculture in development discourse and practice.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It provides an in-depth review of themes in agrarian history and also a broad survey of several regions. There's also a lot of advice to pick up about historiographical trends of the last few years, so that's useful as well. The texts are extremely detailed, so it's up to the individual student to make the most of the course by taking detailed notes on each book. Fortunately we had a strong group of students and everyone had lots to contribute. One of the great benefits of this course is that it pulls in students from a wide range of schools and departments (everything from F&ES to the divinity school). This makes class discussion extremely interesting.",
    "History 849 is a good introduction to some of the themes that underlie Agrarian History in Africa. I would recommend the course if the student is interested in a broad exposure to the field.",
    "I definitely recommend the course to other students. Although the course focuses exclusively on Africa, broader theories of agrarian development are central to the course and would be advantageous for any student of agriculture, anthropology, development, environment, or history.",
    "I would highly recommend the class to historians interested in the nature of colonial regimes and ideologies."

   "comments": [
    "While I do not study history as a discipline, it allowed me explore a different lens in my study of Africa.",
    "this course was excellent background for understanding the contemporary development regime in Africa, especially regarding land use and agriculture",
    "In the International Relations program, I focus on development in Africa. I have never studied agricultural practices or agrarian history and this class was critical in allowing me to understand how important agriculture has been, not only in the lived experiences of Africans, but also in the construction of the field of development.",
    "Since I am focusing on Economic Development this course contributed to my understanding of the historical concept of development as it related to a specific region. As I had no background with Africa, this course significantly contributed to my understanding of this region.",
    "The course was central to my research and my future academic and professional goals. I was able to explore the robust agrarian history of Africa through focused studies that contribute significantly to the knowledge and understanding in the field. The review of literature and concepts on agrarian research in Africa will be fundamental to further study.",
    "This course helped me understand colonial ideas about agriculture and the environment interacted, often clashing, with local knowledge and practices. This is very relevant to my future teaching interests and dissertation work."
