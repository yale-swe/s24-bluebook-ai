   "comments": [
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class. It's a lot of work but the professors are extremely engaging. The class provides a solid overview of gene expression from DNA maintenance through protein degradation. It was more of a biochemistry\/molecular biology class than a genetics class though.",
    "I would recommend the course for a broad overview, especially for a person who had not seen any of the material before.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, it's required. If it wasn't, still yes, especially for those who haven't been exposed to much eukaryotic work.",
    "This course provides an excellent overview of key topics in the field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Even for people that have had most of the biology before it is still worthwhile to learn more techniques and gain a broader sense of the literature. The discussion sections were particularly helpful and all the professors and TAs did an exceptionally good job at facilitating discussion and teaching material relevant to the papers.",
    "It is a great survey of molecular biology, especially for those students who did not come from a biology background. I would recommend this course to other students. Just from the discussion sessions, one can learn a lot. Not to mention the great overview of currently known concepts\/facts in molecular biology.",
    "It is interesting to learn how things taught in textbooks were discovered. I would recommend this class to someonewho really wants to gain conceptual understanding in molecular biology to conduct research. Keep in mind that the work load is heavy.",
    "This course is an in-depth view of the fundamentals of eukaryotic molecular biology. You will learn a range of relevant topics in great detail. I do recommend this course to another student because it goes beyond the textbook knowledge of these topics and provides the student with a better understanding of the basics. It also provides opportunities each week for a thorough discussion of the topic at hand with TA's that are very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course to an undergrad but not to a graduate student.",
    "I will highly recommend this course to students who want to learn the methods and logic in eukaryotic biology."

   "comments": [
    "I started out in parasitology but may end up in a bacteria lab so this class might not be terribly useful to me in the end, but I am still very glad that I took it. It will at least provide an interesting comparison to prokaryotic molecular biology.",
    "Hopefully will find something useful in the lectures for my antithesis. Plenty of material, just need to understand the details and the more current knowledge in the field on some topics.",
    "Provided an excellent overview to key topics in eukaryotic biology.",
    "This course gave me the background I was missing when I entered graduate school. I think it will be extremely helpful, although most of it will not be directly relevant to my dissertation. It is a course every student looking to end up in the biological science should take (including chemistry, physics and biology students).",
    "I learned a lot of things in splicing, RNA export, translational control and protein quality control which are really essential for me, as a biologist, to understand current literature on biological topics.",
    "This is very helpful."
