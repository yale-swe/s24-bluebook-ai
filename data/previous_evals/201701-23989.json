    "I learned how to be a more effective organizer.",

    "Systematic understandings of power as they apply to activism. Ways to approach structures of power so as best to change them. The way structures of power at Yale and in New Haven work.",
    "I gained knowledge on the process of community organizing as well as a variety of tactics on how to community organize. I felt like this class gave me both theoretical and practical knowledge on organizing in New Haven and elsewhere, and this is something I appreciated."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Fascinating readings, hands-on learning through site visits with some of New Haven's most passionate organizers, and Professor Crumlish is a genuinely caring professor. You want him in your corner! Weaknesses: We could have used a little more communication about deadlines and requirements for assignements.",
    "I think the course could be improved by adding more structure and frameworks to differentiate types of organizing, discuss the implications and uses of each, and having students come away from the course with a framework for how to think about organizing and where they think they may fit in the field. Focusing more on readings and providing more space to discuss them might also help. Overall, phenomenal course!",
    "This is an excellent overview of organizing and its interaction with New Haven. The texts are stellar, and professor crumlish is very knowledgeable. It suffered a bit from a wide variety in knowledge about new haven--some students knew a lot already, and it kept the class a bit slow sometimes in establishing common knowledge. Overall, a very worthwhile class.",
    "Strenfrhs: the visits and visitors. All our most meaningful experiences came from them.",
    "Strengths: Ii thought the readings and discussions in the first half of the course were very interesting and helpful in engaging with the material. I especially liked that Professor Crumlish was able to share real-world experiences with the class. Weaknesses: While the site-visits were interesting, I think the course had too many. It was great to meet the different organizers and hear about their work, but I think it meant that the second half of the course lacked engagement with the readings and this detracted from the quality of the course. In the future I would like to see only 1-2 site visits rather than 4. -Also organization of assignments. The assignments were fine but a little more direction on them would be helpful."

    "!!! Take it !!! If you want to make a difference in your community and approach it thoughtfully, you need to learn from Professor Crumlish.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Peter Crumlish is a phenomenal professor, cares deeply about his students, and helped all of us learn how to better tackle social issues, enter communities we are not a part of, and organize. It was so exciting and insightful to go on multiple site visits with local community organizers in different New Haven neighborhoods. Anyone who wants to learn more about New Haven, more about urban politics, and honestly just more about how to be a good human. The readings, the professor, the site visits, and the other students are all phenomenal. Definitely take it if you get in!!!!!",
    "Peter Crumlish is so sweet, and it's a great way to learn in a kind of novel way about the structures of power at Yale and in New Haven. Some cool trips, and very cool people in the class who do very impressive things.",
    "If you are interested in learning more about community organizing or more about organizing in New Haven then I would strongly recommend this course."
