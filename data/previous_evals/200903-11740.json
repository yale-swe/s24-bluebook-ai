    "Yes. Czech 110 was great. Fast and Easy as KvK promotes",
    "Yes, to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "It is sooo much fun! Czech is the best language in the world",
    "good class. you learn another completely different language. although class meets everyday, its not boring and we have a lot of fun since its small.",
    "Definately recommend. Classes are made fun by a great teacher and the language itself is very useful and interesting.",
    "Take this course if you can and want. If you're just taking a language to complete your language requirement, this might be a good choice because you'll learn a lot about grammar and how language works. Even though you might not wind up speaking Czech with fluidity and ease, you might very well come out with more learning and knowledge than you would from another language course. The skills you'll develop in Elemntary Czech will help with any language you choose to study in the future."
