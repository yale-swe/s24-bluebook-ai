    "it felt disorganized, particularly at the beginning, and I received extremely little feedback on my progress, which i would have appreciated before writing my final",
    "- I liked the format of having students lead the discussion at the beginning, but I think there could be clearer guidelines as to expectations. It might also be nice if it were formalized that people bring in images or outside texts\/concepts to accompany what they are presenting, to make it feel more personalized and vivid. - I also think that the timing of the class could have been a little better managed, because often the slideshows at the end were too rushed. Maybe the class time could be equally divided into thirds, for student presentations, slideshow, and then discussion. - It might have been nice also to have more time to workshop papers as a group, and have people read each others papers and get feedback. Maybe there could be less reading responses, which were only so helpful, and then have an earlier draft deadline for the paper, so that people could look at their colleague's work and then respond to it for the last two or three weeks of class, or perhaps for the duration of the class after Spring Break. - All in all, I appreciated the energy, enthusiasm, positive attitude and warmth of both professors. I thought they created an atmosphere that was very conducive to learning and experimentation for a wide range of historians. I feel happy that I took the course.",
    "The topics covered are great, but the bibliography is way too big for each week. The in-class discussion is scattered as a result, because each student reads a few of the articles or books on the list for the week, meaning that everyone has read something different. Suggestion to improve the class: as hard as it is, limited the required reading to either one book or three articles each week. The syllabus can always include a recommended reading list for students who want to go deeper. The who class meeting should be three hours long rather than two. Make the first hour to hour and a half a lecture, given by one or both professors, about the topic. Then one or two students lead the discussion during the second half of the class drawing on the readings that all students read in common that week. This would make the class much more cohesive and engaging. We had an excellent crowd of intelligent people this semester! We just needed a little more structure in the discussions. It would also be nice to receive professor feedback on the written responses.",
    "Strengths - interesting topics, interdisciplinary, variation in students Weaknesses - discussions were difficult because everyone read different things, students leading discussion resulted in much unneeded info and time wasted, too much reading per week"
