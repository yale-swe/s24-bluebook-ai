    "Yes. Everyone should understand China today.",
    "This class sheds some light on a lot of important events in modern Chinese foreign policy, like the EP-3 plane crash or the 1999 Belgrade bombing, that I think many students have had minimal exposure to. It was eye-opening in terms of the determinants of foreign policy in authoritarian regimes. Class discussion was usually fairly engaging and the writing assignments very open-ended and easy to complete.",
    "A great class. Take it if your lucky to get in.",
    "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s International Relations provides an interesting look at China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving foreign policy and how U.S. policy makers are responding. The issues in the class are very current, although sometimes class discussions feel a little repetitive. But if you are interested in China, definitely worth taking.",
