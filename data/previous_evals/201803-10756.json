   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of new characters and grammar structures, as well as the basics of writing in literary Chinese.",
    "Through Professor Zhou's well designed curriculum, I was able to take my intermediate Mandarin language skill and rapidly expand knowledge of syntax and vocabulary. Topics in this course were interesting and thus encouraged students to go above required readings within textbook. The use of Quizlet in this course for learning vocabulary is really great and has helped me a lot.",
    "Through this course, I built from my foundations in China to expand my grammar and vocabulary to a more formal level. I was able to discuss about more complex topics such as marriage, economic development, and undocumented immigrants. I gained more confidence in my writing ability.",
    "This course taught me a wide range of new vocabulary, cultural knowledge, and have me a much better sense of Mandarin.",
    "This course has markedly improved my Chinese. What I really enjoyed was that we not only learned new vocabulary, but that the vocabulary was very relevant to real world topics and issues arising in China. The course was a language, philosophy, economics, and political science course, all in one. I came away feeling more confident in my ability to write in a literary style and more interested in current China. Additionally, since this is my first semester, I figured out how to study for exams.",
    "Deeper understanding of the Chinese language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Zhou Laoshi is definitely the best part of the coursehe's an amazing professor, very easy going, and invested in his students' success. One weakness of the course is that the textbook is somewhat dated, and a fair amount of the vocabulary is highly specific and therefore not hugely useful. Then again, in working towards fluency, all information is useful.",
    "A weakness is that I wish that there were some exercises in class geared to writing characters and to dictation of words\/knowing pinyin with tones of select terms. I honestly loved learning about the cultural pieces with Zhou Laoshi, and especially enjoyed when he would connect a linguistic piece to a larger part of Chinese culture. This class was full of these gems. I also liked the little component of class when we had to transcribe Traditional Characters () into Simplified Characters (). Because of this component of study, students had the ability to zero in on reading\/meaningfully recognizing the differences between Simplified and Traditional writing trends through close reading of texts with Traditional Characters. Depending on how heavily a student brushed up on these Traditional Character readings, he or she could possibly gain an extremely strong grasp on Traditional Characters, which is a great skill. I learned so many ways to transform simple sentences I had learned to full ideas that fully express my meaning. At the end of this semester, I feel able to express almost any idea I have with the help of a dictionary (if there are related vocabulary which I do not know) in decently constructed Chinese when communicating by writing. However, I do feel that my speaking has not improved to the extent that my writing and comprehension (listening and reading) have. Besides time spent with the TF in tutorial, there are few times when we are able to improve spoken ability. I suppose Language Tables are a good option, but speaking activities in class from time to time where Zhou Laoshi's could tweak our sentences to help us learn how to better to incorporate our vast knowledge of characters and structures to the spontaneity of real-time speech.",
    "Weaknesses: I think that the quizlet sets could be submitted three times, instead of four. Strengths: Clear organization and expectations, combination of assignments (from formal essays, to class presentations, and daily\/weekly worksheets).",
    "Strengths: fantastic teacher, interesting coursework, lots to learn Weaknesses: textbook has some vocabulary with limited applicability",
    "This course was pretty much perfect. It was very clearly organized, well-paced, the workload was present but manageable, the topics were all very interesting. I have a really difficult time finding any weaknesses with this course. If I could recommend one improvement, it would be that we do a few more additional readings outside the textbook.",
    "Very engaged instructor, slightly confusing syllabus format."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend, even only for Zhou Laoshi. Take a class with this professor if you can.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I felt like I learned so much in this class, and especially feel like this class helped put me over the hump of comprehension. For example, now I feel pretty confident to Surf the Web in Chinese, or watch YouTube videos in Chinese. The pace of learning definitely kept me on my feet, but it was not horrendous. I never really minded reading the class texts or doing homework because it always was interesting to learn more about the subjects and to better understand how to use these very effective sentence structures that effectively convey much meaning that I wasn't able to before convey.",
    "I 100% would recommend this course to another student. The textbook we use is very interesting, the class discussions are intriguing, and Professor Zhou does an excellent job organizing his course, so that the class expectations and routine is very clear from the beginning.",
    "Definitely! This was a fantastic course that continues to reinforce my interest in learning Chinese. Learned a lot, looking forward to continuing next semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student for reasons I've detailed in the answers I submitted above.",
    "Yes - China is the next frontier, highly recommend developing a deeper understanding of its language\/culture!",
    "Yes, it's a great Chinese course that manages to teach you higher level Chinese vocabulary and grammar in a way that is effective and sustainable. I walked out of that class actually remembering what I learned, as opposed to forgetting after the final."
