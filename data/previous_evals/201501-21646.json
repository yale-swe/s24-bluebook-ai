    "Any Yalie should try to take it and know how wood \/ metal \/ glass and the material world around us actually works and comes together!",
    "This is an amazing course and I highly recommend it, but I would try to enter it with some architectural modeling skills because you will be more proud of your final project if you do so.",
    "take it",
    "Excellent choice for senior spring and CR\/D.",
    "Such a fun class. Not much work apart from the final project and you actually learn A LOT. I would definitely recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in architecture. My only suggestion, don't wait till senior year like I did! I wish I had taken it sooner!",
    "Yes. Good add to your schedule if you don't mind spending a few hours in the fabrication lab. There's literally no workload outside of labs.",
    "YES! Take it! Tim is great, you get your hands dirty every week and the workload isn't that massive. One of those Yale courses that lets you do something different and enjoyable--great for both majors and non-majors.",
    "yes definitely recommend. not a lot of work during the semester just a final model at the end",
    "thought it was a great introductory course to architecture. Tim is a great professor and just a good guy. Learned alot and found class very enjoyable",
    "In studio courses, materials are limited to those made to make models. Tim's class gives you insight into the real qualities of materials and how they dictate design. Its a necessary supplement to the theory-heavy studio and history courses."
