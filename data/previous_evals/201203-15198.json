   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course because it helps solidify Spanish speaking skills and there was interesting readings and videos that opened my eyes up to Spanish culture.",
    "It is a boring, dull language class. Think of it as a means to an end. If you would like to gain a deeper level of fluency in Spanish, this is the class for you, but don't expect it to be a fun process. Much of the material does not feel very applicable to spoken Spanish and seems oriented to continuing classroom Spanish which is a shame.",
    "I think this course was definitely manageable in terms of work load and difficulty. It's good for reading some nice literature and polishing up on grammar.",
    "The course itself can be tedious at times; the syllabus calls for an excessive amount of busy work. That said, Oscar is a fantastic professor who is always willing to explain that tricky grammar rule and whose humor helps you concentrate every morning. If you must take L4 Spanish, try to take it with Oscar.",
    "I would recommend Spanish L4 as a class that will improve your Spanish level. However, it does meet 5 times a week so be prepared for the work. You should take this class only if you truly are interested in perfecting your Spanish skills.",
    "L2 but harder grammar rules and more work. I wouldn't take the class for funsies, but I would take it (with Oscar) if I needed the language credit.",
    "140 wasn't a ton of work, but gave me a chance to work even more towards fluency. oscar is awesome!",
    "Yes, it is a god course. Try to take it with Oscar if possible. He is great and relatively relaxed.",
    "I would recommend it to another student and I would reccomend that they take it with Oscar because he is really laid back with his students. There is daily homework though and that can be challenging to keep up with sometimes.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class with Professor Gonzalez unless you have a very good grammatically understanding of the Spanish language. He is very funny and was a nice person to be around, but he was not very helpful in terms of helping with teaching some of the grammatical aspects of Spanish that I did not understand. If you are assigned him, I would suggest that you find a tutor quickly if you think you will have any sort of troubles with the written assignments."
