   "comments": [
    "Interesting course. Lectures could be a little bit more exciting and well-organized but they were fine. Exams seemed a little bit all over the place, but, again, generally fine. Writing assignments were graded pretty easily.Take it if you need a relatively straightforward credit for the psych major. DON'T take it if you are just interested in the material---there are more interesting random intermediate psych lectures out there.",
    "This is pretty much what you would expect from an upper level psych course: the reading consists of journal articles and the lectures focus on research methodology. As is usual for social science classes, this course stresses the differences between correlative and causal relationships. That being said, Prof. Kim-Cohen covers some very interesting topics (race&IQ, homosexuality, religion, political persuasion...) and the readings (after the first module) are engaging. I would recommend this course to another student, but this isn't a must-take course by any means.",
    "This is a fun and interesting class about the nature\/nurture debate in psychology. The lectures are all very structured and well organized, which made studying a breeze. The exams are non-cumulative and only cover 4-5 lectures at a time (also no final!). Basically if you do the readings and go over the lecture slides you'll be fine. There are a few class debates which require little preparation time, and every once in a while there are one-minute papers which are mostly for attendance purposes.",
    "PSYC 306 is a survey course investigating the current body of scientific work regarding the \"nature-nurture\" debate, favoring the view that nature and nurture influence one another in gene-environment interactions. Course highlights were the discussions on potential genetic factors determining divergence in political orientation, sexual orientation, personality, religiosity, and IQ, as was the summation of the course with the relevant movie \"Gattaca.\" I would recommend the course to another student, especially one whose scientific interests bridge the fields of biology and psychology, and willing to get to the heart of bioethics in the study of eugenics, between-group differences, and legal use of \"nature-nurture\" research.",
    "Yes, this is a great class. It's really interesting, and covers the nature vs nurture debate (spoiler alert) it's a mix of both. The workload is manageable, there are 3 exams, one 7 page paper, and one mini 2 page paper.",
    "take it not as interesting as it sounds but still good",
    "The intersection between genetics and social environment on personality characteristics as well as psychopathology. Good and interesting class with not too much work.",
    "I would recommend the course. Prof. Kim-Cohen has a calm, soothing, voice that can lull you to sleep if you're not careful. But she's a great lecturer, the material in the course is fascinating, and there are a few opportunities for class interaction with the class debates. The guest lecturers were all very good also. There is no textbook, but there are lots of readings from scientific journals, some dense with jargon, others, much quicker and simpler reads. This is a great course for passingly biology\/genetics-inclined psych majors -- or really, anyone else.",
    "I would recommend this class. I think it's a better class for psych majors that non-majors, but it's certainly doable either way. There is a decent amount of reading though.",
    "It was definitely easy - I barely read the articles and I did very well. It wasn't the most interesting of classes though, and it definitely did not feel like a seminar - there were 40 people in the class.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "I'd recommend it. Everything was pretty straightforward. The exams were hard at times. You must keep up with the reading, or else it WILL catch up with you later.",
    "this is a great class if one is looking to go into greater depth in their understanding of many psychological disorders and personality traits. the professor works to break the monotony of long lectures by incorporating films, debates, and interesting projects.",
    "Yes, very interesting and in-depth exploration of genetics and psychology."
