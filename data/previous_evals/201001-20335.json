   "comments": [
    "HI 722 is a research course in the history of the United States in the nineteenth century. In the first part of the course, readings and classroom discussions focus on the nature of history and the historical profession. In the second part of the semester, students focus more intensively on researching and writing on a topic in this period. Besides the final paper, course work includes a short research proposal and a short paper defining history and its importance.I would recommend thiscourse to students looking to gain experience researching in this time period and for students interested in asking broad and challenging questions about what history is.",
    "This is a research seminar dealing with all historical topics from the 19th-century, a time period that Professor Blight frames with loose boundaries. It is a great opportunity to write a paper under good direction and with a number of other students who can aid in that exercise, and I would recommend it to anyone needing or wanting to pursue such a project.",
    "I definitely recommend this to anyone. It's a course that digs deep into the philosophy of why and how we write history. It's unlike most other standard research seminars in that respect."

   "comments": [
    "Through discussions of historical philosophers; the questions of self, subject, and problematique; historical 'sinners'; and a short paper assignment, provided me with the opportunity to reflect on what it is that historians do and why we do it. This course directly contributed to my dissertation project. For this course, I conducted the most intensive original research project I have ever conceived, which, by introducing me to new sources and new questions, narrowed my existing, broad topic both thematically and chronologically.",
    "The course provided an opportunity to explore potential research topics for the future and to gain experience researching in the 19th century, which made it extremely useful in helping to lay the research foundations for future work. More broadly, the course stimulated deep thinking about what history, and the historical profession, mean. Given that so much of our coursework assumes the profession and its goals as a given, it was helpful to step back and think about why historians do what they do, what it is that they study, and how they do it.",
    "The course has allowed me to draft what I see as an eventual chapter of my dissertation.",
    "This course prompted me to step back and consider the bigger picture of why I'm in grad school and why academic history matters to me. It was both a humbling and inspirational exercise to take on. The course got me to the next stage of my research and closer towards a dissertation topic. It has been crucial to helping me turn the next corner and to feel more confident doing so."
