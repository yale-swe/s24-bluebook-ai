   "comments": [
    "It is a great course on a very interesting topic that helps not only improved writing skills, but also understand the choices made by other authors. I would recommend it to every freshman students, but also be prepared to work a lot. But it is worth it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Heather is amazing -- enthusiastic and super intelligent. The workload isn't too bad, a few short articles to prepare for class and then weekly short assignments plus 4 papers. The class discussion is fascinating and the scholarly essays we read are equally great. Talking about children and childhood goes way further than you could ever expect and makes for a truly outstanding class. TAKE IT",
    "This class is not for the faint of heart. If you feel like you'd be uncomfortable dissecting the different aspects of childhood, it probably isn't for you. However, if you enjoy thinking critically and being highly analytical, you'll love this. Professor Klemann is fair and she does an amazing job of actually improving your writing. I felt like the assignments were very stimulating, and that the unique take on the topics was something very new and quite fascinating.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a very interesting course that we'll definitely get one thinking on the construct of society, adulthood and childhood.",
    "Yes, especially if you are uneasy about what college writing should like\/ are you ready to write 5-10 pages and how do you even write 5-10 pages of quality analysis.",
    "English 114 is great way to learn from the beginning how to write a college-level paper.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone who would like to improve their writing skills.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is willing to work hard and is committed to improving their writing skills. This class is a great introduction to college level writing and Professor Klemann makes good writing accessible. Though some people may find her a harsh grader, the improvement in writing skills is definitely worth it.",
    "A basic writing course to strengthen college essay writing skills. I would recommend it to someone who doesn't feel confident in their writing."
