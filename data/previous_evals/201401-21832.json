   "comments": [
    "Boring. Only take if you're into global health.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially for a HSHM major.",
    "Yep!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in learning how to analyze history but is also willing to put in the work to do so.",
    "YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS! Great intro to the history of global health! Take it!",
    "Take this class - it is completely different than anything I'd taken before but it has changed my goals for Yale and for life.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Seriously. It's amazing. It gives you an in-depth feel for the field of global health. If you are at all thinking about this field, you absolutely need to take the class to understand the ethical implications of health partnerships, programs, and campaigns. I think it should be a prerequisite for any student who wants to do research or go into the field, and it will express to you the socio-cultural and political context of medicine, disease, and science, in general. Even if you aren't a history person or science person, the fusion of the two in this class makes for a really edifying intellectual experience that will surely inform how you reflect on whatever field you choose to pursue at Yale.",
    "Take this course if you possibly can. When someone suggested it to me I was a bit skeptical. Global Health? It is more relevant both to history and to current times than you can imagine. The lectures are well prepared, interesting, and engaging. I always looked forward to them. If you have attended all the classes and done most of the readings you will have no trouble doing well in the midterm and final. There are also three short papers that I found enjoyable to write.",
    "I took as a BME student who needed a HU credit. Although there is more work than other HU classes (3 5-page essays, midterm, and final), I would recommend this class. It is interesting and focused on big ideas rather than memorizing tiny details of history.",
    "Yea! Great for all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds. I'm not pre-med or a history major, nor am I really interested in public health. The class is really approachable, and you learn LOTS of really cool stuff. It actually changed my perspective a lot about how I think about humanitarianism, philanthropy, and colonialism. Professor Radin is an engaging and fun lecturer, and the readings are (mostly) interesting. It's more work than a typical lecture \u2013 three small papers, a midterm, and a final. But it's all manageable, and the grading's not too tough.",
    "Take it! A walk through the history of global health from the time of the Columbian exchange to the present. Papers (3, 5 pages each) are interesting to write, as each student is assigned a different country and researches a health topic in that country in a different century for each paper. The course has a lot of assigned reading, however.",
    "If you have never did a course in global health, and want to expand your horizons, do it! it is a totally new field of study (unlike what you think it is), and is definitely worth giving it a try! Professor Radin is also very inspiring and helpful and the course is very fair! Midterms and finals only test on major concepts and examples taught! Papers could be difficult depending on which country you are assigned to. Nonetheless, it is a satisfaction when you complete it.",
    "Definitely recommend it if you're interested in global\/public health, and even if you aren't and just want a cool class that isn't too difficult to keep up with. The workload is fair and the professors and TAs are all cool.",
    "This is a good introductory course for people interested in global health who want a historical perspective, or for people who have no clue what global health is. It is not a good course for someone with an advanced background in global health -- you will find a lot of the material overly simplistic \/ 'fluffy.' However, it will teach you to be more critical of global health interventions and motives of various global health actors. The class is easy enough, but has a lot of reading, 3 essays, a midterm, AND a final.",
    "It is a decent HU if you need one. It's not as easy as what everyone says though. The exams are pretty easy, but the whole class is designed off of such broad themes that it makes it really difficult to write some of the essay questions because you feel like you're just stating things that are obvious. The papers are graded pretty harshly.",
    "Great class. Highly recommend, interesting mix of history and modern day issues. Definitely take if you're at all interested in health. I really liked how you got assigned a country and then wrote three papers on it throughout the semester. Prof. Radin is a great professor and an engaging lecturer who made the class very enjoyable.",
    "Reasonable workload (although LOTS of reading), Prof Radin is awesome, and interesting material!",
    "Historical Perspectives on Global Health is a fantastic course! Take it! You will come away with a much greater understanding of the intricacies of global health, from the 17th century (approximately) onward. The course is not overwhelming in work load, with only three five page papers, one midterm and one final. Professor Radin is fabulous, and her lectures are well-organized and engaging. I always came away from class satisfied that the 50 minutes were well-spent.",
    "I recommend you to take this course, but to respect the rigor. It is not a gut.",
    "A survey course of the history of Global Health as an idea. Focus initially falls on individual diseases and national responses, and later turns towards broader themes such as global cooperation, philanthropy, and consumerism.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class. I thought the subject matter would interesting, but it wasn't. The lectures were poorly organized and jumped around between time periods. In addition, the essay grading was very subjective and because of the general topics, it varied wildly from TA to TA because of their different standards and preferences. That said, the midterm and final exams were very fair.",
    "I would extremely recommend this class to any fellow student as it engages so many factors of history and the field of global health and aid.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. you won't regret it. Great for any type of student, no matter what background you come from. You'll get great breadth over the course, but good depth from your assigned country. Very manageable workload: 3 5-page papers, 1 midterm, 1 final exam, and weekly readings.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this class. Professor Radin is an angel descended from heaven to bestow her history knowledge upon us undergraduates. By far my favorite class at Yale so far and I highly, highly recommend.",
    "If you are interested in health, this is a really good class. It goes into the history of global health starting as far back as the 13th century. Professor Radin is a great lecturer! The papers are not too bad, and the reading is manageable if you budget your time well.",
    "Yes, this is a great class, and it will make you much more effective at helping others. The paper and the final are a bit much, but as long as remembered, not a huge deal. This class should be taken by anyone going into a healthcare, medicine, humanitarian, global affairs type career, since it is applicable to all of them!",
    "This is a great overview course! I found many of the lectures to be pretty dry, but the subject matter overall was fascinating, and the workload is reasonable. Every student is assigned a different country that you research all semester, and it is interesting to get to learn a lot about the health issues in your country and those of the people in your section.",
    "YES. Take it! Very informative and useful and makes you think a lot about humanitarianism and the repercussions that \"charity\" can have all around the world. Makes you think a lot and also exposes you to much uncommon, but very important history.",
    "I am a bio major and I found the historical aspect of medicine to be fascinating. The workload is manageable and the lectures memorable. Take the class!",
    "HLTH 280 is a good overview of the evolution of global health. It had three papers, a midterm, and a final exam (with the last paper and final exam happening quite near each other). Sometimes the lectures felt hard to follow because Professor Radin speaks really quickly, so I would say jotting down one main idea for each bullet point would be helpful. I would recommend this to another student, but with the caveat that he\/she must be prepared to do as much of the reading as possible, especially during the second half of the semester when motivation tends to run lower. Otherwise, the class just won't be as rewarding as it could be.",
    "Sure. Not too bad for a humanities credit.",
    "I don\u2019t think I would recommend this class to someone else. It does add some interesting perspective on how the field of global health developed but I believe that you can get a better experience and overview taking a different history course and a more advanced public health course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in science, medicine, global health, or anything history related. The material is very interesting and really gets you thinking critically about global health interventions. However, if you go into this class expecting in depth analysis about the different historical periods of global health, you will not get this as the breadth of material limits the depth. I would still encourage someone interested in this subject to take this course especially as an introduction to global health.",
    "Good class, thorough review of the history of global health. Not related to my major but I'm glad I took it, otherwise I would never learn this stuff. Highly recommended!",
    "If you have even a passing interest in global health, definitely take it! Joanna Radin is fabulous -- among the best lecturers I've had at Yale. There are three five-page papers plus a midterm and a final. Her exams were not difficult at all -- the IDs were drawn almost completely from the lecture slides, so you didn't even absolutely need to do the readings to do well.",
    "Take it! super interesting, tests are fair, papers can be interesting to do",
    "Very interesting history class and students should definitely take it!",
    "Take it!!! Great lectures!",
    "I recommend this class if you are really interested in global health or doing service abroad. I never realized global health efforts could be so complex, so it was a great class for me. The three essays can be easy or hard depending on which TA you get. The exams are pretty easy, and the lectures are really interesting.",
    "HSHM 212 is a great course, looking at different epidemics throughout the past several centuries. I would highly recommend this course as youcome out knowing a lot and with a different lens of how to view the future.",
    "Joanna Radin is really an amazing lecturer, and at the end of the course, I felt like I had learned a ton of really interesting things. I never thought that a history of global health course would really be applicable, but I realize that what I learned is really applicable, especially as a student going into a health profession. The workload throughout was fairly manageable - there were a ton of readings, but it's not hard to get away without doing them. Your experience will definitely vary depending on what your TA is like. Mine was a very fair grader and also very kind and helpful. The three papers are not too difficult but they are more time-consuming than I thought they would be because of the amount of outside research required. The midterm and final were not too difficult although they definitely required a decent amount of studying. Overall, a good humanities credit but definitely not a gut.",
    "A good course, but not a great one. The first half of the course provides a great background for thinking historically on global health, and the second half, while not quite as strong, looks critically at things like the WHO and NGO interventions. What I gained from this course intellectually was directly related to the amount I took the readings seriously, which was a shame. This is because while Professor Radin is a kind and helpful professor, her lectures were often pretty simplistic (due, I think, to the many non-majors and underclassmen in the class).",
    "If you have even the vaguest interest in what \"global health\" means or where it comes from, take this class!! You will learn so much and enjoy it immensely, because the Prof. is incredible, lectures are thematically and chronologically organized, and the workload\/grading system is very fair. The three five-page research papers are actually pretty enjoyable to research and write, and it's nice to have a final grade that is distributed over so many different assignments\/grades. The reading load is heavy but if some of the documents you only get to skim, you will be fine. I STRONGLY recommend this class.",
    "Three essays a midterm and a final is a bit ridiculous to me",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "HSHM 212 01 is a highlights-of-style survey course on global health. I would recommend this class to another student if they have never taken a medical history course because much of the information covered will have been covered in other medical history classes. If you are an HSHM major looking for a meaty lecture course, I would not recommend this class.",
    "If you are interested in global health, but have only taken HLTH 230 or something like it, or have not done anything with history of health, take it. Absolutely. It will give you a great survey of health over time, and will help you think about the biggest and hardest questions in the field. If you are an HSHM major focusing on health\/medicine like me, take it with caution. I had taken or was taking Epidemics in Global Perspective, HLTH 230 with Skolnik, Public Health in America, and The Global Crisis of Malaria with Frank Snowden. With that background, the lectures in the class were pretty repetitive. The reading list, however, was fantastic, so if you have enough time to actually do the readings (~100 pages\/week, I would guess) and do them well, then I would do it. If you don't, try for something else. Finally, Radin is different from other history profs as she has very clear learning objectives aside from just learning the history. She wants you to understand the issues (ethical, political, humanitarian, etc.) that surround global health that are still relevant today.",
    "For this class you are randomly assigned a country and you have to focus all three of your papers on that country's health problem or situation. I didn't like this constraint. It was especially hard for many of us who got countries that many people had not already written about. It meant some of us had to be extra creative with the few references available to produce our papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for any student.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it presents an overview of lot of interesting historical information that students can choose to explore in more detail if interested. The workload can be heavy at times, but is useful in applying the historical information to present global health issues.",
    "Global health is incredibly important to everyone, regardless of your major. That said, there may be a better course to learn about it -- while this class's lectures are generally interesting, the country assignment can be a huge headache if you are assigned to an obscure country (at the beginning of the term, you're randomly assigned a country to write three papers on). Also, the class has WAY too much busy work for an intro history course: three five-page papers, a midterm, AND a final!",
    "It was a great class. Definitely take it!",
    "Yes! very good, interesting topics, good presentation by Radin, not too much work besides the essay, easy tests, you can skim the readings to get by.",
    "This course is incredible. I would recommend this to any prospective HSHM major, or anyone who is just interested in global\/public health.",
    "This was a basic history course on the history of global and public health. The lectures were interesting for the most part however they became repetitive near the end of the semester. You have a midterm, final, and three essays that all focus on your assigned country. It was really interesting to focus in depth on the public health of one country however after a while researching for the same country started to become monotonous. Overall, it was a good course with interesting readings.",
    "HIST 146 is a fun class that is bent around the idea that in order to make wise decisions now, we have to understand why certain decisions were made in the past. It focuses on a mix of things such as the origin of quarantine, pharma-philanthropy, and....Bill Gates. I would recommend this class though it feels like the last half of the semester is less organized than the first half. Make sure to pick a country that you are actually interested about; then the papers are not too bad to write.",
    "Very broad overview of global health since in the 1500s. Interesting, but again, broad.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. We learn about the human relationship with disease and society, both in the past and in the future. It is a very solid first HSHM class, whilst also suitable for anyone.",
    "I would recommend the class - it provides a broad and analytical view of the history of global health.",
    "A decent overview course of public health that's heavier on the history than the science.",
    "It is an incredible first approach to understanding History of Science and History of Medicine. It has allowed me to see current day healthcare structures in a new light. Definitely recommend the class to people who are interested in understanding the social and historical background for today's issues in health.",
    "This is a good survey course of Global Health. It won't give you specifics and policy aspect like prof Skolnik's courses, but rather ties all these concept together in the light of history. It provided me with a really interesting perspective!",
    "Though this course was an informative introduction to global health history for a newcomer like myself, I felt as though the class didn't live up to its hype. Perhaps because of the larger class size, or perhaps because of the fact that Professor Radin was sick for half of the semester, the class seemed to lack cohesion and never developed a focused guiding theme. The topics we covered didn't seem to have much in common, and we tended to jump around a lot abruptly. I got the sense that the course was guided more by chronological events than by any specific thesis or question. This was disappointing because it left me feeling like I still didn't have a very deep understanding of global health history at the end of the semester. The paper writing in the course is both good and bad. You have to write 3 separate 5-page papers on a country assigned to you, each paper dealing with a health topic from a different time period. The papers are good because they will give you a pretty good grasp of the health history of a specific country in the world, and as a result, you'll be able to talk about that country at a pretty sophisticated and exciting level. Unfortunately, the grading is hit-or-miss depending on your TF (you should be comfortable with the idea that you won't be able to estimate final grade until after the final exam). Information on some countries is also extremely hard to find, especially when you only speak English and are looking for, say, precolonial data on malaria in sub-saharan Africa.",
    "I would NOT recommend this to another student... unless they really like social studies-, history-, and humanities-type courses. I thought, coming in, that this would be a good way for a Mech. Eng. major to get a humanities credit. It was not. There is a lot of reading each week, the essays are hard write, and the lectures are hard to take notes on. This course was no fun at all.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! Very enjoyable, with information that everyone should know (people interested in public health, health professions, even politics.)",
    "It's a decent class. There are three 5pg papers which are meant to cover the health issues of a specific modern country within three different centuries. The hardest part of these assignments is finding sources for the three very short papers, which gets easier as you approach the modern era (also, that difficulty depends on which country you're assigned)",
    "Take this class if you want to get a broad -- yet thorough -- perspective of global health initiatives since they become possible in colonial times. This class covers a wide array of material, and the subject matter is intersectional enough so that students with almost any major will be able to apply their intellectual interests to the material. Professor Radin is amazing, and makes the lectures interesting and fun.",
    "This is a good course on the progression of global health. The course spans from roughly the early 1600s to the present. If you have taken a public health course before much of the information and themes (mainly in the first half) will seem like review. There is one in class midterm and a final. Grades are based on the two tests, 3 five-page essays, and section participation."
