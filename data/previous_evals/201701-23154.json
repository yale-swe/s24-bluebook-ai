   "comments": [
    "This semester, I think, was when I really learned how to write a solid philosophy paper. Obviously, we also learned about a wide group of modern philosophers, how they interacted with one another, and about the possibility of people turning into horses.",
    "I learned of course a good bit about philosophy and prominent authors. More generally, the course is a good introduction to how to structure sound arguments.",
    "This course allowed me to develop a framework for understanding the major thoughts and movements of modern philosophy. It also honed my essay writing skills in philosophy.",
    "This class helped me break down arguments and learn different philosophies and schools of thought.",
    "I learned how to interpret the arguments of major modern philosophers and then analyze these arguments in writing. I have learned how to write focused, analytical, in-depth papers that tackle a small portion of the text. I've learned to better voice my thoughts in a seminar-based setting and discuss philosophical texts with my classmates.",
    "I learned a lot, of course, about western philosophy from Descartes onwards. But even more than that, I learned how to approach an extremely difficult text and engage with it.",
    "I learned some of the central ideas and arguments of some of the central Western philosophers (from Descartes to Murdoch). Some of the things we discussed included: the self, the mind-body problem, sense-certainty, God, free will, love, reason, etc. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper, how to evaluate an argument, and how to compare claims across different philosophers.",
    "Many. 1- I learned how to isolate an author's argument from a dense amount of reading. 2-I learned how to express my ideas better through writing. 3-I became more confident in my ideas. 4-I learned how to study for exams (make a story and compare to each other) 5-I learned that there is no RIGHT philosophy, and honed my own personal beliefs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Presents a cohesive narrative of philosophers. Challenges you to write and think about the world around you: metaphysically, epistemologically, and ethically. Weaknesses: While the efforts to improve diversity are appreciated, I thought that, for example, Douglass could have been handled better than he was.",
    "I really liked that Douglass was on the syllabus this year and hope his work will stay as part of the course. Otherwise, I would say that the lectures could be better utilized if they made a case or argument based off the week's reading, rather than just summarizing the important passages we've already read.",
    "This course did a fantastic job in creating the framework for one to understand modern philosophy. I liked how we are able to engage with the works in section, but also able to hear the interpretations of world-renowned scholars at lecture.",
    "Strengths: Learn how philosophers are in conversation with each other and how each builds and analyzes the others' works. Weaknesses: the volume of reading can make it hard to completely synthesize each philosopher's argument. If they could just cut a bit in the Hume-Kant-Hegel area especially it would be easier, but considering how important they are I understand the struggle.",
    "This course allows students to have a basic understanding of the major philosophers in modern philosophy. It offers an equal balance between metaphysical philosophy and ethics-based philosophy. However, it does not give a look into other areas of philosophy that Yale has to offer. This course does not provide an accurate depiction of what the philosophy major has to offer, but rather has a more narrow scope. This can cause students who are genuinely interested in philosophy to shy away from the major because they have had an unrepresentative experience with philosophy based only on DS philosophy. This course has definitely helped students improve their writing skills in philosophy. However, because there is so much diversity among the professors who teach this course on what a philosophy paper should look like, some students are still left not knowing how to write a philosophy paper. Though there was a definite shift from first semester on how to write a philosophy paper, the instructions were still not clear among all the professors on how to write a philosophy paper this semester. As is a problem with Directed Studies as a whole, there is no standardized method or consensus on what a philosophy paper should look like, or even what the main points each student should learn from the texts we read. This can be a problem when the students all receive the same final, but the final was fair in that it offered a choice from multiple questions the students could answer. The way that a seminar should be conducted in philosophy differs among the professors that teach this course, some believing more in student engagement and others resorting to a quasi-lecture format. The balance between these two forms of teaching can be difficult to assess especially when dealing with incredibly challenging philosophers. However, a seminar should be primarily for student thought and engagement.",
    "The course moved very quickly, which was difficult, but Elizabeth made us all feel like it was manageable.",
    "The course provides a solid introduction to some of the noteworthy developments in Western philosophy ( from Descartes to Murdoch). At times, the reading can feel very rushed, but that can be said of all DS classes. I think that the syllabus distributes the amount of time spent on each philosopher fairly well - 3 weeks of Kant might seem overwhelming, but I'm glad we did it, and likewise for the 2 weeks on Descartes. Discussion sections (especially with Professor Elizabeth Miller) help to solidify understanding, open up new questions, and draw connections to previous works on the syllabus. The lectures are amazing (clarifying and interesting in their own right) and I think, are an underrated aspect of DS.",
    "This is an awesome course, a negative is that we do A LOT so it can be hard to really understand and internalize many of the philosophers in such a short amount of time. I understand though, that the ability to view many different perspectives is also a benefit."

    "DS is a great program.",
    "Would definitely recommend spring semester philosophy for anyone who even remotely enjoyed fall semester philosophy.",
    "For sure; particularly if you can get section with Prof. Elizabeth Miller.",
    "Yes! Take DS if you are at all interested in understanding the trend and root of western thought. You will develop an intellectual framework that will allow you to excel in any other field. Most importantly, engaging with the thinkers of DS will cause you to live and appreciate life in a new way. Philosophy in particular will allow you to appreciate the connection between our minds and reality in a new way.",
    "As a whole, Philosophy was my least favorite part of DS",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in philosophy, but would warn them that this course does not provide a representative portrait of the other courses in the philosophy department. Though this course gives an overview of major modern philosophers, this is only a narrow scope of philosophy at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Section adds so much to texts that are already extremely engaging.",
    "Yes. It provides a good introduction to modern philosophy, and teaches you both how to engage with a difficult text and write a good philosophy paper.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks they might be interested in philosophy or intellectual thought generally. I would also recommend this course to anyone who is interested in DS, but worried about the philosophy tract. The skills you learn in philosophy are relevant to any discipline that requires you to think critically, or construct an argument. Taking philosophy as part of DS also enables you to see how philosophy has informed literature and political theory - which a perspective that can make philosophy more interesting, even if its not your primary interest. This course might not be the best fit for students who know at the start of freshman year that they want to study philosophy. For those students, one or two philosophy courses which emphasize depth over breadth might be more appealing.",
    "Absolutely!"
