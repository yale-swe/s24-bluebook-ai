   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to almost any student (great for pre-meds that need HU credit!). Such a great class on public health in a historical context and very manageable workload. The professor also helps make the class.",
    "It's a very interesting topic, and it makes you consider American and World history through a new lens. It also touches many interesting cultural, social and ethical themes from across many disciplines. I would recommend it- it is a lot of reading each week and a reading response each week, plus a take home midterm, paper and final but it's manageable and still pretty chill. Lectures can sometimes be dull though (and they are all online so you don't really have to show up all the time). A pretty chill 5th class. And Professor Snowden really knows his stuff\/has done some awesome work in the field! And he really cares",
    "This is a great class. The reading can be a little overwhelming, but you can usually get away with just reading part of the books. I would definitely recommend the class if it is a topic you are interested in.",
    "This is a very in-depth course on history of epidemics. Having taken this class and Prof. Radin's, I MUCH preferred this one -- it felt much more advanced, whereas Prof. Radin's is a bit simplistic \/ felt less college-level. Professor Snowden is one of the most knowledgeable, kind professors I've ever had. He is an expert in this field and it shows. His lectures may seem to be a bit dry at first, but stick with it -- you will learn more from them than you will in almost any other lecture. Also, he is a great storyteller, and it is with this style that he teaches the class. The reading load is a bit heavy but you don't necessarily need to do all of it (1 book + 1 reading response per week), and there is a take-home midterm, a final 7 page paper, and a final.",
    "I would recommend this class. Professor Snowden is a dynamic lecturer, and the subject of epidemic diseases is fascinating if you have any interest in history.",
    "Excellent class, for sure take it! Really interesting material, great readings, and not too much work (relatively laid-back reading responses, a take home midterm, short final paper, and a final). Professor Snowden was also wonderful--a clear lecturer who cares about the material and the students. Definitely highly recommended.",
    "This course is beautiful. This is some of the most interesting material there is. It was by far my favorite course of the semester. If you for even a second have an inkling towards taking this course, do it! It covers a wide range of historical time and hits on all the major epidemics afflicting the West during that time. I found the reading incredibly interesting, and although it was a bit much in terms of page count, I was able to read most of it. I didn't mind that the lectures were all given verbatim; it lends a high level of polish to the presentation. I also loved the little anecdotes Professor Snowden was able to provide from his own experience as a historian doing research on epidemic diseases. I will be an MD-PhD student next year, and I found this historical and social perspective of disease absolutely crucial; I plan to specialize in infectious diseases in both my clinical practice and research, which is one reason why I took the class. You will be glad you took the class and gained this precious knowledge.",
    "I would recommend it! I would say that it is a lot of work - especially if one actually reads the book due every week, which I did; but it is worth it and you leave the class feeling much more knowledgable.",
    "You basically get to learn about a lot of different kinds of very interesting diseases: the etiology, epidemiology, symptomatology and social impact. It is highly focused on the impact that these epidemics had on society and on medical innovation: from miasmatism to the sanitary movement to the germ theory of disease. Definitely take it if you are interested in public health!",
    "Take this class. It's really interesting, Prof. Snowden is a really sweet guy, and the workload isn't too bad. There is a one page reading response every week, a take home midterm, a final, and a final 6-8 page paper. The readings are pretty interesting so the responses aren't bad. Even if you're not really into history, it's a good class that doesn't require a ton of background knowledge, and you learn a lot about major epidemic diseases that you probably haven't heard before. Definitely definitely worth taking.",
    "I would recommend Epidemics if you are interested in disease and\/or its social causes and effects. Otherwise, don't take it. Also, if you mind reading a book a week (or are bad at skimming), don't take it. The grading is relatively easy but it's definitely not a gut given the amount of work you have to do in order to prove your comprehension of the material to your TAs.",
    "Lots of readings! Only recommend if you are interested in the material. Lectures are interesting.",
    "HSHM 235 went into the major epidemics since 1600 of western societies. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was interesting and the lectures were easy to follow. Also the work load was never too much and it kept you engaged.",
    "Excellent history course for those interested in health, disease, and medical phenomena like the Black Plague. It's a book a week with a two-page reading response (which are extremely helpful, actually, and worth your time), plus a take-home midterm, short paper, and final. Not a fifth class by any means, but absolutely one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale. Snowden has fascinating insights about the role of epidemic disease in history (particularly malaria and cholera) and makes a very compelling case for the importance of studying disease and public health in a historical context.",
    "This is a class that you should take if you are a student interested in medicine, majoring in history, or if you want to experience one of Yale's unique, engaging humanities courses. The workload is manageable, Professor Snowden's lectures are engaging, and the grading is fair.",
    "I recommend this class to everyone.",
    "Yes, yes, if you love history or medicine or the history of medicine, please take this class! And even if you don't, at least consider shopping it. There's just so much that you can gain from it.",
    "Take this class!! It was a wonderful presentation of all of the major epidemics since the 1600s, and Professor Snowden is a clear lecturer. The reading was heavy and at times a bit dense, but overall the things we studied were very interesting and the curriculum was arranged in a logical and organized manner.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you have the time.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student because it was a class where I enjoyed going to lecture and learned a lot.",
    "very fun class. the material was extremely interesting.",
    "Epidemics is an excellent course, and you'll definitely learn a lot. Snowden is great and his lectures will never bore you. The course, however, is a lot of work with a book a week and a reading response. It's manageable but it definitely takes up a lot of time. If you're HSHM, you have to take this course at some point!",
    "Epidemics is great! I loved the class and Professor Snowden is amazing. There is a lot of reading though (about a book a week), and there is a final paper as well as a final. But everything is completely manageable.",
    "I was a bit surprised by how much I enjoyed this class! We learned a lot about different diseases and public responses to them, and the lectures were very interesting (complete with ppt visuals!) the reading load was also manageable, even if the weekly reading responses were not super fun-",
    "A very solid HSHM lecture. Seems a bit dry at first, but the information is very interesting and engaging. Not too much work. I recommend it.",
    "Great class. It's an interesting history course that covers a wide time period so it's always new stuff. Not a huge workload.",
    "I would highly recommend this course - it was very interesting, and had a great teaching staff.",
    "Epidemics is a wonderful class that anyone interested in medicine or public health (or just disease history more broadly) should take. It is made even better when taken in parallel with Joanna Radin's 'Historical Perspectives on Global Health.' The workload for Epidemics can get heavy at times, with about a book per week and a 500-word essay-style reading response (not your typical free thought reading response) for many, but not all, of the weeks. But the material is very interesting, and Professor Snowden is great.",
    "I would definitely recommend HIST 234 to a student who is willing to complete a lot of weekly work. There were weekly readings and reading responses which can be difficult to stay on top of. Otherwise, I learned a lot in this course.",
    "Definitely take it even if not HSHM major. One of the best courses i've taken at yale in hshm, and I've taken many, trust me.",
    "Take it, it's interesting and engaging and a topic that doesn't get covered a lot.",
    "I'm a science major and found this class to be a really interesting humanities credit. There is a lot of reading, but you don't necessarily have to read the entire book to write the weekly reading responses. Your grade is based on reading responses, participation in section, a take-home midterm, a 5-7 page final paper, and a written final. Professor Snowden's lectures, while not particularly well organized, were interesting and the class was definitely worthwhile!",
    "HSHM 235 seems more interesting than it really is. Take it Credit\/D if you really want to learn about epidemics, but I felt like it was too rehearsed and not nearly as engaging as I wanted it to be. Also, the reading is super heavy at a book a week, which did not fit in well with my busy schedule. Take at your own risk.",
    "An amazing overview course discussing the impact of major epidemic diseases (including bubonic plague, smallpox, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV\/AIDS, etc.) on modern history. Professor Snowden is a wonderful instructor who is a true expert in his field, and he frequently draws upon his career experiences to enrich his lectures. The course has something for everyone\u2014from pre-meds to historians. The assigned reading can get to be a bit overwhelming, as an average of one book is assigned per week, but it usually isn't necessary to read the entire book to be able to participate and do well in section. Other than that, the workload is manageable (a take-home midterm, a final paper, a final, and a few one-page reading responses) and the class is very enjoyable on the whole. I would highly recommend this course to HSHM majors and non-majors alike."
