    "I learned many different ways that nuclear physics is used in modern research. There was a more thorough coverage than the nuclear physics course I took in undergrad.",
    "I felt that I got a lot of good experience in using nuclear physics in the context of its applications. I think this structure is preferable to having a detailed class on just nuclear structure, as I think the applications of nuclear physics is of a much wider interest among the students.",
    "I think having the presentation was good for me in particular. Giving many presentations is something that I anticipate in the the future for which I am, perhaps, the least prepared."

    "Having a variety of guest lectures was a great way to cover the breadth of nuclear physics.",
    "Again, I think the focus on the applications of nuclear physics is a strength. Nothing comes to mind that I would change.",
    "I really liked having the number of guest lectures for topical introduction to a variety of materials.",
    "Okay sorry for only giving a long form response to this question, Yale's sis just deleted all of my answers, I'll just leave the meaningful stuff here. One of my constructive criticisms is that the organization of the class felt scattered. It often felt like we only scratch the surface of a topic, then eventually come back to it in another pass and scratch the surface sightly deeper. I think that the textbook, Basdevant, is partially to blame. I am not quite sure of what would be better, but I think it would be a good idea to try experimenting with a better order. Personally I am not a big fan of using lecture slides. I think they have great use in conveying a lot of information in a short amount of time, but they don't facilitate developing an understanding of the material. I was always appreciative of the times when you used the chalk board. Perhaps that is just my style of learning."

    "It was a great overview of nuclear physics. If experimental nuclear physics is helpful for your work, this will be a useful course",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is an experimentalist whose research involves elements of nuclear physics. I wouldn't recommend it to a nuclear theorist, as they probably know most of what is to be covered.",
    "Yes, I think that this course is a good topical introduction to nuclear physics."
