   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course: it combines the analytic focus of most (or many) courses taught at Yale with a little introspection. Freud's psychoanalytic framework offers a worthy alternative to, say, cultural studies, for probing into the atavistic foundations of human existence.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. While I have a vested interest in history of psychology and especially Freud, I think anything taught by Professor Kronman would be amazing.",
    "I know what you're thinking: a whole class on Freud? The guy who thought that we all want to bed our moms and that girls all wish they had a penis? Yes, this is that guy, and you'd be a fool not to take advantage of the opportunity to study him with Professor Kronman for a semester. Like it or not, we are all Freudians. While the details of his theories may have been debunked, his basic contribution to our understanding of ourselves, the notion of the unconscious, is so deeply engrained in the popular consciousness that most of us talk in Freudian terms without even realizing it. Freud, perhaps more than any other 20th-century thinker, changed the way we think about ourselves. In this class, you'll dig deep into Freud's writings, and you'll do so under the guidance of Professor Kronman, who is that rare kind of teacher who's passion for the material is utterly infectious. He not only ensures a very high quality of class discussion, but also makes it clear that what we're doing in the classroom matters: not just for intellectual improvement, but for the way we live our lives and where we choose to look for meaning and happiness. I often left discussions feeling deeply moved, and I only wish there had been more moments like that in Yale classrooms.",
    "Highly recommend. Professor Kronman is a true gem - seize any opportunity you have to study with him! Also the Freud readings are very interesting - they range the spectrum of enjoyably straightforward to impossibly complex. Still, with Professor Kronman's help, all were manageable for me even though I am a cognitive science major. This was a great course to finish off my senior spring.",
    "It's a seminar on Freud, pretty straight-forward. You should certainly take it.",
    "HUMS 464 is one of Yale's most extraordinary courses, that provides all students with a rich overview of Freud's seminal works, and one that engages the student in topics of self knowledge and human happiness."
