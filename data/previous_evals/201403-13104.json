   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. It's a great way to get your writing up to parr, and the intimate feel is nice. However, if you are a confident writer, I would recommend a high level class.",
    "Take this if you need the writing credit or just want to take an english class. If you find a section topic that interests you then the reading will be enjoyable and discussions will be great.",
    "If the course is on Performing Ourselves.. Take it! I enjoyed it a lot and it made me look at gender, class, race, social status, and the way we perform them in a whole different way. The course material is difficult to understand sometimes, but Professor Wiet really helps a lot on this (plus, she mentioned she was planning on taking some of the more confusing readings out.. so its likely you won't have a problem on this). If you want to improve your writing, this is the course to take! Just make sure you pick a topic you are interested in.",
    "I would call it a mind-opening look at identity in ourselves and in society. I would definitely recommend it. I found the subject extremely interesting and also believe that everyone should have a sense of all aspects of identity, particularly in evaluating oneself.",
    "Good class to fill a writing credit. Also good for those interested in writing about a certain topic of interest. The many sections of 114 make it easy to find a topic that you are interested in writing about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course; it was my favorite of all my classes this year. I feel as though Professor Wiet played a big role in my positive experience of the course, so I would especially recommend taking it with her. However, the material was also great and I felt as though I learned a lot so I would still recommend it to a fellow student, even with a different instructor.",
    "English 114 26 has not only made me a stronger, more perceptive writer and reader, but a more self-aware person. Through this course, I received a fantastic introduction to academic writing, and feel highly prepared for future college papers. I was able to learn this, however, by reading some of the most eye-opening papers - papers that allowed me to understand far more about myself and the surrounding world. Performance studies seem to be the perfect gateway into a better understanding of identity and the limitless possibilities of performing and presenting that identity - topics I find very important and relevant to any young person\/college student. For these reasons, I would highly recommend this class to other students."
