   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is comprehensive in developing skills about paleoanthropology mainly. The approach Professor Thompson takes in analyzing and understanding human origins is objectively clever, through assignments that allow a true understanding of what it is to study paleoanthropology, discover in the field, and to practice it accurately. What I most appreciated however, was that Professor Thompson revealed many of the difficulties in the field of paleoanthropology which was honest and helpful for those considering it as a career. Professor Thompson is understanding and more than ready to help her students succeed in her class. I would note that this class is probably only interesting if you truly enjoy\/are excited by paleoanthropology, specifically the many different types of pre-human species and archeology in this respect, otherwise although a well-taught course, probably will not be your cup of tea.",
    "The course taught me a lot about human nature and the drive to survive",
    "I developed succinct writing skills. Prof. Thompson also instructed about EndNote which has become a very helpful resource that I will utilize throughout my next three and a half years at Yale.",
    "I learned the basic layout of human evolutionary history as far as a lineage is concerned. More importantly, I understand broader scientific concepts: how scientists use lines of geological\/biological\/archaeological evidence to form conclusions and what constitutes a credible scientific paper.",
    "Really good understanding of human evolution, the ways in which paleoanthropology works, what a career in that field would be like, as well as how to evaluate sources. I learned familiarity and comfort with reading anthropological journals and writing. I also got to practice real and applicable skills like the Chaminade site activity. I also loved the debates and how they made me really step out of my comfort zone with public speaking!",
    "This class was a good introduction to the field of physical anthropology. I feel that I came out of the class with a good understanding of some of the big open questions of the field and the kinds of discoveries that would help to settle these questions. I also have an understanding of the politics of the field and perhaps of scientific fields more broadly."

   "comments": [
    "The small class size makes learning easy",
    "Strengths: plenty of time to ask questions or explore new topics of interest, all new and interesting information, easy-to-digest assignments as the primary method of grading Weaknesses: none",
    "Dr. Thompson explained concepts thoroughly and clearly while conveying the material in an interesting way. At times, though, the readings seemed only loosely related to the corresponding lecture.",
    "I absolutely loved Dr. Thompson; she is so smart, kind and engaging. Sometimes the lectures just felt like a little bit of a routine. I think the 1h15min period could be spiced up with a little break in the middle, with switching between different places, activities.. etc. We could also do things like discuss with partners next to us, or make the whole lecture more audience-participation-centric to keep people sitting in one place engaged for that long.",
    "I feel that, while I learned a lot about how anthropological research works and about the kinds of work that are done, I didn't learn very much actual anthropological material."

   "comments": [
    "Only if you truly are interested in paleoanthropology, e.g., different hominins, hominids, hominoids, discovery of pre-human fossils, using the biology of apes and monkeys for analysis and comparison, etc.",
    "Yes it is a fun class",
    "I would recommend this course because I have a much better understanding of the hominid lineage which I think to be very interesting.",
    "Yes! I would highly recommend this class! It's an overlook of the fossil record and what we know about hominin evolution. It's very interesting but not overly challenging. As far as first year seminars go, it is engaging and you have plenty opportunity to ask questions of explore tangential topics. 10\/10 would recommend!",
    "I would recommend this course for a student who is interested in methodology and the scientific process. The course does not focus much on the path of human evolution so much as how evidence is analyzed in context.",
    "Yes I enjoyed learning about anthropology and it wasn't too much work. It was a stress-free learning environment where we got a lot of individual attention and feedback.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I would not go into it expecting to learn intricate details about human evolution. Rather, expect to learn about the process of studying human evolution.",
    "Yes, I love Professor Thompson and this class was very fun! I think it was a great introduction into anthropology, however, I would recommend that someone may consider a non-First Year Seminar intro anthropology class if paleoanthropology is not exactly what they are interested in. While I did greatly enjoy the class, it was more geared towards paleoanthropology than I initially realized, and I happen to be more interested in biological anthropology. But ultimately, I would still say it was a great class and would recommend it!"
