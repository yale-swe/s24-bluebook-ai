   "comments": [
    "Writing intensive is pretty solid. Only two papers. However, they really reserve A's for exceptional students, so you could write a great paper and still get an A-.",
    "Incredible class!!! Professor Shapiro is one of Yale's best: articulate, mindful, professional, entertaining, and extremely knowledgable. Be warned, however: you probably will not find the course enjoyable if you do not plan to complete the reading assignments. So long as you keep up with the readings (which are a healthy challenge to complete each week), this class is a wonderful introduction to political philosophy.",
    "If you take this course, be sure you have the time to really read the materials, because that's what makes it worth it. Otherwise, the course is online, and you can just binge watch it reading week.",
    "More confusing than I thought it would be and could sometimes be boring.",
    "Good intro to political theory with applications + WR.",
    "take it credit d",
    "I totally recommend this class as an introductory class to political philosophy. You read a lot of philosophers I believe are important for any student to be well informed and enlightened.",
    "If you are interested in the moral foundations of politics and want to take a broad and yet comprehensive overview on several authors, take this class. Professor Shapiro is a great lecturer and scholar that presents his material in a coherent and thought provoking way. Some concepts presented were quite new to me and helped me understand and now see the world with different eyes.",
    "This class gives students a solid overview of political thought. But, don't take this class if you don't like philosophy.",
    "Shop teaching assistants. They have different teaching styles, interpretations of the material, etc. and you will wish you'd have done this by the end of the semester.",
    "It was a very enjoyable course. For someone who had never taken any type of philosophy course before, I thinking Professor Shapiro paces MoFoPo perfectly. I would advise students shopping the course to be aware of the end-heavy distribution of assignments, and know that you will likely go into the final with no clue what your grade is. That being said, I still very much would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it. I think it's a good introductory political science class.",
    "PLSC 118 is a great intro class that gives a great foundation for anyone who might be interested in political science. The writing intensive option is also very useful for people who have had little experience writing political science papers in college. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "I took this course knowing nothing about political philosophy, and I am very glad that I did. Now when people talk about democracy, or Marxism, or Utilitarianism, I actually know what they are talking about! You will get more out of this class if you do the readings, but they are a lot sometimes and you don't really need to read all of them to do well in this course.",
    "I am mixed about recommending this course unless you have to take it for a requirement. If you have to take it, it's okay, not too bad. If you don't have to take it, I would maybe consider it if you want to learn about the basics of political philosophy and didn't take DS, just to be able to understand classic political theorists and their ideologies. So in that sense it was good and now I feel much more informed. but the class wasn't fun at all and it got pretty boring a lot of times, so know that!",
    "An okay intro lecture. Don't rush to take it - probably not the best intro to the polysci department. It can be really hard to keep up with the readings. **If you take it writing intensive, it is NOT a gut class. The essays are hard and graded hard.** A lot depends on your TF -- my section was amazing and much more enjoyable than the lecture. Go to the lectures, even though they're all online.",
    "I think PLSC 118 was a good course. The beginning served as a nice introduction to fundamental moral theories such as utilitarianism, and the later part of the course addressed how to attain certain fundamental values in a political system. While the lectures were sometimes dry, the material was engaging and professor Shapiro did a nice job relating the material to real world issues. I took this course as a writing credit and, relative to other writing credits, the workload was very manageable with only two 7-8 page papers and a final exam. If you are looking for a good introduction to moral theories, I think this is a great course because it covers some basics and also ties them in to real world political issues.",
    "I would recommend MoFoPo for someone who wants a general knowledge of political philosophy. It is a lecture, so there are no deep discussions with the professor, but Professor Shapiro is a very good lecturer and all of the TAs seemed very helpful.",
    "Yes, I did not attend a single lecture. You only need his book and the open course lecture transcripts. Section helps keep you somewhat on track.",
    "Absolutely. Great Intro class, great teacher and on material that everyone should know.",
    "A survey course whose quality depends greatly on the quality of one's TF.",
    "This was my first political theory class and I'm sad to say I wasn't too impressed. I would have loved a smaller class where you get to meet the professor or perhaps a class that covers a more digestible amount of material.",
    "MoFoPo makes all of politics make sense in 1 semester. It is a great deal of fun and teaches things that you'll keep with you for the rest of your life. It breaks apart misconceptions and teaches you how to think critically about the most pressing political conundrums known to the Western world. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Overall, it was an enjoyable semester. Most of the readings were very interesting. If you take this course writing intensive, be prepared to put a lot of work into your essays. I feel that you only scratch the surface of the works you read, but what else can you expect from an introductory course that covers the breadth of this one? In my experience, grading is a bit arbitrary on the essays and will vary from TF to TF. But if political philosophy is your thing (or if you need the credit) I'd recommend taking this course... it's a classic.",
    "Be warned, it is a ton of reading (120-160 pages a week). However, it's a solid political philosophy class: beginners will learn a lot and Shapiro is a leader in his field who knows how to keep students interested and convey the information.",
    "Lots of reading, interesting lectures, easy exams. Take it non-WR credit and the class is a breeze",
    "This is a restatement of my assessment, but I believe students interested in the course should read it: My assessment is that this course is really for students who want to delve into political philosophy. At first that seems like it could be anyone, and I thought it was me coming in, because who wouldn't want to learn more about where politics, the natural infrastructure that binds people comes from? But unless you want to really want to analyze the incredibly longwinded, overly technical, and seemingly deliberately arcane writings of Marx, Thomas Hobbes, Alasdair MacIntyre, etc., this course is not for you. Yes, as others will point out, you can get by without doing all of the reading, but why take a course if you're not going to make the most of it? Just my opinion, but I think it's helpful if you get into shopping period and find that the readings are not getting you excited. That being said, if you find them exciting, go ahead an take it. There are only two assessments plus section participation as grades for this course, but if you do in fact do most of the reading, I would say the workload is leaning toward greater than that of the average introductory social science course. Some people rave about this course. If you are not into the subject matter or navigating all of the jargon, I would say it is below average.",
    "Awesome",
    "Take the class! You could not discuss more important concepts.",
    "Very interesting class and a great introduction to moral theories. Lectures being on the web is also a plus, if you have to miss class. Be aware, though, that Shapiro is not the easiest grader, which can be frustrating at times",
    "A good intro political philosophy course with an interesting focus on governmental legitimacy. A good course to take as a writing credit. Heavy reading load and encourages extensive comparison between works.",
    "No. If you are going to take a political philosophy class, take Introduction to Political Philosophy with Professor Garsten. For me, this class did not put nearly enough emphasis on the actual text, section time was not used for discussion, and essays left no room for creativity.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone interested in thinking about the broad, and seemingly insurmountable, question of what makes governments legitimate. For people looking for a more practical political science course dealing with more concrete material, this might not be the right course.",
    "I recommend this class to students with a strong interest in political philosophy. Although I am interested in politics, the philosophical aspect did not garner much interest in me. I undoubtedly acquired useful knowledge, but my lack of interest in philosophy prevented me from enjoying this class to the fullest.",
    "Great course. Definitely take it while you are at Yale.",
    "Moral Foundations of Politics (MoFoPo) is essentially a good introductory course on political philosophy. Take it as a starting point and you won't be disappointed, lectures are intriguing and the TFs are incredibly intelligent and helpful. However, as a disclaimer, the structure that Professor Shapiro promises at the beginning of the course of internal analysis, external analysis, then contemporary application of each theoretical tradition, as well as the promise of answering the Eichmann Problem, seem to be quickly forgotten, leaving the course feeling a little less ordered than one expected.",
    "Wholehearted yes. Great class. Great teaching faculty. make sure to take it writing intensive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, especially someone looking for a good introductory political philosophy course. PLSC 118 01 is insightful and covers important political thinkers and ideas that everyone should have a basic grasp on."
