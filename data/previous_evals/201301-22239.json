   "comments": [
    "Outstanding course. Wonderful texts, helpful secondary materials, strong discussion. Professor Homans is tremendous: knowledgable, accessible, helpful, and interesting. A great opportunity to apply criticism and theory applied to actual work; the biographical content is very helpful as well.",
    "Yes -- if you're interested in Virginia Woolf, it's amazing. Because Virginia Woolf is amazing. And so is Homans. Great class. It's lots of reading, though!",
    "Fantastic! You should absolutely take this class. It is a lot of reading, so be forewarned, but completely worth it. You'll learn a ton and Professor Homans is terrific. She's incredibly knowledgeable and always has interesting contributions to class discussions.",
    "Take it if you like Woolf or would like to learn more about her. It's a LOT of reading. Homans is great though.",
    "This class made me think differently about almost everything. Not only did Virginia Woolf's prose make me read differently, her politics made me start to reconsider many of my own assumptions.Professor Homans is a wonderful discussion leader and incredibly supportive of students. She read our 20 page drafts in 24 hours and came back with detailed, helpful feedback.It's a lot of work, but it's so so worth it.",
    "This is a fabulous class. Professor Homans is incredibly knowledgeable about Woolf, and always excited by students' ideas in seminar and office hours. Woolf is also just insanely on-point, poetic, and fun to read. There is a ton of reading. I would suggest reading Woolf's book every week, and skimming the theory, since there's simply too much to do it all.",
    "I highly recommend this class! I could not have imagined a better way to end my career as an English major than working with such rich texts and a wonderful professor."
