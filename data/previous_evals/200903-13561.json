    "It focuses less on teaching students facts, and more about different ways of processing, thinking about, and critiquing information. It also does a great job of making forecasting models for climate and energy tangible.",

    "Professor Koomey was critical to the success of the course. The subject matter and readings were also very interesting and well chosen.",
    "I enjoyed the small class size and personal attention in class. Class discussion was mainly fruitful.",
    "The set up was good. The professor was very helpful.",
    "Understanding the mechanics of forecasting in Energy topics.",
    "casual discussion\/seminar formatpaper assignment",

    "This class doesn't need improvement, it just needs to be offered every year and probably to a larger number of students.",
    "I felt like the course would have benefited from a bit more structure. A few problem-set type assignments would have complemented the individual projects. I also think discussions needed some more guidance - there was a tendency to range too far off-topic and to become dominated by a few individuals.",

    "Excellent. Professor Koomey was by far the most engaged, most responsive and most helpful professor I have taken a class from. His commitment to student projects was essential in helping them along through the semester.",
    "Jon Koomey provided special meet-up sessions to aid us with our projects which were generally productive and useful.",
    "Awesome.",
    "Great!",
    "Professor Koomey was very helpful and willing to meet.",

    "This was a great capstone course for all of my energy and climate coursework. It's one of the best advanced classes students can take in this area, and has both academic and professional applications.",
    "I'm interested in energy policy--so quite apt.",
    "This course helped me gain perspective on the use and abuse of forecasting modeling. Generally it has made me a better critic of usefulness of models and various approaches to creating scenario analyses for more informed decision making. As a student interested in policy, this was a very useful course.",
    "Straight at the core of my interest in energy issues.",
    "Gives you an opportunity to dig deep into a topic of your preference and understand forecasting in that area.",
    "As an MBA candidate who is interested in the connection between energy industry and policy, this was a very valuable view into the research that influences policymakers.",
    "This course was not in my background area, but I'd had exposure to modeling during my summer internship. I think it's important for anyone going into the climate policy or energy fields."
