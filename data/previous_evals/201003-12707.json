    "ART141 is a great idea with some serious problems in execution. First, it should be declared in the fall course description that only one project is created for the entire semester, because that came as a surprise to all. Roemer is incredibly experienced and well learned, but occasionally talks himself into (contradictory) circles given that we run the 3-hour gauntlet thirteen weeks in a row with the same scene scenario. Though I haven't taken it, if I could do it again I would have taken the course in the spring, simply to build a portfolio.",
    "Art 141 with Professor Roemer places more emphasis on screenwriting than on the technical aspects of shooting and editing footage, so if it's film production you're interested in, this may not be the best course for you. Over the course of a semester, you will write, direct, shoot, and edit a short (2- to 3-minute) film. It's workshop-style, so your classmates as well as Roemer will weigh in on your progress.",
    "yes!",
    "There's not too many other production courses at Yale. This is why you're reading this right now. That being said, I don't know if you should take this. The prof, Michael Roemer, is a cool dude, but he's 82... And he doesn't have email. He doesn't give very much room for interpretation and by he end of the class, almost all the projects started to look the same. I didn't dislike the class, but it was frustrating and I don't know if I would take the class in retrospect."
