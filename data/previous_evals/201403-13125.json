   "comments": [
    "ENGL 120 is an introductory English class. While I do feel that it helped my ability to write essays and personal statements, it wasn't much other than a requirement. There's a fair bit of reading, though the amount of reading often fluctuates. All in all, it's a fair writing credit, but I wouldn't take it for much else than that.",
    "Great course! Not that much work, your writing improves immensely, and it's SO MUCH FUN!",
    "it is a really cool class to take if you want to pursue writing in a setting that is very different from normal academic writing. it can be a good amount of work but it's worth it.",
    "English 120 is a class where you get to explore different writing styles of the modern era. I would recommend English 120 to almost everyone because I think it really helped with my confidence in my writing",
    "Great class, great professor. Take it with Stuart.",
    "A fun and intellectually stimulating class, ENGL120 pushed me to read and write new things in new ways. I was in Barbara Stuart's section and our readings were almost always enjoyable, I felt like this aspect of the workload was really minimal compared to the amount of time I spent writing. (Please note I am a particularly slow writer but I had about 3 or 4 all-nighters writing for this class as our deadlines were 9am on Fridays.) It's essential for 120 to get a good section - I shopped about 5 sections and Prof Stuart's was in the top 2, I was very pleased to get this section because she has intelligent things to say about the readings. Some of the other sections let the students do ALL the talking and I almost felt it was more of a book group than a lesson. Also, it's not easy but Professor Stuart does give As. So it's nice to have that possibility to look towards - I know a lot of English classes don't have that luxury! This class was very helpful in improving my writing and I read some stuff which has permanently changed my outlook on life. Most notably 'Black Men In Public Space' and 'Consider The Lobster'.",
    "Take this course if you would like to become more comfortable with writing and critiquing your work and the work of others. It taught me how to write a solid conclusion, show and not tell, and formulate a structure to support a point.",
    "A great foundation course for English classes at Yale. I know that I will use the writing skills that I acquired in this class in future writing-focused courses, regardless of what discipline. And feel confident that I know the expectations for English essays, and that this class put me in a position to perform up to or beyond the demanded standards.",
    "English 120 was a great bridge into personal narrative writing for someone who had never written that way before (myself). I would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in trying to improve a more personal writing style (or begin one!).",
    "This was definitely one of my favourite classes this semester. The readings were almost always enjoyable and really opened my eyes to the world of creative nonfiction. After this class, you'll be able to read things like the New Yorker and really appreciate them. The assignments were challenging but fulfilling. I would take this class again in a heartbeat.",
    "amazing! This was my favorite course of the semester by a long shot. Nearly all of the readings for the course are things you would probably like to read anyways. There is a lot of writing that you'll have to do, but it's all creative and you'll probably find at least a few of the papers enthralling enough to put a huge amount of work into them with a smile on your face. The highlight of the class for me were the daily discussions of the readings - you'll learn a lot about what other people think about the same thing, and as a result learn a lot about your classmates - and the bi-weekly Workshops, where three students present drafts of their papers and the rest of the class comments upon them. It will probably be the most feedback you've received on a written work ever, and so you will find it useful and interesting to see the perspectives of so many different people on what you've written. I became much more interested in writing and journalism in general during the course of the semester. Professor Stuart is awesome!",
    "Awesome class (not life-changing)! Tiny so you have to do the work or be really good at bullshitting about readings you didn't do. Readings and papers are clearly delineated in the syllabus with due dates and all, so knock yourself out. The readings are manageable enough and the amount of time you put in a paper is going to be really apparent in your grade. That being said it's hard to get an A in this class (has to be \"Award-worthy\") so be prepared to work hard on polishing papers if you really want that coveted A. Otherwise stick to the easier B. Stuart is a sweetheart, a tough motherly type."
