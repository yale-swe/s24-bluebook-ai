    "A very fast paced introduction to Spanish. I would recommend it, but do not get behind. Nearly impossible to catch up.",
    "The class meets everyday and it demands a lot. However, i think the curriculum is perfect for anyone trying a learn spanish to fluency. Youll get a really good handle on the basics of spanish, but you have to be willing to work hard. Also, take very good care into picking a section with a good proffesor because it can make or break your experience.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class. It covers all the basics and goes over the concepts introduced in the chapters multiple times",
    "It entails a lot of work, especially in the form of daily homework. However, it does set a deep foundation in a relatively short period of time. I recommend taking the class if you express interest in learning Spanish.",
    "A really solid and appropriately paced entry level Spanish course. Good for anyone who has never taken Spanish before."
