   "comments": [
    "This class covers many topics pertaining to the psychology of gender.",
    "This course taught me about the importance of gender to one's identity. Before taking the class, I didn't often think about how my gender affected my everyday interactions and behaviors. However, I now see that there are a lot of subtle ways in which society influences the way we act.",
    "I learned so much from this class! I truly learned so much about the psychology of gender, sexual identity, racial identity, transgender, identity, and more. The studies and research we talked about in class were very applicable to life, as gender is a construct that is constantly influencing our behavior, activities, and of course the way we are perceived. As someone who is interested in research, I also learned a lot of technical psychology vocabulary.",
    "I learned a lot about gender which is very interesting.",
    "You learn a lot about a specific type of psych study in this class.",
    "A good introduction to Yale's liberalism and campus culture.",
    "This course provided me with a huge amount of knowledge and skills in the field of Gender Psychology. It helped me to understand so many elements that I was unaware of and taught the content in a manner that was open to learning and encouraged in-class discussions.",
    "How the general public reacts to LGBTQ groups, what evidence is there on differences between the genders, how to conduct a sociology-isn study. Learned a lot about how to read psych\/soc papers."

   "comments": [
    "It seemed to be quite difficult to do well in this class. I feel that this class is only really advantageous for psych or WGSS majors who have already taken many classes and are already very knowledgeable in the coursework. It seemed that the learning curve was very steep.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was the assigned readings. I really enjoyed having a variety of primary and secondary journal articles to read, because being presented with real data helps you form an actually educated opinion. That being said, I would have liked to have read some articles from the \"other\" side. A lot of the articles (and all of the vocal people in the class, for that matter) had the same viewpoints about gender and gender inequalities. It would have been interesting to see some studies that had findings that conflicted with the arguments the professor was trying to make. Another strength was the organization of the lectures. We almost always got through the lecture material and stuck pretty rigidly to the syllabus, which was helpful. Also, the lectures were always put up online after class, so if you missed anything you could catch up on it later.",
    "Strengths definitely included engaging lectures that allowed students to discuss their own experiences, observations, and predictions. I wou",
    "The lectures are a bit boring but it is still interesting.",
    "The important aspect of the class is that it takes on a really relevant topic. However, the class fell short because: 1) it is the psychology of WHITE women, as there is nothing about women of color included in this class (or quickly glanced over in a problematic way), 2) often there is one message that is taught from a topic that does not have an answer, rather than discussing many different studies and theories on that particular topic.",
    "The class discusses stuff that is very hot in the press right now, Gender & Sexuality. However, the classes do tend to be one sided, i.e., with only liberal views expressed. More open discussion within the class would have been very useful to gaining a full picture of the current discussion and debate in the US about Gender & Sexuality, instead of just hearing one side of the argument. I don't think the problem is that the class only had liberals in it when I took it, that is unlikely, but I felt that the feel and undertone of the class didn't not allow for conservative discussion or views to be expressed.",
    "Material was very interesting and covered a lot of ground. Ability to discuss during lecture was great.",
    "The readings and course material was amazing and very relevant to the classes. The only weakness would be that the slides were not given before class. I think that they would have been more useful if given in class or just prior to class so that notes could be made on them.",
    "Heavy on the reading, which was ok. Felt a little echo-chambery by the nature of who would sign up for the course. A bit repetitive. But by the end of the course I realized how much I had actually learned.",
    "More examples of applications of findings rather than just the findings\/observations themselves"

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The midterm was so difficult and seemed to be looking to trick students. The paper seemed like an area where students could excel, yet again it was hard to get a good grade unless you had experience writing psych papers or knew so much about the subject matter already. I was very unimpressed and felt very demoralized throughout the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about the way that gender is involved in so many things (mental health, behavior, prejudice, etc.). However, I will warn future students that the course involves a lot of people agreeing about things. If you're looking for a class in which there are two sides to the debate, this is not the class for you. Granted, I also agreed with everyone in the class, but it would have been refreshing to hear someone else's point of view. Overall, though, this was a well-taught course and I would definitely opt to take it if I were choosing classes over again.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class! I'm not a WGSS major, but I do think about gender a lot and have come across feminist theory and thinkers. With that said, I found the beginning of this course really basic, even sometimes reductive. It made me worried about the efficacy of using to psychology to think about gender. However, this class got really good after a couple of lectures and I have a feeling that the first lectures are particularly targeted for \"newbies\" who have little to no past experience in thinking about gender, feminism, or sexuality in an academic context. As we got through the semester, we talked about some really thought-provoking psychological theories, research, and studies. Some topics we cover are intersectionality (yay!), masculinity, sexuality, transgender identity, and more. I think the best part about this class is that even though its a lecture, Prof LaFrance really encouraged discussion and it often felt like a large seminar where we could not only talk about the studies, but also our own personal experiences and observations.",
    "Yes, it is a good class.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There are so many WAY better and more interesting psych classes: Intro Psych, Sex, Evolution, and Human Nature, and Attraction and Relationships, to name just a few. This class does not give a good overview for those who are new to psych and is repetitive and unconvincing for psych majors. Also, this is a class only on the psychology of WHITE women and does not consider women of color at all.",
    "Yes, this course did well to broaden my understanding of gender and sexuality.",
    "For the sake of getting an introduction to the campus culture on Gender & Sexuality, definitely takes the class.",
    "Fascinating class with an incredibly knowledgeable professor!",
    "Yes! I didn't altogether love the style of the course - we had to memorize the author's of the majority of the papers we read for the final and there was not enough opportunity for discussion - but overall it was a good course. I enjoyed it, and it is a good class for someone who is very interested in gender. I would suggest that the class discusses and explores more about non-binary gender - much of the focus was just on the binary genders of man and woman, with a little on the subjects of transgender, lgbtq+, and intersex squeezed in at the end - and I would also appreciate if the class maybe had a discussion section? Or if the professor didn't want to add that extra burden, maybe making it an optional one. I just felt the class would benefit from students being able to share their thoughts and hear those of their classmates fully.",
    "This is a good overview of topics in the psychology of gender and sexuality. The studies you read are current and interesting, and the workload is reasonable. I enjoyed the class discussions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to almost all women (and men) who attend Yale. I think that the insight and learning is invaluable from this course.",
    "Yes! I took it to fulfill the premed psych requirement in a more-seminary class compared to Intro Psych. I liked it. Probably won't help me on the MCAT but it changed my view of the world so... Prof LaFrance is really nice, and so was Natalie (the TA). Prof LF says \"um\" a lot while lecturing, so that took some getting used to. Sometimes discussions felt a bit repetitive or one-dimensional, but it's hard to force it esp if not everyone has done the reading. I (usually) kept up with the reading and was glad I did, but it's easy to skip it if you don't have time b\/c there's no on the spot discussion. Loved when Prof LaFrance played devil's advocate or argued back - added another dimension. The midterm is pretty intense but the final was more relaxed. Overall a relaxed, fun course with a lot of studies to read. And she posts the slides online which is helpful",
    "Yes because the material is important, relevant, and well curated by Professor LaFrance."
