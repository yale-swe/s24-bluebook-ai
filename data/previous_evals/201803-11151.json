    "Professor Duval provided the tools needed to approach 16th-century literature, which was rather daunting at the start of the course. By the time I wrote my final paper, I felt more prepared to take on the works by Rabelais and Marguerite de Navarre than at the beginning of the course. The class made me excited about texts that were otherwise unfamiliar and intimidating. Professor Duval, as many would agree, was an outstanding teacher and role model for us aspiring teachers.",
    "Ce cours m'a permis de m'ouvrir l'oeuvre de Rabelais et de Marguerite travers une lecture au plus prs du texte et des discussions fort enrichissantes. La comptence premre que dveloppe ce cours est certainement le \"close reading\". Une fine attention est porte aux dtail de chaque texte, ce qui permet de dvelopper des pistes de riches et pertinentes pistes de lecture. Le cours permet surtout de prendre conscience de la pense humaniste qui sous-tend ces textes. Les discussions 0taient toutefois ouvertes sur diffrentes lectures, mais toujours avec la mme attention au texte."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Duval led the way for those of us who felt the subject matter to be quite distance from our own expertise. I was always grateful to hear Professor Duval's interpretations and wisdom around each text we examined. With all his wisdom, he still left ample space for students to explore and contribute our own thoughts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Duval makes his subjects fun, while staying quite thorough and close to the texts. He opens texts up for students to delight in their humor, mischief, and meaning and gives more than his own interpretations, but a map for how to read."
