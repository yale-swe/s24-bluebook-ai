    "It is a great class for anyone interested in maternal and child health from a policy perspective. I enjoyed the historical perspectives that we otherwise don't learn much about as well as Professor Lee's recommendations for how to advocate policy change.I wish there had been participation credit to encourage a more critical discussion of the homework readings. If possible in the future to show clips from \"The Business of Being Born,\" I would highly recommend it.",
    "strengths: student participation is encouraged, instructor is in tuned with student's backgrounds and interests, the classroom environment is very invitingweaknesses: because there were several undergrads in the class who didn't have a background in public health, the class was a little slow at the beginning.I would assign fewer readings, and choose readings that are clearer to read.",
    "The course was an interesting introduction to public health. Overall I think it covered a broad range of topics affecting women and children's health. I thought that was the course's biggest strength. The courses biggest weakness was its focus on the United States. I wish the entire class had taken a more global perspective.",
    "I really really liked this course. The school of public health should have more courses like this one. It was very information and the instructor was so knowledgeable. We covered a wide range of topics that covered healthcare in the US and maternal and child health. I have learned a lot from this course and I know feel very confident about my ability to understand and solve some public health issues, particularly in the field of women's health.",
    "The instructor, reading assignments, class assignments and lectures were all excellent. The class explores multiple aspects of women and children's health through the policy lens. The reading assignments are reasonable in terms of the load, and they pertain to class lecture\/discussions and are also helpful in enhancing one's understanding of the highlighted topic for that week. The assignments are very applicable to future public health work, and also enjoyable while challenging. The instructor is very knowledgeable in this field and is always open to questions. She is also available outside of class. If anything, it would have been nice to restrict this class to only graduate students as the level of knowledge in the area of public health and epidemiology is drastically different between the graduate and undergraduate students."

    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Mary Alice was wonderful. She knows the material so well and is so caring a considerate. However, I would have liked if there had been more discussion in class; two hours of straight lecture can get relatively dry.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Professor Lee brought in her own expertise in working in policy, which was very insightful. She was creative in her approaches for class; I especially enjoyed the day when we presented on other countries' health systems. I appreciated her thoughtfulness regarding the course content and how it was taught.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0strengths: very warm and friendly, experienced in the fieldweaknesses: a few times the slides weren't updated to the current date.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Professor Lee was a kind, committed professor. She has a clear expertise with the subject material and made the class enjoyable. I wish she structured the course to be more interactive. Her biggest weakness was not engaging the class with questions and talking points every step of the way to ensure that the newer students understood all the introduced topics and the public health students had an opportunity to convey their expertise.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0She is also available to talk to students and makes a lot of efforts even though her office is off campus. She is also very knowledgeable about the topics we covered and is able to answer any questions.",
    "Instructor: Mary Alice Lee \u00a0Please see above."

   "comments": [
    "This course is about women's health policy -- there's really no theory or analysis, it's straightforward learning the facts about women's health policy and how it affects people's lives. I would recommend it if you are really committed to women's health and health policy, but not otherwise. I would also recommend it if you are looking for a fairly easy class that doesn't require too much work...",
    "It is great course covering a range of topics in maternal and child health in America, focusing on the policies that address them. I would highly recommend it.",
    "A look at the status of maternal and child health in this country, especially amongst the poor. Looking at how the government provides healthcare for underprivileged children and their mothers.Yes--it's very informative.",
    "I would say that this course is an interesting foray into the field of public health. It is a focused course on the health of women and children in the United States. The class is mostly conducted in lecture style. I would recommend this class to anyone explicitly interested in the subject material but if this is your first experience with public health, I would caution undergraduates. The course offers experience with common public health issues, but not from a global health perspective.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in women's health. It is one of the best course I have taken at YSPH. We cover a wide range of topics that every public health student should not. This course also provides you with the knowledge you need to have for any internship\/job.",
    "I highly recommend shopping this course especially if this is a topic of interest. Every lecture was very different from the previous ones, and it covers a broad range of women and children's health in the U.S. The assignments allow one to delve deeper into a particular topic of interest, thus it allows the students to explore certain issues in greater detail. The workload is reasonable, and the instructor is excellent and engaging."
