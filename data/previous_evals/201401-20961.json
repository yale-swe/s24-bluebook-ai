    "It is required for the intensive major... just keep your chin up while your doing it...",
    "Terrific Course! take it!!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has made it far enough to see this review... You're going to have 3-4 shitty nights during the semester when you're finishing up your lab reports, and there's lots of error analysis. Some of the labs are opaque when you're trying to figure them out. On the other hand, there are lots of cool experiments, and you can more or less choose the ones you want to do. It's a pain schedule wise, but you only have to go to lab about half the days, the rest of the time is basically a free afternoon. The hands-on aspect is refreshing next to your physics core courses, and this is WAY more pleasant (and chill! and interesting!) than 206!",
    "If you're thinking of taking this class, you probably already know you have to take it. It's not terrible as long as you don't pick the truly horrible labs.",
    "This class requires alot of programming. If you go in without much programming experience like I did, you will spend alot of your time floundering with matlab code that you may never fully understand. Also the experiments are difficult and much more involved than any of the experiments in 205 or 206. You also receive much less guidance, and the data analysis requirements are much less clear. TA's are essential, as the lab handouts rarely tell you exactly what you are supposed to do. Luckily, you are usually given more time than you need to acquire data, but what time you save in the acquisition you lose in the analysis, which takes a very long time. Overall, this lab can be enjoyable, but is not a walk in the park.",
    "This is a great class! Even if you're not an intensive major, you should take it. The labs were often interesting and very informative. I learned more than 205 and 206 combined. It's a very time-intensive course, but very low stress if you put in a minimum amount of effort. Prof. Lamoreaux is awesome! He's informative and approachable-- a perfect lab instructor.",
    "It's a good class if you like experimental work - if not, you might find it frustrating. This year, it was too big. Some of the labs don't take too long to do, so try and write up the report during the class. Other ones - such as the Ising model - take ages. Be aware of this, especially as midterms and finals approach. The most important thing in the labs is to do the error analysis well, so don't neglect this! I'm a theorist so I didn't like it as much as other people probably did, but Prof Lamoreaux is pretty good. The workload peaks a LOT around the lab reports, so although it's very little work for most of the semester, there will be a couple of late nights.",
    "Yes. Everyone should try out physics lab experiments to appreciate the world better.",
    "Presumably you're taking this because it's required for the physics major. It's pretty good--definitely better than 205 or 206. Stay on track during your lab sessions; you'll feel like you have a lot of time to get an experiment done, but it can slip away from you.",
    "Lab 382 is generally a good class. You only complete 3 labs over the course of the semester, though these labs are considerably more involved and time consuming than those from 206L and 205L. However, they are all (except for the Ising Model) quite interesting and they give you a flavor for what \"real\" physics research is like for graduate students. Just be proactive about your lab reports and be sure to ask Lamoreaux lots of questions (he's very friendly and gives you a lot of tips if you simply ask). Ultimately, it's required for the intensive major but non-intensive students would probably get a lot out of the class as well.",
    "A more laid back schedule than most lab classes. Take advantage of that by working on analysis and paper writing as you go instead of waiting until the deadline, especially since the deadlines tend to fall at busy times in the semester. Obviously a very enjoyable credit if you enjoy science at all.",
    "Take it! It's more interesting than the intro lab courses.",
    "A lab class that will frustrate but reward in the end. Dr. Lamoreaux suggests that about 40 hours are required for each of the three labs in this course, but the plus sides are 1. that's it, there aren't any hidden assignments or anything 2. you can really work at your own pace on them\/come in whenever is convenient for you (I had a serious conflict Monday afternoons, but my TAs and lab partners were willing to shift the time we met) 3. the labs are MUCH more interesting than in 205 or 206. You really have the opportunity to make each project your own in this course. I did the Ising model (kinda boring, but required) and then the superconducting tunnel junction and the optical tweezers labs (both great labs with great TAs). Dr. Lamoreaux is pretty lenient with the grading, and you will feel like much more of an accomplished physicist after doing 382. ONE NOTE OF CAUTION: it would have been extremely useful to have had experience with statistical mechanics and with MATLAB for this course. 382 is a good incentive to take stat mech in the fall of your junior year, which is a factor not many intensive physics people talk about. Also pretty much 80% of your time in this course will be coding in matlab, so knowing it going in would be huge. On the other hand, I have become far more proficient in matlab than I was going into this lab, so you can also use it as a learning experience.",
    "The course taught me: - how to use LaTex - statistical methods to analyse data - dealing with high uncertainty and poor data which are all essential skills. It also forces you to write reports in a formal manner, but I already knew this from doing research. The class does not a good job at teaching the underlying theory for each experiment. This adds to the workload, and even when submitting a successful report, I only feel I vaguely understood the material. I enjoyed discussing problematics aspects of data analysis with professor Lamoreaux. He took the time to meet and talk with students, and was always extremely supportive. A heads-up: work regularly. Data analysis is more work than collecting data, so even if you don't have to work at the lab, you should still plan to work every Monday and Wednesday afternoon.",
    "It's a lot better than the other physics labs.",
    "This was a cool class. The labs are really really cool. As long as you don't procrastinate and start the lab reports right before they're due, this class is pretty low-stress. There is obviously a lot of time spent in class, but this is countered by the fact that it really requires very little work outside of class for the majority of the time, as long as you are on top of it and work on your lab reports during the class time. This class is meant to be an introduction to doing real research, so there is a lot less hand-holding as you go through the labs. The lab handouts can be a lot less clear, so it takes some creativity to make them work sometimes.",
    "I would recommend you do Bell's Inequality lab. I was very happy to see the experiment that proved Quantum Mechanics and Hidden Variable theory are incompatible. I would however stay away from pNMR. When we did it, the equipment was not working well, so our results over four weeks were basically meaningless."
