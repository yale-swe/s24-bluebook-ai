   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as the best possible introduction to classical literature. I would definitely recommend because I feel that now I have a strong basis for understanding and evaluating other literature that I read.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I really enjoyed not only engaging with brilliant texts, but also, being able to see how flexible the interpretations of them are in lectures and in sections. I felt as though I learned a great amount from taking this class and I am very pleased that I made the decision to do so.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in the classical literature of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. This course allows students to read the literary works that comprise the foundation of the literature of the Western canon, and an understanding of the class readings will enable students who take this course to thoroughly comprehend many of the literary allusions and references contained in modern literature, theatre, and cinema.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. We cover fascinating material, and the class discussions are great.",
    "DS Lit is an introduction to the texts that form the pillars of our western literary tradition, something I would strongly recommend in any circumstance as anyone can learn tremendous things from an exploration of texts.",
    "It is an exploration of the West's most influential works of literature, and provides instruction as to how to approach and interpret these works. I would recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend it.",
    "DS: literature involves a lot of work, but is also a lot of fun. If you are looking to read all of the major texts and discuss them in the free-est way possible, this is for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially anyone interested in studying the classics.",
    "You read a lot of important literature, with a professor who knows her stuff very, very well.",
    "I would caution my fellow students about the Directed Studies program as a whole. The reading is substantial and for many of my friends I could see the work load becoming too much for them. Other than that I would absolutely recommend it to anyone."
