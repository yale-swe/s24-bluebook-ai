    "I have gotten so much out of my lessons this year. First, I think that my technique has improved dramatically: I feel so much more relaxed and comfortable when I play, and I feel like I also have a better handle on more technical skills like a range of vibratos and bow technique. Most importantly, my love for the violin has only grown this year, and I am so excited to keep up with so much music in the years to come!"
