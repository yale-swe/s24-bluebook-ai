   "comments": [
    "A good physics elective. No exam but the problem sets can be time intensive.",
    "Definitely take the course. Interesting subject material and my GUT reaction is a yes.",
    "Would definitely recommend it.",
    "Not the most riveting course. If you've taken quantum, this will seem really slow. If you haven't, I imagine you might get very confused. The professor is very nice, but pretty disorganized and hard to get a hold of. Still, I did learn some interesting physics. If you need a low-workload elective, this is it.",
    "The beginning of the semesters is uninteresting if you have taken PHYS 440 and 441. The end of the semester covers new material, and addresses ways in which QM can be applied, which is very rewarding. We have to review a published paper as a final assignment, which is undoubtedly the best part of the course. Actually, the one I had covered material from PHYS 440, 441, 420 and 430 all at once. The problem sets are easy, and give you insight into what is happening. The course would be better if it were more paper review based, and seminar like. Lecture material should simply be posted online. Copying it in class is an incredibly useless thing to do, and for reasons I just don't get, a widely spread practice. Other than that, lectures are tedious, fast-paced and algebra heavy. There is a lack of visual information, and I hardly ever could get the bigger picture in mind. Asking a question is a 15 minutes time commitment. The professor is enthusiastic and readily available to discuss course material. TA does not hold any office hours.",
    "PHYS 344 was an interesting physics elective with an extremely reasonable workload. Professor Barrett was always upbeat and passionate about the material he was teaching which made for an inviting classroom experience. Five psets over the course of the semester and a final presentation with a short (2 page) write up--no midterm or final. The work was a bit back-loaded, but the workload was so reasonable it would be criminal for me to complain about how it was spread throughout the semester.",
    "It basically covers the key ideas of QM--what kets are, what quantum entanglement is, etc-- by just focusing on one example. So you don't need to understand a lot of physics. Having taken Math 222 is really helpful. If you are looking for somewhere to apply that, this is a good class for that. The class focuses on Quantum Computing. It is interesting to know a bit about the state of Quantum Computing in all its wonder and limitations. Also, know that the psets are based on the lectures and there are no online notes.",
    "I took this course as an applied math major who did not have any formal background in quantum. This course does a good job of teaching you the essential quantum mechanics but is focused on the quantum for quantum computing. It was a good science credit that was high level and required linear algebra but that didn't require the introductory classes. Also it was not that much work with 5 psets and no tests.",
    "I would recommend this class as long as you know what you're getting into. Since I hadn't taken quantum, a lot of the class was new to me and I had to spend time learning what other people already knew. However, all of the psets come out of the class notes and were pretty straightforward to do. The only work is 5 psets and a paper\/presentation, and none of it took too long to do.",
    "If you've taken quantum before, this is an EXTREMELY easy class. Only 5 problem sets that are super straightforward and straight out of the lecture notes (which he ended up posting online. But you should make sure to go to lecture cause that's all you'll ever need), and then one journal club presentation. I spent probably 2 hours per pset and 2 hours for the presentation. That's 12 hours for the entire semester outside of lecture, of which I attended maybe half. Great for a 5th class and easy good grade in a physics class. If you haven't taken any quantum before, this could be more challenging, but it's definitely the best class to take if you have any interest in learning quantum material as it's a lot easier than 440 or 439. Also, Prof. Barrett really wants you to do well. He extended the deadline for pretty much every pset and is super lax about everyting. Easy class, you won't really learn much if you have quantum background other than a little at the end about cryptography and quantum gates, but hey, sometimes we all need to catch a break.",
    "From the perspective of a physics major: The class will be very relaxed if you've already been exposed to quantum and are comfortable with linear algebra, but it really focused on giving a conceptual understanding of the subject in a way other classes don't. (For example, Bell's theorem is covered). It takes until the second half of the semester for it to become interesting, but it eventually gets to really cool topics like quantum cryptography and algorithms, and Barrett's lectures are always great."
