    "You won't really learn any one thing in a useful amount of detail. It's more of a history\/overview of the field. Readings are super diverse (from academic to legal to artistic stuff).",
    "We learned about the film music industry, history, and some more practical things about composing itself. The course covered a lot of different topics, so it was more of a survey than a detailed look at just one thing.",
    "History, business, and technical aspects of film music.",
    "In this course, we studied film and media music. Specifically, we developed knowledge, skills, and insights in film music history and theory, technical and creative practices and techniques, and legal and business aspects of the industry.",
    "This course was a great summary of the business side the history and the production of film music. it didnt go too deep into any particular area but Professor Shapiro was interested in hearing what students were most interested in and providing us more information on those subjects",
    "Insight into the practices, laws, trends and debates surrounding film music composition",
    "An overview of the composer profession and key theoretical texts for film composition. Excellent information for people interested in pursuing music composition professionally (or just interested in the profession), as it's not stuff you would hear in other music courses."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course jumps around topics, which is pretty cool because it feels like you're taking a film scoring class, a film history class, and a music business class sort of all at the same time. But this also means that we never go into any level of detail. And since there are no exams (besides one spit back \"Classic scores\" quiz), there's no real reason to pay attention in lecture\/do the readings. But having access to a lot of the readingsespecially the legal side of thingscould be useful later on if you want to pursue this.",
    "This course covered a lot of interesting topics, which was very coolI did like learning about the film and TV music industries, even though I don't have any interest in pursuing them. At the same time, my favorite part of the course was actually composing for the final project, which didn't get a lot of attention over the course of the semester until the very end.",
    "This course provided a solid overview of how the film music industry works. Because we covered a broad amount of material, we couldn't delve deeply into particular parts of film music, but it was helpful to get an overview from someone involved with the industry, since no other classes offer this kind of practical information. I think the organization of the course was appropriate.",
    "This course is excellent! The professor, Steve, is incredible! He is so kind, and he genuinely cares about his students and their career development. It was great to be able to learn from him, as an expert in the field.",
    "Strengths: Pretty interesting readings and a professor who knows the business inside and out. You will learn something new and useful and, if you're intent on actually pursuing a career in this area, you will gain connection(s) and will want to buy a whole bunch of the books that we cover. Class is equally accessible to people whether or not they can write music. Weaknesses: Professor has a tendency to ramble a bit. The final project gave students choice between writing a paper and composing using a DAW - would be helpful if earlier in the course, there was some kind of homework to force kids not used to working with DAWs to learn how to use them.",
    "This course is probably difficult for anyone without a musical background because some of the essays and related assignments involved knowing influences and musical history that wasnt taught. Important to note that if you dont have experience scoring, the final project is hard so choose to do an essay!",
    "I would have appreciated more class time each week in order to allow more in-depth exploration of each topicwe touched some issues at too much of a surface level for my liking. That said, the scope of topics provided a nice variety from week to week.",
    "I thought it was organized really well and the professor covered a great deal of material fairly efficiently."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in the field, it's probably the most useful of the film scoring classes that are sometimes offered (more practical knowledge, less theory\/history). I wouldn't really recommend it if you've done scoring before, since it's really a surface level look at a lot of things. But if you want a foundation in the craft, or you just want to see if you even like film scoring\/can even do it, than go ahead, it's an easy A.",
    "Definitely! Take this course if you like music, if you like movies, or just want to learn something new! The workload was honestly pretty minimal: weekly readings weren't too strenuous and the class discussions didn't rely too heavily on them, the midterm was straightforward (ten questions based on the lectures and readings), the score analysis paper was fun and easy to write, and the final project was a blast, although to be fair I had prior experience using Logic which helped a lot for the project. It was great to learn about so many different aspects of the music industry, and although I would have liked to spend a little more time on the composing aspect of the course, I did like that we got a balance of history, analysis, business, and creative projects.",
    "Yes! It is a very good course if you are interested in anything about film music! There are not any regular Yale music courses that cover this kind of material, so take this class if you get the chance.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was such a joy to come to class every week. I always looked forward to learning from Steve and hearing what he had to say each week. We were able to look at film music from many different angles and perspectives, which was fantastic. Having taken the course, I feel like I now have a much better understanding of film music as well as the music industry. This course should definitely be made available in the future for students!",
    "Yes! If you're even relatively interested in film or music or film music, do it!",
    "Yes! Even for students not studying film or music, there is a lot to learn about the film composition industry that is both interesting and applicable to any creative field.",
    "Take the course if you're interested in composing music professionally or pursuing a career in music-adjacent industries."
