    "I think this course help you know more about cryptosystem and help you grasp basic knowledge about module in math.",
    "I would recommend it. Cryptography is a very interesting topic with a wide variety of applications.",
    "recommend",
    "Yes, sure.",
    "The course provided a solid framework for cryptography. We started at its origins with Caesar Ciphers and other substitution ciphers. Then, we discussed AES, DES, and public key crypto (RSA, ElGamal). Lastly, we tackled more recent innovations like Tor, homomorphic encryption, and Bitcoin. The course is more of a survey course in the following sense: We discuss the math and some proofs behind why each system works. However, we don't ever have to perform detailed proofs nor write the systems ourselves. In this sense, it is a good course if you are looking for an intro or overview of crypto. It is not as good if you are already fairly knowledgeable and want to dive deeper."

    "Cryptography is an important aspect of cs.",
    "Every field of CS has to worry about security. In that sense, the course is critical. What is more critical than the techniques is the security mindset. Oftentimes, simple precautions can make systems immensely more secure."
