   "comments": [
    "Basic calculus skills pertaining to integration, series and sequences, and thinking in three dimensional coordinate systems.",
    "Integral calculus and series.",
    "Good calculus class!",
    "I gained a good understanding of calculus.",
    "I think the course was a good, detailed calculus class. The applications of the material were not always as clear, but I left the class feeling much more comfortable with calculus, largely due to my instructor Kyle. While I enjoyed the class, I'm an economics major with an interest in political science and had hoped for more calculus helpful for social science. The course definitely has a more STEM focus.",
    "I learned to develop my problem solving skills.",
    "I learned a good overview of calculus 2. I did not get to see this knowledge applied to many real word scenarios, however.",
    "I learned some applications of integral calculus. I learned about sequences and series."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "For the most part, I enjoyed the flipped aspect of the course. However, occasionally concepts weren't made especially clear in the videos presenting the material, and only practice problems were done.",
    "The videos go over the most basic example of a concept, but then the prep problems are very hard because of this discrepancy between material taught in the video and questions asked. I liked how Kyle went over the concepts briefly in the beginning of class and then helped us work through problems.",
    "Parts of the problem sets were unnecessarily tedious. For example: Find the Midpoint, Left E, Right E, and Trapezoid estimations of this function with 10 intervals. HOW IS THIS HELPFUL? Clearly you want us to learn how to take different estimates, but you could asses our knowledge of them with only 2 or 3 intervals. If we can take these estimates with 3 intervals then we can certainly take them with 10 - it's just an extra HALF HOUR of ugly decimals and tedious arithmetic. Sure there are some other unnecessary parts of the p-sets but that question in particular was the stand-out most frustrating part of this entire course.",
    "The course does not support learning very well in the flipped-classroom format, but I was in a smaller section and our teacher was very open to helping us as much as he could, so that helped offset some of the disadvantages of the video based learning.",
    "I like the videos before class and the fact that section is small.",
    "Strengths: I personally thought that I had a fairly good professor: he was patient, willing to explain things countless amounts of time, created a fun, relaxed, and productive learning environment; review sessions were very helpful for studying for exams and everything; can't say the same thing about the other sections, but Kyle was a great friend and professor and I'm going to miss him a lot when he leaves Weaknesses: everyone really hates flipped classroom and I'm under the impressiont that if you don't have any Calc II exposure, you really need to invest a lot of time and effort into learning and absorbing the new material; videos for flipped classroom does not help at all (questions and mini-lectures in class definitely need to supplement), video project to answer exam questions not really helpful either",
    "The videos are not very helpful and the flipped-class system clearly DOES NOT work! Please stop this.",
    "I thought my TA did a fantastic job at facilitating learning but I don't feel that the flipped classroom method added that much to my learning. I never really ended up understanding the concept until being re-taught it the next day. It felt like unnecessary work to me.",
    "FlIpped classroom fails once the in-class instructor is poor. However, mine was an excellent teacher and therefore I was able to learn everything and feel comfortable working with the material. The online videos were sometimes helpful, but often just trash. The course is organized very well and I like the order in which we covered things.",
    "The small classroom size was perfect for me.",
    "The flipped classroom online learning made it a lot harder to learn the material and do the work.",
    "Strengths of this course include it's weekly videos. They were always accesible and they were easy to learn off of. Weaknesses include the flipped classroom approach to learning. I did not find it helpful. I prefer a lecture classroom.",
    "I didn't particularly like the flipped classroom format of this course. I learned much better from my instructor than from the online videos. The prep problems were particularly frustrating because they often required a more in-depth understanding of the material than what one could gain from watching a short introductory video. I liked my section's small size and our great instructor. I felt like I was able to connect with the professor and the other students more closely than in other courses, and this connection helped me do better in the class. It was also very easy to ask questions and receive feedback in class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes; the material was enjoyable to learn and the classroom setting was enjoyable to be in.",
    "A lot of majors require this class. Just be prepared to spend time learning the concepts and doing the psets.",
    "I would recommend this course in general, but it won't be as good as it was this semester because Kyle Luh is moving to Harvard.",
    "Sure, take it for the math credit. A lot of time was spent on sequences and series which was not fun, but the rest of calc is.",
    "Yes, for beginners in calculus.",
    "Unless you need to take this as a prerequisite or something, I feel like there are better and other math classes to take. I was lucky to have a good teaching professor, but I feel like introductory math here at Yale isn't always the best. I really did not find flipped classroom productive at all, and I think that should change. I've talked to everyone in my section and the videos are not helping that much. Also, I've experienced most of the course material before, but I still had to put in a lot of work to extensively review things because the way the material was presented was not very concise and clear. Having a tutor is really good for this class, she really helped me clarify class material.",
    "It's a pre-req for many majors so you have no choice. Make sure you study from the book and do the worksheets because the videos are pretty bad. Much harder than 112.",
    "Yes, I thought this was a well-taught and manageable intro math course and I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially with my instructor!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they have an interest in calculus and\/or they are required to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, it has been my favorite at Yale so far. I loved learning with Kyle.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student only if they are willing to take a challenge and if they think it's necessary to take this math course.",
    "Math 115 is a required course for many majors and pre-professional programs. I wouldn't recommend it as a general QR credit, but if you have to take it for your program, find a small section with a good professor. The material isn't exceedingly difficult to understand if you attend class, watch the videos, and put in a little bit of studying on your own. I found my professor to be very accessible and excellent at making math engaging and fun, which was key for my success in the class."
