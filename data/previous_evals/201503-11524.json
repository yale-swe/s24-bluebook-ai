   "comments": [
    "This course approaches the music of Dmitry Shostakovich through a variety of analytical approaches, while encouraging a strong engagement with historical, political, and biographical context.",
    "The course is an overview of Shostakovich's life and music' the focus is on getting exposed to a wide range of his music rather than on analytical methods or theoretical issues, although both are covered to some extent as relevant.",
    "It's an intense courselots of reading and listening (all of which really needs to be done to get the most of the class). My most demanding course this semester in terms of written assignments and presentations, too. Theorists and composers will have an easier time than performers and historians, but there's a lot to learn for everyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to incoming students. The course offers many opportunities to study the composer, his life in detail and his compositions in depth. It's also helps the students practice his or her writing skills as well as analytical skills by analyzing compositions of the composer in writing in detail and papers with textual evidence.",
    "Excellent and thorough course on Shostakovich, but the student must be prepared for a heavy workload, with overwhelming amounts of reading and writing assignments.",
    "I would perhaps hesitate to recommend the course to a music student who is in performance, as it was clear that the course was ideally catered to those with a very strong background in music theory\/musicology. However, every student would learn a lot and benefit considerably from the course.",
    "Yes! Even if a student had no particular interest in Shostakovich, if there was any interest in 20th century music, Russian music, music and politics, or music and media, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a fellow student, but only if they have a prior interest in Shostakovich. This caveat has nothing to do with the professor or the method of teaching. I just know from experience that musicians tend to get a bit polarized when talking about this particular composer. But if they're willing to put in the work and reading time, then I would highly recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "A healthy balance of theory\/analysis and historical context in this course made for a productive semester that benefitted both the historians and the theorists in the course, not to mention the several performers we had among us. In addition to bolstering my research on the topical side, this course provided a great opportunity to further develop my analytical skills and to develop an ear for compositional patterning in this music.",
    "It was interesting to get more exposure to a composer who I am very familiar with in a certain sense but whose music I had never spent much time thinking about. It was also interesting to get exposed indirectly to Russian theorists from that time period",
    "I hadn't done much 20th century theory before (and it had been a long time since I studied theory at all), so the course was very useful in learning analytical techniques. Though I'm unlikely to work on Shostakovich-related topics for my dissertation, the historiographic problems involved in Soviet artistic hermeneutics are fascinating and my study of them will certainly influence my historiographic position as I move forward with my research.",
    "As a composer, this course ended up influencing my music. Whether that is for the better or for the worse is up for debate. But I always enjoy these kinds of classes because I think more light always needs to be shed on the life of the composer. It's refreshing to put aside the myths that circulate through concert programs and actually dive into the socio-political contexts under which a musician worked. This is the kind of depth that I want all of my course to explore. With regards to my own research and preparation for my thesis, this course has both given me a possible topic (the 15th symphony) as well as primed me for the hours and hours or research time that will soon be spent in the library."
