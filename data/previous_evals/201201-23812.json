   "comments": [
    "It is a practicum course. Would be very useful if you want to gain hands-on experience. A big asset to the summer internship finding.con: some of the lectures are a little boring. If give us more time to work on our project, that would be perfect",
    "Strengths: hands-on\/practical application, qualitative research skill building, doing something FOR the community, not just for academic purposesWeaknesses: not always the most efficient use of class time - some lectures were unhelpful or did not seem entirely relevant (e.g. power lecture). IRB process should have been started MUCH earlier.",
    "This is a great course and I would recommend it to others. Even though I have worked with community-based organizations and done community-based research before, I found this class to be really informative. I enjoyed working with a group of MPH students and working with a local organization, and would recommend this class to others.",
    "Before enrolling in the course, my understanding was that this course focused primarily on completing a community health project (as oppose to learning about techniques, methodology, etc. for this area of research). For this portion of the class - completing a community health project - I felt unprepared throughout the semester. The long class periods on Friday afternoons failed to provide adequate preparation for the projects, and our group relied mostly on the TA as well as prior knowledge of group members to carry out the project. I had trouble relating to many of the lectures that spanned from February - March (power relationships, leadership, etc.), and wished that this time could have been more focused on gaining an indepth understanding of the particular group projects.",
    "This course is a great opportunity to participate in community-based public health practice. It was my only opportunity this semester to go outside of the classroom to apply my skills in a concrete setting. The lectures are also very engaging.",
    "I think this course is very great. While the organization is a little bit wonky, and I honestly felt like some of the lectures I could have done without, this is a great introduction to working with a community organization. This is something you just can't learn by reading a book.",
    "okay",
    "I thought this course was good for those planning to enter into community-based public health work. Though I don't plan to work in community-based health soon, I enjoyed learning how to conduct projects from start to finish. I have acquired a lot of good skills in the class that can be applied to many other public health areas.However, this course was at times unorganized and unclear. There was a lot thrown upon us in the beginning and it was tough to make a plan of action for our project, especially since our project goals were unclear and actually part of a larger goal that we were not part of. Many things were rushed at the end of the semester that did not have to be. A large set back was the HIC protocol. Additionally, lectures were not always informative for me, personally. I often felt that I did not need a class to learn the objective and readings would have been enough.",
    "I loved the course. It was very practical which was refreshing since all my other courses were theoretical. Gave me a great sense of accomplishment to design and complete a research project, and made me feel like I was contributing to the New Haven community.",
    "I am very fortunate to have a great experience in this class and complete a project in the community. I think all student's should have to take this course so they can understand how to do community based research.",
    "Great course to get some real public health experience in planning and executing a community health project.",
    "This class offers a valuable opportunity to work on a community health project and produce a tangible report at the end. I felt like my group would have appreciated more guidance from each class session. The class sessions felt like seminars about various topics in community health planning that did not pertain to our projects at all. More guidance in terms of how to put together results or analyze qualitative data would have been helpful. The grading is very arbitrary but this class is more about the experience.",
    "It was a great opportunity, but the organization of the course was confusing. Many of the activities seemed like a waste of time, and very little of the course was used to complete our primary assignment. Also the organization and development of groups was not fair.",
    "I think that it is a great opportunity for students to engage in research. I think it might be more beneficial to begin the process in the fall. I also think that the lectures on community health programming should be a bit more applicable to the projects that we are working with. Perhaps exercises and assignments should be geared towards understanding the specific projects we work with.",
    "This is a good course, and one of the few courses here at Yale dedicated to communities rather than straight research.But it stands to get some tweaks, namely more organization and better communication with the placement sites.More class time should be devoted to working on projects in class. Many of the lectures (for example, power) are more suited for a class more philosophically oriented. This class is too short to be philosophical and practical in nature: there just isn't enough time.",
    "Strengths: engaging, good simulation of a community health consultancy, much-needed focus on qualitative methods, interesting projects, useful text book, knowledgable and passionate profWeaknesses: There was a lot of time that felt wasted in the classroom. Often the concepts addressed could have been covered in half or one quarter of the time. Also, many of the softer concepts were not explained clearly... at times it seemed deliberately so. Often in class I felt myself struggling to grasp what the purpose of that particular class was. Additionally, I think the IRBs should be submitted much earlier and projects should begin sooner.All in all, the idea of a community health program planning class is VERY important, but I think class time could be used more efficiently and the course could be better organized wih a clear list of topics to be covered, more organized handouts and syllabus, and earlier start of projects."

    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Prof Humphries is a great professor and I can't imagine this class being taught without her. I only wish that my group had gotten to spend more time with her and been able to get more direct feedback from her. We often met with and talked to our TA and got feedback from Prof Humphries via our TA, but it would have been useful to have more direct contact with Prof. Humphries.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0I wish that there could have been more class-time interaction with Dr. Humphries. While she responded quickly and helpfully to all questions, it would have been helpful to check it with her more frequently throughout the semester.Our group often felt confused and conflicted about expectations, assignments, and project tasks, and it would have been helpful to check-in with Dr. Humphries more frequently. The lectures and examples she provided, however, were generally informative and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0The instructor always provided excellent lectures and gave valuable feedback that helped us contextualize and appreciate our respective projects. Her style of lecturing makes concepts that are sometimes abstract or complex very accessible. I thoroughly enjoyed her classes.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is fantastic! She's so full of knowledge and fun to learn from. I really appreciated her expertise.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0The instructor, Dr. Humphries, was a good instructor with a lot of experience in the community-health setting. However, she was not always very flexible to meet with us and give more detailed instructions for the project.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie has a lot of experience which is great. She is approachable and is able to communicate well with students and also with the community counterparts.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Fun, quirky, and very helpful. I really wish she were there to help us at the end of class with group time instead of leaving to catch the train. Her insight can be really helpful.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Very knowledgeable, and very encouraging.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0She is really good and has great knowledge in Community health research. Very responsive to feedback and always makes an effort to improve the course.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie has a different teaching style than other professors I've had at YSPH. She stimulates more critical thinking and most classes are discussion based, which is nice because you get to take part in shaping the class experience.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries is a great professor. I enjoy her lectures and the way she teaches her classes. I think that the class could improve by being a bit more focused and applicable to the projects that are being dealt with.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries is definitely committed to the work she does and to inspiring students to be committed to people and community.However, she relies a little too much on her TAs to run interference between herself and her students. She has a lot of experience and wisdom to offer, but she tries to convey it via lectures, where the message gets lost. If she spent more time working with the groups as they work through issues, and instead invite a few guest speakers to give a couple lectures, there would bea little more balance in the class.Additionally, it's not clear to me why the TAs are required to come to class when they themselves admit that they are just 'screwing' around on their computers most of the time.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is has knowledge, passion, and great experience in community health research and programs. I only wish we could have gained more from her wealth of experience through more group meeting time with Debbie and more class-based discussion wih her. Her lectures are very interesting, though often disorganized. She is excellent in a question and answer setting."

    "My TA for the course was Stephanie Platis. She was a wonderful resource to our group throughout the semester, and provided substantial amounts of productive feedback!",
    "The TA, Stephanie Platis, was excellent. She was involved in every step of our project and very responsive by email. She also gave us valuable feedback whenever we needed it. Though she must have had a busy schedule as a second year MPH student, she always took the time to provide detailed and helpful comments.",

    "Britton was great. She was very helpful and always willing to run through things with us and revise our work.",
    "Britton Gibson was an excellent TA. She was extremely attentive and helpful both in and out of class. I really enjoyed having her help us through the whole process.",
    "Britton was an awesome TA! Helped us at every step of making our project possible.",
    "Katie: Is very helpful and has given good feedback when required.Other two TA's Britton and Steph were good too.",
    "The TAs, Katie Lamonaca, Britton Gibson, and Stephanie Platis, were the most valuable part of this course in my opinion because they are the ones who work closest with you on each individual project. Though each project has an assigned TA, the other TAs not part of my project were very willing to help when I approached them with questions. They've had experience in the class previously, so their input was very valuable.",
    "Stephanie was great. She was incredibly helpful. She provided immediate feedback for our group.",
    "Stephanie Platis was a great TA, but was probably a little too busy to provide the kind of assistance Humphries expected her to provide. She did offer good perspective and guidance when she was needed.",

    "Highly recommend!",
    "Learning to docommunity-based participatory research. It's a mix of learning the academic (e.g. qualitative data analysis, logic model building) and the practical (working directly with community organizations to meet their needs). Very time-intensive and involves heavy collaboration with other students in the group.",
    "This course is an excellent opportunity that you should take advantage of.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a touch course. Working with a group is truly challenging and working with a community organization is off the charts. But for me what I learned was truly invaluable, and now that I'm on theother end I wouldn't take it back.",
    "you'll learn a lot but expect your project to take over your life. this course should be worth 2 units.",
    "This course teaches you how to conduct and carry out a community-based public health evaluation\/ intervention that is a very practical application of public health skills.",
    "It is a great way to gain some practical experience and I would definitely recommend it",
    "A lot of work, but very rewarding.",
    "Great experience! Also, learn different organizations working in New Haven regarding health, and provides a good insight on how community can be an important part of public health.",
    "I would recommend it to have a general overview of CHP and research plus have a practical experience of public health practice.",
    "This class is more about the experience of working in a team on a community health project. I gained much more from my project than I did from the class sessions, but having a class that forces you to complete a project in a time frame and that gives you guidance is useful.",
    "I think the course really is different according to the group you get assigned to and what your project is. It seems like some groups do much more or less work than other groups. Feedback was also not given so it is difficult to determine a grade.",
    "I would recommend it. I think I learned many useful skills.",
    "A worthwhile course that will probably drive you crazy. Take it anyway, similar opportunities are few and far between at YSPH.",
    "The first half of this course is a slow-paced overview of concepts, frameworks, and tools for community health (ranging from very practical to somewhat esoteric). The second half is a mad scramble to carry out the projects we have been planning and apply the tools he have been learning. The projects are highly rewarding, but the time is short."
