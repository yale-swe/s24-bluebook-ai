    "I learned how to form a thesis (original, corrective, contestable) that would be effective in writing a paper as well as ways to structure papers. This class was definitely a good class to take as an introductory course to what college classes expect out of a paper.",
    "Over the duration of this course, I developed new points of view on the issue of censorship that I thought I would never have. I also feel as though my writing skills and effectiveness as a communicator in making a well-developed argument were strengthened during this course.",
    "I learned how to write a good essay and analyze complicated texts.",
    "Great introductory writing class! The course teaches you the basics of academic writing research and skills for close reading and text analysis.",
    "The course was incredibly helpful. It taught skills in writing, researching and analytical thinking. The course material (namely, censorship in art) was incredibly interesting and thought provoking.",
    "I improved my argumentative writing skills, especially writing strong theses and supporting them with effective evidence."

    "I think there could've been more room for discussion at some points.",
    "strengths: relevant, interesting readings; clear, workable essay prompts weaknesses: some of the readings are bit unnecessarily long",
    "I think the major strength was Professor Robinson, who was very helpful and always available. I cannot think of any major weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely. Even though every high school is different, I feel like there's certain expectations for papers in college that weren't as emphasized and this class was a great transition to writing at a college level. Also, since you get to choose a topic you're personally interested in, it made the class even more interesting because you really didn't have to write papers about topics you didn't want to. Even within the class, there was pretty good leeway to choose your own topics within the wider section topic.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it is a very intellectually stimulating class while simultaneously having a very manageable workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, because it was unique, interesting, and not too intensive. Great introductory English course!",
    "Absolutely! The course is a great introductory writing class. It helps you develop skills that will be useful in any other writing class you take. It also teaches other important academic skills such as research and reading techniques. Professor Robinson is a great professor. The readings for the class are very interesting and relevant to the topic. It is important to note that (as Professor Robinson himself says) the course is very front loaded. Starting with lengthy research papers and court cases and leading to news articles.",
    "This is a great, great class. ENGL 114 is a very helpful class to take at Yale simply because so many Yale classes require a high level of writing. Having spoken to other students in ENGL 114 sections, I can say that Professor Robinson's section gave its students the best experience. The topic is so interesting and incredibly pertinent. A great introduction to researching and fully understanding a topic. Prof. Robinson is a fantastic teacher. And, he is one of the few professors who teach 114. (Most sections are taught by grad students). Really great class.",
    "Yes. My section of English 114 was an excellent writing seminar; however, I have heard from friends that the quality of the class depends greatly on the professor teaching the section."
