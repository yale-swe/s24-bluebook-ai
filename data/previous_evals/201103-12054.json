    "For me, this course was a do-over of DS. I was not the greatest student as a freshmen, and this course allowed me to reexamine the texts that were wasted on me two years prior.The interplay between Profs. Smith and Garsten is a bit overstated. It would have been much more interested to see the points of disagreement between the two, if only so students could understand the different ways to interpret these texts, but that very rarely (never?) occured.The workload for this course is the exact same as DS, and the grading works the same way as well (i.e. scare tactics for paper 1, smooth sailing, largely, for the other 2).I have mixed feelings about recommending this course. If you want an excuse to read the texts again, go for it, but if you are hoping for some kind of intellectual relevation---I don't know if this course is right for you.",
    "Ancient Polyphil attempts to be an extension of first semester DS H&P. It only somewhat succeeds. I could have accomplished the same goals as this class doing a directed reading of the same material without the headache of writing difficult and unrewarding essays or going to sometimes informative and mostly boring lectures. With reform in the lectures and essay topics this class could be extremely rewarding, but in it's current state I can't recommend it.",
    "Good in-depth survey course of ancient political philosophy, covering greek, roman, medieval and christian philosophy. There is lots of variety, but also ways to tie it all together. Recommend it if you've got the basics of political philosophy down, you'll probably get more out of it that way. Don't be discouraged if you haven't taken political philosophy before - you'll just have to really keep on top of the readings and learn how to write a philosophy paper. Not impossible, but definitely more challenging.",
    "Take this class. But be prepared to either get mediocre grades or take it C\/D\/F. The lectures are fantastic, sections were a joy, but you are graded on the papers and its impossible to do well on them. Literally the top kids from three years of DS were in this class and no one did well. (I mean, maybe they scaled it-- we haven't gotten our grades yet....)Anyone who loved HP or felt that they could have loved HP if it weren't so all over the place should definitely take this class. It was just wonderful and inspiring and really dealt with serious questions about government and justice and rhetoric and law and religion and...everything important!Also, this year's class was a trial-run. This had never been taught before. Probably a lot of us have complaints about how the class was organized-- that there was little reading sometimes and an enormous amount at other points, etc. Smith and Garsten are very conscious that this was a trial-run, and I actually think they are going to take the evaluations of this class seriously and make some structural changes. So don't let our complaints convince you to not take the class (though really do CDF it just in case.)",
    "Hard!",
    "The course has hard grading, mixed lectures and an interesting syllabus. Not recommendable.",
    "Both professors are excellent. You'll really engage with these wonderful texts. The class wasn't run well, but if they offer it again, they'll probably have worked out some of the kinks. Make sure you know what type of paper they want."
