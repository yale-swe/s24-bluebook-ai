   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for anyone looking to fill the language requirement. It really helps your Spanish, just be careful what teacher you have. Mine was amazing but I hear that not all of them are as wonderful.",
    "You learn vocab, grammar, and culture about the Spanish language. I would recommend it if you are interested in learning the language.",
    "The class was largely within expectations. Sra. Mombell is great - definitely take the course with her if you get the opportunity to. Her class is one of the most engaging I've had here at Yale.",
    "Covers through grammar learned in high school Spanish and extensive vocabulary. It definitely helps improve conversation skills.",
    "If my experience was representative, expect Spanish 120 to be a well-organized and rapid furtherment of your language skills, reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Particularly with an enthusiastic teacher, the class is great, especially near the end when we read passages from Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Cervantes' Don Quixote. I would absolutely recommend Span 120 to anyone with any desire to learn the language.",
    "Well, there is no other option if you're on the track.",
    "The course is not difficult as long as you study for the periodic examinations and quizzes. There are a lot of grades throughout the semester for a variety of tests and assignments and presentations. Workload varies each night but there is virtually always work each night, although it most often does not take very long."
