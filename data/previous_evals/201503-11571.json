   "comments": [
    "The course provides an overview of still life, interior, and figure drawing. It allows the class to explore the process of mark making in an engaging way. Highly recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I would descibe it as being good for people who haven't drawn before, but also for people who know how to draw and are looking to refresh\/refine their skills.",
    "Really great class! My drawing definitely improved a lot over the course of the semester. Definitely worth taking, even if just to balance out a course load and to give yourself a chance to use a different part of your brain.",
    "Basic drawing was a good class. Good size, good energy, proper workload. I think there was a bit too much of a stress on making an \"interesting\" drawing compared to actually building drawing skill.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a cool course where you do a lot and learn how to see and draw without it being overwhelming.",
    "Anna's section is accessible to people of all abilities! Very approachable and low-stress.",
    "I would. It improved my drawing skills and loved having that class.",
    "If you're only looking to improve your technique, take this class with a different professor. If you're looking to learn how to use drawing as a tool for making art, take it with Professor Betbeze. The class is pretty easy, but be warned that you'll barely learn any techniques for drawing better. The improvement you'll see will really only be through repeated practice.",
    "It's a good way to improve or practice your art skills and is definitely a worthwhile class. I would definitely recommend the class, since other students may want this opportunity to explore their creativity once in a while.",
    "Demanding, rewarding and full of encouraging opportunities for personal discovery in work. I would highly recommend professor Betbeze for students of all levels as they will find opportunities within the course to grow and improve at whatever level of experience they may have.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class. It's an excellent place to start for beginners, although I'm sure it's also valuable to those who have more experience. Assignments are really flexible. Watching the quality of art improve over the course of the semester is awesome. I also really enjoyed drawing in different locations around campus (YUAG, Woolsey, Sterling). I definitely am coming away from this course seeing things in a new way.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking to become more confident in his or her own artistic abilities. Some of the assignments might seem difficult to do depending on one's skill level, but each student focuses on overall improvement."
