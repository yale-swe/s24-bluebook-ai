    "I would definitely recommend portuguese 112 to another student. I would tell them that it is a super interesting and dynamic way to learn another language, as well as to learn about the culture of Brazil.",
    "This is a great class! You learn a lot, but it is also really easy to do well in. Overall, it felt like a very natural and practical approach to learning language, as opposed to being a class where you just memorize obscure vocabulary lists.",
    "The class is fine, but I would recommend taking another language, especially if you are not a native Spanish speaker. Be aware that if you are not a native speaker, the class may be detrimental to your Spanish skills. The class isn't much work and Marta is very laid back."
