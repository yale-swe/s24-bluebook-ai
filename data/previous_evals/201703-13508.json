    "a good set of statistical techniques and what (probably) resembles real life statistics analysis.",
    "I learned basic statistics and how to evaluate data to find the best statistical approach.",
    "Very practical statistical skills. I have already used a lot of them in my research this semester. Essential course for graduate school.",
    "A good grip of basic statistics, will be helpful as an environmental practitioner.",
    "I learned a lot about statistics and how to apply them to real life situations or use them in my own research!",
    "I learned so much in Intro. to Stats this semester! I am now able to effectively analyze the statistical significance of P-values and R-squared in data. I can also generate statistical analyses from MINITAB that I can incorporate into reports and projects in other courses.",
    "I learned the basic concepts of statistics in this class. I now feel more comfortable with seeing statistical results in scientific papers, and start thinking about any issues they might have.",
    "I developed a grasp and familiarity with statistics that was new and deepened my understanding of analysis approaches and methods. I have the skills now to use statistical methods and approaches to analyzing data and results, and also conducting experiments that I wouldn't have been able to do prior to the class. This has opened my brain to new avenues of thinking and it has been inspiring. I've developed new insights by way of the analysis methods and only hope that I get to continue using these skills and this knowledge to sharpen the insights I can derive from future projects.",
    "I received excellent instruction in the basics of statistics, and I am very excited to take my education in statistics much further because of this class.",
    "Deeper understanding of statistical methods and better knowledge of R programming.",
    "I learned tools for statistical analysis, and some of the mathematical concepts underlying these tools. I learned how to use Minitab.",
    "I audited this class. I took away some skills.",
    "This was a great introduction to the basics of Statistics, and applied through the use of statistical software."

   "comments": [
    "very well",
    "The class perfectly met my expectations.",
    "There was much more to learn than I had anticipated. The professor did an excellent job fitting everything in without it feeling like topics were brushed over.",
    "Covered the content that I thought we would, and went a little further at the end of the term which was nice.",
    "They far exceeded my expectations.",
    "I took the class expecting just the basics, and that's what I got. So I was happy with the class.",
    "By the end of the class I was able to gain knowledge and skills that aligned with my expectations. This however did not build gradually over the course, and rather came crashing into my mind near the end of the term as I approached the final project. I felt a bit like the exercises in the earlier part of the course were not as contextualized as those in the end, so my expectations were not met in the beginning, but were met as the course blossomed.",
    "It fit in well with my expectations.",
    "Met my expectations and course structure (flipped) and teaching was better than expected.",
    "Exceeded my expectations. I have a better understanding of statistics than I expected, which has helped me read papers and conduct project work for other classes.",
    "Well",
    "Yes, absolutely. I've taken introductory statistics before, and this was an exceptional course. Very clear and everything really came together for me."

   "comments": [
    "I really like the hands-on nature of the class. all the assignment and exams were aimed at facilitating more learning testing just for the sake of grades",
    "I loved taking the flipped course format for statistics - it has been my favorite course thus far. The videos before class allowed me to learn at my own pace, the pre-class quizzes identified holes in my understanding, and class time itself allowed for very hands-on learning. I was able to ask questions about specific points and learn from my peer's questions as well. The hands-on time in class working through problems helped solidify concepts.",
    "I took the flipped class and really enjoyed that format.",
    "Flipped class allowed us to learn at our own pace, instructor was helpful and available.",
    "Strengths: -Clarity in instruction -Course structure -Interesting assignments Weaknesses: -N\/A I loved this class.",
    "Jonathan is an amazing professor!",
    "I liked the flipped setup of the course. I liked that I could pause lectures, digest, go back, and continue.",
    "For me, the flipped class was not an ideal way to learn the material. I found myself constantly spending more time than I would've liked being confused about the material while watching the recorded lectures, which I could have easily averted by being in a class setting where I could simply ask and clarify my understanding. This is not a knock on the course however, as it was well put together generally. The one recommendation I have is to synch up the video slides with those that are provided in the course materials. This was not always the case and made it difficult at times to follow along with the appropriate lesson or slide deck.",
    "Jonathon is awesome. His passsion and knowledge really shine through.",
    "Major strength is opportunity to discuss material and do practice problems in a small group due to the flipped nature. More quizzes after each lecture would be helpful.",
    "Mostly strengths. This class was very well taught. I enjoyed the flipped section - I found the pre-class quiz helpful, and I liked analyzing datasets with direct professor and TF feedback. The overall class structure was logical, and we covered a lot of material in good depth. The notes are helpful, although summary slides for different concepts (consolidating key formulas and concepts) would be helpful - especially because I will use the notes for statistics work that I do going forward. The exams and homework were very good, and the feedback was excellent.",
    "I loved the flipped style.",
    "I loved the flipped version of the class, because it allowed access to Jonathan while using minitab in class for practice problems. This really increased my understanding of the software and allowed me to focus on the statistics not figuring out the functions of the program."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the flipped version if you are comfortable with more self-learning",
    "I would recommend that all Forestry students take the flipped stats course, regardless of their focus during school. Flipped stats is the most effective way to learn the topic and sets you up for success in all other courses. You can learn at your own pace, and Professor Reuning-Scherer is oustanding.",
    "Must take! It helps immensely for any work involving data.",
    "Don't fall behind.",
    "Be ready to have a great time learning stats!",
    "Give yourself ample time to complete assignments. If you rush, it will not be to your advantage.",
    "Go see the TFs! They'll help you with the homework, but only in ways that help you learn.",
    "This is a foundational skills course, so if you haven't had statistics it is worth taking it to expand your exposure and understanding on the issue. If you already have statistics background then you don't need this class.",
    "Yes",
    "Take it! I learned much more than in other stats classes because of high teaching quality and hands on learning.",
    "Brainstorm project ideas early. Work with a dataset that you care about.",
    "I highly recommend for anyone with a fuzzy understanding of statistics who wants to be able to do basic calculations and analysis. The course is designed for you to walk away with basic skills that I think would be useful in a wide range of work environments."
