   "comments": [
    "Take it! It's a lot of work at first, but the instructors are so nice and each class is extremely well crafted. You won't regret it.",
    "This class is a lot of work but a lot of fun, so I highly recommend it!",
    "Phenomenal how a class can have such an enthusiastic community around learning its material. This is really one-of-a-kind at Yale in that all the students are so supportive of each other and become good friends\u2014even if they're not in the same section. The pedagogy is also incredibly sound; I felt I learned a tremendous amount of difficult material given the amount of time I put in. Highly recommended, even as a way to stretch your mind to learn something fun and new.",
    "If you want to learn Japanese and have a great time while doing it, this is the class for you. It's a commitment and there's a lot of work but the teachers are great and you progress incredibly quickly.",
    "It's a work-intensive class, but worth it. The amount of material you learn is incredible and the class itself was my favorite class I've taken so far at Yale.",
    "If you want a challenging class and are willing to speak even when you aren't sure you are communicating correctly, you will find that japanese L1\/L2 is a very fun and rewarding experience. It probably has been my favorite class so far. IT's also a great way to meet people from all different grades\/backgrounds.",
    "Continuation of JAPN 110 but the grammar gets more complex. You either need to have a lot of time on your hands, or be able to take it credit\/D. This class is a lot of work. You feel so satisfied, but it is truly a struggle if you don't have enough\/a lot of time.",
    "This class continues much like L1 did, with a lot more fun videos and music videos to watch and learn from. The sensees continue to be awesome and very patient, and while the grammar really picks up speed from L1, everything remains just as fun and engaging as last semester. There's a lot more new vocab to learn compared to last semester, and it is very easy to fall behind on the grammar structures if you don't study it regularly. Very fun class on the whole, and your classmates become some of your closest friends here at Yale. Great course with great teachers.",
    "There isn't much of a choice to take this class if you endured through L1, but definitely go into it with enthusiasm. As hard as this class is, it is FUN. There is a ton of homework, but this semester more than L1, the homework is watching drama, anime, or movies, because you can actually understand a good deal of it at this point. It is truly amazing to see how far I've come in a language in 8 months after no prior knowledge, and I'm far from being the best in the class. The program is superb, but it can feel like it is taking over your life at some points.",
    "It was a great class!! However, you have to be prepared for the work load and you can't slack off because once you do, you'll fall far behind in the class.",
    "If you're taking this course, it's because you took the first half, so it doesn't make much sense to review it now...",
    "I don't know how much this characterizes the foreign language programs at Yale, but JAPN 120 is the best course I've taken at Yale so far. Make no mistake; the class is challenging. If you do not put in the hours to study the material, you will fall behind very, very quickly. You will learn a ton of material though! It's a bit shocking to see how far you've come in a single semester. Moreover, your professors truly care about you and will happily chat with you on the street as well. Additionally, the Japanese classmates you practice with everyday will soon become your friends; my year, the JAPN 120 students were like a huge family, even going to karaoke to celebrate! The class is challenging, but for the relationships and experiences I got out of it, it was totally worth it. :)"
