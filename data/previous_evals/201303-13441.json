    "YES. Absolutely take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "This course is an exploration of Hip-Hop in all of its cultural manifestations: Rapping, Breaking, Graffiti, DJ'ing, and Knowledge. You will both look at the origins of these concepts, as well as where they have taken us today.I'd strongly encourage those looking at hip-hop in the modern day to take this course as well, too many interesting discussions came out of this class.",
    "Less like a seminar and more like a conversation among hip-hop aficionados and newbies alike. Nick, the instructor, is great and is really passionate about hip-hop. The class structure was fluid and so chill. Recommended for anyone with even the faintest interest in music and its relation to the larger culture.",
    "If you want to learn about hip-hop, this is a good place to start. But don't expect a strict, chronological, formal education in hip-hop culture. You get a general idea of it, then the class talks about current hip-hop culture (Kanye West, Miley Cyrus (lol)) without much of a grounding in the race and gender politics of hip-hop. You do get the chance to do a coool creative project, though, and the students in the class are creative and interesting. The Professor is extremely laid back--that can be good or bad, depending on how structured you like your courses.",
    "An overview of the history and foundations of hip hop culture and how it pertains to the music today.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in learning about hip hop music and culture. Super low key and fun class that teaches you a lot if you're invested.",
    "I would definitely recommend Hip Hop Music& Culture to another student. If you like discussing hip hop for two hours a week in a casual setting with smart people, take this class!",
    "It's good. It's fun. It's fascinating. It's not too strenuous or hard. Take it.",
    "I definitely would recommend. Hopefully it is offered again next year.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the genre.",
    "Amazing class that covers everything from freestyling to graffiti art. The readings are interesting, but not necessary to take part in class discussions. Professor Conway definitely knows his stuff and encourages you all the way with your creative projects, which are really rewarding when you choose to something that interests you.",
    "Awesome!!!"
