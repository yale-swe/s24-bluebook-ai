The slides had some animation overwriting some information, and the PDF version provided to the students lacked this info, because it is literary covered by something else. The quality of the explanations also could be improved. Again, the use of slideshow, with the distilled formula is not how one should learn engineering. The method utilized was suitable for seminars, but the exam and problem sets required information often not provided at class or slides."
