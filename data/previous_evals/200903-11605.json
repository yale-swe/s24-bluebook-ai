    "Should definitely take it. Professor RS is great and will make all the hard concepts sound easier. Stay on top and attend classes. Lecture handouts are all you need for the first part of the course and make sure you study it in minute details to appreciate the more subtle points. Then you should be fine. But Take it, Professor RS is probably the best lectuerer I've had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it only if you have never taken a statistics class before. The material is definitely not interesting, but I guess it's stuff you should know. I really liked Prof Reuning-Scherer's teaching style, but Prof Wagner (who teaches the last 5 weeks of the course) was a very dry lecturer and taught us too much theory, rather than actually teaching us how to analyze data.",
    "Ummm, NO! If you're an EEB major, you have to take it, but Prof. Wagner is just terrible. He is confusing, and you end up learning pretty much nothing from this course.",
    "I liked stat. The big lecture is absolutely worth taking. Bio section gets sort of hard (ANOVA=not exciting and very complicated), but I still liked Professor Wagner a lot.",
    "MCDB 215 is a great introduction to statistics taught by unusually engaging professors. Generally the material is not too difficult to understand and the workload is fairly light, but you learn math with real world, obvious applications. The first half of the course is taught as a big lecture and can be somewhat elementary,but the professor has a great sense of humor and somehow makes sure everyone understands well. In the second half, I split into a biology section which had a nice smaller classroom feel. I certainly got a bit sick of ANOVA by the end, but overall the material was very much worth learning. I definitely recommend the class if you have not been exposed to statistics in the past.",
    "This course is a very good introduction to a subject that you'll need no matter where you go. Professor Reuning-Scherer is very entertaining, and Professor Wagner is funny and endearing. However, it's a lot of material, so if you actually want to learn and know the material, you'll have to do it on your own time; it's too much information for either teacher to effectively have us understand in class time. I would highly recommend it though; it's incredibly useful, and fun at the same time.",
    "If you need a stats class for your major, I would definitely take it with Jonathan Reuning-Scherer; he rocks! If I didn't have to take this class I wouldn't have, overall it was not a very enjoyable experience.",
    "Second half is crammed with too many topics. Wasn't a fan.",
    "If you want to learn about about analysis of statistical models, specifically as it relates to ecological studies then this is the class\/section for you.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it is absolutely necessary for a requirement. The course is difficult, boring, and tiresome.",
    "It is a decent class if you want to learn about statistical explanations of various biological experimental designs; unfortunately, it is not the most well-taught class in the world.",
    "a good, solid grounding in statistics for life sciences.",
    "I would recommend it. You learn so much it's bound to be useful no matter what you study.",
    "yes, only if you are interested in statistics. helps build a good foundation on statistics.",
    "I would definitely recommend Introduction to Statistics, but I wouldn't recommend STAT 101 unless you have to take it for your major or if you know you want to go into research and you'll need to know what you learn in the Life Sciences section. The first part of the course is as interesting as statistics can get, and it was surprisingly enjoyable. Professor Reuning-Scherer is great. The second part of the course was not nearly as good, though. The lectures were often difficult to follow and the material was not organized well.",
    "No! Don't take this course! It's not worth the misery and boredom you'll face if you choose this section over the many other sections that are available to you! I would rather cut off each of my fingers with a butter knife than recommend this class. To be fair, the first half of the course with Jonathan Reuning-Scherer was fine. His lectures were engaging and his lecture slides were extremely well-written. The midterms and homework were fair, although I found it odd that the multiple choice questions were worth so many points on the midterm (each one was worth 6% of the total test grade!). The course at least started on a good note with JDRS, but quickly went downhill from there.The first signs of how bad this course was came when we stopped receiving our graded homeworks from our T.A. after the fourth assignment. There were nine in total. We got assignments four through nine right before the final. The second midterm was also given back to us right before the final along with the homework, almost two months after we had taken the test! No one had an idea where his or her grade stood before the course withdraw deadline. I had to agonize over whether or not to drop the course because I didn't know how I was doing in the class. Most of the email entreaties that were sent to the T.A. were left unanswered, and those that were answered just had excuse after excuse about why he hadn't graded the homeworks or exam yet. The T.A.'s performance was abysmal and inexcusable. EEB 220 has been T.A.'ed by the same graduate student for the last couple of years, so it is likely that you'll have the same T.A. this time around. That does not bode well for you if you choose to take this section (God forbid!).The professor wasn't really any better, but at least he didn't grade our work. He spent great chunks of time going over incomprehensible mathematical derivations, none of which were on the final exam. The lectures were rambling, incoherent, soporific, and confusing. We spent weeks on ANOVA and other topics, and I can't even tell you what ANOVA is. The professor didn't do a good job of explaining the purpose of the equations and models: he spent too much time trying to derive them, confusing us even further. This is one of the few classes I can think of where going to class is actually detrimental to your understanding of the material. You'll just end up more confused by going to class. Solution? Don't go to class. Study for the final on your own. The final is actually pretty easy, but don't think of it as a plus. Even if you know the material, everyone else will do well on it and it will be graded harshly. I was surprised when I saw my low final grade as I thought I had done well on it. In sum, the T.A. and professor should be replaced if this section to continue.But you don't have to go through any of this if you choose another section. If you're an EEB major, see if the medicine or data analysis sections can substitute for this class. Take my evaluation seriously. I didn't take the previous years' evaluations of this course seriously , and I seriously regret that.",
    "It was a very good course. The material was actually interesting and the professors (JRS and Gunter Wagner) were terrific. If you have any need or interest, take it."
