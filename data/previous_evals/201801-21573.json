   "comments": [
    "I learned actually so much about cell bio",
    "Everything there is to know about the cell. Very comprehensive.",
    "This course taught me a ton about cell biology. It also provides good foundational information about research processes and methods. I gained a ton of appreciation for the field of cell biology.",
    "I developed a very strong basis in cell biology, and feel much more prepared to take all other biology courses.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about cell biology",
    "Comprehensive molecular-level look at the biology of the eukaryotic cell. Mechanistic understanding of (sooooo many) cellular processes.",
    "I learnt a lot as there is an awful lot of information in this class. Initially I found it difficult to make the links between topics as each lecture was so specific to a certain topic but by the end of the semester I started to connect concepts together.",
    "I learned about various topics concerning Cell Biology. I learned an immense amount of information about how the cell functions.",
    "I learned so much about cell biology. I have never learned so much material in one course, but I learned the basics of almost every process in the cell. It is information that continues to pop up in my research lab and has really helped me better understand the work I am doing. I also feel like I better understand some larger processes at work when I do thinks like exercise because we learned so much at the cellular level.",
    "I feel like I gained a very in-depth overview of cellular biology. I \"learned to swim\" as Dr. Pollard would say. Of course it was impossible to memorize all of the material, but I know that in the future, I have enough background information to get by and learn concepts on a deeper level.",
    "This was a very comprehensive and in-depth class on the biology of the cell. I felt like a lot of information was taught and that my understanding of the mechanisms within a cell is much greater after taking this course.",
    "I learned in much greater depth various topics of cell biology.",
    "Haha lots of signaling pathways!!! This class was so interesting!",
    "I have learned important details about cellular mechanisms and how they are incorporated into physiological functions. We have learned how to design experiments using biological techniques like microscopy, FRAP, CRIPSR, etc, and applying the knowledge we have learned throughout the semester to explain biological phenomena.",
    "Good base knowledge for all of biology: different types of pumps, receptors, transcription and translation, the extracellular matrix, etc. Basically all of 101-104 in a more concentrated, in-depth, and systematic manner, with some added topics",
    "This course was a great overview of cell biology. We learned so many relevant things that will be helpful in future biology classes, research, and med school.",
    "Cell bio covered A LOT of material -- pretty much the entire spectrum of introductory cell biology (think DNA and chromatin, the nucleus and nuclear transport, cell signaling pathways and second messengers, fibers of the extracellular matrix, connective tissue and intro to the immune system, actin\/microtubules and myosin\/kinesin\/dynein, muscular contraction mechanism, neuronal synapses and action potentials, cell cycle and cell death) was covered over the course of the semester. We read all but one chapter of the book (which Professor Pollard authored himself), if that tells you anything.",
    "I learned so much about cell biology and how to memorize things in very little time.",
    "I feel like I learned everything about the cell. Crazy how much knowledge you can fit into your brain.",
    "This was a great introduction to the mechanisms of biology - the material was well-presented and interesting.",
    "I gained a broad overview of cellular processes.",
    "I learned about the general principles that govern cells and how to apply those principles.",
    "Amazing class!!! Learned the basics of cell biology",
    "I gained insight on eukaryote evolution, DNA packaging, transcription, translation, signaling pathways, connective tissue, and other topics.",
    "The functioning of the cell on a very deep level.",
    "A great knowledge of cell biology.",
    "I learned about cell biology",
    "A lot of information about Cell Biology and how to deal with large amount of biological information effectively.",
    "I learned honestly more than i ever thought possible about cellular biology and how structural aspects of the cell lead to specific pathways and signaling that allows the body to work.",
    "What a whirlwind of a class! I am proud to say that I made it to the end of Cell Biology, because many people drop throughout the semester. I learned so SO much about the cell. Because of the incredible breadth of the course, I know that things I learned in this biology class will come up in every other biology class I take for the rest of my life. The first few weeks of this class were terrible for me, but around week 8 things finally clicked and I started understanding the underlying mechanisms and principles of cellular processes instead of the tiny details. This was the coolest feeling ever, and now I have a newfound understanding of how to digest large quantities of information. This class gave me so much appreciation for biology and for learning, even though from week to week it sometimes felt miserable. No other STEM class has given me such great insight into learning and appreciation of evolution. The biggest thing this class gave me was a love for biology, and an immense feeling of wonder about how much is out there that is yet to be discovered.",
    "I learned the various pathways and mechanisms that allow a cell to live and proliferate. I also learned fundamental skills to learn new topics in this field in the future.",
    "I learned about cell biology.",
    "I learned about the components of the cell, such as membrane, actin, transport pathway, etc.",
    "This class provided me with a strong foundation in Cell Biology for future coursework. I learned how to effectively study for biology courses, approach large volumes of material, and swim in the infinite sea of knowledge and ignorance.",
    "This class is mostly about memorization, so I guess I got better at that. The sections on the extracellular matrix and muscle\/nerve cells were interesting and actually seemed relevant.",
    "it was the most fulfilling but most difficult class i have ever taken. tread wisely.",
    "This course was an incredible introduction to the field of cell biology and a variety of sub-sections within it. The sheer amount of material that we covered in the class was staggering, and I feel that I am walking away with a greatly refined understanding of hundreds of biological concepts. Honestly, Professor Pollard and his team of instructors work together smoothly and provide a wonderful environment in which to learn cell biology. After taking this class, I am finding myself understanding scientific literature much more easily and am so thankful that I enrolled in MCDB 205.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Really liked the weekly quizzes, glad there weren't midterms.",
    "They do an amazing job of bringing in professionals in different fields of cell biology. I felt like each lecture was really taught by a world expert in that field. Megan King, Shirin Bahmanyar, David Breslow, and Thomas Pollard are actually amazing biologists. The approach to learning was exactly how biology should be taught, weekly quizzes were engaging and not too burdensome.",
    "The course is very stressful with weekly quizzes. However, I can not think of a better way to cover as much material as we did.",
    "I think that the weekly quiz format works really well because even though you put in a fair amount of time studying each week, it really pays off because you stay on top of the material and understand things really well. Major props to the peer tutors for helping me understand the material. Theres so much material covered during lecture that it can be overwhelming and unclear what to know (because its impossible to study\/learn\/know everything). It could be helpful to have starred slides that are just for extra knowledge\/not going to be tested or something.",
    "the lectures could be more engaging, maybe have more time for students to answer questions or draw things on the board.",
    "This course covers an immense amount of material, and I think could be improved by splitting it into two semesters. THIS COURSE WOULD BE PERFECT AS A YEAR LONG INTRODUCTORY SEQUENCE. The introductory biology sequence did not prepare me for any of the other biology courses I have taken, but this course is incredible with the amount of information covered. I highly recommend that the introductory biology sequence be removed, this be used instead, and HUMAN BIOLOGY COURSES BE ADDED!!",
    "Strengths are that weekly quizzes force you to stay on top of the material and the lecture packets are well organized and very helpful. Weaknesses are that there is so much material you cannot possibly learn it all and studying for each quiz and the final can be pretty overwhelming.",
    "Starting with strengths: MCDB 205 is super-well organized to facilitate learning a lot of material in not that much time. Really appreciated the condensed notes uploaded to canvas for each lecture, as well as the lectures themselves, given effectively by several really smart scientists teaching us about their areas of experience. The weekly quizzes were also effective -- much easier to process such a wide array of material one week at a time rather than in bulk. In terms of weaknesses, though, I felt like the level of engagement was very low -- sections were a good start for actually talking about the material, but just going over the material didn't seem like a worthwhile use of time. Every upper-level science class at Yale should be reading and discussing primary literature in section!!!! There is literally no excuse not to do this -- it's by far the most engaging way of learning the material, and the whole point of doing science is to apply it to real-world situations. Biology is empirical, not just theoretical -- demonstrate this by choosing relevant primary literature and discussing either in lecture or in section. See MCDB 200 for an example of a class that did this right -- I actually looked forward to going to section every week.",
    "The quizzes are pretty challenging and requires a lot of studying each week (60% of grade).",
    "A strength is that it really facilitates learning. Through the lecture guides, review questions, objectives, and discussion, you are really equipped with the tools you need to succeed. There are no weaknesses in my opinion! Only that the mic should have been a little louder because it was hard to hear sometimes during lecture.",
    "The strength is in the quiz structure of the course. It set a good pace and made you want to really understand the material. With the amount of information, it helped to have a focus for each week that you would understand and study well. There was no way to remember it all by the end of the course, but you had a decent understanding of all the different processes at play and learned a lot about how to think about these processes to minimize the amount you had to memorize.",
    "Sometimes the lectures had so much material that I could not take notes quickly enough and it was hard to pay attention because I was overwhelmed. However, I absolutely loved the course! The lectures were incredibly interesting, and the format of the weekly quizzes helped me to consistently review material and read the chapters. The discussion sections were helpful, although I often studied on Fridays\/during the weekends, so it was hard to come prepared to section even though I invested a lot of time in the course. I really wish we were told the average for each weekly quiz so it was easier to tell how we were doing in the class.",
    "This a challenging course, but it is very well organized and very fair in its assesments.",
    "It was great! I liked that we had a mix of professors teaching based on their areas of expertise!!",
    "I think the material taught is incredibly useful especially if you are in a biology related major. The quizzes are also a great part of the course because they help you stay on track, and although they cover only a week's material the material often relies on previous concepts learned so it is a good way of reviewing and applying knowledge. By the time the final came around, I felt more than prepared for it. Professor Pollard is great, but sometimes it is really hard to hear him so I would recommend sitting really close up front. Professor David was probably my least favorite, he went over the material really fast and used language that was extremely unnecessary to explain simple concepts.",
    "Strengths: Gives a very good base for all of biology. Systematic and organized w\/ a good amount of resources (discussion section, study guides, review sessions). The professors are all very knowledgable. Weaknesses: It is a TON of information. The final can feel especially daunting. Sometimes, the course material felt too much like a long list (types of receptors, types of pumps) than meaningful information. It would be more helpful to perhaps intersperse this information within the context of larger pathways.",
    "Strengths: extremely organized, so many resources provided (packets, slides, textbook), quizzes to keep you on track with studying Weaknesses: some of the professors were not clear lecturers, grades were not recorded on canvas so there wasnt much transparency",
    "This course packed a lot of material -- sometimes too much -- in at a lightning-fast pace. The weekly quizzes could be helpful in getting me to keep up with the new information, but they also became overwhelming when other classes' workloads picked up. I don't recommend taking cell bio with a heavy course schedule. This class should be your hardest class, by far, if you want to do well in it.",
    "I think that the material for this class is very interesting, but it was really just thrown at us at lightening speeds. I wish more time was spent on each topic, for I felt like I just memorized the material each week then had to dump it out for next week's material. I wish this course was spread over two semesters, just so we could have more time to really understand the material.",
    "Strengths: Everything comes together at the end of the course! Weaknesses: The quizzes were so exhausting and time-consuming, it felt like I had a midterm once a week.",
    "Strength: The course was organized in such as way that the knowledge you learn later on builds on the knowledge you learn in the beginning. This gives the course a sense of continuity. Weakness: There are too many details in this course. Doing well in the course is more about knowing what to study than actually studying. I spent a long time understanding the details of certain processes because it bothers me to just have a surface-level understanding. Unfortunately, I do not think this was the right way to approach the class and my grades suffered.",
    "I liked the weekly quizzes personally, and the powerpoint lectures don't bother me, although I know some people didn't like them.",
    "Great class! Loved the quiz structure, wish there was more guidance on the final though! Some lectures were too dense, Lots of self-teaching involved",
    "This course is highly organized. The textbook corresponds directly to the material in notes and tests. After each quiz, a handout with the answers is passed out. Professors always hand out note sheets or have them available online. I do wish the lectures had more content since they were mostly pictures.",
    "This course has a crazy amount of material to learn. But, it is organized so well for you to learn all of it. The weekly quizzes are actually helpful once you get used to them. The course is run really well.",
    "The strength is the depth and the quizzes make sure you are keeping up with material but we cover too much in too little time\/ the prof is not loud enough",
    "A lot of information but the class provided discussion sections, review sessions, and peer tutors to process it. Additionally, the weekly quizzes and their quick grading forced you to study the information soon after learning it. This greatly improved the amount learned.",
    "The quizzes ended up being more like exams which made studying hard, but it forced me to learn things as I went along which was very helpful come the final. It is a lot of material, but I do not know how you could get around that.",
    "Strengths: 1. Textbook is very well aligned with the course. Only problem is that some weeks there just arent enough hours to read all the chapters, so the study guides that Professor Pollard prints out are an excellent tool. 2. The review sessions on Monday nights were helpful and I felt a sense of unity with the rest of the class. 3. Tom Pollard is an extraordinary professor, and I would take any class he teaches regardless of subject because hes just that good. 4. Weekly quizzes are both a strength and a weakness. I think its the best system for a class like this that covers this much material (a midterm would be dreadful), but it does make your semester extremely exhausting. 5. Section is well structured by going over the review questions. Weaknesses: 1. Introducing new teachers at the beginning of the semester makes students stop coming to lecture, and makes the class feel slightly all-over-the place. 2. Sometimes the professors really zipped through the slides, which made it really hard to keep up. I would suggest that going over slightly less material might enhance the quality of instruction. 3. Some quiz questions were much more difficult than others",
    "It is very fast paced, and there is a lot of information. The weekly quizzes ensure that you have to keep up with the material every week, however it can be difficult to bring everything together for the final. I also really enjoyed having different professors teach different parts of the course, since I could meet more faculty members, and learn about their interests.",
    "This course was very strong at the start, but gradually became less engaging. By the end, nobody was taking notes. The initial focus on experiments and concepts was great, but it eventually became lost in details.",
    "I believe that this course was well constructed to learn a vast amount of information. The weekly quizzes made sure that I was keeping up with the lectures.",
    "A significant strength of this course are the faculty and teaching fellows for the course. They were approachable and accessible for the entirety of the course, and were always extremely well prepared for lecture and section. The quizzes were well written and unambiguous, and the lecture slides were easy to review. The textbook was also a major strength of the course; it provided excellent reference for the material.",
    "It seems to be perfectly well-taught, but the material is irredeemably boring. I'm not sure there's any real way to improve that.",
    "strength: you learn so much weak: you dont know your grade ever and you have to teach yourself the textbook",
    "WAY too much material and information crammed into one course. It eventually became way too overwhelming that it causes you to lose interest in the class and the material. Would have been better if they chose more important concepts and themes to focus on instead of packing so much information and detail into EVERY aspect of cell bio possible.",
    "Overall, this course is extremely strong. I am a fan of the teaching format and the weekly quizzes, and the final exam was a great test of how to apply the knowledge we amassed over the course of the semester to more comprehensive problems. The weakest portion of this course was the disconnect between some of the professors, and, personally, I was not a fan of Professor Bahmanyar's teaching style. I think this course will continue to improve over time, and I do not really have any additional recommendations.",
    "Strengths - comprehensive, well-organized, information clearly presented, regular quizzes with appropriate focus on understanding of concepts and processes rather than memorization Weaknesses\/improvements - large amount of information can be complex and difficult to follow at times"

    "Yes, the class gets a bad wrap but it's much more manageable than described",
    "Don't listen to people who say cell bio is an impossible course - it's totally fine. Take it, you won't regret it.",
    "Absolutely. One of the best bio courses at Yale.",
    "Yes. But the class is difficult. Although there is not that much time to be spent studying the material in pure hours, it sucks almost the entirety of Monday to dedicate to studying to this class with the review session. Emotionally tolling.",
    "Absolutely. People will try to scare you away from taking it because they will complain about the workload, but its really not that bad at all. Its a really good and interesting foundational course. Theres also so much course-based support that you will be totally fine and supported throughout the semester.",
    "Yes. this is the most well run bio class I have taken at Yale. Every professor is exceptionally knowledgeable and wiling to go the extra mile to explain things.",
    "This course is a must for anyone interested in biology, and gives you a very strong foundation for future study in MCDB.",
    "If you are willing to put the time in each week to study for the quizzes than take it! You will leave with an immense amount of knowledge.",
    "Definitely choose cell bio as one of your core courses if you're an MCDB major for the breadth and depth of the material alone. Also helps that one quiz a week is not bad at all -- workload is super manageable. Quizzes also force you to think like a scientist instead of just spitting out information, which is super valuable for the future. Highly recommend.",
    "Only if you need it for your major because it is difficult and time consuming.",
    "If you are interested in learning about cell biology, and also learning about scientific techniques and what is still unknown in this field, definitely take it. But be prepared!!! It was the hardest class I've taken at Yale because it goes so in depth and so much material is covered, so it is definitely a challenge. Probably 75% of my time spent studying this semester was allocated to this class because you need to learn so much. But, it's also very cool and rewarding and the professors and TAs are great!",
    "Yes. If you are interested in medicine or research, this is one of the best courses you will take. It teaches you so many different research tools and really makes you understand difficult pathways that are important in our bodies.",
    "Absolutely! The class is a lot of work, but you learn so much over the semester. The knowledge will be incredibly valuable for any future biology course!",
    "If you like biology and are willing to put in a lot of work, take this course!",
    "This course is a real doozy, but it is so satisfying when you are done -- I really feel that I have learned a lot, and my study habits have improved in taking this course.",
    "Yes! It's a lot of fun learning about the processes that happen within our body!!",
    "If you are passionate about biology and are planning to take higher courses, this class is a must. Risk it for the biscuit.",
    "Yes! This is one of the best bio lectures. It gives you an incredibly solid basis of research and further, more specific biology. You will go over things like different types of pumps, receptors, transcription and translation, the extracellular matrix, the GTPase cycle + also more interesting pathways like how vision works, how the neuromuscular junction works, etc. All the professors are experts in their field, especially Pollard, who wrote the textbook. It is quite a bit of memorization though and some lectures can feel dull because they are just extensive lists (i.e. types of receptors, types of channels). The quizzes are all very fair, but you have to make sure to keep up. The class is very organized. Not a wildly exciting class, but a really solid one.",
    "This is an essential class to take if youre majoring in biology. It seems like a lot of work because of the weekly quizzes, but its not really that much more than any other biology class it only seems like a lot because you have to constantly study throughout the semester instead of just cram before an exam.",
    "I recommend this class for a good foundation in all important aspects of cell biology, but if you're going to take it, do so knowing that it's going to be tough and overwhelming and will consume your mental stability during finals period! I can't stress enough the importance of getting started early studying for the final, but even I couldn't follow through with that because of other papers and final exams. So plan your schedule wisely, knowing that cell bio is going to take you ages to review for. The final exam is comprehensive.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in biology, for it's a really great class. But I would only recommend it if you're willing to work really hard across the entire semester.",
    "If you want to learn cell biology, this is the course, but plan your schedule accordingly.",
    "Only if you like memorization.",
    "I would for sure recommend this course. I don't think it's as hard as people think",
    "no",
    "Yes! Great class if you put in the work",
    "I would recommend this course to another student due to the remarkable amount of biological knowledge you acquire in a short time frame.",
    "I would definitely recommended this course. After the introductory bio sequence, I really didnt think I liked biology anymore. But this course made my realize I still really enjoy biology and find it interesting. This course showed me I still really liked biology. Yes it is a lot of work, but if you put in the time, this course is extremely worthwhile.",
    "Yes, it is a great course that can be taken for MCAT preparation. I am MBB and still got a lot out of it.",
    "Yeah if you are a mcdb only though",
    "Yes but only if they are ready for the workload.",
    "Absolutely. If you have any interest in biology whatsoever, this is ground zero for how every other branch of biology works. All interested should take it.",
    "Yea. I didnt end up going to a single lecture, but cramming before the exam really made me wish I did because I fell in love with the material. This class is a lot of fun, and if you put in effort, it will be easy.",
    "Yes, you are learning from one of the biggest experts in the field-- what an honor.",
    "Absolutely yes, but this course is not for the faint-hearted. No one lecture is impossible to understand, but all the information all at once is quite overwhelming. This course requires that you learn all the information presented and then apply it to a novel question in the quizzes that are not just regurgitation but test application of knowledge. Dont take too many other strenuous classes if you choose to take this class, because it is mentally and emotionally exhausting to take a quiz every week. Its a good system for the amount of information presented, but its a lot. 9 am class T\/Th, Section on Wednesday or Thursday, and the Peer Tutors hold a review session on Monday nights before the quizzes from 7-9 that I would highly recommend. Clear your Monday schedule so that you have enough time to review for the quiz (I studied for 10 hours every Monday). I would highly recommend taking 1-2 hours to review the starred discussion questions before section, because it will make it much much easier to participate. Youll be so happy you took this course at the end of the semester, but not always when youre taking it!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student majoring in a biology-related field, as I believe that the course material is fundamental in understanding higher level material.",
    "This course was engaging, but fell off towards the end. The quizzes and final were fair, and I liked it a lot, but I think that I stopped learning in the last 3 weeks.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although it is a lot of information and there are weekly quizzes, there is a lot of help from the professors, TAs, and Peer Tutors. Weekly quizzes mean that Monday nights are always allotted to studying for the quizzes, but it made sure that we were keeping up with the lecture content.",
    "YES!!!! If you are an MCDB\/MBB\/pre-med student, this class is a must! You will definitely be pushed in ways you might not expect, but you will learn so so much along the way. Prepare to work hard; keeping up with the material is a must!!!",
    "No--this is only a good option if you're sure you love cell bio. If you don't, then it's painfully boring and this can make it difficult to pay attention in class, which can hurt your grade. Only embark on a class with this much memorization if you actually care about what you're memorizing.",
    "it depends. looking back i shouldnt have taken it but im glad that i opted in. i learned quite a lot.",
    "Only if you are REALLY good at memorization.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student, especially if this student is interested in developing a comprehensive toolbox of information to use in their future research or medical-school oriented endeavors. Cell biology has been the best course that I have taken in the MCDB department, and I absolutely loved the professors (especially Dr. Tom Pollard). I feel like I learned an enormous amount of information in this course and am actually retaining a large portion of it because of how effective the professors and TFs were at instructing.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a lot of work, but you will get so much out of it. Every week, there is a 15-minute quiz on Tuesday starting at 8:55am in OML. Each quiz requires that you master the material from the past two lectures. Each lecture takes a while to understand and master, requiring that you study extensively for each quiz. In that sense, the class is quite time consuming. However, looking back on it, I learned so much in this class. The sheer amount of knowledge and understanding of how experimental research in biology works I gained over the course of a single semester is astonishing. Even though it was a lot of work, I am glad that I took this class.",
