   "comments": [
    "I gained a general knowledge about political economy concepts and questions facing advanced economies.",
    "I greatly appreciate having been exposed to a body of literature that attacks arbitrary boundaries between economics and politics, treating economics as politics when many political science courses treat politics as a sub-field of economics and\/or game theory. It also allowed for me to gain a degree of fluency in characterizing welfare state and labor market policy regimes in the Global North.",
    "I gained exposure to texts that are fundamental to the study of comparative politics and political economy. I learned about the variety of welfare states that exist in the advanced industrialized world and the politics surrounding policy reforms (insider\/outsider cleavage, institutional stickiness, retrenchment).",
    "I learned a lot about different interest groups in European economies and the roles they, as well as political parties, play in affecting welfare policy, the organization of firms, responses to economic change, deindustrialization etc. in different countries and systems.",
    "We learned about all the various factors influencing the political economy of advanced industrialized nations. We learned how to analyze different economic and political systems from various angles and how to accurately compare them to each other.",
    "None",
    "This class gave me great insight into the vast field of comparative political economic theory, allowing us as students to explore the causes of cross-national variation in policy.",
    "How parties and interest groups interact to inform public policies, welfare state politics, some general European historical knowledge"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength is that the concepts were thought-provoking and the research project was fulfilling. It could do well with some better organization however.",
    "Lectures from Professor Mares managed to thoroughly contextualize the texts as well as clarify confusions expressed by students. These elements might have been brought out even more through enabling participation in class discussion from all students (especially in allowing students to think through their project topics in the company of others). Given interest among students in comparative analyses of the Global South and Professor Mares's research focus in Latin America, incorporating a degree of North-South comparison might make class discussion even more dynamic as students consider explanations of the differences between North and South.",
    "This is a compelling course that covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. I think that readings could be cut down a bit to ensure that all students actually read all of the assigned material-- this class is very discussion-heavy and it was clear that half of the class consistently did the reading and the other half didn't. Professor Mares is extremely passionate and makes the class very engaging, though, and those who put the work into it absolutely will reap the benefit of learning so much throughout the semester.",
    "Principal strength is the readings assigned. On the first day of the course, Prof. Mares said that what we would read would be the foundation to every student's study of comparative politics and I wholeheartedly agree. Everyone should take a course that exposes them to texts on firm organization, the welfare state, etc.",
    "The class discussions are really interesting and Professor Mares is very knowledgeable and explains the readings very well. The class has a lot of very dense readings, so it is sometimes difficult to do them all. However, it is a great class for delving more deeply into one topic of your interest, as there is only one paper on which every student works all semester, giving you the chance to really go in-depth.",
    "The main strength of the course was that it was discussion-based, so everybody was able to participate and engage in class. The conversation was based on the readings which were very comprehensive. The main weakness of the course was that the readings, while thorough, were at times very long and it was difficult to pick out the most important parts.",
    "I don't think I have ever been less inspired by a course in my life.",
    "Prof. Mares vast knowledge and desire for each of us to succeed truly was the biggest strength of the course. At times, though, I think the course could have been a little better organized.",
    "Strengths - professor assigned very useful and prominent literature Weaknesses - class discussions weren't well facilitated or engaging"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you are even remotely interested in challenging yourself intellectually in the social sciences, this course is an absolute must. Though the course deals with challenging and complex materials, the professor does an incredible job explaining it to the students in a sense that resonates with our everyday life, which makes it more understandable. This class is what political science is.",
    "Yes if you're interested in reading A LOT (!) about political economy and learning from Professor Mares.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants a deeper understanding of dominant policy frameworks in Global North countries, especially if interested in law and\/or policy.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but it could have been more streamlined. Typically we would have a lot of reading and then come to class and discuss them but we never spent equal amounts of time on all the readings, and sometimes we wouldn't fully get to some of them. I think these kinks will be worked out in the future as this was the first time she was teaching this course.",
    "I would recommend this course. Although there are a lot of readings, the Professor's style of teaching is really interesting and easy to follow.",
    "I would recommend this course mainly to Political Science students who are interested in Wester Europe, due to the fact that it is a very in-depth analysis of the interplay of politics and economics in advanced industrialized nations in that part of Europe.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is willing to put in the effort to wade through dense theoretical literature. In return, youll receive much knowledge on the subject and be much better off in your future classes and independent research.",
    "Would recommend only if you are serious about\/very interested in this specific topic"
