   "comments": [
    "Relevant, informative, demanding course designed for students considering or dedicated to any biological research career. Yes, absolutely.",
    "It is useful for a graduate student to make good prepration for future studies in this field. Also it gives students basic knowledge about human physiology.",
    "I would recommend it only for students in Drug Delivery and Tissue Engineering. For an Imaging person like myself, it was an overkill. I doubt I will ever need to know this much by heart and in this detail. However, it is a required course. The graduate section is particularly useless for Imaging people, since all of the papers are bio-chem\/genetics oriented.",
    "I'd recommend it. One of the best physiology courses I've taken.",
    "Though the class is fast-paced, you'll get a comprehensive overview of the body's major organ systems by the end of the semester. The Constanzo physiology textbook gives you a good overview of the material, but doesn't cover everything. Serge Kobsa is the best TA.",
    "It is a lot of work, but you learn a lot. Worth the effort.",
    "Course summary:A survey of most major physiological systems in humans on multiple anatomical levels.I would recommend the course to another student if he or she is interested in knowing some of the ways that individual parts on the molecular and cellular level act together to carry out physiological functions.",
    "Summary: Excellent course, but a lot of work.Recommend: Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for an undergraduate wanting to pursue a medical degree."

   "comments": [
    "Deeply deepened it. I'm already using the material covered in my laboratory.",
    "It provides the basic knowledge for my discipline. Without this course, I would have missed the basics in this field.",
    "Very little. See Question 3 from above.",
    "Very necessary to biomedical engineering.",
    "The course gave me a better understanding of how biology works a level that is macro in comparison to what I know.",
    "This course gave me a broad perspective of physiological systems on the molecular and cellular level. Because dissertation work will tend to be focused and narrow, this class is a necessary counter-balance. Furthermore, it prepares me to dig deeper on selected topics of interest.",
    "Provided excellent overview of human physiology. Complements my background in molecular biology."
