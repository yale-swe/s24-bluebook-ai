    "I absolutely recommend this course. It is one of my favorites I've taken at Yale. A great combination of theories and examples (past and present). I definitely learned a lot, and Kocher's lectures consistently engaged me. If you're interested in international relations, then you should definitely take this class. If you go to lecture it is a cake walk.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 165 to another student. It offers an excellent overview of the field and the workload is manageable.",
    "Take it. Interesting course.",
    "No. The setup of the class is vague and doesnt make much sense, as well as the biased grading by the professor. I would recommend people stay away from this class.",
    "Meh. Interesting info, but I'd rather do the readings on my own and take a different IR class with a better lecturer. Monteiro's Balance of Power covered similar topics in a superior fashion.",
    "Good political science course",
    "YES! If you are interested in the field then TAKE THIS COURSE. It is a great introductory course, you don't need to have done anything international relations related before this. Take the class to get the basics and you'll be covered in this area for the rest of your life.",
    "International Security is a PERFECT college class - fair yet catered to students. I came out learning so much about both political science and history, and my knowledge is something that I will be able to apply for the rest of my life. Take it!",
    "This is a good class, one that you should definitely take if you're interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would absolutely recommend PLSC 165 to another student. The material was interesting and managed to strike a balance between clear and understandable and detailed and complex. The workload was also super manageable.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in International Security. The material is interesting, and the professor is good. The midterm and final are reasonable and definitely doable if you study. You don't need to do all the readings.",
    "Into level overview of the various international relations theories. I would recommend it as it provides a good background foundation."
