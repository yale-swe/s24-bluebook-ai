    "I gained a comprehensive understanding of the micro and macro strengths and weaknesses of my and my classmates' writing, as well as so much knowledge about the genre of first-person writing, of all kinds, through the ages.",
    "I learned so much about writing through this course, both on the macro-level of structuring essays and the micro-level of constructing sentences. Anne was an remarkable teacher and critic, and her feedback on essays and advice about the writing process was incredibly helpful.",
    "This class taught me how to *write.* I have never received better instruction than when working with Anne. An incredible opportunity to learn so much about all forms of writing, not just personal essays.",
    "In taking Writing About Oneself, I suspect I became a better writer, and I am certain I became a better person. The process of workshopping, similar in kind but supreme in degree to other creative writing classes, is very intimate, and thus one learns how to be sensitive yet efficacious with the giving and receiving of criticism\/commentary\/feedback. This is an exercise in diplomacy par excellence, one for which I am very grateful. I was also introduced to an eclectic and individual reading list, of the perfect length (if anything it could be longer) which I would not have encountered in any other class. Was my life changed or my intellect sharpened by Eizabeth Wurtzel? No. Was I bettered by Cheryl Strayed, Vladimir Nabokov and Thomas de Quincey? Most likely yes. Certainly the anxiety of influence can whir a little more smoothly when there is a greater breadth of influencers cranking gears up in the literary mill of the brain.",
    "I feel like my ability to write generally has greatly improved (ability to think and edit on a micro and macro level), and my ability to write about myself has increased immeasurably (I feel more comfortable with the subject, ways to approach it, etc.)and my grammar improved too."

   "comments": [
    "In a few days, I will graduate with 44 course credits. Of all those courses, Anne's by far evidenced the greatest amount of methodical thought in planning each moment, in and out of the class. This course is phenomenal in every way. I have given my detailed feedback to Anne directly via her proprietary form.",
    "The devotion that Anne brings to this course is its defining feature. The reading, the writing assignments, the assigned critiques, the workshop sessions, and the one-on-one meetings all combine into a course experience that exceeds any other I have experienced at Yale.",
    "This class had so many strengths -- the wonderful weekly reading from both old and new authors, the lively, thoughtful discussions and workshops, the intense focus on critiquing and revision, and Anne's deep, continuous care and commitment all helped me grow as a writer.",
    "The strength of this class is that each student is considered as a human being that contains such things as flesh, lungs, eyes, a hippocampus, and a set of faculties which approximate to the experience of emotions. No one cares as much about their writers as Anne does, and it shows. Many hour-long meetings, diligent and earnest edits, and the gradual setting-in of a reciprocity amongst students who peer edit each other. ALSO we are taught grammar. No one is teaching grammar and these lacunae make for lousy writing. I'm sure you can see for yourself; I've probably already made about seven grammatical errors writing these evaluations.Alas, we can't all have DFW's hypersemantic childhood to tighten these gaps, but a few minutes spent on grammar go a long way."

    "You really have to do all the work, but it's so worth it.",
    "WaO is basically a secret society. Its super selective, you meet on Thursdays, you learn very intimate personal details of the other members lives, and you gain connections to successful writers. Obviously take it you get in. Anne is truly one-of-a-kind. My writing has improved tremendously and I feel like she genuinely knows me as a person more than the vast majority of people in my life. The amount one-on-one attention is extraordinary.",
    "This class transformed my Yale experience. It's a lot of work: an entire memoir and a shorter reading plus 1000 words of *excellent* writing every week. And then a 2500-3000-word final. You have to drink the whole glass. But the reward is enormous: Anne teaches you how to write, how to edit, how to make sense of your own life. And she invites you into hers. To the trepidatious: Do it. Do not be afraid of applying if you're not an english major or even if you don't consider yourself a \"writer.\" I'm not, and I didn't (until this class).",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to those fortunate enough to be admitted. It's unlike any other workshop I've experienced at Yale (or anywhere, really). Anne is a gracious, kind, and dedicated teacher and editor. The workload is necessarily intenseand so fulfilling.",
    "Definitely take this course!! Anne is thoughtful and kind and incredibly committed to her students, and the one-on-one writing conferences with her were invaluable. The class is a lot of work, but absolutely worth it -- the combination of fantastic weekly readings, regular essay-writing and intensive revisions, and continuous exchange of feedback with others through online comments, in-class workshops, and formal critiques was fantastic. It was also so wonderful to really get to know the other students in the class and become part of a tight-knit, supportive group of writers. This class was one of the best that I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is a rare opportunity to work with Yale's most gifted professor. Take this and the lessons you learn will continue with you forever.",
    "If you're a writer, you're an idiot not to take this course. Anne will invariably improve your writing, and probably make you feel better about yourself, and help you place the crises of your life in perspective, along the way. If you're not a writer and you end up in this course, please be gracious enough to do the reading, and bare your naked soul to the rest of the class, as they will likely 'get naked,' metaphorically speaking, for you.",
    "By all means take this course if you have the chancegreat readings, and your writing will improve. That being said, I took this class credit-D (as we were advised to do) and put more work into it than any of my other courses. If you take it, take it becuase you want to write, not becuase you want a good grade."
