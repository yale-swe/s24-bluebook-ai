   "comments": [
    "good",
    "This class didn't have much relevance to the SBS track. A lot of the examples were very clinical, and it was hard to connect why an SBS student would have to know some of this. Maybe incorporate more examples from the various tracks to make it more relevant.",
    "strengths: very useful topics, I have learned so much and the topics are relevant and practical. I now understand epidemiological studies so much better.weaknesses: none",
    "Strengths - good material, interesting PH examples, helpful TAsWeaknesses - Friday morning section",
    "Useful.But too much material was covered and too much memorization needed.",
    "Strengths- the articles selected for the homeworks really helped us focus in on the main topics we learned from class. I feel like I learned a TON throughout this semester.Weaknesses- as someone who did very well in Epi I in the fall, I found myself struggling with many of the concepts toward the beginning of the semester. I think the course is much more quantitative than Epi I, and the examples used were very science-based. As someone in SBS with an undergraduate background in policy, I found that the course material, especially the examples used, were much easier for other students who had a science background to understand.",
    "Very thorough lectures, really helps you to understand the material, homework assignments are long but very helpful for teaching you how to effectively read a research article.",
    "It was really interesting and I learned a lot. The content and skills we learned were very useful. Though some of the assignments were long and tedious, a lot of them helped us consolidate our knowledge. I think that the homework assignments should be a little bit shorter. I would also like to see more SBS-related topics covered in the course, not just pure science and biology. The assignments did provoke interesting discussions.",
    "I thought that this class was very disappointing. I think that to some extent the tests measured what people knew coming in to the course and that for people for whom the material was new it was extremely difficult. Although the readings were well chosen to illustrate the concepts, without a textbook they were insufficient. The lectures and slides were sometimes confusing and the important concepts were not emphasized - the slides were dense and he read from them.",
    "this course is very intense and takes a lot of time to work it out. But it is good and useful for literature review.",
    "A little dry, but taught me a lot",
    "This was a tough course! However, I have no suggestions on how to improve this course because it is already great in itself.",
    "The last third of the class and the instructor overall is too medically based. If I wanted to take a Med School class, I would have signed up for one. As an SBS student, the articles, examples, and overall class was COMPLETELY out of my interest and range of concern. Not very epidemiologically based and his thought process is extremely difficult to maneuver. 100% opposite from EPI I. He should really stick with the Med School.",
    "This course was extremely informative, challenging and thorough. I have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "Overall, I learned a lot from this course. The additional semester of epidemiology really helped to solidify and expand upon concepts learned during Epi I.However, the semester started off quite rough. I had a very hard time following lectures and overall the course seemed very disorganized and chaotic. The lack of textbook made me feel helpless when I did not understand a concept. Initially, Dr. Dubrow did not post lecture slides until the morning of lecture, meaning I could not print them off to follow along in class (cannot take good notes when following slides on laptop). Class was not interactive.After the first exam, Dr. Dubrow solicited our feedback and made appropriate changes to the course that greatly improved my ability to engage with the course material. I appreciate these changes and improvements, but I lost a solid month and a half at the beginning of semester of learning\/enforcing epidemiological concepts.",
    "Overall the course was great. The discussion sessions were critical in reinforcing topics covered in lecture. The homework assignments were well-designed in general and served to help students think through concepts. Overall, the lectures were helpful, as were homeworks, and I am walking away from this course having learned quite a lot.",
    "Good course, A LOT of information. For someone without a biology background the third section of the course is tough.",
    "I think that class covered an extraordinary amount of information within one semester. It built very well off of the Epi 1 class, and I really feel that the application aspect was very beneficial to truly understanding some of these concepts. The variety and depth of examples made most concepts very clear and easy to learn. There was a great deal of time spent choosing appropriate examples, and articles for homework assignments, and everything harmonized beautifully. I think that the tests were challenging but fair.",
    "This course covers a lot of material and I felt that it greatly enhanced the foundation of my epi knowledge. I enjoyed the homeworks and felt that they reinforced the material well.",
    "less ambiguity on exam questions",
    "I learned a lot from this class, particularly how to read papers critically",
    "This class was challenging, but I feel like I got out of it and know that it will serve me well in the future.strengths: interesting material, forces you to really delve into and understand primary public health literature.weaknesses: slides were initially a bit dense, but Dr. Dubrow was able to condense and make summary slides by the end of the semester. With the quick lecture pace, I often felt like I had little time to process the information as I was learning it.",
    "I think the biggest weakness is there is no text, which is of course not Dr. Dubrow's fault, but the assigned readings are too long and in depth. Dr. Dubrow does a good job of covering all the material in lecture, so the readings aren't necessary.",
    "learned more from this course than any other single course at YSPH. highly informative. very heavy workload and difficult course, but the pay-off is great. I was not even required to take this course. Highly recommended.",
    "The material is really difficult especially or someone with no real science background. The strengths of the course are that the professor is very open to feedback from students and the office hours are great ( I usually attended at least two sets of office hours a week).",
    "This was a good course.Strengths:Well taught, in depth learning of Epi concepts including confounding and effect modification.When I took Epi 2 at another university, it was very dry and very calculation intensive. I liked that this was more about understanding than just applying equations.Weaknesses:There is a fair amount of overlap between this and other classes, with some material (e.g., Kaplan-Meier curves) being taught in slightly different ways. A little more coordination would be nice.",
    "Some of the material is quite advanced and I would have very much preferred to be able to refer to a textbook, even if this was in addition to the current readings. A lot of the readings were quite long and not always directly related to what was covered in class\/discussion section, making it difficult to use as reference material.Would have very much liked if the homeworks included questions such as those in the practice exams, as I feel like going over topics through practice questions helps a lot in gaining a better understanding of the material.Would have liked an explanation added to the answers to the multiple choice questions of the (practice) exams. Without an explanation, it is difficult to assess why the other answers are incorrect (i.e. did I make a simple mistake or do I apparently not understand the material).",
    "useful",
    "This course was great- definitely my favorite so far at YSPH. I really liked the format of the course and learned so much through both the lectures, homework assignments, and section discussions.",
    "I am a second year taking this course after additional statistics and epidemiology courses. In some ways this course was repetitive, but mostly in a good way. As with my other epidemiology courses, when concepts were familiar I found it harder to focus on the lecture but simultaneously appreciated the review. New material was primarily presented at the end of the course, which would be expected, but made the course more challenging as that was the time when I had the most demands from other courses.",
    "I really like the outline of the course as it covers a good recap of Epi 1 material and goes much more in depth. The discussion sessions and homeworks are great because they enhance learning.",
    "The strength of the course is that is a great compliment to the fall semester epidemiology course and builds off those concepts. Another strength is that the level of difficulty was consistent throughout the semester (although slightly front loaded); thus, requiring students to be engaged throughout. One weakness is that lectures should include more simple examples that do not require prior knowledge on specific topics. Sometimes examples were wasted on this because as a student it may be difficult to follow an example when you have so many questions about things unrelated to the point of the example.",
    "This was an AMAZING course...probably the best one I have taken so far at YSPH. The lectures were not always extremely exciting, just because of the nature of some of the material (i.e. a bit dry), but each lecture was packed with so much useful knowledge. Strengths: The lectures provided the content, while the homework assignments and periodic quizzes\/exams were essential for forcing me to go back and look over and really understand the material presented during class. I really felt the structure of the course and the frequent office hours allowed me to master most of the material at an \"intermediate\" level. Weaknesses\/improvement: First, the first two quizzes were essential checks to be sure I mastered the first two parts of the material presented during the semester. I feel I would have benefited more if there were three quizzes and a final, as opposed to two quizzes and a final. I felt like I wasn't able to learn the third part of the material presented as well as the first two parts because there was not a third quiz\/check of my knowledge of the material. I know that it is not logistically feasible to have all material assessed prior to a final exam, but anything would help...maybe even an extra set of practice questions focused on the third part of the course. Second, the course starts off very dry and very slowly...I almost did not take the course! But I am so glad that I did! Positive feedback about this course from other students and professors helped me make my decision, but perhaps something could be added to the first couple of lectures to attract more students who are on the fence like I was.",
    "I really enjoyed the course content and felt like I learned a lot! Great depth into epi. Except for the final exam, very fair course (the final this yet was a little rough! Some things that we barely mentioned in class were asked about in depth.)Also, the course was a little heavy on generic\/molecular and EMD type topics. I would have liked to see a bit of social and psych epi while we are covering various topics at the end.",
    "Well prepared and organized course.",
    "I learned a lot from this class. Honestly one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.I like the homework assignments. Time intensive, but I learned a lot.The final was a bit rough though. I don't think it was a fair assessment of how much I learned. There were a lot of questions on the really tough article about biomarkers. There was one lecture on biomarkers and a lot of the nuance he wanted us to get from the article was really hard with just one lecture. Seemed to be a disproportionate amount of our grade for the final (and well, the course) on that one lecture. I was fairly upset after the final and pretty down that it was so hard and nuanced.",
    "very well organized. great course!",
    "Strengths--the instructor was so responsive to feedback and adapted the lectures to our suggestions. The course was very organized from the beginning. You knew exactly what to expect--exam's structure, homework submission protocols, office hours, etc. The exams were hard, but fair.Room for improvement--you could have more office hours. The ones I went to were usually crowded and some students just steered off the subject often. Perhaps having more possible times would translate into fewer people per hour.",
    "Very, very good course! Started out a little slow but really picked up by the middle\/end. Dr. Dubrow was fantastic, as were the TAs. I found the material tough, but I probably learned more in this class than almost any other this school year. I found tests to be fairly challenging (especially Part 1--the article(s)). Homework was very helpful in mastering the material.",
    "The material presented in this course was not difficult, but for some reason it was presented in the most confusing and opaque way possible. I felt that my frustration with the poor presentation of the material interfered with my ability to get all that I could out of the course.",
    "super useful course which helps to pave the way for future epi research and provides insight into various epi studies.",
    "Strengths: touches on a wide variety of epi topics (molecular, outbreaks, etc). Really helps form a solid epi knowledge base.Weaknesses: some of the material is dry and difficult to understand, depending on your academic background."

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Very clear and tries very hard to make the lectures useful and meaningful for students. really appreciate his effort to ask for student feedback through surveys and he really did make changes according to the feedback.weakness: maybe speak a bit louder to make the lectures more lively. (really minor weakness)",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He was very receptive to our comments. I wish he didn't put questions in final exam practice that we would not be tested on\/were too complicated to be on exam. He could improve his clarity during lectures.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Very clear explanations, good availability",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Good.Too much fluctuation in the level of difficulty in the exam.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0While I understand that Dr. Dubrow puts a lot of time and effort into this course, I had a hard time personally feeling like he understood why I struggled on the first exam. When I met with him to discuss my performance, he really didn't have any suggestions for improvements I could make in my preparations for the exams. I found that pretty disheartening, considering I had done so well in Epi I, and started out this course in a rocky spot, and could have used some advice.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Always asking for feedback, very responsive to the students. Good organization in the lectures, and consistent with exams.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I really like Dr. Dubrow! His is so nice, funny, and clearly cares about his students' success. He has a great way of engaging students and asks good questions to facilitate participation. He is very accommodating and responds well to feedback. He goes out of his way to make sure we understand the material.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I think that he cares deeply about students and about the course material but his teaching methods aren't working. I did all of the assigned reading and attended every lecture and still struggled in this class - that doesn't seem right.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I like his class but his speaking tone need to be improved because it is very easily to loss focus on his presentation.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0a little dry, but taught me a lot and was extremely receptive to student feedback, which I've never seen in a professor. His alterations to lecture after mid-term evaluations were very helpful to me.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0At first, Dr. Dubrow seemed like a stiff character. He had a very monotonous tone, and it was difficult to stay awake in his class. However, after the first midterm, he was really open to suggestions. He tried his best to improve and his receptiveness really turned the course around. He became more comfortable teaching in class and the students in turn were able to understand his subtle humor and appreciate his teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow's lectures were well-planned, clear and thorough. He was sensitive to students' questions and concerns and very patient.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow should be recognized for the effort he puts into this course. He does truly care about students learning. It is clear that he puts a lot of effort into the course and that he expects a lot of effort from students, which I believe is how it should be.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was an excellent instructor. It seems like he really does care about students. I particularly liked that he took feedback at the middle of the semester from students and implemented it--someone suggested a broader range of topics to incorporate social and behavioral topics, which he did.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Great guy, kind heart.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I have told many people this, but I am more than extremely impressed with Dr. Dubrow's level of dedication and concern for his students. He went out of his way to get feedback constantly, and actually listened to what was said and acted accordingly. He was thorough, methodic, extremely prepared, informed, and is by far one of the best professors I have had.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0At the start of the semester, the material was covered very quickly in class and it was difficult to follow but that improved with time. Dr Dubrow's lecture notes were excellent and very detailed. I appreciated the care with which he chose the readings. He was very responsive to the mid-semester feedback, so he was very sensitive to the students' needs.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0it's clear that he cares about his students, very responsive to feedback",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Really helpful and I really appreciated how he took our midterm evaluations into consideration",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was the best professor that I've had at YSPH so far. It was incredibly apparent how much he cares about teaching, and I really appreciate that he had us evaluate the course after the first exam so that he could work on improving the class after that point.Also, I think it should be noted that Dr. Dubrow ruptured his quadriceps tendon and STILL managed to prepare and give the lectures following that even, even when it was clear that he was in a lot of pain.Overall, he is a wonderful and thoughtful professor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I found Dr. Dubrow to be very invested in our learning process. He was incredibly responsive to student feedback and made sure to carve out time for student office hours before exams. He is also very well organized and detail oriented, which I appreciated.",

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Really open to student feedback and extremely knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow did a very good job of teaching. I liked the relatively interactive style and appreciated his ability to get the class to respond to questions. He was good about answering questions and clarifying issues.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is great at explaining the material, especially when students ask direct questions.The outline of dr. Dubrow's slides can sometimes be confusing (although was improvedafter the first evaluation), especially because there is no accompanying textbook.The lectures seem rather focused on examples, while a few extra slides explaining the material would be helpful. In using many different examples, it can be difficult to keep track of example questions, especially during review sessions for the quizzes or final. Perhaps using an article that everyone can read prior to class as an example or expect to have students go over the practice questions for the review in advance could help?",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0fantastic",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a wonderful instructor. I loved that he took our mid-semester suggestions to heart and always seemed like he was trying to make the course the best it could be. He definitely had a thorough understanding of the course material and did a great job of communicating the material to the students through effective examples, homework assignments, ect.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a wonderful professor. I highly enjoyed coming to lectures each day and have learned more in this class than any other I have taken so far at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Did an excellent job. At the beginning, lectures felt very dry and were hard to follow, but by the end, had adapted to his teaching style and lectures were very valuable.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is an excellent instructor who is genuinely dedicated to student learning and is willing to adapt to feedback. I really appreciated how he did a mid-term evaluation so that he can gauge how to make changes in time before the course ends. He's good at explaining complicated methods.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow should be commended for his efforts to continuously improve the class. I greatly appreciate that he conducted his own mid-semester course evaluation in order to determine in what ways the class could improve. What was even more commendable is that after this mid-semester evaluation his lectures took into consideration things that were said by students. Also, another strength is that his lectures were organized in a similar manner to those of Dr. Niccolai. This really helped to draw the connections between the two courses more clearly as I could refer back to my notes from the previous semester.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a FANTASTIC instructor. Strengths: He explained the content thoroughly and clearly, provided great examples to reinforce concepts, and responded thoroughly to all questions. You could tell he reflected on everyone's questions because he would often further address those that he didn't feel were addressed adequately in class through announcements on classesv2 or in a later class. He also took the mid-semester course evaluations very seriously and responded to them with positive\/helpful alterations in the structure of the lectures. I really appreciated the extra effort that Dr. Dubrow went to to make the course the best it could be for his students! Weaknesses: none",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He cares very much about his students! He expects a lot from students, but puts in just as much. He was very responsive to student comments at the mid term evaluation which I really appreciated. I think his power points could still use a bit I work to be clear, concise, and efficient. But generally very good!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr Dubrow is a very responsible professor!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He is great! Love him. He seems to care a lot. I think he must have trouble telling how hard his tests are. Maybe it would be a good idea for him to run them by the TA's first?I asked the TA's a question (in office hours) about one of the articles and they said they had no idea why the author would do what they did and then it was a questionon the exam! If the test were run by the TA's first he might have known that was a bit of an unfair question (in my humble opinion).",

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Amazing. A genuinely nice person, he cares about students, he is responsive to feedback. He is a hard worker (he broke his leg, had surgery and was still present at school even with a legitimate excuse not to be). Also, extremely knowledgeable about the topics and responded well to students' questions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was great!! He presented the material in a helpful way. Importantly, he listened to the students' feedback and changed the course in a positive way after the midterm. These changes made the course that much better.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow is obviously a very competent epidemiologist, but that does not necessarily translate to his teaching ability-- I found his lectures to be unnecessarily painful to sit through, or even read through. His teaching could be improved through more concise, accessible and transparent presentation of the material. Perhaps he could look to Professor Niccolai for some idea of how to do this effectively.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Excellent instructor, carful, nice, logical.super knowledgable and answer all questions in detail.it will be great if the method introduced for survival analysis could be the easier version at the beginning.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0It's clear that Dr. Dubrow put a tremendous amount of thought into the assignments and exams. He was very open to criticism and suggestions, and modified his lectures accordingly.Sometimes examples seemed to drag on a little long, so that my mind would drown in details and lose the purpose of the example.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is great! He cares so much about his students and wants us to get the most out of the course as possible. I really appreciated that he always asked for feedback and made changes to accommodate our needs."

    "Instructor: Daniel I Jacobs \u00a0smart and great",
    "Instructor: Daniel I Jacobs \u00a0Great Job! Walked through all of the concepts on the homework assignments and did a good job of explaining what was happening, especially when some of the questions werea bit challenging.",
    "Instructor: Daniel I Jacobs \u00a0Daniel was always available to answer all of our questions which is important in this course as the material is not intuitive and sometimes requires further clarification. During section, Daniel was extremely helpful and eager which made reviewing the homework assignments very productive. While the homework assignments added greatly to lectures, at times they were very long (content wise) and we could not get through all the questions in section. Daniel would sometimes linger too long on one specific question and we were forced to rush through the end.",
    "Instructor: Daniel I Jacobs \u00a0Daniel is responsible and great",
    "Instructor: Daniel I Jacobs \u00a0Daniel: Best TA ever. NIce and patient, clear and logical.",
    "Instructor: Daniel I Jacobs \u00a0Very patient, able to explain concepts clearly. During many sections we could have moved quicker though, to spend more time on the more difficult topics.",
    "Instructor: Daniel I Jacobs \u00a0He is just so helpful and encouraging. I could not have asked for a better TA for this class.",
    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0Overall good sections. Got a little repetitive.",

    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0Erikka was amazing. Very intelligent and very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0Erikka was very helpful both in our formal review sessions and in her office hours. She took the time to explain difficult concepts and was very clear and thorough. She was always approachable and made herself available to her students.",
    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0I was extremely impressed by Erikka and by how much she invested in the course. She did an excellent job teaching the material and was extremely resourceful and knows the material inside out. I greatly benefitted from discussion section because of her.",
    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0Erikka was an absolutely wonderful TA. I learned a ton during our sections. She is very well organized and great at leading our small discussions.",
    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0Amazing, very helpful",

    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0Erikka was an AWESOME teaching fellow. In general, she was very pleasant to spend Friday mornings with. She kept the discussion section focused so that we could finish going over the homework assignments in a thorough fashion within the hour and twenty minutes allotted but was also willing to answer questions. Although she was able to answer all questions, she provided follow up explanations, including review slides, to better explain complicated explanations brought up during discussion sections or office hours during later sessions as appropriate. I often feel a little hesitant to answer and ask questions during classes, but during our discussion section, I felt extremely comfortable participating in the ongoing discussion with Erikka and the other students. Erikka really did her best to make sure we fully understood the material during discussion sections and office hours!",
    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0Amazing. Very helpful in lab and in office hours",
    "Instructor: Erikka Loftfield \u00a0Erikka was very very helpful. Section was invaluable. She took time to explain important or challenging topics. Great TA.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Ray is awesome. I've had him for both epi 1 and 2. He explained everything so clearly with original and helpful examples. He also taught us studying tips. Overall, a very relax and good learning experience in his section.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0I had the privilege of having Ray as my TA for both Epi I and Epi II, however, he served two very different purposes for me throughout my year of epidemiology. First semester, he taught the sections and explained any unclear concepts and kept things entertaining, as always. However, second semester, I found myself struggling much more with the material. Ray encouraged me to come to his office hours to go over the assignments. He was more than happy to stay late after his office hours were technically over to keep going over topics that the students weren't quite understanding.Despite his extra help, I did poorly on the first exam. When I came to him in tears, he found the time to go over every single question on the exam with me to make sure I understood where I had gone wrong. He assured me that other students were in the same boat, and that even he had struggled in this course when he took it. One of the best qualities about Ray as an instructor is that he is not trying to sound smarter than anyone else, and is always quite honest about how he feels about the material. His telling me about his struggles in this class put things in perspective for me, and he knew what kind of work I was capable of from being my TA in Epi I.He continued to work with me every single week of the semester in his office hours, and assured me that the second quiz would go better than the first- and sure enough I got an honors on the second quiz. Throughout the semester, Ray's office hours always were the most crowded, and while that might be due to the fact that his office hours were Thursday afternoons before the homeworks were due Friday, I think this wasdue to the fact that students trusted him and his laid-back approach was appreciated by many of the students who needed some extra help.Ray is going to go on to be an amazing professor, because he's incredibly motivating, he has a lighthearted approach to teaching that helps take some off the pressure off, and he makes students want to perform at the best of their ability. I am incredibly fortunate to have had Ray as a TA through my first year of graduate school.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0RAY IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He loves working with students and goes out of his way to make surewe understand concepts. His office hours and sections are always so much fun, and he comes up with great metaphors and analogies. He has a way of making even the most tedious topics interesting. The homework assignments did provoke interesting discussions in his section. He is the type of person who tries to relate to each student individually and values what everyone has to contribute. Hey is really laid-back and cool. This semester wouldn't have been nearly as awesome as it was without Ray. I am so lucky to have known him and I will miss him so much next year. Thanks for everything, Ray!",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0RAY IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. HE REALLY SHOULD WIN AN AWARD FOR DEDICATION TO HELPING US LEARN. SERIOUSLY. NOT COMPARABLE TO THE OTHER TA'S AT ALL.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0ray was great, didnt always know the answers, but would help find them out.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Ray is awesome! I learned so much this semester. He has a great way of explaining complex topics in simple terms. Discussion section with him was much more interesting.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0High praise, Ray was a wonderful TA. He is very skilled in breaking down complicated concepts into layman's terms.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Ray was great! He kept us engaged in going over the homework assignments and was generally able to answer our questions.He sometimes had difficulty explaining some of the practical aspects of how a study was done, when that sort of question came up. Perhaps a bit more preparation between the professor and the TAs could anticipate those questions and prepare for them.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Ray was a fantastic TA. He did a great job leading discussion section. He made all of the students comfortable participating and was very good at guiding us to the correct answers without either explicitly saying them or making us feel dumb for not getting things right the first time. He was very approachable and did an excellent job explaining difficult concepts in a number of ways to ensure that we understood them. His office hours were very helpful and I was always impressed with how well he could answer twenty or thirty students questions in office hours before exam days.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Ray was a good TA - answered all the questions that he knew well, and wasn't afraid to say when he didn't quite know. The sessions were a comfortable environment so it made it easier to talk and have discussions.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Ray was great! Very good at relating to students. He's great at epi too! (even though I think he tries to hide it)",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Love Ray! He was great. He was very personable and made me feel unafraid to talk in section and ask questions. I loved section.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0very helpful and good at teaching",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Amazing! Super smart, but very down to earth. He seems to enjoy his work as TA and always has some witty and interesting ways to help us learn the material. Only nice things to say about him and wish he could be my TA in other courses.",
    "Instructor: Jose Ramon Troche \u00a0Ray was an excellent TA and without him I would have gotten very little out of the course. He was always available and was very good at clarifying the more confusingconcepts."

   "comments": [
    "good",
    "This course is extremely demanding and challenging. The workload is heavy. It's required or I wouldn't recommend it for SBSstudents.",
    "highly recommended for other students. learned so much.",
    "Pretty bearable, homeworks get better halfway through the semester, easy, general material, Friday morning sections are pretty bad",
    "GoodRecommend but aware them of the work load.",
    "A ton of work, but you will learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend it, you do learn a lot. It does require a lot of patience though. I think the course should be slightly amended so that it's a little more accessible to SBS students or students without a formal science background. But overall it's a great course and you really get a lot out of it.",
    "I think the material is really important and mostly very interesting but it tries to cover too much ground.",
    "This course was very challenging and time consuming. However, I would highly recommend this class because you will learn so much from it!",
    "EPI II is difficult. If it's not required, don't take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is the best course I have taken at YSPH so far.",
    "Great course that I would recommend all students take--it is a wonderful complement to the first Epi course.",
    "yes.",
    "This course takes everything (and more) that you learn in EPI 1 and applies it to real research and real life examples. The understanding of bias, measurement issues, pros\/cons of study type are much greater now than they were before.",
    "This course is a detailed progression from epi 1 and an excellent foundation for public health. The lecture material is an excellent resource that I will go back to often moving forward. I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
    "definitely, teaches you to critique the current epi literature",
    "Definitely would recommend this class- one of the most informative classes I have taken so far",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student because it provides practical knowledge that can be applied to future work in epidemiology. I really felt that I learnt a lot from this course.",
    "While challenging, I am incredibly glad that I had the chance to take this course. The course complemented the topics that I was learning in other courses, so I think it that it helped to strengthen my skill sets all around. It really built upon the knowledge that I gained from Epi I and I know that I will carry the skills forward into my other classes at YSPH and my future career.",
    "I fully recommend it, even if it's not required for you. Yeah, it's a lot of work, but I learned a lot that will be useful for my internship and thesis and in my career.",
    "This course is really difficult for someone without a quantitative and science background. However, you do learn a lot and it is very useful to be bale to critically look at scientific articles\/studies and understand them.",
    "This class teaches you the basic information that you need to be an epidemiologist. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student even if it is not required for them.",
    "I took this as a second year as an elective course, because I am considering a PhD in epi, and I think it was highly valuable. I would not only recommend it in terms of learning a lot from a great instructor, but it is HIGHLY valuable in learning how to effectively evaluate scholarly articles.",
    "It's an excellent core concept-building course for epi methods.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student. After taking this course, I do not believe that taking just one epidemiology course is enough to really gain a clear understanding of epidemiology. Furthermore, there are a lot of classes at YSPH that really build off the concepts that we learn in this course, for example Applied Analytics. Had I not taken this course I would not have understood as clearly some of the topics taught in other courses.",
    "I recommend this course to everyone!! I think it is such an important foundation course for public health students and other health professional students. Building upon the content of Epi I, this course really helps students build the skills necessary to read the literature that is out there and evaluate the research being conducted. This is a vital skill for health professional students. Before Epi II, I had trouble reading through all of the sections in articles presented in all of my courses (which can be a problem as this is a key element of every course when you're getting your MPH!). As the semester progressed, I could see the changes in my comprehension, as I was able to read through articles at a much quicker pace and with a greater understanding of the methods, etc. The skills I have gained through this course are invaluable in all of my other courses and outside work.",
    "Difficult and informative",
    "A very challenging and engaged course in epidemiology. You will learn a lot, but need to put in a lot of work! I would definitely recommend it to build on the methods learned first semester!",
    "Very useful. Although the workload is heavy",
    "Take it! Seriously. Even if you don't have to. I learned a lot.",
    "an essential course to understand issues in epi studies",
    "I would definitely recommend it! You learn so many new material during the semester, but you really internalize it because of the homeworks and practice exams. Even if you do not have to take it, you should. I am actually going to miss this class next semester. Just be prepared to work hard, because it is a harder class than others. However, it is worth it!",
    "Highly, highly recommended, especially for EMD students (who have the option of choosing between this class and Dr. Desai's). Probably my toughest class overall in terms of the material and the amount of time spent on it each week, but I learned so so much. Dr. Dubrow is great.",
    "a must-take course for EPI students and will benefit you a lot in the future!",
    "I'd absolutely recommend anyone interested in Epi take this course. I probably learned more in this course than any other.",
    "A more in-depth look at the topics we glazed over in the first semester course. It begins with a discussion on selection bias and confounder adjustment; continues with a look at the nuts and bolts of survival analysis, randomized control trials and meta-analyses; and ends with an overview of more specialized topics like molecular and genetic epidemiology, screening, and outbreak investigations. Definitely recommend it to all students."
