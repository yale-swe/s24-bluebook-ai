   "comments": [
    "Light load, fun, learn some stuff.",
    "Even though GMAN 110 is a tough class, I really enjoyed it. I thought that the professor, Professor Gordeew, did a great job with instructing the students in a manner that was comprehensible to a person with very little experience with the language. She really tried to make connections between German and different languages that we are well-acquainted with, such as Spanish and English. I also thought that the exercises we did in class were focused and effective. Professorin knew how to pinpoint and attack the different weaknesses we had with the language. The only recommendation I have is that we practice our speaking a little bit more in class. I am still not very confident in my ability to converse with others in German. Otherwise the class was a solid introduction to not only to German language, but also to German culture in general.",
    "I absolutely would recommend it to another student. German is widely used in Europe and is great to know.",
    "If you want to learn German, take this class. You learn a lot in terms of vocabulary, syntax, those pesky case things, and even German pop culture. It's also a lot more fun and easier than many other languages Yale offers, and this is my second language track at Yale so I'm saying that from experience.",
    "This is an excellent course, but it requires hard work.",
    "Learn basics of German"
