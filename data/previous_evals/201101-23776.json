   "comments": [
    "I really loved this class. I'm sure the vibe of the seminar depends greatly on the students, but we had a great group. Professor Zoffness structures student workshops constructively. You read four collections of linked short stories and then write to short stories of your own that are linked. All in all, it seemed like the emphasis of the class was more focused on the merit of these short stories to stand on their own than the link; so while the course is a bit unconventional in the linked focus, really you'll be learning the craft of writing a short story over writing a linked one. Highly recommended.",
    "yes ! If you like writing and want to start off a collection, this class is a great choice.",
    "A great review of linked short stories and an exploration of the process of writing them.",
    "You will read a lot of interesting stories in CSDC 240, and produce a lot of pages (your two short stories, revisions for the short stories, assorted assignments, journal entries for the story collection, and assorted small assignments). These assignments may feel tedious, but they do allow the student to better understand the architecture of a short story.However, the class critique sessions (of original stories) were unprofessional (see above).",
    "Great class for people who just want to write and get credit for it. It's great for people of all levels, though I was particularly grateful that it did not count towards the English major because it was less intense for that reason. Still really useful and enjoyable.",
    "Best reading list ever. Fun to read a diverse array of stories from peers. Less writing intensive than one might think.",
    "An engaging but low-impact fiction seminar. Do not expect life-altering lessons in self-expression. Do expect a fun excuse to write whatever interwoven idiocy pops into your head."
