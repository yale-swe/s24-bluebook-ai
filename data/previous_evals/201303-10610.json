   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend French 140.",
    "French 140 has an awkward goal for a language class: because most students have nearly reached fluency, the emphasis on grammar sometimes feels inane. It's tough and time-consuming, but in a busywork kind of way. The emphasis on compositions and conversations ensures that students will be challenged in a compelling way.",
    "Yes! The class is more laid-back than french l1 and l2 here. The class is geared towards improving oral and reading comprehension and thinking in french. i.e. redactions were graded a lot on content. and we read a lot of short stories, two novels and watched some movies.work load: a few pages of course packet per night. A decent amount of reading each week. 5 redactions and tests.",
    "Yes. Very helpful in developing your french.",
    "This is a very good class. There was a heavy emphasis on speaking and listening comprehension (as well as reading comprehension). Sometimes the grammar could get a bit tedious. Fren 140 is very work intensive- I found myself spending 1.5-2 hours a night on homework. There were four unit tests, four essays (the last one was in-class), and a final exam.",
    "A conversation-oriented language class that focuses discussion on a few different texts. The texts are generally interesting and expose students to different francophone cultures.I don't know that I'd really recommend the course, because I feel there wasn't most improvement for most students.",
    "Pretty easy step from L3 to L4, maybe too easy. The hw takes a long time and some of it seems like busy work. I recommend Proffesor Koundi."
