   "comments": [
    "yes good, but difficult; professor was great and course was well taught; review prob theory beforehand if not fresh in mind",
    "Work in progress, but interesting material",
    "Man this class is hard if you haven't taken statistics or probability before. That said, it is taught quite well and the material is very interesting. Also there are only psets and a final project, no exams. If you enjoy proofs and have some familiarity with the material, definitely take it. Otherwise, take it but it will probably be pretty tough. By the end of the class many of the undergrads had dropped out and a lot of grad students were left. Some of the psets took a hella long time.",
    "Stochastic Process was not easy, but I learned a ton from it. Not only is Sahand a pretty good lecturer but the material is (I think) fairly interesting and accessible to anyone with a knowledge of Calculus and probability.",
    "Yes. This course is amazing and all the abstractness of math and statistics that you learn goes away. Ok, maybe not all of it, but a lot of it. Stochastic processes is a beautiful and highly applicable field. Applications of what we learned include: voice recognition software, protein folding, options pricing. I would definitely recommend this course for individuals in computer science, biological engineering\/ general biology, potential economics phds, and future finance drones. all will be welcome and will walk out will a large body of knowledge,",
    "HARD HARD CLASS. You will learn a lot, but this will take a lot of time. You must form a good group early on to do the psets well, and kill the final project to do well on the class.",
    "Despite the 200-level number, this is a rigorous proof-based course. You should be pretty familiar with probability theory, and relatively fluent in the language of mathematical reasoning -- all the symbols and conventions, and so on. The material is very interesting -- this is the stuff that underlies most machine learning algorithms -- and the lecturer is enthusiastic and relatively clear. Ask questions (in or after class) if you don't understand, though, because those misunderstandings build up pretty quickly. This year, there were no exams, which was nice, but you do have to learn the material, because the problem sets are tough and weighted heavily, and build on each other.",
    "It's a good course, but VERY difficult. Weekly problem sets are extremely long and tedious (15 hours\/week at least), so the class can be a bit frustrating. However, TAs and Sahand are extremely willing to help and give hints. It's a rewarding class if you put in ALL the work.",
    "smacks you in the face",
    "A good class to learn the fundamentals to stochastic processes and machine learning: markov chains, markov random fields, martingales, brownian motion. Overall, is about 50% theory, 50% application, which I found a pretty good balance. A really strong understanding of probability is a must to get a lot out of this class, though if you're willing to work hard and self study it, I think this class is doable without 241. Professor Negahban is really excellent! He is very energetic and very good at answering questions during lecture. Also, absolutely go to his office hours if you're confused at all. He steps up the rigor quite a bit compared to the textbook and what you might expect if the prereq is only 241. So be prepared for a tough class, but you'll learn a lot!",
    "Take this class if you want to do long homeworks and then get them back with really harsh grading. The subject is great, the professor was great. It was sad that more than 70% of the undergrads who started the course dropped the class, but that was because of the homework more than anything else.",
    "At least as a non-math major, this was the most difficult and time intensive course I have taken at Yale, but it was also the most rewarding. You will be amazed at how much you know at the end of the semester, and how many nee doors for study feel like they've opened, assuming you have an interest in learning more applied math.",
    "Yes. Difficult and you'll probably have several all-nighters for psets but at the end you might not regret it.",
    "The course is rigorous.",
    "This was a good course. The material is interesting, and has a lot of applications, although we didn't go into those applications in class. The homework is hard. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow, but the book is very helpful.",
    "Stochastic Processes seemed more on the level of a graduate course, and taught a great deal of challenging and interesting information. Having a final project instead of a final exam meant that students never studied all of the material comprehensively but rather focused on a smaller part of the course at the end. Yes, I would recommend it as a challenging but rewarding theoretical statistics course."
