    "If you're taking Arabic, try and get a class with Sarab Al-Ani--she's a lovely person and a great teacher. That said, it's still Arabic at Yale, which means it's a lot of not-so-rewarding work.",
    "I would. It feels great to be able to speak another language. Also, since they stopped rotations of instructors, the program has improved significantly.",
    "ARBC 120 is the second semester elementary Modern Standard Arabic Course, and realty does not deviate m. From expectations of this kind. Grammar wise we cover the most important aspects, while at the same time enhancing our vocabulary and learning new structures. It is a good amount of work everyday and it should not be taken carelessly as it requires continuous attention. Take it of you took ARBC 110 and chances are that you will enjoy it much more than first semester elementary Modern Standard Arabic class (ARBC 110)",
    "Yes as long as the student is dedicated and willing to put in the effort every night.",
    "I would say its a lot of work and a lot of effort, comparable to other language classes I've heard of at Yale. I would recommend it only to those who are seriously interested in learning Arabic."
