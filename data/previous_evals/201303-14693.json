   "comments": [
    "Good class; the class covers new topics not covered in intro psych. worth taking if you are interested in the topics.",
    "Take it! Great senior psych class",
    "good class with interesting conversations. super laid back. 1 paper and weekly responses, that's all",
    "Very interesting stuff. Professor Napier does a fantastic job of assigning interesting and relevant readings each week and managed to set up several guest lectures with the authors of some of the readings. Work load is reasonable as well. Weekly response to the readings (1 page double space) and term paper of course",
    "A little slow at times but horizon broadening in the readings and occasionally discussions.",
    "Awesome material, very boring class. I'd still take it though because the material is very interesting and if Professor Napier just changes her teaching style a bit it could flip the class from boring to exciting.",
    "Yes! The class is a great way to learn about psychological theories that shape the rampant inequalities facing Americans today. The main format of the course is discussion, so be prepared to bring your own experiences to the table and leave predispositions at the door.",
    "Highly recommended!",
    "Definitely take it! Professor Napier is wonderful. The seminar is small-enough that you stay engaged and do the readings while still being relaxed.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is a great way to learn about inequality in a relaxed environment. I feared the topic would be too overwhelming or that I wouldn't be able to contribute much to discussion because I had never studied the topic before, but Professor Napier is encouraging and the class really stimulates open and comfortable discussion.",
    "A very thorough course; if the subject material isn't appealing then the class likely won't be enjoyable. But if you find it at all interesting then it will go well.",
    "Very good readings, so if you've taken a few sociology classes then you'd probably like this.",
    "Recommend this course who wants to discuss some real questions that actually affect society personally and socially every day."
