   "comments": [
    "This course provided a great foundation in critical thinking and close reading. Completing a course centered in such abstruse poetry also instills confidence! Perhaps just as importantly, learning to develop critical arguments around the material we read also prepares students for any future English course they may take.",
    "I honed my analytical skills, especially with regards to poetry. I learned how to read Old English. And I learned how explain my thoughts clearly in class. Through this course, I also learned to appreciate poetry much more and have become much more interested in poetry.",
    "Really improved my writing skills because Prof Rogers gives great feedback on all written assignments. Also developed better deep reading skills and learned to read Middle English at a basic level.",
    "You learn quite a bit about the early English texts, and about how storytelling evolved. I felt that I got a great grounding in essential texts, and I think it will help me understand contemporary literature better.",
    "This course introduced me to a collection of poets I had never before encountered in an academic setting. Throughout the semester, I learned how to better navigate complex texts, from the confusing Middle English of Chaucer to the cryptic allegories of Spencer. This course also improved my ability to participate in seminar-style discussions. Finally, this course greatly refined my writing skills and improved my ability to craft multi-page papers focussed around strong central arguments.",
    "We learned some of the fundamentals of English literature, in the course of reading and lingering over four authors who have been hugely influential for so many subsequent writers and poets."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was very strong overall. I only have a couple of specific suggestions (which may simply be personal preferences). First, perhaps Professor Rogers could offer fewer essay prompts? While Professor Rogers was certainly generous in providing so many, some students felt that the sheer number made the process of honing in on a topic overwhelming. Also, for the online forum, perhaps Professor Rogers could encourage his students to interact with each others' posts more directly. By the end of the semester, students responded to each other more pointedly, but I think the online forum would have been more beneficial if students had engaged with one another earlier in the semester.",
    "I enjoyed all the texts we read, though I wonder if there actually could have been MORE assigned reading, either more from the poets already on the syllabus or more poets on the syllabus. (I know the course is being restructured, though, so I'm interested in seeing what happens... if I were to knock off anyone, I would choose Donne)",
    "The strength of this course was Professor Roger's explanations and patience with his students. Also, the weekly discussions on canvas really helped me prepare for lecture. Although they could be a lot of work, it kept me on track with my readings and kept me engaged with the work. I also really liked the pacing; it never felt like the professor was moving too fast and we always had plenty of time to prepare and write the essays. The weakness of the course is probably the structure of the final. As an English course, I felt that an essay testing memorization was not particularly useful. Instead, I think that one longer final essay would allow us to dig deeper in the text and really understand it.",
    "I really liked this class and I think the time allocated to each poet is pretty good - Shakespeare gets the least time because the sonnets we read are pretty accessible, whereas Spenser and Chaucer and Donne are harder to read without discussion\/guidance.",
    "I think this is a very strong course. Yes, it requires an attention span, but it is well worth taking. It's based on reading and discussion, with attention to writing as well. It is a great class!",
    "I had a very positive experience with the course. This is likely due to Professor Rogers' excellent teaching skills. Regarding the actually course material, though, I had a surprisingly enjoyable time reading most of the texts for this class. I feel like I have gained a baseline understanding of Chaucer, Spenser, Johnson, Shakespeare, and Donne and am excited about taking a course in each of them throughout my time at Yale. I am glad to have encountered these poets so early into my undergraduate career and the course has solidified my commitment to a degree in English. This course is also an excellent exercise in writing. I enjoyed writing essays for the class and felt as though the number of papers required was reasonable. However, I wish the course was slightly better balanced. Though Chaucer and Spenser received a great deal of attention, the latter three poets, especially Johnson and Shakespeare, felt rushed. Cramming two masterful poets into the span of two weeks didn't make much sense. I recommend that Johnson and Shakespeare either be cut out completely, or the amount of time spent on Spenser and Chaucer be shortened in order to allow more space for the other poets. I feel as though there is a class or two that could be removed from the Spenser unit, though that might just be because I enjoyed Spenser the least. Also, I question the necessity of weekly forum posts on Canvas. I understand the purpose of these posts. However, the requirement to post on Canvas once a week felt like more of a drag than an opportunity to think critically about the assignment for the day. I think I would have gotten the same amount out of the class if Canvas posts weren't required every week. Finally, I recommend eliminating a final exam. I would have preferred to write a more robust final paper instead. The final exam seemed like overload, especially considering we also had a paper due towards the end of the semester. Moreover, the final exam covered skills we had never focussed on during class. In short, the exam felt thrown in and didn't appear to serve any major purpose. Those three small criticisms aside, I did truly enjoy the class. English 125 was undoubtably one of the highlights of my semester. Often, discussions would completely alter my perspective. On multiple occasions, I left the classroom feeling as though my mind had been completely blown. I consider this the sign of an excellent course.",
    "The course's greatest strength lies in the amount of time that can be devoted to each poet. Since we only study four poets, we can really give each author enough attention."

   "comments": [
    "Simple answer: DON'T take this class if you're not majoring in English or don't enjoy poetry. DO take this class if you are, and you do, and ESPECIALLY if Professor Rogers is the instructor.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to another student (especially with Professor Rogers!). Learning to read Middle English poetry is a daunting challenge, but with the guidance of a patient professor, students greatly benefit from the critical analysis skills that develop from reading Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne. Provides a solid foundation for future English coursework.",
    "Definitely -- the material can be difficult, but Professor Rogers is very engaging!",
    "I'm not sure this review will be all that helpful because 125 is changing, but I do think that the old version (the one I took) is worth taking. No matter your preferences, these are important texts Chaucer, Spenser, Donne, Shakespeare that have influenced so much literature that has come after them. The seminar set-up is, as always, ideal for humanities classes. I would say you shouldn't take this past your sophomore year, though, and ideally in your freshman year.",
    "I would recommend this course! Going in, I was really hesitant because I didn't have much experience with poetry, not to mention Old English poetry. However, this course allowed me to understand poetry at a much deeper level and see the beauty of it. Although this course sounds like it is going to be really boring, it is actually quite interesting and deals with many deep philosophical questions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a little bit of a challenge, because the readings are not easy. I loved it, and if you're willing to engage with the material, it's great reading some of the most shocking and crazy stuff in older literature.",
    "Yes -- if you are an English major, I think you really need to take this class (even though it is technically not required anymore). I held off on taking this course until I'd already taken several other English classes, and I can say that I would have enjoyed those other classes even more if I'd had English 125 as a grounding. Professor Rogers was enthusiastic, entertaining, and very good at his job -- I recommend both him and the class!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any other Yale student. I believe that even non-English majors should take English 125. It serves as a strong introduction to a handful of texts that I believe everyone should read. I owe a great deal of my enthusiasm towards the course to my professor, John Rogers. However, I still think that the material covered in the course is excellent and everyone should at least try to take the class.",
    "It's a fantastic course, whether you're an English major or not. Everyone should know and read these essential texts.",
    "Definitely take it! Great course, engaging seminars, very interesting to see the progression of the English language since the middle ages."
