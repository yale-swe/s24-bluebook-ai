   "comments": [
    "The class was essentially a basic introduction for any philosophy course. I would definitely recommend it because now I feel as if I have the tools to effectively understand and evaluate future philosophical texts that I read, even outside of the western canon.",
    "A strong yet difficult course that introduces students to Western philosophical tradition. It provides student with argument analysis skills that are very helpful.",
    "Take the class. Most college freshmen have never been exposed to schools of philosophical thought before so for that reason everyone should take the class.",
    "This is a great introductory philosophy course, and Professor March is fantastic professor. The books are intense and intimidating but working through them is really rewarding.",
    "I think this is a very good introductory philosophy course that looks at philosophers from Plato until Aquinas. I would definitely recommend it to another student because its a class everybody should take.",
    "Fun if you like the material. Professor March is a good professor to have.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student what we read is interesting and discussions are usually meaningful.",
    "It's a great course, if you can take it with Professor March, take it with him.",
    "This is a good course taught by a great professor. He works very hard to keep the class engaged and the information relevant and often connects the works we study to modern philosophy and current events. Professor March and deeply knowledgeable about the content and understand that this is many students' first introduction to philosophy. That said, he has high yet reasonable expectations of his students yet makes himself very accessible if one ever needs help. This class really drew the best out of me and I found it fulfilling. It was a great experience.",
    "Philosophy in Directed Studies is immensely challenging, as it should be. Students are working with texts that have puzzled thinkers and spurred controversy for hundreds of years. They should be difficult to understand. The papers are a little terrifying, but it's worth it because you learn as much as you let yourself, and then a little bit more, because you're also figuring out how to think in a completely new way.",
    "Yes, the best class out of the four I've taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is very useful in terms of teaching logical thinking."
