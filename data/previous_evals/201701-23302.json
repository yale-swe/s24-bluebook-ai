   "comments": [
    "This class was phenomenal. I actually switched from American Studies to Environmental Studies because of this class. My worldview on nature and wilderness was completely flipped, and I interacted with the conservation movement in ways I never had before. I learned a ton and always prioritized my readings for this class because of that.",
    "This class gave me a much better understanding of the history of American wilderness. I also have a much more nuanced view of what counts as wilderness; the difference between conservation, preservation, and environmentalism; and the barriers that prevent people from interacting with\/experiencing wilderness.",
    "I learned a ton about American environmental history and American perspectives on the environment and wilderness, especially in the 20th century (which I knew little about previously). I also learned a lot about New Haven and its special relationship to the environment and wilderness. While this category may seem narrow, I now feel very knowledgable about American wilderness itself and in the American imagination--and I feel that this knowledge is very applicable to my life and modern society.",
    "This class provides a significant overview of American environmental history, with an eye towards wilderness.",
    "For anyone interested in fundamental questions of how humans relate to nature, this course offers an incredible overview of the evolving history of the American perspective.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS. It completely changed the way that I think about wilderness and nature, and as an aspiring ecologist, I can't express enough how important that was to me. Learning the basis for which I interpret wilderness and nature, and also the history that led to my interpretation was extremely eye-opening, and I believe that this changes the way that I approach conservation science and my career.",
    "This is the best class I have taken so far at Yale. It was demanding, but I worked very hard and that hard work was so rewarding. Prof Rutkow clearly knows everything and more about the topic, and he organized the class in such a way that facilitated an incredible amount of learning for me. First of all, the class allowed me to read all the canonical literature about wilderness, so I can now say I have read Thoreau, Emerson, Leopold, etc etc and that is a great baseline for an environmental studies student to have. Second, I feel like I really learned how to think critically about the readings during class time. We had amazing discussions, which were facilitated by Prof Rutkow in the questions he asked of us, but he left so much space so that we could do the learning by ourselves. I feel so lucky to have taken this class as a sophomore, and I know it is going to shape the course of my undergraduate experience for the next two years because I loved it so much.",
    "Through this class I learned to think critically about the natural spaces that I spend time in, whether they be tiny city parks or national wilderness areas. I learned that often there's much more of a story to a place than meets the eye. The class in general was a fun history lesson of the United States through a wilderness\/conservation lens.",
    "I love the outdoors, but had never before considered nature and wilderness in an academic way (beyond the scientific). This course has definitely added to my appreciation of nature through my increased understanding of the history and challenges of 'wilderness' in the US."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great readings, great discussions, tons of interesting excursions Weaknesses: could have possibly structured writing assignments with some more guidance to enhance understandings",
    "Class discussions were fantastic. Professor Rutkow had a great lineup of readings every week, and we rarely had a shortage of things to say (on the contrary, we generally ran out of time). I think that the weekly book reports could be cut from the syllabus. Although some of the books were very interesting to learn about from fellow students, they significantly decreased the amount of time we had to have full-group discussion. What's more, the weekly reading assignments were already so long (in pages and time necessary to read them thoroughly) that the week in which you had to present an additional book to the class was pretty overwhelming. That's my only suggestion!",
    "I see no major weaknesses of this course.",
    "This course had a rather white male centric syllabus, to which the professor gave minor lip service about wanting to challenge.",
    "I really liked the way the course was structured as far as developing and challenging a nuanced understanding of wilderness. There was a bit too much reading to count on doing all of it every week, but the vast majority of readings were very interesting.",
    "The class evolves in large part year-to-year depending on the instructor and the syllabus. It's strengths stem from the creativity and the personal passion that each instructor brings, a focus naturally drawn out of the background of the professor.",
    "It's a lot of reading, but I thought that it covered a good amount of material and topics, so I'd call that a strength of the course. I also thought that the individual presentations were a wonderful way to not only read more about something that potentially interests you, but to also learn about it from the student presenters without reading the books. The courseload was also just right. I also thought the class dinner and field trip were spectacular, because I not only got to know my classmates in a non-class setting, but also because in a class where we discussed wilderness in the North American Imagination, it was extremely important to me that we also discussed and interacted with these ideas within our own frames of understanding regarding wilderness. I couldn't think of any weaknesses in the course!",
    "The strengths of this course are numerous. The readings by themselves are enough to make the course worth it. But mostly it was Professor Rutkow's way of facilitating class discussions that made the class so special. He made sure we had all the background historical knowledge we needed before starting the discussion, and then mostly left us to our own devices while still every so often jumping in to ask a provocative question. The course contained absolutely crucial content for anyone hoping to understand environmental history, environmental politics, the role of government in protecting wild land, and environmental philosophy. It was somehow comprehensive and deep at the same time, and I walk away from the class knowing that I learned so much critical information about the field I intend to pursue.",
    "I thought the major strength of this course was the people in the course and professor, the majority of whom were really engaged in discussions throughout seminars. The material is of course important, and a wide selection of readings was covered across history and many viewpoints which I appreciated. I also really liked the book presentation that each student gave on a different book corresponding to the relevant week's readings. This allowed students to delve deeper in an area of personal interest, and also share additional material with students in discussion that was often helpful in reaching conclusions. Some weaknesses of the course were to be expected in a course with such a broad and ambitious title, such as trying to cover a large amount of material in each discussion which meant that we couldn't fully develop certain ideas, or never got around to discussing some of the material. I at once find myself wishing we had covered more topics, or others more in depth--such as demographics in wilderness spaces, or how current wilderness groups are addressing present social or environmental issues such as climate change--, and also that there had been less pages assigned each week. So there's no easy fix to that. I would say that with the current workload I managed to read 90% of the readings, so had more readings been assigned I may not have been able to participate in discussion as well, and with more topics covered it would have been difficult to understand certain time periods or events enough to really grasp them. So I think you've just got to pick your battles, and I think the course did a good job with this."

   "comments": [
    "Even though getting into this class is never a guarantee, it's clear why it is offered every year. I would definitely say to shop it but not to bank on getting in. If you do, it's absolutely worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in the outdoors who wants to learn more about the history of America's conception of wilderness. The long reading assignments are worth it!!! I also really enjoyed class dinner (our year it was at Miya's sushi) and our Saturday field trip of Sleeping Giant and a variety of parks near New Haven.",
    "Great class with Rutkow. He cares a lot about the material and knows a lot. I had never taken an American Studies - type seminar before and did find the course to be a bit nebulous in its mix of different disciplines and writing styles. With Rutkow though it ended up being mostly a history seminar. Not a terrible workload, pretty interesting subject matter so I'd say take it if you can get in. I'll give this class a B+, very good just sometimes would get a little esoteric, and there is a pretty heavy reading load.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking this course. If you are remotely interested in wilderness or any of the material on the syllabus, by taking this class you will learn an incredible amount about the wilderness in American history. As the course gets on the material actually gets quite complex and challenging through postmodern deconstruction of ideas of wilderness. The materials are generally interesting and Professor Rutkow was great at leading discussion. The dinner at Miya Sushi and the field trip were definitely highlights.",
    "In the past, this course has gotten rave reviews, but they switched the instructor this time around, and I think that has a huge influence on the experience of the class. A fine 5th class if you want to take a seminar for a 5th class, but with lots of reading that can get really tedious.",
    "Yes! Very interesting and totally changes the way you think of wilderness and nature. An interesting topic we almost never think about.",
    "Absolutely- this is an incredibly fun seminar that tackles some of the most challenging questions about the place of humans on the planet.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I'm so glad I did. I was initially on the waitlist, but expressed how interested I was in this class, and I'm grateful that I made that investment. It's been a life-changing class for me, and probably my favorite class that I've taken at Yale (and I'm saying that as a senior). It was a lot of reading, but the fact that the feedback was \"I wish we read more\" conveys that there's just so much to be learned. The courseload itself isn't that heavy - 2 reading responses, 1 presentation, 1 final paper - but it's worth it to do the reading because you get more out of the class discussions when you've actually read the assignments. And definitely do the class dinner and class field trip - they were extremely rewarding parts of the course, because it bridges the gap between discussing how others thought about wilderness over time and discussing how (& why) we think about wilderness.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only to people who are willing to work for it. Part of why I got so much out of it was because I did every reading every weekend before class and came prepared for the discussions. Participating and listening to others who treated the work equally seriously was SO rewarding. Also, Professor Rutkow (as a historian, lawyer, and writer) has a very well-rounded approach to the wilderness concept and made a huge effort to assign both canonical works and modern intersectional critiques.",
    "Hell yeah! It's super great and really made me think critically about the wilderness\/natural spaces that I spend time in. I'd recommend it to EVST\/E&EB majors as well since it is a wonderful introduction to the social\/policy factors in the history of ecology\/conservation. It's also a really fun variety of readings and the people in the class are very excited to be there. And the class trips are a plus too. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in the outdoors and want to learn about all the history and work that has created those spaces. It's quite a lot of reading each week, but usually a good variety and interesting. Class discussions can be a little slow especially with a larger class, but they can also be super interesting and compliment the readings nicely."
