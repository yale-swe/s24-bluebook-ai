    "Intense. A lot of work. Not easy. Very, very fun. The students are great. The professors are great, and it's overall a very enjoyable course that really improves your Japanese. 4lyfe.",
    "I would really recommend this course, as it is effective in teaching as well as interesting and fun.",
    "I would recommend it for another student if they are truly interested. They will not be dissapointed, but the drive to succeed must be there.",
    "WONDERFUL, rigorous beginner course in Japanese. Probably one of the best in the world! :) Take it if you are at all interested, and want to learn a difficult language FAST and effectively.",
    "Prepare to put an hour or two per day into this class--but if you enjoy language learning, then you will enjoy it the whole time. Japanese is VERY different from English so the faculty will push you hard to learn a lot in your first year. The textbook is apparently controversial. I loved it--no other language textbook I have used respects and takes its readers seriously as committed language learners. I appreciated its rigorous explanations about Japanese grammatical structures, word etymologies, and standard canons of intonation. USE IT READ IT",
    "If you're in 120, you've probably already taken 110. It's the same deal, lots of work, lots of fun."
