    "very interesting material. hard work but doable with friends and office hours",
    "Lie Groups is a class in progress. This time around it had a lot of flaws, but the big picture was somewhat cool. Roger Howe will probably improve the class by the next time it's taught. Just be prepared: he really really really likes doing computations on the board and assigning computations. There are very few rigorous proofs in the class, and even fewer that don't just amount to computation.",
    "This is a unique course. Professor Howe is great, but this course was pretty scattered. Problem sets are tricky, but he provides two review sessions a week + office hours, so it should be manageable. 350 wasn't required, but I don't know what I would have done without it.",
    "This is a very challenging and abstract math course with interesting material. Professor Howe is a major player in the field, and learning from him is great. However, do not take the course unless you have taken at least 350.",
    "It's mostly an advanced course in linear algebra with some confusing Lie Theory towards the end. If you really like linear algebra and matrices it would be a somewhat interesting course but I was underwhelmed by the lesson planning and we never really learned exactly what a Lie Group is."
