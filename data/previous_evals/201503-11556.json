    "You've gotta take it, and that's that, but I had a really good time. SUPER MATLAB HEAVY. BEWARE. also, finnicky computers. Also, the lab reports are intense and calculation heavy. It's not the most work I've done in lab, but it's not as easy as just writing down what you did.",
    "a great lab to accompany physiological systems",
    "I believe this lab is BME only and is also a requirement, but I would recommend it regardless. It is paired up really nicely with BENG 350, and it's fascinating to see the concepts from lecture being applied concurrently in this lab.",
    "A good lab for introducing you to research in the biomedical field. I especially liked the panel of MD, PhD, and MDPhD students where we got to ask them career-related questions.",
    "Definitely one of the more fun labs I've been in. Prof. Seifert is a really chill instructor and not that hard. The lab reports are pretty data intensive, but the formatting for labs is really easy.",
    "BENG 355L is a lot of fun, especially after PHYS 205L and PHYS 206L, which have really complicated setups. You can basically only take this class if you're a junior in BME (with some exceptions), plus BME students are required to take it, so you don't really have a choice in the matter. It involves very basic MATLAB coding (just changing some parameters; don't be scared!) and you can get a lot of help from the TFs. The bulk of the work comes in the form of the lab report, but, if you work with your lab partner(s) to number-crunch, the quantitative answers end up being really fast to complete.",
    "The lab is pretty painless!",
    "You probably have to take this course if you are a BME major. But if you are just interested in physiology, I would hands down recommend this course. It seemed very manageable.",
    "It's a good lab class on physiology. The material is understandable and the TA's are very helpful. The lab reports are not as bad as physics lab but it does require time to analyze data. Lab was once a week and usually lasted the four hours depending on how much you wanted to get done in lab. Matlab is necessary for the class, so take this after biocomputation. This class provides a good time for some BME bonding :)"
