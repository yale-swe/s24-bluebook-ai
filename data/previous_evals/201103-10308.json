    "Anthro 640 is a global health\/medical anthropology\/public health class that focuses on infectious diseases and child and maternal mortality. More importantly, the class and the books that we read focus on how people experience the disease as an individual in a social world. I would recommend the class to those who are interested in these fields.",
    "A good opportunity to read and discuss health issues in navy parts of the world.",
    "I'd recommend this to anyone interested in global health and\/or medical anthropology. It's essentially an academic book club with global health anthro books, which I found to be fun. The three hour block starts feeling pretty long by the end, but it's an interesting class with very little work outside of the reading, and well worth it.",
    "Definitely take it!! If you're interested in issues in global health, including both the biological and the social, take this course! It provides huge insight into how health problems and their solutions are far more complicated than they might first seem (especially to policy-makers).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It's a great seminar, better than intro anthropology courses in global health. Professor Inhorn is committed to her students and clearly engaged in the coursework, which in turn keeps the students engaged. The readings are interesting and varied, and class discussion lively.",
    "Yes, the course material and the instructor for this course are fabulous. I would highly recommend this to other students.",
    "A great class to take if you're interested in medical anthropology and global health."

   "comments": [
    "I was able to develop a better understanding of various infectious diseases that I had not previously considered and the system of vaccination in different countries.",
    "This course greatly helped in my knowledge of anthropology, and was hugely influential in how I will choose to approach and structure my senior essay.",
    "This class contributed to my understanding of global health issues from a bottom-up perspective. Helpful for a public health student in global health.",
    "This provided me with a new perspective on health that I had not explored before taking this course. It will certainly benefit my education and future career in understanding global health interventions, policy and programming.",
    "I got a much better sense of the areas where there are gaps in ethnographic research on specific health issues anddiseases, and also walked away better understanding how my work fits into the broader spectrum of ethnographic and theoretical approaches to medical anthropology."
