    "Yes, highly recommend this class.",
    "Movie Physics is a a great science or QR class to take for anyone enjoys physics but isn't great at it. The class is fun, and the topics aren't too difficult to grasp if you do the work and stay engaged. Overall, I would definitely suggest this class, the professor is awesome.",
    "If you STINK at math, TAKE THIS COURSE. It is the EASIEST QR you will ever take here; however, if you SUCK at math like I do, you will most likely still struggle at this course (Welcome to Yale!). Professor Robinson HELPS you so much though! Droping your worst homework grade, dropping your lowest Exam grade, giving you 1 extension for the class on ANY homework. If you don't take this class, then not only are you missing out on a wonderful professor and wonderful class, but you are missing out on a SUPER easy (compared to the other courses here) QR credit.",
    "Good class to take to knock out a SC\/QR credit, its interesting and still teaches you a few things. if you have any background in physics or higher math, you'll get bored if your expecting a rigorous workload ( in terms of difficulty) - its just not what the class was designed for. If you are worried about other Sc\/QR at Yale but still want to learn some interesting concepts, take it for sure",
    "I would recommend this course, but do expect to do a good amount of homework and studying.",
    "Definitely recommend it for a fellow nonscience major who needs a science credit. By know means an overwhelming course and Professor Robinson is generous in how he grades but this by no means makes it a gut course and it still requires solid effort from the students",
    "Entry level physic's class with 3 major exams. Interesting and useful. Not a particularly large amount of \"movie clips\" as the semester continues on.",
    "I would certainly recommend Physics 101 for a fellow student. It was informative and provided a very solid base for understanding physics.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 101! I had never taken any physics before, but Professor Robinson was more than willing to work with me on an individual basis. The topics were all interesting, and I came away with an understanding for principles and concepts I hadn't been introduced to before. Plus, we spent 1\/4 of the class watching movie clips. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Great class if you are looking for an easy QR. Not much work at all, and very generous grading.",
    "Great class for someone looking for a math or science that is interesting but not incredibly time consuming or difficult.",
    "This class is perfect for those who are scared of Yale math classes but actually want to learn and grow. The material ranges from the study of physics as it relates to the beleiveability or doability of movie stunts to black holes and global warming. Really interesting lessons -- you leave the course with a mathematical understanding of the principles of physics (but not boring mathematical -- mathematical in terms of solving real physical problems.) And all of the material is just really useful -- or really important to understand might be the better way to describe it, especially when he gets to global warming. I'm so glad I took this course. It was the best way I could've used my QR requirement.",
    "Great class, manageable if you are looking for a QR or Sc",
    "Be warned: Movie Physics isn't a \"gut class\" as many believe it to be. However, the workload is manageable and Professor Robinson makes himself available to his students that request help. He's a great guy that makes learning physics fun. His demonstrations and overall refreshing take on traditional physics is unparalleled. If you can take this class, do it.",
    "Physics 101 01 is a science course for non-science majors. You learn real world applications of physics based on movie clips. Do not take this course if you think you will be simply watching movies--there is a lot of physics. It is certainly not math-heavy and the professor is extremely available for extra help. He posted copies of the notes online before the midterm and final and held review sessions before the midterm and final. Prof Robinson is very enthusiastic and genuinely wants you to learn. It is not a gut course and the tests are hard but if you study you will be fine. It does provide a non-science non-math major with the opportunity to fulfill a science\/math distributional requirement in an environment adjusted to fit non-science non-math people and learn interesting information. As long as you pay attention in class, go to office hours if you have questions, and study you should be fine.",
    "Movie Physics is a great and definitely manageable course that teaches basic physics concepts with the help of movie clips and demonstrations. There are weekly problem sets and three exams but the workload is not that substantial. Professor Robinson is an amazing professor that will do anything to help you understand the material. While it's easy, the course is not quite the gut everyone makes it out to be. Some of the concepts can be difficult to understand and help from Professor Robinson is needed to get the most out of the class. However, if you want to take a fun and fairly easy science course, definitely takethis one!",
    "Professor Robinson (Frank) is accommodating to the max. Willing to help you out, meet you on his own time for hours, supplement you with extra material or explanations on hard-to-grasp concepts, talk about his cool work in geophysics\/geology. Wonderful man. He is hilarious in a bumbling and adorable way. I took this for a QR (humanities background 100%) and found it difficult despite all the visual supplements to physics equations and laws. HOWEVER, you could not find a nicer professor to learn from. Put in the time, make an effort, know that it won't be a piece of cake, but do the work."
