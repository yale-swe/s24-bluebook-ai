   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course. The material is interesting, and the readings really do give a perspective that is otherwise absent from similar classes.",
    "The course is taught so well by Dr. Kavathas, who is an absolutely wonderful human being. She made the subject of immunology very interesting, so much so that some people in our class were willing to go into immunology as a career field by the end of our class.",
    "I would totally recommend MCDB 050. In a place like Yale, a small class like MCDB really lets you goof off, let out some steam, and get to know some students intimately in a way that you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere on campus. That doesn't mean the workload isn't hard, but that you don't feel as if you're in a lecture of 200 kids and you know no one.",
    "The first part of the semester is focused on basic immunology and the second is based on the study of specific microbes. The workload is very manageable. Definitely take this course if you have an interest in both immunology but also how diseases impact society.",
    "Immunology and microbes definitely goes into depth on scientific subjects and processes. It can be complicated at times, but Dr. Kavathas is always willing to explain more. The readings and reading list are great. The final paper allows you to explore an area of your interest in immunology. I feel a though I learned important things for my own personal knowledge. Even though I don't plan to major in the sciences, I got a lot out of this course.",
    "I would summarize it as a broad introduction to immunology and the way that one's body reacts upon encountering a pathogen. The first half of the semester it consists more of the biology behind immunology and the second half is more about infectious diseases and their impact on humanity. I would certainly recommend this course to another student because it was my favorite class this semester and Dr. Kavathas truly knows how to make this class an amazing experience.",
    "Yes",
    "I'd definitely recommend MCDB 050 for someone who is interested in how the human body responds to external threats and how some foreign entities are actually not threats to us at all. The lectures are pretty science-heavy, so AP Bio would definitely be a plus, but no background in advanced biology is still very manageable as the course material starts from the beginning of immunology and goes deeper from there. The assigned books are all very interesting and the class discussions were a great supplement to the readings. Workload was very manageable: several problem sets, two papers, and a final presentation.",
    "A brilliant class with a brilliant instructor only partially hampered by sometimes strange grading methods. Expect to work diligently and precisely -- even if you don't quite get Dr. Kavathas' grading methods, however, the material you learn in the class and the interdisciplinary approach you learn by make it more than worth it for anyone even relatively interested in this field."
