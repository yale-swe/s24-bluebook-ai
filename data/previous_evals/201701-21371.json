    "I gained a broad understanding of the different major poets in the English Canon in an environment that allowed students to draw connections between different poets and their relationship to the evolution of the English canon.",
    "I developed the skills of looking closely at the language of major works of poetry. I think this is an important ability when looking at these works.",
    "An Insight into how English history has affected English poets over the centuries",
    "I gained a heightened ability to evaluate poetry in this course, along with excellent exposure to the English canon.",
    "This class made me think more about connecting historical circumstances with styles and modes of art. It helped me hone my ability to write papers about abstract literary theory, and it sharpened my discussion skills, and specifically being familiar enough with texts to use them precisely as evidence during class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is an excellent use of time, the long seminars twice a week are enough for really fruitful conversation that drives the class forward. At times it felt like there was too much content crammed into a really small time frame though, and it wasn't fun to rush through something as serious and monumental as Paradise Lost.",
    "The strengths are that the professor is very engaged and the material is interesting, which I didn't necessarily expect. I don't see any obvious ways that it could be improved.",
    "The amount of time given to each poet sometimes felt arbitrary and undeserved, and I would have liked to study one or two more",
    "The reading material is interesting and the instructor (Professor North) is fantastic.",
    "My feelings towards the limitation of the 126 syllabus are in line with most of the criticism that has been levied against the course. The selection of poets, even more than 125, felt random and rarely did the readings coalesce into sustained themes. It was never clear to me why we read these four poets together other than they were all considered important on their own merits. If 126 is to be relavent, I feel their needs to be a stronger reason for presenting these four poets together.",
    "A strength of this course (the way Prof. North taught it) was that it didn't suggest that the four authors chosen represented \"the\" canon, but rather proposed them as a selection of semi-representative authors that could be used as an exercise in thinking about how literature changes and evolves and is in conversation with politics and other cultural phenomenon."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely would recommend this. I would say it is designed for English majors and students with a committed understanding and passion for the study of English literature - don't be fooled by the low number 126 as I don't think this is for any old Yale student.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the instructor makes things interesting and the material is challenging but not so hard that it's a problem.",
    "If you're an English major, yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, even to non-English majors.",
    "To be perfectly honest, I can't say I loved or enjoyed any of the material. That being said, Professor North made the material intellectually engaging if nothing else. He is an excellent and insightful discussion leader who is happy both to share his own opinions and listen to others. If you have to take it, he's definitely a great professor to take it with.",
    "I would recommend this course to English majors as one which strengthened my English paper writing skills, taught me to think a bit about literary theory, and gave me a chance to study authors that (with the exception of Pope, ugh) I found compelling."
