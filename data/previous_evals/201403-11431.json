    "How valuable this course is is directly related to the project on which you work. There was also more focus on writing style than content.",
    "Excellent class. Anyone who wants to work at the intersection of Business and Environment should consider taking it. Working with the client gave me a hands-on experience on consulting.",
    "The course lectures were very elementary and did not teach me anything. The same can be said for most guest lectures.",
    "It completely depends on which project you have. Ours did not end up being very good. I like Maureen a lot, and she cares very much about helping out each group with its project. I just don't find her lectures very helpful or engaging, and our project ended up being pretty bad. Also, she's very set in thinking that there's only one way to write well. I disagree. Plenty of people prefer more complex sentences that capture nuance and make the words flow, jump out, provide a narrative, etc. I can write a beautiful, rich sentence that gets a low score by that silly metric. Or, I can divide it into three stilted sentences that sound like a not-particularly-bright middle schooler wrote them and get a higher score. I've never ever once run into anyone in the working world who cared about this, nor have I ever been told anything but that my writing was excellent and appropriate for the audience. I think we just have to agree to disagree.",
    "The instructor did a good job organizing the course, but I think that the project selections could be improved. To be honest, none of the projects seemed particularly appealing, but because we are required to take a capstone course, and this was the only course that fit into my schedule, I felt a little forced to take it. I personally don't think that anyone with work experience could greatly benefit from taking the course.",
    "The course teaches very practical skills on project management and teamwork, and Maureen is awesome.",
    "Q10: Maureen goes an extra mile for students. She is so dedicated and considerate."

    "The lectures are not very helpful, and several of the guest lecturers were boring. One that comes to mind is the former FESer who worked at YCELP. Class is also scheduled at a terrible time, so always conflicts with interesting things going on on campus, club meetings, etc.",
    "As mentioned above, the selection of projects could be improved. However, I understand that different students would have different opinions of what is considered to be an interesting project",
    "Overall the course is perfect. Maybe ask people pay more attention to their classmates' presentations.",
    "More attention to team dynamics. Feedback was very badly structured - it only asked about quantity\/quality of work and did not get at team dynamics. Feedback (including the suggested phrases included as an example) \"crossed the net\", were not very constructive and would not have been acceptable at SOM. Many clients were not good to work with."

    "Disadvantages - different and conflicting schedules. Advantages - learning from other talented peers, and also dividing and conquering tasks",
    "Advantages: Working in a group was an opportunity to bring my ideas, to be challenged, to understand other people's ideas. The end result of the group work was to provide the best solution to our client. You also develop your leadership skills. The evaluation form that Maureen provided was one of the best aspect of the class, as your teammates provide feedback on you. This is a strong opportunity to understand what other people think of you. This is excellent as you identify areas in which you can improve.",
    "Our team was amazing so we each took the lead up different parts of the project and reviewed each others work.",
    "A couple of the group members were free-riders so the work load for the course was much more than it should have been.",
    "Team aspect is good. It's always valuable to work with different people and adjust to their personalities, abilities, etc. The class material and meetings with Maureen don't help in this respect. Group work is mostly a matter of practice and learning how you interact with others. The honest feedback portion of the class is helpful.",
    "It was great to be able to share ideas and split up the work, but many times the work was not split up evenly and there was definitely a lot of free-riding",
    "Great opportunity to learn from my classmates, not only their expertise, but also the way they communicate and get work done.",
    "I learnt deeper aspects of group dynamics. Specially when the group consists of people from different countries, it brings with it a great learning experience in terms of understanding personalities and adjusting accordingly to bring in desired results.",
    "The groupwork was the best part of the class, and it was structured and guided by the instructor in such a way that the weekly meetings were always productive.",
    "Advantage was to gain experience serving a client with a team. Disadvantages were that the class does not facilitate the formation of teams with good synergy, and exacerbates the problem by not devoting any attention or time to team dynamics. There should be several guest lectures from Amy Wrzesniewski and\/or Heidi Brooks about team dynamics in a class like this."

In this course, you have no control over what project you end up doing, so it might turn out poorly, and there's nothing you can do about it...",
