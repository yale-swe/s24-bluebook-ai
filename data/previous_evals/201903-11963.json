   "comments": [
    "Learned about the history of Neoliberalism and sexuality, especially through the lens of Foucault.",
    "I have improved in my comprehension of WGSS academic text and can now coherently read & write about the academic readings assigned in class.",
    "getting angry to the world but also finding hope in it",
    "I honestly do not know if I have any feedback. This class was very phenomenal and I feel like Prof. Savci did a fantastic job with helping us learn, grow, and overcome a lot of the tough material that was in the course.",
    "I literally learned so much in this class, I feel like every week I had a mind-blowing, eye-opening experience. There is so much to learn in this class because, as the title suggests, Neoliberalism and Sexuality are two very broad topics that have a surprising number or intersections. There is kind of a lot of reading for this class, but most of it is really interesting and there isn't a whole lot of other work so it is manageable. Our discussions in class were really helpful for digesting the readings, and the class environment was really empowering. Even though we had some depressing conversations, it always felt good to be in class with everyone else.",
    "This class is extremely interesting, and I gain a whole new perspective on the world. The readings and discussions were extremely insightful, and Professor Savci was instrumental in helping to further the concepts.",
    "You will LEARN IN THIS CLASS. You come in having no understanding of the very theoretical understandings of WGSS and you leave at least having some foundation to continue work in this field. I can not stress enough that you will grow as a scholar in this class. The readings give you a great basis in theory but also challenge you to be critical and engage with pieces academically.",
    "I started looking at society in a completely new way after taking this course. I knew nothing about neoliberalism at the start of the term, and now I feel I have a much better understanding of how society works today.",
    "My writing skills significantly improved and the course provided me with a broad range of knowledge related to history, literature, economics and political science.",
    "I learned how to manage multiple long readings to extract all important information while also being an efficient reader.",
    "I have developed a greater perspective on global issues, and feel I developed in critical thinking as well as theoretical understanding.",
    "I gained so much knowledge on the ideologies and systems that structure our society. We discussed the development of neoliberalism, read a lot of works by writers such as Foucault, Angela Davis, Audre Lorde, and Dean Spade, and we discussed things like the effect of neoliberalism on social movements, the state, and sexuality\/marginalized identities. I can't even begin to describe how much the class has affected me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are interesting readings and clear structure. Weaknesses are that sometimes we didnt explain the meanings of what we were saying sometimes we would have benefited from more direct analysis.",
    "Strengths: the readings were absolutely engaging & discussions in class were well-managed, so most students were able to get their points in. Weaknesses: the seminar was composed of 18(?) people, and although most students were able to get their points in, I can recall not hearing some students speak at all during the course. Maybe of there were more opportunities to work\/discuss in smaller groups, it would allow for more voices to be heard.",
    "The class was overall amazing! We learned so much about neoliberalism in ways that I didnt think one could and also learn how things that are traditionally tied to our identity are used and exist in neoliberalism. The class was a fascinating way to begin to tackle tough topics like power dynamics and the systems around us with a great group of peers.",
    "I only wish that we had more time to discuss everything since sometimes we didn't get to everything. This class was really helpful and a background in economics, philosophy, politics is definitely not necessary. Even though we read some dense texts, I would say that the strength of this class is that we learned how to grasp some really complex topics. Also, the blog posts and essays were super helpful exercises becuase they really tested to see if we understood what we read, and if not gave us the opportunity to go back and figure it out.",
    "I would always look forward to going to this class because it was so interesting and new. There was a large amount of reading, but usually it was interesting and fairly clear.",
    "Strength: EVREN SAVCI! EVREN SAVCI!!! EVREN SAVCI!!!!! The strength of this class comes from the strength of Prof. Savci. She is truly brilliant in a way that inspires you to work harder. Sometimes you will have no clue what's going on and then she will explain it in 30 seconds and suddenly everything in the entire world makes sense. Another strength of this class is the fact that you are there to learn. From the beginning, every assignment is about helping you learn and grow and you are never really afraid of the grade outcome because from day 1 growth, not grades, are the focus. Weakness: My only major problem with the class was that the final was so broad that it was difficult to really know what to do. It was an interesting essay topic, but I wish there had been more work on imagining a post Neoliberal world in order to prepare us for the final.",
    "I enjoyed the blog post assignments, because I felt they were a low-pressure way to participate and see what other people were thinking. I also really enjoyed the final paper. I think more of the course could be dedicated to more traditional lecturing, especially in the beginning, because while student-based discussion was helpful, sometimes it just felt that no one knew what was going on.",
    "I thought a strength of the course was that the professor chose to cover a broad range of topics and also complemented that with a high quality selection of contemporary and older readings. As well, she integrated case studies and materials from the news and current events.",
    "My weakness in the course was my lack of confidence in the neoliberal approach, however, this was strengthened by continually meeting with the professor and unpacking the readings.",
    "I really enjoyed the discussion-based nature of the class, and the content was always incredibly interesting. I would say the structure of the class into weekly topics was both a strength and a weakness because we were able to cover a lot of material, but sometimes I wished we had spent more time on certain topics. Often times, once we moved on to the next topic, we never had a discussion explicitly on that topic ever again."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if you have an interest in pretty hardcore critical analysis you wont get in most Yale classes:",
    "Absolutely! Professor Savci was amazing and this class was by far my favorite this semester.",
    "Yes!! The topic of this seminar is interesting and encompasses so much of modern society. It's also a good beginning point in practicing reading and writing about academic text.",
    "yes especially great for prospective econ poli sci global affairs majors ;)",
    "I absolutely would because this class allows you to begin to dissect and understand the social world around us through the lens of power and structures. And, Professor Savci does an amazing job at pushing you to grow by tackling some difficult ideas while also keeping the workload very very very manageable. And there are not a lot of writing assignments (and there is a lot of room for freedom of expression and exploration than I think is present in most classes).",
    "Yes!! I think it is so important for people to take classes like this! I never thought I would be able to understand Foucault and apply it to a paper about neoliberalism, but I did! I feel like I improved my thinking skills a lot in this class, and our discussions were actually inspiring and rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because I was extremely engaged and excited to learn.",
    "YES! TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU CAN! As a first year seminar this course is amazing. I looked forward to this class every day because the discussions were always amazing. Plus Prof. Savci is absolutely amazing and if this school had only faculty like Prof. Savci I would never want to leave.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course because it allows you to think about the world in a different way.",
    "Yes! It really opens up your worldview and the way you engage and interact with structures and communities around you. So thought-provoking and fundamentally important.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other first-year students.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is eye-opening and completely changed my day-to-day perspective.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course description made it seem really daunting, but I absolutely loved the content even though I had no background in this subject. Since taking this class, I feel like learning about neoliberalism is pertinent to understanding our society and social justice work. The readings were sometimes difficult, but our discussions in class were almost always based on addressing things we did and did not understand from the readings. The workload as a whole was very manageable, with only the readings and three short papers throughout the semester."
