    "Without a doubt. Great class, as it didnt have too much reading, but the discussions were great and I really got something out of this class. Take it.",
    "A look into common misconceptions about the American people and how they view politics. Despite the fact that many of the readings involved stats, it was interesting, not too much work, and you get to put together a study for the final paper.",
    "Take it. Gabe is the man, the readings are interesting, and you learn a lot about the realities of democracy in the US today.",
    "Democracy in America is an insightful analysis of voting, sociopolitical attitudes, and other aspects of political behavior. Recommended for great instruction, reasonable workload, worthwhile readings, and a fun final project",
    "This was a great class. Professor Lenz was a great teacher who tried to get us to think critically about everything we read. There was not too much reading, the workload was light, and the discussions were engaging. If you can, take it."
