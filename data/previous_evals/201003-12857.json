    "I would recommend it to students who are interested in learning an interesting language. But I would say focus on tones from the beginning by yourself once you learn what the tonesare. Plus, you have to be really self-motivated to get anything out of the course. If the class were a lot more strict, then you wouldn't have to be, but I think most of us didn't learn as much as possible because the course wasn't as strict as expected.",
    "Excellent! Learned alot while having fun. Great intro to the culture and traditions of Yorubaland!",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Yoruba and have a great time in class!",
    "Fantastic class! Great l1 course and a lot of fun. Take it!",
    "This is a superb language course! It has a very manageable workload and is so much fun! You will look forward to class every single day. There is a quiz every other week, one homework assignment per week and a midterm and final exam. Professor Adesola supports you with every step and you never feel overwhelmed or confused. He is very open to student questions during class and very understanding of our hectic schedules. You can't lose!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if youre looking for a fun and informative way to fufill your language requirement.",
    "This class is perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to speak Yoruba. The professor really takes it slow and teaches that class in a way that is easy to catch onto. This is a really informative class. I really enjoy it.",
    "Yes, if you want an easy, gut class where you're guaranteed an A!",
