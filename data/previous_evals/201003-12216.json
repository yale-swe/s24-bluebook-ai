   "comments": [
    "A good way to fulfill the bio lab requirement.",
    "Nucleic acids lab is a good lab to take for your MCDB lab requirement. You're working on a real project, which is a nice motivator. You work on one project for half of the semester, and another project for the second half (if you continue on). There are a few late lab days, but it was more than made up for by the many days when we were in lab for less than an hour. I learned a lot about in situ hybridizations. It was a very practical, useful, and educational lab.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're still looking for a bio lab credit. Even though it does meet twice a week, it's pretty useful in that you're doing real work, and learning real lab techniques.",
    "Pretty good bio lab even though it takes up a lot of time. Workload isn't that bad until the final paper at the end.",
    "Definitely take Nucleic Acids if you have the opportunity. You should email Professor Nelson as soon as you first think about it (aka right now) to get a spot in the class, you can always take your name off the list later. The workload isn't bad (no lab reports just short problem sets and one final paper), you get more credit than you do for other labs, and it's way more interesting.",
    "A lab class with a very, very light out of class workload and frequently only short lab days. The final paper takes some work but that's about it. Nelson is one of the most invested educators here; he truly wants students to do well and puts in loads of extra time to make things work. Sign up early!",
    "This was a great, easy, and laid-back lab. Highly recommended.",
    "This is a phenomenal lab. The time you spend in lab each day varies, but it is not too big of a time commitment (besides the final paper, which is lengthy). You get to do part of a real experiment and Prof. Nelson treats you like scientists in training; no more lame lab reports or worthless \"experiments\" like other labs here.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Great way to fulfill one-year bio lab requirement in one semester for one thing, not too painful. We did an in-situ hybridization for half a semester, projects vary from year to year though-maybe. Not too bad for a lab course, but quite a bit of work for one credit compared to a normal class--weekly problem sets, 15-page lab report, and lab notebook.",
    "Pretty manageable class. Problem sets every week or two aren't terrible, but start working on the final paper early. Never had to stay in lab past 4-430 except once or twice. Really good upper level lab.",
    "Best lab I've taken! There are weekly psets and a research paper at the end. The paper may be a pain if you procrastinate.",
    "If you need to take a bio lab, or even just want to learn a very useful technique, TAKE THIS LAB!! This is far and above the best lab class I have taken at Yale. Dr. Nelson is so devoted to the class, and if an experiment doesn't work, he will go and work on it - in general you will not be blamed or faulted if a step fo the experiment fails. There are biweekly homework assignments and a big final paper about your whole experiment. It's actually a really cool experience because you are doing a real project - we were characterizing the mRNA expression of a gene in a new area of the brain, where it had not previously been described.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "Probably the best lab I've taken at Yale. It was fun and worthwhile. We were actually doing an experiment for a lab at Yale, so it wasn't like we were just doing a known experiment. Our results really mattered! It's a mostly juniors\/seniors lab so it was fun because most of us knew each other. It was a very happy lab environment, which is different than most stressful lab situations.",
    "It's a good bio lab to get hands-on experience with in situ hybridization. Not too difficult, and you do learn a fair share.",
    "Best lab at Yale as far as I'm concerned, professor is great, workload fair, interesting, real project. In class can be slow at times, but that is the nature of research."
