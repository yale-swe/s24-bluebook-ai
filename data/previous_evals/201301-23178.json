    "Grading is tough, material is interesting although sometimes repetitive and seems like the content could be boiled down and taught in half the number of classes.",
    "Best class I've taken, hands down. Don't be scared off by the syllabus or first days of class: it's pretty accessible material. Really interesting content: learned a lot about the subject and about research methods in Political Science. It will force you to think critically, but it's not extremely difficult or a huge workload either.Professor Lyall is a great lecturer and very approachable, and he's also a badass with experience in the field in places like Afghanistan. Too bad he's on leave next year - when he teaches another class, take it.",
    "Really interesting class. The class covers the use of foreign aid and how to evaluate its efficacy, for example. The biggest thing I learned was the US wastes so much money in foreign aid, it's ridiculous. The class itself is not difficult. The professor summarizes the readings in class very clearly, but scanning the readings for papers is really helpful.",
    "Really unique course. Actually really enjoyed it. Might be better as a 50 min lecture with a section. But, seriously, the subject matter is pretty interesting and pretty practical. Lyall seems to have a commitment to be relevant, and he shines.",
    "Yes, but be warned that just because there isn't section, doesn't mean that you don't have to work for your grade. The grading on the papers is tough and you HAVE to do the readings.",
    "Interesting material. Gets sort of redundant. Readings can get very dry. If you want to do aid work in the future, I would recommend this course.",
    "It's a new class so listen to the reviews. It is not easy despite what the syllabus looks like. If you're interested in development or aid I would take it, otherwise it might not interest you.",
    "The class itself was extremely interesting. However, take note that there were many very, very low grades on the take-home assignments (think grades on a normal curve a la an intro physics class). To me, this was completely ridiculous in an introductory PLSC class, but alas. With that said, I have no idea what the final grades will look like. Supposedly there is no \"curve,\" but I have a difficult time believing that--we'll see, I guess. If you can stomach the shoddy grading, take it! Or just take it Cr\/D and that'll be a non-issue.",
    "This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale thus far. Professor Lyall is a dynamic lecturer and the course material is current and relevant. It provides a nuanced look at development by focusing on its effectiveness in conflict settings. The two papers (5-7 pages) are challenging, but interesting and the final was actually enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone interested in international development and\/or security.",
    "Yes. Very interesting material and not a lot of work at all.",
    "I would summarise it as a good course on the practicalities of war, and the theories behind the complicated conflicts we see today. If you're interested in philosophy of war, I wouldn't recommend it, but otherwise, give it a go!",
    "Great, fun, low-stress course. Fairly intro-level stuff for anyone who has studied field evaluations before, but I'd still recommend it.",
    "I really enjoyed Development Under Fire. I think this was the first semester they offered it at Yale. It's about what happens when the government tries to create aid\/development in conflict settings like Iraq, Afghanistan, Colombia, etc. in order to reduce violence. Prof. Lyall's really great. He's actually done a lot of work with USAID and other organizations in places like Iraq and Afghanistan so he's had first hand experience with a lot of things he talks about in class. He's also really young and fun.",
    "I think Dev Under Fire was a really interesting class that taught me to think about the effects of aid in a really different way, and from many different vantage points. There's a lot that goes into the development of an aid program and the evaluation process, and there are a lot of really interesting theories of why these programs should\/should not work.However, I would be cautious about taking it again. We were the guinea pig class so I think if there's a more balanced grading policy (it was two essays worth 25% each and a final worth 50%) and a clearer elaboration on how to do well on the essays, you'll be fine. Definitely go to the TA's before each essay and before the final, though.",
    "I DO NOT recommend this class. Yes, the material was initially interesting, but it became very redundant by the end. Prof. Lyall is very articulate and friendly - but the material itself made it difficult to remain engaged in lectures. The major problem with this class is all about grading and expectations. The two essays (25% each), which answered two questions each (each worth 12.5 points, so exactly 25 points for each assignment) were arbitrarily graded and were extremely harsh in terms of deducting points from your overall grade in the class. I found that TAs were not very helpful, and thought that comments and deductions were arbitrary and completely unwarranted. Students were held to too-high expectations. I want to say that I do not mean to sound entitled, and that I have worked extremely hard in my classes - so please don't take these comments as being overly negative without any justification. EVERYONE in the class was either very upset to very annoyed by the assignment grading and comments in this class. MANY students dropped after the grades\/comments for the first assignment - which, in hindsight, was very wise, and a sign that something was wrong. The final exam was unacceptably long and had unfair expectations in terms of having to write 10 double spaced pages on your laptop, in a classroom, in 3.5 hours max (it was very clear that at least 8 pages were necessary to properly answer the prompts). Considering that we had 10 days to answer 1 essay prompt, yet had 3.5 hours to answer all THREE questions on the exam - which required JUST as much time, effort, and references as a single paper prompt - it's clear that this class was not well thought-out.",
    "This is a wonderful course! You doesn't usually have the opportunity to learn from someone who is really creating the field as he is teaching it. This will give you a whole new perspective about what is going on in the world.",
    "While this class hasn't necessarily been my favorite, I do recommend it. I do appreciate a course with a final that goes beyond memorization and actually makes you apply what you learn to a hypothetical aid project.",
    "Very cool class but the assignments are graded very toughly. You have to put the work in to get a good grade.",
    "Yes! It is such a unique class that is manageable work wise and I even enjoyed taking the exam!",
    "Probably one of the most interesting and exciting classes at Yale. The grading seemed a bit tough, as evidenced by the number of people that dropped after the fist paper. While I definitely do not want to discourage students from taking this class, I would be hesitant to enroll until the harsh grading standards are corrected.",
    "If you are interested in international development in conflict settings, then definitely take this class. You learn a lot about the issues in the field and ways of evaluating programs, as well as the theories about insurgencies and civilian behavior. Prof Lyall is great - he has experience in the field and has done work in Afghanistan. He really takes the time to meet with students and answer their questions. He is great at explaining things.This class may be repetitive if you have taken other security courses or research design classes. I think it is designed to be an intro course, though it takes a different angle than the other classes. You don't need to know and you don't learn any math\/econ\/stats, a fact that the Prof emphasizes (but I think some of this stuff may have been valuable). The work load isn't too bad - 2 papers and a open book final. The papers were short but I think the grading varied depending on the TF.",
    "Awesome course about theories of civil conflict and insurgency, balanced out by a lot of lectures focused on practical applications of the theories in the real world (through case studies about aid programs and different studies that evaluate the programs.) The workload is very manageable (2 5-7 page papers, one essay-form final worth 50%of your final grade).) there are a lot of nightly readings that are interesting but granted, you probably won't have time to read them all during the semester. Prof Lyall also goes over the readings in lectures often.",
    "Practical take on conducting surveys in conflict zones with Prof Lyall's personal experiences being quite valuable. Introduction to many theories regarding aid during conflicts as well. Not too rigorous. Interesting and unusual exam.",
    "Great intro to a fascinating subject. Very timely.",
    "This is a great class on a very interesting topic, and it was really nice to learn from a practitioner.",
    "This class is hard work, and it's graded harshly, but it is incredible. Professor Lyall is a great lecturer, and he does a good job of tying theory and practical examples together. This class is great if you're interested in learning about the process of social science research or about development.",
    "Take this class! The material is fascinating, the lectures are engaging, and the tools and theories discussed are incredibly current. If you have any interest in conflict, in humanitarian aid, in the role of civilians, in the intersection of \"hard\" data and \"soft\" social science, then Development Under Fire is a great way to explore these themes and more.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend Devo Under Fire. Prof. Lyall is a good lecturer, and has an interesting perspective given his recent experience in the field (he spent last year doing studies in Afghanistan, which adds to the relevance of his course). The confluence of aid and counterinsurgency\/conflict zones raises interesting issues, and the class is solid, and had a manageable workload in its first iteration this year (2 papers, 1 open-note final).",
    "Very interesting material, well-organized lectures\/syllabus, great professor, manageable workload. If you're interested in this kind of stuff, definitely go for it!",
    "Unless you're Global Affairs or simply masochistic, don't take this one. Interesting course content, but it's really not worth the trouble at all.",
    "I would recommend this class on the conditions that the course is reorganized a bit and that student is self-motivated. Lyall has a lot of great information to teach and the course is informative, but it dragged a bit after the first couple months. Still, interesting and informative.",
    "I would not take this course. Professor Lyall is smart, a good lecturer, and at the forefront of his field. All that said, the course is unrewarding - the two papers feel like reading responses and are graded by TAs you've never met. The feedback is useless and grades feel arbitrary, since the essays are essentially a source packing contest. Additionally, the entire discipline is nonsensical. If you want to go into development, be my guest and take this course, but otherwise be prepared to be frustrated by useless information, broad generalizations, and a literature without a lot of serious potential.",
    "Take this class even if you're not a global affairs major because the workload is very manageable and the content is interesting.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS. If you are a political science major or interested in the material, take the class with Lyall.",
    "It's interesting, but the final is worth 50% of you grade, so only take it for a grade if you understand that.",
    "take it if you like the international side of poly sci, not a tough workload outside some of the readings",
    "THIS IS NOT A GUT. Seriously it screwed me over. The Professor says the readings aren't of much use and too mathematical\/dense to understand or help with lectures. BUT then you have to use readings in papers and you get screwed over. There are only two papers and a final and you end up kind of getting screwed.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Fascinating class, and I feel like I learned something. There's lots of readings, which is a drawback, but if you can handle it, I'd recommend this class.",
    "By no means a gut, but requires only well-timed bursts of intense commitment.If you're interested in international relations and tend towards more creative courses work wise, I'd recommend it. You can get away with doing little of the reading, but be prepared to buckle down and really give the two written assignments your all if you want a good grade. The final was also unlike any other I'd had before - open laptop, with all notes and reading accessible. Lyall gives you a few boundaries and specifics and asks you to create an aid program and method of evaluation; you're expected to get up to 8-10 pages in 3.5 hours.",
    "Course material is interesting and Lyall is an engaging lecturer. It's definitely a good introduction to the topic of development in conflict settings. However, there was almost no feedback on course performance or grades though, so Credit\/D might not be a bad idea.",
    "Yes it was a great course, maybe take it credit\/d",
    "Fantastic course. Grading was kind of tough, but the lectures were amazing, the content was always well-organized and clear. Overall very enjoyable. Lyall was a good lecturer--easy to listen to, engaging, very knowledgeable, never boring, very organized and easy to digest. The readings were good too, but long, but necessary. I alwaysgot good feedback on my papers too, which was refreshing. I felt that the grades didn't necessarily capture all of the work that I had put into the class; for example, doing all the readings and going over all of my lecture notes extensively wasn't really captured by the final, which was an in-class paper. Other than that frustration, great course. You have to put in the work though. DO THE READINGS!",
    "This class was not too much work and actually very interesting and practical. If you're interested in learning about development in conflict zones, I'd definitely recommend it. The focus falls heavily on Afghanistan and (to some extent) Iraq, so if you're expecting to hear about other countries, you might be disappointed. Overall, great new class that's bound to continuing improving after its first year. Professor Lyall is an engaging lecturer with real-world experience. You won't regret taking it.",
    "Good credit D",
    "I would highly recommend this, not only for GA and Poli Sci majors, but for anyone who is generally interested in learning about development in war zones. Professor Lyall is great at keeping lecture interesting and is very knowledgable in his field. If you do end up taking it, go to office hours and just talk to him! There's a lot you can learn from him. The midterm papers were not too tough, especially if you started early and the final was very comprehensive so make sure to go to lecture.",
    "This class gets fairly specific with the information. As someone who does not plan to go into the aid or ngo sector, I found this specificity to be overwhelming at times. But, it also gave me a very cool look at the otherside in conflict zones. I thought that the course material was so different from any other class at Yale (and Lyall's approach is refreshingly saturated in experience) that I learned a LOT!",
    "Dev under Fire is a very interesting course. The course material that Professor Dufresne presents is unique and thought-provoking. I thought all of the lectures were very engaging, and had no trouble paying attention throughout.This course also requires relatively little work. You can get away without doing all of the reading and the papers aren't too challenging. There are lots of non-majors in the course which makes it easier to do well on the curve.Overall, this was a great course, and I will recommend it to my friends.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Professor Lyall was great, but the teaching fellows could at times be very dogmatic and not helpful at all",
    "A great introduction to randomized controlled trials and impact evaluation, mixed with a introduction to poli-sci theories of war and civil conflict. Lots of good relevant examples from the recent past."
