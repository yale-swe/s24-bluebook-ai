   "comments": [
    "Usually, a course title that sounds so technical paints an image of boring lectures of long mathematical derivations and tedious theoretical homework assignments. While the course was undoubtedly mathematical, Professor Tully was an engaging lecturer even when he was going over the math. There wasn't much homework either, although you'll make up for that extra time studying for the exams. Stat mech is a difficult course to grasp mainly because it is so symbol-infested; even after reading the text a few times, you'll still be fuzzy about some of the derivations. Unfortunately, the small amount of homework and the open-book\/notes tests didn't motivate me to completely absorb the material, but I've gained a good foundation in the field, for sure.",
    "Stat Mech with Professor Tully is a great class to take. Although the material is difficult, Tully does a fantastic job of covering the material. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations.",
    "If you like the mathy parts of P-Chem and QM then this class is for you. Do some of the things you learn in these classes and gen chem with slightly more rigor. We cover some really cool topics.The material itself is pretty complex but the workload is very manageable and Tully is a great professor and makes the class interesting.I highly recommend this class for any math-minded science students (not just in chemistry).One down-side is that it's MWF at 9:25 which can be kind of brutal as being in class is pretty important.",
    "Chemistry 430 is an excellent overview of topics in statistical mechanics, from probability to classical and quantum statistical mechanics. I would definitely recommend the course to any student interested in theoretical chemistry and how math and chemistry intersect.",
    "CHEM 430 covers ensembles, ideal gases, classical statistical mechanics, Monte Carlo simulations, and molecular dynamics. It is an interesting class for those who enjoyed p. chem. Exams are open-book, so you just need to worry about understanding the material and not about cramming formulas into your head. That said, preparing for the exams can be difficult because there are hardly any problem sets, so not much practice applying the theoretical knowledge that Professor Tully covers in class.",
    "Professor Tully does a great job with explaining concepts thoroughly starting from basic concepts. The open book\/notes finals are nice in that you don't have to memorize all the equations, but they are harder than they first appear to be."
