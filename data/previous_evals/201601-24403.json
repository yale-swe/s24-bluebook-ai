Plus, he has so much great experience, and thus tons of excellent examples that illustrate the material clearly."

She's a great person to have met, and very knowledgeable; I just think that she didn't pace her presentation out very well with all the details she wanted to share. (I think she got through 30% of the material she planned to cover.) In short - I wanted more time with her! Perhaps she can have a whole class session instead of half?"

A major lesson I'll carry with me! I am very glad to have been given the proper vocabulary for this increasingly important area of the profession."
