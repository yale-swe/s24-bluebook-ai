    "Highly, highly recommend this class if you're at all interested in photography. Especially with Kate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she's awesome (although I'm sure all the other instructors are good as well)",
    "Yes, it's a good chance to exercise the creative part of your brain in a relatively relaxed environment. Not as intense as I expected, but still a fair amount of work.",
    "Yes, this is a great class to take if you are interested in photography with an artistic tint.",
    "Phenomenal class. It will challenge you technically and conceptually, and reward you for the work that you put in. Kate Greene is a encouraging, kind, and, when she needs to be, challenging. As someone with very little art background, one of the best parts of the class was spending so much time with my talented classmates. In critiques and class they helped me immensely in both my understanding and production of work, and I had the privilege of watching their pictures develop into works of art that genuinely brought me to tears at our final critique. I plan on shooting the rest of my life, and will make much better photos because of everything I learned in this class.TAKE IT!",
    "Absolutely. This class is wonderful if you're at all interested in the medium.",
    "I enjoyed taking this class immensely. It was a great change of pace from my other subjects, and I felt as though I was learning a lot as well. You can make it a class that takes a lot of your time if you really want to, but I think you can get by pretty well without taking pictures everyday like the syllabus suggests. However, don't go into this class thinking that you can justtake a few candids of your friends and call it a day; it does take artistic thinking and creativity to make a good final product."
