    "This was an excellent course! I was pushed choreographically more than I had in a very long time and I so appreciated it!",
    "If you're interested in modern dance, this class of fantastic. You focus on the work of Trisha Brown, but also read and watch works from other famous choreographers. I learned so much about who I am as a dancer and as a person through Irene's teaching.",
    "I learned compositional techniques, performance strategies, and a lot about my own personal creative process.",
    "I learned a huge amount about myself as a dancer, and as a thinker with other parts of my being than my head!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Irene has an incredible store of information so just being able to listen to her stories is extremely informative and appreciated. The course provides many hours in the studio to work, which with the lack of dance space available to students on a regular basis it was appreciated greatly. I liked how we worked on our midterm projects in class and continued to develop them further and received constant feedback for the final.",
    "The strength of this course is in Irene as a teacher and her ability to guide the class. It was great having a small class; I'd recommend that enrollment be capped at 8 or 10",
    "The class was small and therefore we all got individualized attention - this was a key strength. Irene's experience and artistic eye largely shaped the course and was also a major strength. The emphasis on the actual doing of choreography was really effective, but it was good to have supplemental underpinnings to the doing in the form of readings. I think the overall arc of the course became less obvious as we progressed into the semester; a potential weakness is letting the structure of the class be subsumed into our final project work. Personally, I didn't mind that, because it truly made the class a laboratory. But if the intent to survey compositional techniques then that was sort of lost towards the end once we zeroed in on our individual projects and their needs.",
    "I would have appreciated more structured time spent on how to create pieces as a group perhaps moving from the improv we did as a warm up into setting something by the end of a class session. I also just generally really enjoyed the improvisation we did, and would absolutely take a class that focused on that!"

    "Take this class!! Irene was an amazing teacher, and I learned so much about dance as a field, the history\/theory of modern dance, and my own movement. The class is creatively challenging rather than intellectually challenging, and you definitely get out what you put in.",
    "I loved this course - it was a place to experiment, a place to try and fail. Places like that are scarce on campus. The length of the class was productive though challenging, you can cover a lot of ground (educationally but also personally\/emotionally) when working for four hours. Being up and moving as part of a creative process for me is the greatest thing ever, so I'd recommend for those who love to move and who also like to build. Plus spending 4hrs with Irene every week is an absolute treasure, I would not have given that up for anything.",
    "Definitely! Irene is a wonderful teacher and a beautiful human being, and the chance to dance with her is a gift. As a ballet trained dancer this was a wonderful leap into a lot of forms and methods that were really very foreign to me, which was an incredibly valuable experience. This is a great class for anyone interested in exploring new ways to think with their body."
