    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the arts.",
    "I highly recommend this class for anyone looking to learn the basics of black and white photography. Using a manual camera, so developing and printing in the dark room, is very different from digital. It made me more aware of my surroundings and engaged me with the places and people around me. It is a lot of work, but it's worth it!",
    "Take this class, you won't regret it.",
    "Yes--take it, definitely! Great for all levels of photographers, and Lisa's very helpful. You're really encouraged to develop your own personal vision of the world, and you learn and grow so much as a photographer. Be warned that its a decent amount of work, and you'll be spending a lot of time in the darkroom.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to a fellow student. I would summarize the course by telling my fellow student, that it would give them a completely different perspective on how to view the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has a vague interest in photography. Black and White photography is such a great medium to explore and you will definitely enjoy your hours in the dark room. Because the size of the class is relatively small, it is a great way to get to know people and see how other people view the world.",
    "Art 136 is the kind of course that will completely open up your world. It's extremely time-consuming (I'd recommend taking it in a semester in which you have a lighter load or are taking other classes that aren't significantly time-intensive), and the supplies can get pricey, but it was so, so worth it. Whatever your course of study or future career may be, just take this course. Believe me."
