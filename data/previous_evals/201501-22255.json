    "I would take it. Even as a senior, it was a helpful synthesis and reframing of a lot themes that other classes touched on.",
    "Great class. This is Witt's first time teaching it to undergraduates I believe, and he is a great teacher. This is the kind of class where you have to go to the lectures, but if you're fascinated by the law or by American politics or history at all that is not a burden because they are fascinating. This is also a GREAT class to take if you're interested in going to law school, as it will give you a fantastic background. The TAs are also extremely smart and helpful, and in general it does not seem like it is too strictly graded. Can be more work than average but not overbearing, so take it!",
    "Would definitely recommend. The course can move a little quickly if you have not studied any sort of law related material\/famous cases, but Witt's lectures are well organized.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in law and history.",
    "Eh. Witt is amazing but prepare for tons of boring readings.",
    "great class, interesting lecture, good TA's. ton of work",
    "Yup, take it. Professor Witt will make you want to pay attention in lecture, and he curates amazing casebooks. You will become fluent in American legal history.",
    "The title is accurate. Its a bit heavily focused on the law and economics, but overall an enjoyable course.",
    "It's a great class about American legal history from an interesting perspective. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It's great that Professor Witt took the time to teach this subject to undergraduates. Take it if you're interested in law, though if you've been more of a Political Science\/law person, the different way of writing exams\/papers may be challenging. It's basically like an American history course but premised on the assumption that law has done a great deal to drive and shape American History. Definitely take it.",
    "Overview of key moments in the development and transformation of law in the United States. I would recommend it only to students who plan to become lawyers or are very interested in a less well known aspect of American history.",
    "This class is good if you're into law\/do mock trial. If not, then you will likely be eaten alive by all the after mentioned kids in this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as a unique perspective on American history, and especially for people who are interested in the law.",
    "Good low level intro course that provides a different perspective on American History. Too much reading for a lecture.",
    "Yes, & have recommended.",
    "The best class ever! Please take this!",
    "I would absolutely recommend american legal history. I loved it and I learned a ton. The readings were interesting and not too long. Professor Witt is extremely dynamic and helpful. Definitely take it!",
    "I really enjoyed this course! The lectures are always interesting and Professor Witt is fantastic. Make sure you go to class because his lecture slides just can't cover what you gain by being there. The readings are long, but really interesting and give a great understanding of the course material. For the more confusing topics, it's definitely worth going to office hours. Final focused on a few annoyingly small details, but in general the grading was fair and there isn't a lot of work outside of reading and leading discussion once over the semester. Overall, great class with a great professor. Couldn't have asked for a better introduction to law!",
    "This is a challenging but very good course. Take it if you are interested in American history or the law. It covers a lot of material and is reading-heavy, but lectures are very engaging. The midterm and final are generally fair, though grading is a bit harsh.",
    "I would definitely recommend. It is course that summarizes via US history from the perspective of law and is a great introductory course for anyone considering anything legal related.",
    "Yes definitely worth it!",
    "This is a great history course that I totally recommend. The readings are really interesting, as Witt posts these pdf documents that draw from a bunch of primary and secondary texts. He also generally really cares about students enjoying the class and does a lot of things to get us engaged.",
    "American Legal History is a class that talks about the evolution of law in American history. We looked at different periods in American legal history and tried to define what their themes and important cases were and which people helped contribute to these changes in thought. There is a ton of reading, taken from cases, primary sources, and secondary sources interpreting even some of the primary sources that we read.",
    "It's a solid history course that isn't for slackers but it's also not going to take up all of your time, and it's definitely a good one to take if you're interested in history from a legal perspective."
