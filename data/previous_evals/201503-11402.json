    "IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A LANGUAGE YOU HAVE TO TAKE ITALIAN 110 WITH MICHAEL FARINA! IT IS AMAZING! I DIDN'T EVEN NEED THE LANGUAGE CREDIT BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!",
    "You'll have homework every night, but ultimately you get what you put into this class. If you take the time to practice and put effort into it, then you'll enjoy the class a lot more than if you don't. That said, it is an introductory language course so you'll be expected to absorb a lot in a relatively short time span, but it'll be worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian 110, especially with Michael. I genuinely enjoyed class every day and it wasn't rare to find the whole class erupting in laughter on any given day. Michael gives quizzes every day, which I thought was actually a great way to motivate us to study the material.",
    "Yes. Italian is a fun language and it's a lot of work but doable.",
    "I'd say it's a fun introduction to a very fun language, and you finish the course with a skill level I wouldn't have thought was possible for a single semester of work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the language and Italian culture. It is a fun language credit and although it demands considerable work daily, it is definitely worthwhile.",
    "It is a great introduction to the language and is fast paced but rarely overwhelming."
