    "Professor Sab\u00c3\u00a9 is bubbly and engaging. She will ask you about your day and bring you food. The class activities are interesting and exams fairly graded. After one semester, you'll have learned all the basics of Spanish grammar, and your listening will be so much better because you're using Spanish 5 days a week. However, take her L1 class instead if you've never been exposed to a romance language before. The intensive L1&L2 is very fast-paced.",
    "If you want to do an intensive language course, Spanish is a good choice. Helps to have done a romance language previously, though (three of the six students in our class had done so). The course gets tough around November-time, but slog through and be happy with getting a little less than the grade you'd expect in a language course. Also, Prof. Sab\u00c3\u00a9 (if she is still teaching it) is the cream of the crop as a teacher, and will make the effort to look out for each and every student.",
    "This class covers the first two semesters of introductory spanish, and is, as a result, a tremendous amount of work that moves quickly. It is pretty amazing how much you learn by the end, though, if you're wiling to put in the work. I took it Cr\/D\/F and now sort of wish I had taken it for a grade. Overall, if you want to learn Spanish fast and you are capable of devoting 2 hours a day and a lot of time preparing homework, this class can be tremendously rewarding.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but it's worth it. Definitely recommended.",
    "Intensive Spanish was a great way to become relatively competent in Spanish after one semester. Professor Sabe was great--her enthusiasm made the 2 hours\/day bearable. All in all, less work that two separate classes would be, and you get used to the time commitment after a while. Definitely take this if you are serious about learning Spanish."
