    "ER&M 382 is an introductory exploration of the field of Latino studies. Each week, we focus on one group or topic and learn about them in detail while keeping in mind and adding to our knowledge of the questions surrounding Latinidad, especially the question \"What does it mean to be Latino\/a?\"I would recommend this course to another student because much of what was covered in the course involved material that is not generally taught in high school history courses. With the Latino population steadily growing in the US, I think it is even more important to learn about the history of Latinos as it is a large part of American history.",
    "Take this class! The professor is great, and all the material is really interesting and makes for some great discussions. Class was never boring, I always looked forward to it. If you're an LAS major but you're interested in the Latino experience in the US, then this is the class for you. This class, however, isn't just for Latinos, if you have any interest in Latinos at all then you'll enjoy it",
    "DEFINITELY recommend. Prof. Laguna is super awesome, and the class is so, so relevant. It was not in my major, but ended up being one of my favorite classes. Reasonable workload that was interesting\/enjoyable. Prof. Laguna is great at keeping class discussions relaxed without compromising academic quality. And, for a class as broad as \"Intro to Latino Studies,\" he does a wonderful job of approaching the topic from different angles and conveying the variety within the field. This is a topic that is relevantto everyone, and Prof. Laguna makes the Intro class really enjoyable. TAKE IT!",
    "YES! TAKE THIS CLASS! You won't get this information, this concisely, with such a great teacher, anywhere else. Class was NEVER boring, and always relevant. It is a survey course, but such a new survey course that you are likely not to have gotten to really look at much of the material before. Be forewarned, though: it attracted every where from freshmen to seniors, people new to ERM and those having spent years thinking about these things already, so while the discussion was always fun, it ranged from really stimulating to a little stilted. Still, Laguna is a great discussion leader, really energetic, and quick witted. You won't regret taking this class."
