    "a good way to learn the fundamentals of screenwriting. the midterm folder is a ton of work, but overall the class is virtually no work and a lot of fun. If you have a story to tell, definitely take this class because you will become a better screenwriter and read a lot of interesting stuff.",
    "Take this class if you want to get to know about screenwriting. The class is exciting and enjoyable. You can write about whatever you want so be sure to choose your story carefully. Write about something that you are passionate about.",
    "Great class, take it! It's a creative stretch (different from every other kind of creative writing), but worth your time. Marc Lapadula is a cool guy.",
    "Take this course. Even if you don't want to pursue film as a major, don't you want to learn about the process that created some of your favorite movies? It's so fun to express your imagination on paper.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's challenging in all the right ways. However there are only two assignments: DONT leave your midterm folder to the last minute.",
    "If you wanna write screenplays, this class will help\/won't hurt (at the very least, it'll make you write a short screenplay and you'll get feedbacks from a number of people)."
