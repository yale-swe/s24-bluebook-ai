    "We were essentially given the whole semester to work on our season planning project. Luckily for me, my group met frequently and managed our time well so it didn't feel like an insurmountable burden.",
    "The work is certainly time consuming, despite the fact that it's essentially just one assignment (aside from Millicent Megabucks) all semester. This is appropriate, as it reflects the iterative nature of the season planning process. I deeply appreciate that there is not extra reading or writing on top of the season project.",
    "I loved this class and it really opened up a whole new world in the possibility of artistic leadership. Vicki taught the class extremely well, and the guests were excellent. I would love to have met more than once per week, and brought in more guests if possible. Finally, I found it really helpful to meet privately with James and go over my season from his perspective as an artistic director. In general, I think the Artistic directors of MPP could use more incisive critiques of their seasons from artistic directors.",
    "It was manageable. Gathering once a week was the hard part to manage to find a time that everyone could attend, but anyways we made the time to do so."

    "One small comment: the season budget template we are given is for a five-show season (a la Yale Rep's current model), and not the six-show season that is required of us. This required me to add a sixth sheet and sixth column to the summary page, which took me a solid hour of work to update with the appropriate links for show #6. Also, the Physical Production budget was not in the v2 resources, so it took our group (which didn't have a TD&P student) one extra step to obtain. Small quibbles that a TA can easily fix - otherwise, every thing was clear in terms of direction (the syllabus and attachments were EXTREMELY well laid-out, I imagine from many years of adjustments!).",
    "I think more studies of existing season announcements and mission statements would have been helpful."

    "Vicky is always a compelling lecturer with a wealth of information. Her lectures are clear and organized, but due to time constraints, we can not always go in depth into topics.",
    "Vicki is generous with her time, and I think it is extremely smart and helpful that she does a bit of a 3\/4-term review with each team to put them on the right course before their presentations. Her enthusiasm for the creative aspect of the class is also inspiring and fun. Finally, she is a joy to be in class with, as her anecdotes are always at once entertaining and illustrative.",
    "Vicki is a great instructor! I think the course is directed a bit more towards the theater managers than the other departments, but maybe that is ok. A bit more review of the seasons would have been helpful.",
    "Vicky was an amazing instructor and very inspiring. Enough to make me wonder if I want to join theatre management. She was very honest in using her own experience in order to teach us about the material. She was always,ALWAYS open to answer any question. She made a warm and lovely environment in our class."

    "The lecture with Jon Reed was driven by questions from the class, and although interesting, they were all specifically geared towards co-productions. I wish he had given insights into the overall scope and steps he takes in the budgeting process. I feel that I really did not get a whole lot of information from that lecture because of how it ended up diverging. Sue Frost was organized, interesting, and she was able to communicate a lot of specific information and tips in her lecture. I think that the lecture with Joshua Borenstein and Gordon Edelstein was mostly enlightening to see the relationship between the two directors. I can't say that it really provided a whole lot of concrete useful information, but the personality differences and how each approached season planning was what I pulled away from it.",
    "I truly enjoyed having all of the visitors - if for no other reason than to see that artistic leaders can take on a wide variety of personalities. Gordon Edelstein is nothing like Vicki Nolan is nothing like Sue Frost, and yet they are all effective arts leaders and professionals. It also lent a specificity to the theories of producing models that we were learning and creating. Finally, and most importantly, it is so helpful to be exposed to leaders who work outside of Yale, because though Yale is committed to teaching us the best practices in all areas, we students also recognize that the University makes it different from most \"real world\" theaters. So the exposure to the \"real world\" folks from Long Wharf, for instance, is a healthy reality check and switch of perspective.",
    "The visitors were certainly all interesting! I would have loved to have had someone from a smaller company that was moving beyond the subscription model that seems to be on its way out.",
    "I think we could have better visitors. For example, Gordon Edelstein made me very angry in his visit. And I respected Vicky and everyone else that did not react to his way of talking. I found him sexist, rude in some places and even racist. I actually wondered if he's there to show us what and how NOT to be."

    "I regret not taking this course earlier in my time at YSD. I feel like I gained a great deal of insights into how the Rep and the school functions and have adopted those insights to how I've worked and responded to assignments through the semester.",
    "It is clear to me now that the hidden agenda of this class is learning how to work within a team and leverage the various skills that make up a theater's staff. It was a big lesson for me to learn about how to use certain group dynamics to our advantage, who to lean on for particular facets of the project, etc. And of course (and I'm sure you hear this each year), it was sobering to realize the compromises that leadership makes when planning a season within a set budget. Of course, I knew this before, but this is the first time I've had to apply that in a real way - moving forward, I'll think twice before criticizing a theater for programming one- and two-person shows or for paying actors AEA minimums (though I'll still strive not to accept these as inevitable conditions!).",
    "This course and its nature was very new to me. Although it was extremely exciting but everything such as the rules of actors' equity and rules of budgeting was so new that I mostly thought I am behind. But I think this has nothing to do with the structure of the course but my place in being stranger to this kind of material. I know I had learned so much and from here it's my place to do more."

   "comments": [
    "My only suggestion is, if you're going to create a group without a TD&P, either require the group or strongly encourage them to work with the TD&P \"TA\" early in the project, rather than let them assume that they're equipped to tackle the Production budget after one class session with Jon Reed. I didn't really know what I was getting myself into before I'd mucked up a production budget pretty badly and finally asked Kat Wepler to pull us out of the mud halfway through the semester - yes, poor planning on my part, but I just wasn't aware of what I was getting myself into. Other than that, the structure of this class is rock-solid and I have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "I'd love to get artistic feedback on the seasons presented. Could James attend the final presentations?",
    "I loved being asked 'what is your dream theater season in a traditional subscription model,' but there was some sad part of me that wondered if such a model might not exist when we are 'out in the world'. Are we learning-in MPP-about a dying model? Maybe not, but I would have loved to learn about some alternative models.",
    "This class one of the best classes I had in school. I don't have any big comment. I just have a suggestion, we thought it would be great if James Bundy could join us for our last presentations, in order to give us notes as the artistic director and to see our work and desires for planning a season."
