    "I would recommend the class to other students if it is not as a 5th class. The class itself was very interesting and engaging and there were no midterms or final exams, but there was a lot of work and reading every week. It was challenging to balance this course if you are also taking 4 other classes. However, the professor is great and engaging and the material is fun to learn and highly applicable to real life.",
    "Mundane. Maybe.",
    "Super easy, not a lot of work, interesting readings.",
    "It's an interesting course, but you will be learning mostly about water in relation to geophysics (other plants) rather than geology (finding water on earth.)"
