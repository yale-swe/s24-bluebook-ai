   "comments": [
    "Take it if it's required or you are interested in making deals.Lectures really boring. Everyone just stops listen after the third week.",
    "Great. Wonderful",
    "a different but interesting class, definitely try it out",
    "I do not recommend this class, unless you want to sit through an entire night of listening to the most dry lecturer ever. You can take it and never go to class, just read the book kind of, and do the \"games\" and be fine. I went to every lecture and completely regret that - shouldve spent my time doing other things instead of facebooking for three hours.",
    "Basic information. Good to know, and really not that hard a class.Depending on what role you have in the game you may be doing more work than classmates.",
    "Taking this course is a gamble. If you get a good group for the games it is not that bad, but otherwise it will be awful. It's a pretty poorly organized class. The lectures are okay, but if you don't have a deep interest in the material they will be very painful for you.",
    "This is the worst class I've taken at Yale. The games are hard, but at least they're interesting. The lectures however, felt like dying. I don't think there is a more boring professor than Garvin, who has tuned out, takes no questions, and rambles for three hours every Tuesday. This class should have been killed in the '70s. If they don't get rid of it, at least you can avoid it. Please.",
    "This is an interesting class if you have the attention span for a 2.5 hour lecture. The games are hard and time consuming, but other than that there is not too much work in the class. If you are interested in the development of cities in the US i would definitely take this class.",
    "Fine. I would recommend it, but it wasn't my favorite class at Yale",
    "This is hard. I learned so much about the way the Real World works from playing the games in this class. Each game, and the final, was a valuable experience. As a student of urban studies, I thought I would love this class, but Professor Garvin has a real talent for making interesting material boring. You will sleep. You will be unable to take notes, because there is no logical progression in his lectures. You will see the same slide a hundred times. Go ahead--shop it and find out. (But the games are great.)",
    "The business games are a lot of fun and make the class worth taking for anyone interested in American cities, and urban planning",
    "Study of the City is a class that is interesting, but deceivingly difficult. Overall, I would say that it is a great course to get an architecture student going in the direction he or she would like to go. I would say that its strength happens to be the same as its weakness: it encompasses EVERYTHING. This is great if you'd like an overview of cities, but when the final comes it's not so thrilling. Only take this course if you 1) are very interested in the topic and feel it would help you in your major and 2) can handle a 2.5 hour lecture--it's hard.",
    "This course covers very interesting material, though the 2+ hour lecture can get a bit repetitive at times. The games teach you a lot, but are challenging.",
    "I would tell them that it is like being thrown into the shallow end of the pool. The first project seems to be a lot very early in the semester, but overall the lectures were actually very enjoyable and I feel that I gained a very deep appreciation for urban planning and the multitude of things that must be considered when approaching a project. Also, to never underestimate common sense. Yes, I would recommend it to another student because I felt that I was developing some skills with the projects and evaluations that Garvin would give each student. Overall, an enjoyable experience.",
    "This class is a wonderful experience. Normally, it is not too much work, and I enjoyed the lectures. You will learn a lot. Do take note, however, that the group projects can take an enormous amount of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It was an incredible learning experience. However, I would warn him\/her that it is A LOT OF WORK. Worth it, but definitely shouldn't be taken as a fifth class.",
    "Its ok, not my favorite course at Yale.",
    "Fascinating subject, definitely worth taken. Will make you think about cities completely differently.",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in urban planning, parks, land use, suburbia and American cities. Garvin has a very specific style and way of conducting the class which he's been teaching for decades, but it seems to work. It had great real-life projects (\"games\") which are a lot of fun although a lot of work. Besides the two games though, the work load is not bad. Lectures are long and can be boring, but if you're interested in the material, take the class.",
    "I had read all the frightening reviews of Study of the City but decided to take it anyways. Well, let me add another frightening review to the bunch. This class is so disasterous, its like a specially-designed tortue device just for Yalies. Seriously. Two and a half hour long lectures where the professor READS FROM THE TEXTBOOK. I kid you not, he wrote this textbook and now he will recite it to you. Two \"games\" that are actually just month long projects where you will be required to communicate ENDLESSLY with DOZENS of your classmates to succeed. I pulled my first all-nighter on the first game, somethig I swore I would never do... and I do not exagerate when I say it was unavoidable. Then watching your project being ripped to pieces in front of the entire class by the snobby prof. If you don't have a love affair with cities you will not make it through this class.",
    "I would recommend it mainly to students who are very interested in cities and urbanism with the caveat that the class environment is difficult to deal with sometimes.",
    "The course did change the way I look at specific types of developments - even the townhouse complex I live in, which seems to be a (less-effective) example of Clarence Stein's ideas, for instance, or Edgerton Park in New Haven. I am really glad to know the history of many different types of developments in cities. But the perspective of the course is very very limited. It is a course about commercial development. The metric for determining whether things are good or bad - even parks! - is how much money they make. This leads to really glaring oversights in the class - such prized gentrification comes at the expense of minorities, for instance. This is one perspective on the city, but it is not a universal introduction.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I will never look at cities the same way again. The workload is manageable. The projects were fun. Lectures were long but interesting. I'd highly recommend it. My favorite class this semester.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone uninterested in urban planning",
    "See previous answer, copied again below:The course served as a comprehensive survey of the modern American city, its historic roots, and its largely (if not completely) Western influences. In this regard, the course met my expectations, and Professor Garvin's expertise was apparent and much appreciated. An additional level of sophistication and interest, however, would be served by looking at very recent and future-planned developments, with an eye toward new paradigms and to examine what lessons have been learned (or ignored). How can a rapidly developing city like Dubai or Lagos respond to resources scarcity? Can Curitiba-style transportation be emulated with ARRA-funded rail projects in the US? This forward look would be invaluable at preparing us students for future planning thinking, careers, and opportunities.The team exercises were useful, if a bit tedious for what they were worth. For instance, I understand the point that successful planning and development requires responding to divergent needs and constituents. However, that point could have been made in a 3-hour in-class exercise, as opposed to a 3-week simulation.",
    "games! games! do you want to learn how the world actually works? through games? if you aren't signing up already... but srsly this class is rock solid i would definitely recommend it",
    "No. The class is boring and a waste of time.",
    "While the class is a great insight into the American City and city planning it is poorly organized. The first game\/project is interesting and time consuming but is a goof exercise in development strategy. The second game is poorly structured and seemingly lacks a coherent goal. I would recommend the class only if you have the time to take it but don't expect too much out of it.",
    "Absolutely take this class, interested in cities or not. It is very different from any other class you'll take and while it requires a great deal of work, you'll come away from it with so much."
