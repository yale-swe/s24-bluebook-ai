   "comments": [
    "Chem 547 explains EPR from a quantum mechanical perspective. It is a deeper look into EPR than one gets in the other survey courses and is focused on mathematical understanding rather than spectral interpretation. I would recommend this course to student who already had some interest in paramagnetic systems, as the course is very specific."

   "comments": [
    "This course greatly enhanced my knowledge of EPR and quantum mechanics. Before taking this course, I could interpret the basic structure of a spectrum, but now I have the tools to understand more subtle spectral differences which relate to electronic structure. This course will be very helpful to my dissertation research, which includes some EPR spectroscopy.",
    "I appreciated how the course applied seemingly esoteric concepts I had learned in Molecules and Radiation."
