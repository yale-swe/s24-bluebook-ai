    "I would recommend this class to someone who needs this course for lessons for credit or music majors. Would not recommend for anyone else though.",
    "A worthwhile half credit class that does not have a lot of work, and teaches useful musical skills. A good easy class to balance out harder classes.",
    "If you are looking to take high level music courses, I would suggest taking this course.",
    "I came into this class feeling like my aural skills were very weak, but I ended up catching up and learning a lot in this class. I now feel much more confident in hearing individual lines and chord progressions. The dictations cover modulation, secondary chords, and augmented sixths. The class is taught in fixed do, which is daunting if you are used to movable do, but Stuart made the transition easy. Each day in class you sing what you have prepared for a quiz, sing new material as a class, do practice melodic dictations, and do harmonic dictations. Stuart was a great teacher and understood and worked with the different levels of skill we each had."
