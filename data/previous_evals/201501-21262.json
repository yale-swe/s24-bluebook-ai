    "I would highly recommend the course to another student. In fact I have repeatedly done so throughout the term",
    "Yes, definitely. For anyone who is preparing to go into the field but has not conducted qualitative research before, this class is a must. It's a great way to start to learn about your research and interviewing style before you start your main project.",
    "This class was a survey course in qualitative fieldwork, including theory and methodological techniques. It also involved a considerable local research project. Yes, I would recommend it. The reason for this is because these techniques cannot be learned through exam or reading. Only a course like this that combines readings with actual fieldwork is helpful."

   "comments": [
    "The course has been extremely relevant as it goes to the heart of the discipline. I did the course because I wanted to prepare myself for summer field research and get a stronger methodological basis. The course has served that purpose 100% Thank you!",
    "I now feel much more prepared to collect data in the field this summer. I feel less comfortable about analyzing that data later, but I do think it was a great chance to get ready for research.",
    "As someone seeking to use qualitative methods in my dissertation and other research, I found this to be a helpful course. It enabled me to fill in a fair amount of gaps in my knowledge level about various research techniques and strategies."
