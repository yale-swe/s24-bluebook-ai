    "In this course, I gained a very in-depth knowledge about Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne. I also developed close-reading skills and the ability to work very closely with English poetry, thinking about poetic conventions and departures from those conventions, poetic structure, etc.",
    "I improved my close-reading abilities as well as my essay-writing skills.",
    "How to better critically analyze poetry",
    "I had limited experience analyzing poetry going into this course. As such, it was a great opportunity to learn how to close read some of the definitive poetry of the English tradition.",
    "I began the course with virtually no exposure to medieval literature and little basis in formal analysis of poetry. After taking the course, I've started to learn how best to grapple with difficult, unfamiliar language, and I've become more comfortable with the themes and conventions that were common in the time periods of the authors we studied. I think I've started to develop the technique of close reading over this semester, and doing this kind of work with literature felt more natural by the last papers."

   "comments": [
    "ENGL 125 is a very, very specific notion of the English canon that centers on four English poets - Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne. I only took this course because it is required for the English major, and in all honesty, I don't feel that what I learned in this course is necessarily applicable to the type of literature that I hope to pursue during the rest of my undergraduate and even graduate education. I really loved Professor Brantley and I think she is fantastic. She made the course material interesting for me and I can tell that she really cares about her students and about the class. However, the actual material of the class itself felt tedious and the content was uninteresting to me, in all honesty.",
    "This course could be expanded to deal with more diverse poets. I don't think we needed the amount of time we devoted to some of the poets.",
    "If this course weren't compulsory for English majors, perhaps I wouldn't make criticisms. As it is, it should be held to higher standards. I think a major flaw of this course is that it does not strike the balance between being a survey course and a course with a more narrow focus. If this course is to be compulsory, then it should either provide students with a broad foundation for their future studies of English literature, or it should provide them with necessary skills that other courses do not provide. I don't think it does either. Any course can build the skills that this one does. And I don't think four authors qualify for a 'broad basis.' Of course, I learnt a lot, but not nearly as much as I had hoped.",
    "There was a lot of reading that we never really went over. I enjoyed it for the reading, but some of it was confusing. The final was a lot of info...",
    "The reading was interesting and our assignments were intuitive. I'm not a huge fan of reading poetry, but this class made analysis interesting, even if I found the poems themselves dull.",
    "The close reading done in this course, both in class and through assignments, is definitely a strength that goes a long way in developing analytical skills. The amount of works studied seemed very appropriate because it cultivated some breadth over history but also depth for each author. However, the time spent on each author was a bit uneven; the course spent surprisingly little time on Shakespeare given the course's focus, and spent a lot of time on Spenser.",
    "It's very focused on gaining certain conclusions from each text. While we covered a lot of text, we didn't get to talk about pretty much any of it (though that could be due to the people in my section)"

    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you are an English major and are required to take it. ENGL 125 focuses on a very, very hyperspecific idea of what English literature is, centering on the poetry of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne. I am not necessarily pushing back on the idea of studying the canon - I actually believe studying the literary canon is really important even, and perhaps especially, if you want to focus on non-canonical authors and texts. I think you should take ENGL 125 if you are interested in studying English poetry, medieval poetry, medieval women in literature, etc. But if you just want to be an English major and study, say, anything else - I think this class will feel tedious, its content will feel very outdated and not relevant, and it actually might deter you from being an English major. That being said - if you do want to be an English major, and have to take 125, definitely take it with Professor Brantley. She is fantastic, really sweet, and overall a great professor who made the course interesting for me.",
    "Professor Brantley is a wonderful teacher for this course, especially Canterbury Tales! However, at times I felt like this was more of a religion analysis class than poetry.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take this class with Professor Brantley, TAKE IT. She's a wonderful teacher, and the class is a blast. If you're not planning on being an English major, I'm not sure how much this class would offer you, but if you're even considering it a little, it's totally worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are certain they have an interest in the particular material that is studied. It does provide an effective basis in English poetry even for students who don't have background knowledge of the material, but would certainly be most engaging for students who are intrigued by Chaucer and Spenser and are eager to dive in to the work, not only for literary analysis, but for the language in particular, which can be very challenging.",
    "Unless you're interested in reading all of these authors or trying to major in english, I wouldn't take this."
