   "comments": [
    "This class was pretty disorganized at the beginning, the \"labs\" that we do were pretty silly but they get better as the semester goes on. There is one presentation at the end and a final paper. This class is good if you are an archaeology major who wants to learn more about ceramics, but if not I wouldn't take it. You have to do all the readings to actually learn anything. The seminar is not really a seminar so not much discussion happens.",
    "Its a fascinating class that really focuses on the relationship between pottery and archaeology. Its a great class to learn about many tools and techniques used by archaeologists. Its a great class even if you aren't an archaeology major.",
    "Definitely take it if you have some interest in archaeology, geology, art, history, etc. While the topic itself seems somewhat niche, Prof. Underhill does a great job connecting ceramics to lots of different topics in the social and physical sciences, and you get a lot of freedom to explore your own interests in the final paper. I was a little intimidated going into this class because I'm not an archaeological studies major, but the workload is light for a seminar and you get to do a lot of fun and hands-on labs (think making your own pottery and then smashing it ...). If you want to take an interesting and fun seminar, this is a great one!",
    "A good class for ceramicists, but not for anyone else. The labs are awesome and very hands-on (you get to make your own pot! and smash it!), but little extra knowledge is gained as a whole. Mostly, interesting readings and more a place to explore your specific ceramic focus, not to learn about ceramics in general.",
    "It is an in depth look at analyzing ceramics. If you are more interested in the particulars about ceramic analysis in archaeology as well as the cultures behind certain ceramic styles then definitely take the class."
