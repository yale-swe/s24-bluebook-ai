   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended. The skills I acquired will go far beyond the course.",
    "Good, discussion based class where you get to learn the intricacies of the ethics of the field and grow by listening to your peers' perspectives.",
    "Bioethics is a discussion-based class where interesting issues surrounding the bioethics of neuroscience are discussed in a realized setting. I would recommend it, because I learned a lot about my field through the papers and discussions.",
    "Being ethic is the first thing to keep in mind if you want to do science. It is really useful to know what should be done and what should be done, or if something unethic happens, what actions can be taken to deal with it. It also teaches technical skills in applying for a grant or getting a job etc.",
    "Ethics class is fundamentally a series of discussions. Student participation is not just welcome; it is fundamental. Research the issues and be prepared to share your opinions."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I am more aware of several issues in my discipline.",
    "The course led me to consider certain topics I hadn't thought of before, and let me delve into others in more depth. There aren't many forums where you can hear your peers talk about their abstract beliefs, so I appreciated the opportunity to do so. By hearing more perspectives I can appreciate the variety in and difficulty of the field of neuroscience.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my profession by letting me discuss aspects of my profession (the peer review process, paper publishing, etc) with my fellow students and other professors. These are topics that may not have been addressed elsewhere and bioethics provided a nice introduction to them. This course contributed a fundamental knowledge of how my profession works, which is essential to moving forward with my research.",
    "It course gives young students a picture of how the science community runs. As all the first-years have been rotating in the lab for some time, everyone has his\/ her own problems. We get practical suggestions on how to pick a lab, how to cite a paper or apply for a grant, how to treat animals properly and etc. In sum, this course provokes consciousness of right or wrong in scientific research.",
    "This course has helped me prepare for the decisions I will have to make as a researcher and a member of society."
