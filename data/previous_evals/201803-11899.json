    "Theater Studies offers little support for students who want to pursue an academic thesis. But this is Yale and this is supposed to be an academic program. Relative to other majors, I had no support or deadlines make sure I was on top of my work. Luckily, I was very motivated and organized and kept on top of my work. There is also little to no recognition for academic theses. While Theater Studies lauds their production theses, those who write and create substantial research in their thesis receive no recognition. I am not seeking the spotlight, but I do think that this treatment of academic thesis writers sheds light on the Theater Studies department's priorities."
