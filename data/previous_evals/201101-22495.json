   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course for anyone considering a career in neuroscience. The coursework is definitely manageable (and very interesting), and both Prof. McCarthy and Zarrar (I don't know if he'll be there next year) do their best to make everything comprehensible and enjoyable. The best part is definitely the final project--it allows you the chance to do your own research, which is valuable.",
    "Cannot recommend highly enough!",
    "Psych230L has an average of biweekly lab reports. The class meets for 4 hours on Friday, which can be a little rough in the spring, but I really feel like I got a lot out of the course. The final project is very time-consuming, and expect to spend a lot of out-of-class time on it. However, it is nice to apply the learned information and present it.",
    "Research Methods in Human Neuroscience is a great class. The labs are all done on the computer, which can get tedious, but overall they are interesting. You have to do a research project at the end of the semester which is a lot of work, but is an excellent opportunity to gain experience in the field and practice writing journal articles. Also, you may have the opportunity to continue your research after the class if you wish. I would definitely recommend this to those students who are interested in neuroscience.",
    "If you are really really into imaging and eeg, take this course. it's fantastic and you learn so much. if you're not, for god's sake don't take it you'll be miserable.",
    "Take it if you're interested in neuroimaging. You learn everything you need to know. Very useful and well taught, etc.",
    "very very valuable course - definitely take if you're at all interested in neuroscience research ..we learned different imaging methods\/ analysis methods"
