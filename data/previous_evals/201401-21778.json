    "The real takeaway from this class is the number of short stories that we get to read throughout the semester. So many titles, and so many authors\u2014you'll never get that from any other class. Discussion might not be enlightening, but you are exposed to a wide range of cultures, genres, styles, languages, etc.",
    "Incredible syllabus but also so frustrating as a class. The 9am class time didn't help, but neither did Paulo's teaching style -- mostly lecturing about semi-related things rather than stimulating discussion or providing provocative analysis of the stories."
