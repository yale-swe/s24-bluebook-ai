    "When I took French, we finished grammar and it was \"Great, now let's read the newspaper!\" When I took Italian, it was \"Great! Now we can read tabloids!\" The day we finished German grammar, Howard Stern devoted the second half of the class to reading a poem by Rilke, which is the correct choice. This is the weirdest class at Yale, terrifying and terrific. Stern has excellent taste and is a wonderful person and teacher. Even if he can be intimidating at first, he is actually harmless and just wants you to work hard. Take advantage of him: he cares a lot about students and is has a godlike knowledge of German. Go to Moderately Cheerful Hour. Avoid cellphones. And never be late, never ever come late, do not come late to class, he will not let you in if you come late to class, do not be late, lateness is no good...usw.",
    "I am now very confident in my understanding of German (esp. reading) and can speak pretty well too. Take 125 and then 145 and you'll fint the same.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to have a crash course in every possible construction you could ever find in contemporary german. definitely a focus on grammar and reading, so if you want to become fluent you'll need to continue study in a speaking intensive class or study abroad. but overall definitely worth it, to pick up competency in a language from scratch in nine months."
