    "Absolutely. It's a foundational course for Hebrew Bible students, especially because Deuteronomy has such a high degree of impact on subsequent texts in the Hebrew Bible.",
    "This class offers an excellent introduction to the scholarship of Deuteronomy research and a great environment to think about the text and compositional setting over the course of a semester. I would recommend the course.",
    "Abosolutely recommended. Rigorous course that gives a great background to the issues with Deuteronomy.",
    "This course is a detailed study of the questions, interpretation, and motivation of the book of Deuteronomy. It involves a good deal of primary reading (usually 3-5 chapters of the Hebrew text) as well as one to four secondary essays or books.The class is discussion based, so it is important to come prepared to class and familiar with the assigned reading as well as any texts that the reading might be similar to, commenting on, or related to (so for example, when reading the Decalogue in Deut, it is good to refresh one's reading of the Decalogue in Exodus\u0096 are there differences? similarities? why? Why is it told twice? etc).I would definitely recommend this course to another student in Hebrew Bible studies because I think it is a foundational course."

   "comments": [
    "This course was foundational for my discipline. Most of my work focuses on the prophetic literature of the Hebrew bible, but since so many of the prophets are coming out of, or at least aware of a Deuteronomistic theology, it is crucial to study this book. I wish I had spent more time preparing for class each week and discussing the secondary readings in class (we didn't always get to discussing the secondary material in class discussions because the primary material often provided more than enough for discussion!)."
