   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this studio and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "My expectations were met, I feel like I have a good general knowledge about Shanghai and Hongkong, which is why I wanted to take this studio in the first place.",
    "I expected to have a site that is somewhat special. The site for the studio this semester was challenging because it was such an ordinary site. However, because of this, I was able to investigate real issues involved in urban design.",
    "I think this studio does a great job of exposing Yale students to not only an entirely different culture, but also the academic environments and methods of the two other universities involved-- HKU and Tongji. It was interesting to see the pedagogical differences between Yale and those two schools. I thought we would be working more closely with the other students, but I'm glad that it worked the way that it did. It was interesting to see the HKU and Tongji projects at the final review and also a great experience to get to know those students as well.",
    "I expected to have some understanding of large-scale urban planning especially in a developing country such as China. This was met to the utmost degree.",
    "I started with the expectation that this studio could investigate issues that are a proxy to my personal interests in architecture and urbanism in my home country in Singapore. To some degree, I pursued a line of research and investigation related to the same topic and the final result was not something that I could have envisioned at the start of the semester, which is a good thing.",
    "I expected to learn a great deal about Chinese urbanism and produce a project that is specifically relevant its major issues today. This expectation was met for the most part. See question #3 for a more specific discussion of this.",
    "My expectations for this studio were very well met from engaging the Chinese culture to pursuing an urban design project that helped me to define and explore my personal interests. I appreciated the consistent interaction that a locally based studio critic provides and feel that an assistant to take the pressure off Alan would have only improved this situation."

   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. - adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "There was more than enough resources available to us.",
    "The resources at YSOA are better than any other school I've seen... thank you!",
    "It is extremely hard to find books in the library. Usually you will only be able to actually get your hands on 1 in 5 books you are looking for and the librarians are not helpful. The one day takeout is also extremely frustrating.",
    "It would have been nice to have more space near our desks for mode lmaking.",
    "The resources available were more than adequate and well maintained. Managing the knowledge about each offering would be the next step, providing direction in what technologies to use and a short session to give initial steps. For instance I would have benefited from help with the video editing software package that is provided and knowing a greater set of people experienced with this (a database of known specialties for instance) could have helped with a greater informal trade of knowledge and common\/mutual development."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "I found having juries very helpful. It would have been great to have perhaps one more formal pinup with guest critics.",
    "I think the most valuable aspects of the studio were desk crits with Alan. Pinups are always helpful, but I felt like I got the most out of the studio when we had more individualized time. It was also great that Alan had an open-door policy at the Urban Design Workshop. In terms of overall improvement-- I think next time it might be better to have a teaching assistant to help coordinate things and give more feedback.",
    "The one thing I would completely do away with is the shared \"mapping exercise\" with HKU and Tongji students during the trip to Shanghai. Time is much better spent visiting and learning from the built buildings and neighbourhoods than being holed up ina basement putting a powerpoint presentation together in a pseudo review that means little to students on either side.",
    "Mid-term review and our all-group pinups were very useful. Individual desk crits were great but it felt like there were weeks-long periods where we didn't really know exactly what the other groups were working on.I would have appreciated if there was more discussion about the specific relevancy of our work in studio to our future careers, i.e. what a future career might look like for an architect who is more interested in the urban scale than small-scale architecture and what paths there are to get there.See question #3 for more suggestions.",
    "I felt that the semester was well structured, from the initial research projects to the post-break pinup as an end to push for over the break. I feel that as a studio we would have benefited from revisiting the initial studies and reformatting those for final review display. It also could be interesting to provide a mixing point at the middle of the semester with the joint studios in Hong Kong and Shanghai perhaps through a video conference session to see what projects they are developing and define a short statement\/presentation of our projects as well. It could also be interesting to engage other joint studio instructors at nearby institutions or people involved with Yale-China to get their thoughts on this cross-cultural exchange and the projects that we are developing."
