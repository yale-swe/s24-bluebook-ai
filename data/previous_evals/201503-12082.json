    "Take it if you're a GG student, explains climate\/weather phenomena pretty well. If you're not a GG major and want to learn about this stuff, take Natural Disasters, you'll learn the same type stuff but in much simpler terms.",
    "A fun class! I took it as a just-for-fun science elective, and I definitely enjoyed myself. I appreciated the opportunity to apply my physics coursework to real systems. it was neat to see how the equations I've been learning in classical physics classes can be used to describe how raindrops form, or how the Earth is warmed. That being said, a lot of the class was qualitative, and just required an understanding of physical systems and how they can be applied to the atmosphere - which was also intriguing! Professor Storelvmo was really sweet and great, and made class fun. She is a really compassionate and approachable professor. One great thing is that this class didn't have p-sets, just optional practice problems to prepare for the tests (three non-cumulative exams), and one group presentation. The exams were fair and manageable, if you paid attention in class and worked through the practice problems. All in all, I'm really happy I took the class - I feel like it made me a more well-rounded physics student."
