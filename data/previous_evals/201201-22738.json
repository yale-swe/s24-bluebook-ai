    "Take it if you want to learn ancient Greek!",
    "It is a lot of translation and not much else, but it is a good introduction to reading actual texts in Greek.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone wishing to continue learning Ancient Greek! This course was a great way to improve reading ability in Ancient Greek and reading The Apology in the original was an awesome experience. More grammatical review likely would have improved the course.",
    "Ancient Greek 120 is a continuation of L1 Greek. For the first half of the class, you finish reading Hansen and Quinn, the comprehensive greek grammar, and the second half of the semester, you read Plato's Apology. The class is a great introduction to reading Ancient texts, allowing you to translate daily and go over all the translations in class.",
    "This is a good class. If one is interested in continuing to the higher level Greek courses, then definitely take it. It is a huge change from Greek 110, though, in terms of content. I found that there was less work for Greek 120, becausethe homework consisted mainly of reading rather than memorization work\/Greek composition. While I feel like my reading skills have hugely improved, I know that I now have a less solid grasp on the formal grammar of Greek."
