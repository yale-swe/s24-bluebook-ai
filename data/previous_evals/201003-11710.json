    "Good overview of epi\/biostats.Stregnths: forcing students to work with data and write homework assignments that are above and beyond those of any other courses.Weakness: inability to read Harvey's handwriting well on the pdf slides - they really need to be typed up to make the legible.",
    "The title of this course should be changed to\"Epi Math Formulas Up the Wazoo and Making Sense of It All (If You Can, Before the Semester Ends)\"This class demands a tremendous amount of time of students due to the weekly assignments.If you don't think you'll be able to give at least 15 hours a week to the weekly assignments, don't take this class ... unless you are as brilliant as the professor (which is unlikely).",
    "I learned a lot.",
    "The classes were mostly theory and discussion of how you would apply the concepts. The homeworks were helpful to force you to try and learn the application of all the concepts. At the beginning, we did not go over the answers to the assignments after we were done, but once we started doing this- it was much more helpful because you would better understand any questions that you may have answered incorrectly originally.",
    "This class presented an interesting way of looking at modeling and combining epi and biostat. The programming in GLIM sections were a little less helpful since we were using SAS.The TA sessions were helpful for completing the hws, but it seems that the TA and instructor should have reviewed the handouts before giving them out in section because there were some errors and misleading parts."

    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Harvey is a good instructor but needs to make his expectations in regard to homeworks clearer early in the semester. Also he needs to stop lecturing on GLIM. None of us are ever going to use that program in the present or future so it is a waste of time to lecture on it in class.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr Risch is a brilliant epidemiologist, mathematician, and medical doctor. He's essentially many of the best intellectual parts of the YSPH faculty set into one being.From what I saw in this class, though, his brilliance may at times restrict his ability to teach to less-than-brilliant students (yours truly).Dr Risch might consider trading out a little GLIM (the beloved and dead computer language that Dr Risch learned back in the day and that he shows students in vain) and adding a bit more concrete demystification ... in terms of what methodologically we're trying todo, why and when we would do this in epi, and his talented and experienced perspective on how NOT to get tripped up on common pitfalls.Undoubtedly, we learn a good deal from Dr Risch in this course. However, puzzlement for puzzlement's sake can be futility-inducing to a degree that doesn't elevate students' knowledge and mastery of the topic in the most productive way. Yes, as he writes in one of his class handouts, the answer is easy when you know it ... but sometimes you have to know the answer to appreciate the question and the long march that leads to answers.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Brilliant and humorous.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Very knowledgeable on this topic.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch brings a new perspective to the models that we had learned in earlier classes. The GLIM material was not very helpful since it is not a software that we use. Overall, the instruction was clear and Dr. Risch was responsive and thorough in answering questions."

    "Anita is a bad TA. Although she knows the material, she can't explain it and is often unhelpful and unprofessional during discussion section. It was much more helpful for us to talk amongst ourselves in discussion section to answer a question than to ask her for clarification. I would not recommend that she TA any additional courses in EPH.",
    "If it weren't for Anita Sung, I'm not sure any of the students would have passed the course.Metaphorically, she was the headlights on a fast-moving car on a dark, winding road ... and, at times, the GPS navigation system ... all in one cheerful, encouraging, helpful person.She made herself available as much as you expect her (eg, e-mails on weekends).No TA could have been better than Anita, and I am grateful to her for her patience, kindness, and generosity in passing her knowledge on to me in a way I could understand.",
    "Anita.She's great. She explains things clearly and has been a great help to all of us! Without her, I would not have survived the course.",
    "Anita was very accessible, but as previously mentioned at times the handouts for section were misleading. It might have helped if she had gone over these with the instructor before the sections.Also, attimes when there were questions it would help if she could think of a different way to present the material rather than referring back to the lecture notes since that is where the question stemmed from."
