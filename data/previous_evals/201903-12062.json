   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course overall was pretty good. Some of the homeworks were unclear, where everyone had to ask the TA if our interpretation of the problem was the same as the instructor intended. Also, I think the homeworks should have hints when there is an integral that Mathematica can't do and which requires a special substitution to solve, because right now that information is passed down anyway through the TF from previous years' experience.",
    "Providing extremely helpful solutions to the assignments; Prof. Alhassid extremely fluent and knowledgable about the course materials and also extremely kind and helpful; weekly review provided by the teaching fellow Sohan; clear and well organized course structure, etc.",
    "Problem sets tend to be long and extremely difficult, and most worked examples in class are not particularly useful for solving the homework problems. I thought the overall (over the course of the entire semester) structure of the material presentation was good, with one topic flowing mostly fluidly from the previous. The provided solutions to the homework problems were well fleshed out and useful. The TA for the course was exceptional and supremely helpful and supportive.",
    "Clear lectures. Reasonable exams. Some of the pset questions were unnecessarily computational to the point of obscuring the physics behind the algebra. Psets came with very detailed solutions which is a great rarity.",
    "A large strength of this course was explaining how the essential ideas of Classical Mechanics were developed and drawing connections to other physics disciplines, especially quantum mechanics. The biggest weakness of this course was the timing. The end of the semester felt extremely rushed. However, I found chaos and non-integrable systems to be some of the most interesting content in the course, and it was new to many people. If the material could be adjusted, I would have been interested to learn more about the last topics on our syllabus.",
    "This class made the most of the subject matter, and helped me build a fair amount of physical intuition. An emphasis on mathematical tricks (series expansions, etc) was frustrating. Homeworks and lectures were well aligned and seemed applicable to the objectives of the course. The midterm was fairly easy in hindsight, but the final exam was needlessly difficult...",
    "The TF (Sohan) was by far the biggest strength of this course. He was very clear and helpful. The biggest weaknesses of the course were the overall teaching style, the fairly not useful problem sets, and the seemingly randomly written exams. The problems on the problem sets ranged from problems that didn't help develop any intuition for the subject to obscenely long problems that turned into mini-programming projects. Half of the midterm was a problem that asked students to re-derive a topic from class that we spent 20 minutes discussing, despite the fact that the midterm was supposed to cover half a semester of content. The final exam had a problem on a topic that we covered two days prior to the final exam during the reading week.",
    "The pace of the course was too fast at the end, so the time management wasnt that good. It would be better if the instructor had covered all the materials that are needed in the homework way ahead before its due.",
    "I would say the lectures could be slightly more organized.",
    "Combination of theory, derivations, and the working through of problems in lecture is a strength.",
    "As an undergraduate sophomore, the largest strengths of this course for me were an exposure to a wide breadth of classical mechanics topics, instructive weekly office hours, and talking with other graduate students about physics going forwards. The material certainly is not easy and psets will take much longer than in other classes, but it is very rewarding to sit down and work through them to obtain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of classical mechanics. That being said, there are improvements in the class which would help all students, including giving more practice material for exams and discussing more problems in class. Class time was often spent working through derivations readable in Goldstein, and we were left in the dark as to preparing for the midterm and final exam, aside from the one practice final exam we were given. This class has been a staple in the Yale physics department for numerous years, but it could be better facilitated for student learning if more overview and direction was given over the material, rather than consistently working through derivations.",
    "I think the strength is that it lays down some physics fundamentals, and sharpens various math skills. However, I think that there are more weaknesses than strengths. The class is, quite simply put, very boring. The various topics are not tied together. The class is pervaded with the sense that we will never use what we learn in this class because it's so outdated. The homework and exams are full of tedious algebra that felt unnecessary. I think the course could be improved if the syllabus and the homework were updated to teach us more relevant topics. Often, it felt like everything boiled down to some obscure algebra trick to be able to solve the homework, making them awfully time-consuming. I think this course needs to be reviewed and re-designed to stay relevant and useful for physics graduate students.",
    "The course was very well laid out and planned. It would be nice to have notes available for topics that had to be rushed over. Some of the examples used in class were not helpful in understanding the topics.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the sheer breadth of knowledge it presents and the preparation of its students to work on high level mathematical physics problems. The weakness lies in the breakneck pacing which often skips over some of the more practical examples we would find on tests or in a problem set to get through the next set of proofs. The course would certainly benefit from more instruction time given the breadth of information and more importantly problem solving techniques it attempts to teach."

   "comments": [
    "Probably only if it's a requirement, it's interesting but not more fun and useful than other classes probably.",
    "Yes, very fundamental and well organized",
    "Yes. Materials were very well-presented and the pace was not bad for most parts. However relativity and chaos were covered at a very sophisticated level and all standard introductory materials were skipped. Took it as a sophomore and the workload seemed reasonable to me. Some of the pset problems were unnecessarily computational to the point of obscuring the physics behind all the algebra. You oftentimes end up resorting to Mathematica and not practicing\/developing an intuitive grasp of the formalism introduced in classes as ideally. Exams were much simpler than pests and obscurer topics like parametric oscillations weren't tested at all. However as a heads-up, there was a section worth 40% of the final on proving certain results learned in class.",
    "This question is moot. But sure.",
    "Surely",
    "No, this course is not a course I would recommend to another student. I left the course feeling like I learned next to nothing new in the subject of classical mechanics. The two new topics that we covered in this course that I hadn't seen before were topics that we \"covered\" during the reading week and did not actually get taught properly. Overall, the workload was very large and I felt like I gained nothing despite the immense amount of time I spent on the course.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. The material itself is interesting, but it also is very useful analog for the formalisms of quantum mechanics.",
    "This class is required for first-year graduate students, so there's not much to say there. I would recommend this course to another undergraduate student if they are willing to put in the time to read Goldstein Mechanics thoroughly, visit office hours every week for thorough homework help, and ask other graduate students, other students who have taken the class, or Sohan and Yoram many questions. This class is far from a walk in the park, but you will be successful if you put in consistent effort and ensure you are keeping up with the fast-paced material. There are now a good number of undergraduates who have taken this class, so please feel free to reach out to any of us if you have any questions\/concerns - taking a graduate class is much different from taking an undergraduate class, and we all have some insight we would love to share. At the end of the day, I am proud that I learned classical mechanics with Sohan and Yoram.",
    "It is required for graduate students. It is silly, in my opinion, for undergraduates to suffer through this course.",
    "*This is from an undergrad* If you would really like to study physics, then yes. The textbook by Goldstein is really hard, but if you spend a lot of time on it, then it is definitely rewarding. I had a lot of trouble solving the psets by myself and relied a lot on the people I studied with, so don't expect the problem sets to be easy.",
    "Not to an undergraduate unless their mathematics background is sufficient and they have been exposed to advanced mechanics at this level before. For those students, the class is quite good. Obviously the course is well fitted towards graduate students."
