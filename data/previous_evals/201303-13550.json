    "The course covers a lot of important and relevant material if you're interested in energy, but the problem sets were too time-consuming in relation to the amount of learning you get out of the process. The questions were often poorly-written and confusing, leading to quite a bit of wasted time trying to figure out what they were asking.",
    "I am commenting on the class generally, and particularly on the pedagogy of the course. I was disappointed with this class. The lectures were only tangentially related to the problem sets. The problem sets were quantitative, but the lectures were mostly either qualitative discussions of consumer behavior or general discussions of graphs. The lectures did not teach students how to complete the problem sets. Moreover, the problem sets were often poorly worded. Even worse, many of the questions required students to go on extensive fishing expeditions looking for information and data sets. Finally the problem sets were computationally quite simple, but were made artificially convoluted by the need to incessantly convert from one set of units to another, then to another, then back again. These types of questions are not conceptually challenging, and do not encourage students to think creatively or analytically. They merely take up a lot of time.",
    "See answers below.",
    "Best class at FES I've taken so far, also the hardest",
    "excellent course for anyone interested in Energy. This course requires hard work and curiosity",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to Energy Systems. However, the lecture style often involved questioning students in a way that belittled students.",
    "Questions 8,9,10: The instructor for this class was, in my opinion, very disrespectful towards his students. At every single class, he would make at least one derogatory comment about FES, its students, or just environmentalists in general (for example, environmentalists don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything\/can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything right\/have no idea how the real world works). And, he never made any negative comments about students from other schools (SOM, law school). It made me feel terrible about myself as well as my choice of school and I could not help but wonder why a professor would hate a school (FES) so much yet still work there. He was also very impatient with his students. When students asked him questions in class, he would oftentimes scoff at them as if he was in disbelief about how someone could ask such a stupid question. Only a small handful of students would participate in class because most students felt too intimated to make comments or ask questions. Granted, he told us on the very first day of class that his job is not to help inflate our egos, but at the same time, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to not damage morale. At the beginning of the semester, he told one of my friends in the class that she went to the wrong school if she wanted to study energy. Considering what he says about FES, I believe that he genuinely thinks this is true. I understand that some students are more sensitive than others, and perhaps I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just not a fan of his teaching style, but I honestly felt like I was paying someone to make fun of me and my poor choice of a school\/program.",
    "The course is taught in a different manner than most other subjects at FES. Classes are mostly theoretical, and allow little student driven interaction\/discussion.",
    "ESA represented the work of my three other classes added together. It was by FAR the toughest in terms of workload, sometimes to its own detriment. For example, on weeks with heavy problem sets, there actually was not time to also complete the assigned readings, which I very much regretted because the material was so useful, engaging, and good.Despite this, ESA was my favorite class of the semester, and the one to which I devoted the majority of my study not because I wanted to do well in the course, but because I actually wanted to learn what Professor Grubler had to teach. ESA exposed me to more new material and challenged my previously-held ideas more that anything I've encountered since... gosh, maybe in the entire span of my professional career and prior schooling. I really appreciated the material and actually enjoyed being so challenged.",
    "There are very few energy programs in the US, and very few energy classes at FES. This class actually provides a system-level view of the energy, well, the energy system that is lacking just about anywhere else."

Also getting a general understanding of orders of magnitude for things like energy production, consumption on a world, per country, per-capita basis.",

    "Student Learning based on the Problem sets is, in my view one of the strongest learning processes of thecourse.",
    "The course gives a comprehensive overview of energy systems, which is quite valuable for anybody in theenvironmental field. I also appreciate that the course focuses on the \"energy demand\" perspective rather than energy supply and incorporates concepts from systems theory.",
    "Professor Grubler leads a real lecture. It was great. He presupposed we'd done the reading and gave a deeper dive in class, putting things into context and showing potential applications beyond what was approached in there reading. There was nothing about this course that felt like freshman year of undergrad--this was a class fitting a professional school.Problem sets were highly educational (although extremely frustrating, which I will cover in the answer to Question 15). The material covered in the professional modules was also appreciated and valuable.Overall, this course stood out among other I took this semester in that it treated students as professional students. I appreciated the lack of hand-holding more than I would have expected.",
    "Focus on demand-side approaches and understanding that demand drives supply rather than always focusing on the supply-side of the energy system.",
    "Problem sets, but they need serious revision and improvement.",
    "It was incredibly comprehensive in scope and very thoroughly taught. It completely changed the way I thought about energy and climate change, and it should be required for almost every environmentalist who's interested in climate change, in my opinion. It was very rigorous and challenging, and I learned more from this class than any other this past semester."

   "comments": [
    "Problem sets - the questions were often poorly-written and confusing, leading to quite a bit of wasted time trying to figure out what they were asking. I spent too much time on each problem set in relation to the learning I got in return.",
    "Professional modules: good opportunity to learn more. But how necessary is every section of these? I think there is a lot of opportunity to trim the fat. The hour spent on how to use excel was much more elementary than described in class, and I think a lot of us wished we had skipped that. The section on financial modeling in the last PM was duplicative and not necessary. TY's presentation on discount rates was not really relevant, especially that early on, and because his discount rate formula was not even the one we needed to use when discount rates finally did come into the picture for PS5.Also - I think Prof. Grubler can go a long way in making students feel more comfortable answering his questions and asking their own. Being made to feel stupid if you answer wrong quickly created a situation where no one wanted to answer his questions, even the most simple ones. I appreciate his sense of humor, and I think most of us understood that he didn't seriously think we were dumb for answering incorrectly.But no one wants to be embarrassed. And the fear of embarrassment, I think, has a particularly strong effect on women, who were much less vocal in this class than in others I took, and much less vocal than their proportion of the class would suggest. In a field that is already male-dominated, a little more consideration for how to encourage women's participation would be much appreciated.",
    "See question 13.",
    "The instructions on the problem sets could be a bit clearer",
    "The problem sets can be very vaguely worded at times",
    "1) Problem set instructions should be improved for clarity. TA's should answer questions about the problem set instructions in a straight forward manner.2) Required readings should be talked about in class.3) The professor should avoid making crude jokes - they are a distraction \/ irrelevant to the material discussed.4) Exam grades should not be posted publicly with the accompanying students' name.5) Mid-term exams should be returned, with comments, to the student. Exams can only be viewed in the registrar's office and a solution key is not left with the registrar. Furthermore, comments were not provided on the exam.6) For the final, approximately 1\/3 of the material came from a single lecture. We were told to study materials for the final which did not correspond to the materials that would have helped us succeed on the final.",
    "Change the testing and let student's review their midterm.",
    "Gil DePaula was especially incompetent as a TA.Grubler should realize grades may be important to some students for different reasons (funding stipulations, future PhD applications). That doesn't mean he shouldn't grade harshly, but he should be receptive when a student wants to legitimately contest the way something was graded (e.g. something counted wrong that is actually right). It just makes people feel they are treated fairly, as opposed to a blanket curve on all grades.",
    "Maybe the problem sets should be addressed in a way that TAs can actually help in working on the problem sets and provide not only guidance and the solutions.",
    "Time commitment could be decreased.",
    "I felt like much of the material that was covered was not clearly explained. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the professor tries very hard to ensure his students understand thematerial. Either we get it or we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.",
    "Lecture is a little tangential at time, it could become a little more focused.Also, it would be useful to drill the course material that will be tested on. Many times problems were thrown at us on the midterm with it being only briefly or tangentially covered, which is slightly annoying.",
    "The readings for the course seemed to be front-loaded in the semester, leaving not much reading for the latter half. I would suggest that if the professor wants students to do all the reading, he should spread out the reading more evenly throughout the semester so it's more feasible to actually complete the reading on time.",
    "The course could benefit from more coherent organization, especially during the second half of the course. It felt like during the second half of the course we breezed through topics rather than going into sufficient depth to understand them. Greater depth on energy models, and energy production technologies would have been useful.",
    "The class was capped to 50 students, based on the space restrictions of Sage 24, when there are bigger rooms available.During the lectures, there are several highly conceptual explanations, that might need an easier way to translate concepts, specially considering a non-technical class background",
    "While the lectures were very good, I think the class would be more engaging if there were more student-led discussion in addition to a conventional lecture-based class.",
    "The problem set instructions could be made much clearer. If this sounds nitpicky, it is: to have this be the biggest weakness of a class is the marking of a strong course. However, this is not insignificant. There were several times when--even working in large groups--questions were completely misinterpreted because of unclear wording, which meant that we didn't get to complete the assignment as it was intended. Overall, I found the assignments to be well thought out and [mostly]useful, so when we couldn't complete something as intended because we couldn't understand it, it felt like a missed opportunity. I'd suggest vetting of the question wording in advance of problem set release.The exception to usefulness alluded to above is the amount of legwork necessary to complete problem sets. While I don't mind a heavy workload at all, I think more problem sets could include givens while maintaining the educational capacity. Three quarters of my time spent not his course was Googling--that's time that came at the cost of reading for the course. It was essential to complete the problem sets, so there was no way around it, yet it still felt like a tragic misuse of time that could have been spent reading the urban chapter of the Global Energy Analysis. I understand that this was to impart the difficulty of finding reputable sources, but I feel that decreasing the amount of legwork by 25% (by including more givens) would still impart the same lesson while giving time to complete readings also.A suggestion: list the evening modules on Classes V2 and\/or in the course catalog. Many students were unaware that this course entailed class sessions beyond those in the course catalog (only the Monday afternoon sessions were listed) and so we scheduled other classes for Wednesday nights. Because professional modules on Wednesdays contained vital information (both for our learning and for the exams) these really could not be skipped. That led to a number of us being forced to skip our other regular Wednesday classes to attend the professional modules. Had this conflict been known during shopping period, we could have planned accordingly.And one complaint, if I may: the midterm exam tested deprecation\/interest calculations. This materialhad not been covered prior to the exam: it's first appearance was there. Following the midterm, we covered the topic in a professional module and discussed it in class (and I did independent research online to further learn it). It felt inappropriate to test on a topic prior to its introduction into course material.",
    "I think the TAs could be more effective if they actually had office hours or discussion sessions for reading material.",
    "Problem sets were often ambiguous and poorly explained. TFs did little to alleviate any problems students had, we were really on our own. Professor has an interesting opinion of FES students and seems quite biased against them as he makes clear in his lectures and grading notes.",
    "The wording of problem set questions need to be dramatically improved. They were very unclear most of the time, and some of the TAs offered little to no help whatsoever. There was a real disconnect from the lecture material and the problem sets in terms of instruction on how to complete the quantitative assignments, and I would have been completely lost without the aid of a group for each problem set."

Professional modules were essentially additional lecture sessions, albeit with delegated authority. They were useful and informative.Substantial group work occurred outside of class as we collaborated on problem sets -- this was probably my favorite aspect of the course. Professor Grubler understands group work: don't assign it, just stand back and let it happen. Grade independently at the end. This is head-and-shoulders above the prescribed approaches of other courses with regard to efficacy.",

    "One of the best part of the class, really helpful",
    "Used group work to get through problem sets. It was very helpful for talking through and overcoming challenging problems.",
    "Group work for the class is not required, but recommended. Most of the problem set solving were done in a relatively stable group, which also served as study group for the examans.Group work is nearly a must, to discuss concepts and problem solving mechanisms, in order to be successful in the class",
    "It is helpful to work on homework assignments with other students because each person has their own way of solvingproblems and thinking about the assignment. It's an opportunity for everyone to learn and to teach each other.",
    "All group work was informal: Professor Grubler allowed collaborative work on problem sets, with individual grading at the conclusion. This was ideal for a professional school, as it allowed students to select those with whim we wanted to work and when we wanted to do the work, without making anyone's score beholden to another person's work ethic (or lack thereof). I very much appreciated that it was not prescribed.If Yale and FES are about making connections that will serve us in our careers beyond graduate school, then ESA is the course that people should take. The bonding that occurred at problem set work sessions is worth the tuition. There has not been another experience--not SIGs, not TGIF, not even MODs--that can compare. During ESA I got to know the colleagues I will consult for the rest of my career, and the group experience of the course is not to be missed.",
    "The problem sets would have been nearly impossible for me without the collective brainpower of groups. The disadvantage, however, were the logistical constraints that group work imposes, and I had to plan most of my other schoolwork around when everyone could meet to work on the problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "Prepare to spend a lot of time on the problem sets",
    "Don't worry to much about any one assignment. Don't work alone if you plan to do well. Pay attention to detail.",
    "Ask as many questions as you can in class. The professor is a wealth of knowledge on many energy and climate sub-topics.",
    "Start the problem sets early and email your TAs with questions!",
    "I donot recommend this course. I found the professor difficult to follow. The professor did not introduce topics well so that often times students were lost. His personality is authoritative, which is not inviting to classroom discussion. Also, his accompanying slides, contained little information. This means that if a student became lost, it would be difficult to get \"back on track\" by looking at the notes on the slides.",
    "Take this course.",
    "Work hard. Don't be intimidated.",
    "strongly recommend, also recommend to be ready for hard work",
    "Take really, really good notes during class.",
    "Pay very careful attention to everything the professor says in class",
    "The same as everyone else: work hard and don't save any of the assignments to the last minute. Also, if he says the midterm is just on the primer, it's a lie. It'll cover everything.",
    "Read the primer and know it. Don't get down about grades, and enjoy it while you can!",
    "If your focus is on energy, this remains a very useful course. Give yourself time for the problem sets. And try to push Arnulf to teach more concrete material and spend a little less time delving into his own (very strong) opinions.",
    "Review application criteria and apply in advance.Request a clear indication of who are selected as \u00c2\u00a8Proof readers\u00c2\u00a8 and make sure they do at least a decent task.Work in groups for Problem Sets",
    "Take it!",
    "Apply. Don't even question yourself. Apply.Know that ESA will be your semester. Set the expectation early that you will not be able to complete all the work for your other classes because ESA will rule your time. Know that and do it anyway, because it IS what you came here for. This Is The Class. Apply.",
    "If you have any interest in energy work at all, you need to take this class. TAKE IT. PERIOD.",
    "Don't.",
    "Prepare to make this class your number one priority, and you will have to sacrifice some other class' schoolwork to complete the problem sets. Work on them well, well ahead of time, and know the primer inside and out."
