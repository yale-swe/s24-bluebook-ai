   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. It's a fair amount of work each week, but there's no final at the end which is great. It's a pretty consistent work load. The material, for the most part, is pretty interesting. I would say that who the other students are in the class makes a difference. We had a lot of engaged, knowledgable students who brought in interesting perspectives from their respective backgrounds. I'm definitely more of a lecture person, but as far as seminars go - this was a good one.",
    "It's a wonderful class but make sure you are interested in learning more about welfare states (not just interested in taking a political science seminar).There are a lot of shorter writing assignments (like weekly responses about what you learned during the last seminar session and comments you have to write on other student's essay, etc.) so sometimes it feels like there's just too much writing. It's truly worth it though! And you learn a lot by taking the time to think through the material and writing down your thoughts!",
    "Yes definitely. You'll learn a lot of really important information in a really low key setting. Class discussion is interesting and the readings are relevant and not overwhelming.",
    "This is a great class that I would recommend to other students.",
    "This course will teach you about welfare states, and you'll have a good time if you've got a good set of students in your seminar, but buyer beware: the 3 papers during the semester can be a bear, especially if you have to turn them around really quickly because Professor Kahl is tinkering with that week's readings still. Having no final and no final paper is a godsend, though - if you're shooting for a not-so-rough finals period, this course is a great choice for that.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially for people who have backgrounds in statistical analysis--I definitely felt behind the rest of the class in my lack of experience with handling data. However, it was manageable for me. The workload is pretty relentless throughout the semester, with a lot of busywork due every week, but I was very happy not to have a final paper at the end of the semester. You'll gain a much deeper understanding of welfare states from a lot of interesting angles.",
    "Take Welfare States Across Nations if you're interested in the broad-scale questions of welfare economics (what structures the claim\/contribution transaction of the welfare state?), and interested in the economic minutia (marginal tax rates) as well. It isn't a policy-focused class: don't expect to walk away with a thorough understanding of the NHS or TANF, but Kahl is fun and offers good suggestions if you go to her office hours.",
    "It's a good overview of different countries' approaches. You'll be a writing a small piece each week, and a few longer essays but you can choose when to write them.",
    "I would recommend this course. There's a lot of really good content contained in the syllabus and the seminar, and Prof. Kahl's method of having short papers and comments throughout the semester improves the course even while reducing the workload (since there is no final paper). I found the organization of topics by week a little jumbled, but I'm sure that will be improved in future iterations of the course. Finally, as a more quantitatively-oriented person, I was occasionally frustrated by some of the class discussion that didn't seem to be grounded in empirically verifiable claims (and consequently would have appreciated a statistics pre-req). Nevertheless, a rewarding PoliSci seminar overall with a sharp and well-versed professor.",
    "Great seminar, one of my favorites this semester. The class organization (3 short papers throughout the semester, 6 even shorter comments on others' paper, plus very short reflections after each class; everyone sees everyone else's papers, comments, and reflections) incentivizes everyone to do their best written work and to be prepared for class--which in turn helps discussion. Plus, there's no big paper due at the end of the semester, which is extremely helpful. Professor Kahl is a great discussion leader, very approachable and very helpful. In short, if you're interested in looking at welfare policy across nations in the West, or even if you just need to (say) fulfill the core requirements for EP&E, you really can't choose a better class to take.",
    "The class has an interesting syllabus but the reading load is pretty heavy. I don't think everyone did all of the reading every week but overall it was pretty doable. There is a lot of small work to do (3 papers and 5 comments on other people's papers over the course of the semester). The nice thing is that you don't have a final paper, but the constant work can definitely be difficult. If you're interested in welfare at all (which encompasses a number of things), this class will be interesting - discussions were generally well led and its cool to get to discuss the papers your peers wrote (which we did a lot of towards the end of the semester)."
