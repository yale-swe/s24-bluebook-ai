    "A really fascinating course. I love the idea of looking at cities through literature. I enjoyed the way the discussion was divided between relating the novel to the city, and relating the novel to the greater body of postcolonial literature in the world of the former Portuguese Empire. I thought the work load was very fair, Janelle was an amazing teaching fellow, and Professor Jackson's personal experiences enlivened conversations about places that were very far away."
