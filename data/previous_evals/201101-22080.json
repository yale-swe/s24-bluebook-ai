   "comments": [
    "Good course! Lots of reading of ancient Chinese texts in translation. Sometimes dense, but you will learn a lot about not only the history but also Chinese philosophy. You may even adjust your own outlook on life. Found it an interesting contrast to many other history courses I've taken on early Christianity and the Enlightenment.",
    "Do not take it unless you already have a comprehensive knowledge of these works, and do not expect the class to have a point.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in Chinese thought. I would mention that the course, in my view, leans more towards the philosophical thought than it does the \"history\" component.",
    "If you want to know what Mao Zedong dumped on in 60's, take this class. It will introduce a side of China that doesn't get much light these days, and if you've been to China as a Light Fellow, it will really broaden your understanding of the culture.",
    "Great class! I feel grounded in the basic Chinese philosophies and have probably learned more from this class than any other this semester. The work is very manageable, though the paper is challenging. Overall, very much worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in studying either philosophy or China or -- especially -- both. So many students come to Yale and take Chinese language without ever getting exposure to these materials, which seems strange considering the degree to which they (Confucius, Mencius, etc.) have shaped Chinese culture, thought, and language. I am confidentthat this class helped my Chinese through sheer cultural understanding, strangely enough.",
    "History 314 is primarily a philosophy course rooted in early China. It introduces the primary philosophical traditions during this time period.",
    "I love this class. Take it.",
    "I would recommend it to another student if they are really interested in the material.",
    "This is a must-take and definitely one of the best classes I've taken here all 4 years. The material is not only intellectually stimulating, but also deeply inspiring and thought-provoking on a personal level. I feel not only more knowledgeable, but also more insightful about life, relationships, humanity, etc. Take it by all means if you can!",
    "A stellar, stellar history class for someone looking to learn about China, especially in the wake of Professor Spence leaving. Professor Chin has a way of making philosophers as untouchable-seeming as Confucius accessible and fantastically interesting, and all the while giving a strong sense of context within history. I feel like I have a strong grasp of the basic ideas of many Chinese philosophers now, and I am eager to see how this knowledge applies in more modern times. The readings were not often long, and though often frustrating on one's own, become crystal clear through Professor Chin's nuanced explanations in class. Take it take it take it!"
