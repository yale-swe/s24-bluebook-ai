   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Affirmations: energetic, smart, and really loves academia. She understands the material and was responsive to suggestions. Comments on our work were thoughtful and detailed. Was prepared and organized for each section. Always willing to meet with students and offer help. Suggestions: Be sensitive to how frustrated students are with the material and course format; consider teaching the first few readings. Be sensitive to when small group exercises are not working and turn the energy and stress level down to figure out what will help the group. Learn more about ministry students in a Div. School context; there was a condescending attitude that was palpable.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Not patience with students. Does not have good listening skills. For example when a student is explaining something and has not finished, she jumps in to give a negative comment even before she hears the full story. This is very frustrating to students especially when you depend on such a Teaching Fellow to give you a final grade for the course.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati was very helpful in her feedback and comments on papers and exams. However, there were times when she was very dismissive and condescending. I don't know if that is her personality but it was very painful and hurtful to me. It made it very difficult for me to approach her because she seemed like she did not want to be bothered. And if you asked a question, she responded in a way that made you feel unintelligent. I believe that it is important for future teachers and professors to not interact with students in that way. Overall, I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge from her. But throughout the semester, my feelings were hurt and I felt like I could not talk to her or approach her.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati offered very helpful feedback on written assignments that was thorough and specific. She also led discussion group in such a way that students were actively engaging course material.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0I think Kati was strong in her ability to get us thinking critically in the type of way we would need to for the tests, our papers, etc. Her approach to section seemed very skill-based. I also appreciated her enthusiasm for the subject and for our abilities. Sometimes she ran over time, which I found to be a weakness. I also disliked that we tried to cram in so many of the readings into our section discussion instead of going in-depth on one or two. Discussion was more disjointed than thorough.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati is friendly and knows the material well. She also appears to be good at historical methodology, and is very understanding of the demands placed on students. I greatly appreciate that last point. However, she often seems dismissive of students' contributions in section - and I don't just mean myself, I often observed her responding to others this way. It wasn't because she disagreed with them; it was more the patronizing way you would tell a 10-year-old \"That's so interesting\" when they're describing a new video game. \"I validate what you're talking about because it's polite even though I really don't care\" is not a good way to foster discussion. I also dislike her approach to grading and to the course texts. Whenever anyone tried to speak in class from personal experience, she asked them to use the assigned reading to back up their point. \"Where is that in the text?\" There are dozens of texts for any given topic - it is okay for us to learn about that topic from more than just three assigned essays, and I am more interested in the larger topic than I am the specific texts (especially if it's not a topic I'm coming back to later - this is my chance to learn the topic itself, not just a related methodology). This course is our chance to learn those things, and students speaking from other sources of knowledge should be welcomed and encouraged! Stifling that kind of discourse stifles learning. Finally, I take issue with the approach to grading. A thesis is far more than \"make an argument I can disagree with.\" Not all topics lend themselves to that style of writing. Some students - who may be perfectly good at argumentation but don't feel it's warranted in a particular paper - may learn more from a descriptive thesis, if they're describing something in a way no other source has done. There are many different kinds of ways to write a good social sciences or humanities paper, but Kati insisted on one narrow way. That makes sense if you're trying to teach a specific style of writing, except we are not high school students or undergrads. We know what a primary source is, and we know how to write. If we don't, that's our fault, and it's not Kati's job to fix that. That is not what graduate school is for. This reads very harshly. I am not saying that Kati is a bad teacher. I like her personally, and I think she can improve. She is a student of pedagogy just as we are students of divinity, and this is her chance to learn and grow. She has the potential to be a great professor, if she alters her approach to learning methods.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0She was very reasonable, kind and generous. TA Kati commented on my assignments every time I submitted my work- her comments were helpful.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Strengths: Kati seems to know her material well, and seeks to impart it in a manner that allows for everyone to understand what she's presenting. Overall, she does a great job of facilitating the sessions, and focuses on materials and information that enhances comprehension and interpretation techniques. Demonstrates a heart, spirit and desire to bring out the best of academic development in the students - myself in particular! Weaknesses: Sometimes she may appear to be a bit insensitive and hardnose in her demeanor. This is not always or necessarily a negative trait. However, it can potentially be perceived as such. However, this can be helpful as well. The good thing about her is that underneath the tough persona, there's a nice caring individual. So it's ok! Awareness is the most important thing!",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Curtis provided very thorough and helpful written feedback.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Srtengths: Very caring. Was very enthusiastic and engaged in the material. Great instructor - invested in the course and students. Weakness: Well probably both strength and weakness -- very demanding and maybe outside of the lines drawn by the professor. But, probably made us better historians.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati is just awesome. I really enjoyed her enthusiasm, dedication and brains. I am so excited for her future students at Sewanee!",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati was very enthusiastic about the material and the students. She was also helpful in explaining the material and writing procedure. Overall, she was excellent.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati was engaged, encouraging, and brought enthusiasm to a well-prepared section.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati did a nice job leading section discussions. Her in-depth feedback on the writing assignments was thoughtful and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati brings a high energy level to her teaching, along with a clear passion for her discipline. I appreciated her availability outside of class and her interest in my intellectual projects. She was thoughtful about setting the \"ground rules\" for class discussion, and took time to engage us in contributing to those \"ground rules.\" She repeatedly expressed her commitment to us as her students and our learning experience. My primary critique is that at times, Kati talked down to us--which I know was not her intent. She has a great deal to teach us, especially about the discipline of history, as well as the substance of the course. But many of us have done graduate work and had previous careers before coming to Div School. I'd hope she can safely assume that we know what a thesis statement is, and that the main work of an academic paper is to support an argument. Perhaps we need guidance on how to do this well, or feedback on when and how we've missed the mark. But in general, I would ask Kati to relate to students more as experienced, adult learners who are perhaps novices to her area of expertise.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Strengths: Passionate about her role. Gave helpful notes and I have told her so. Keeps a high standard for herslef and others Weakness: Can hover a little in section when she gives an assignment. Should trust the students more to do what needs to be done in section. It would just take a little adjustment. Overall, she was a great Teaching Fellow.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati was a force to be reckoned with in Section. She demanded serious preparation, challenged us to think more broadly, caused us to be more precise in our responses. Her written commentary on my work was exceptionally detailed, provoked my deeper reflection and has equipped me to ask better questions about my academic writing for the future. I could tell she cared deeply about my learning experience. I will hear her voice over my shoulder as I struggle with each of my future papers.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati gave the best written comments on my work of any fellow I have had at YDS, and that has made me a better writer.",
    "Instructor: Kati Denae Curts \u00a0Kati is clearly knowledgeable and passionate about her particular field, and that is a great asset when in a room of people who may or may not be training to be historians. However, her focus on discussing methodology took up so much class time that we rarely ever actually discussed the readings for the week in any meaningful manner. This was especially frustrating as our mid-term and final exams were predominantly based on interpreting those readings. I especially took issue with Kati's methods of evaluation. In discussions with other classmates it became clear to me that, as long you did was Kati told you to do on an assignment, with in terms of content and method, you would do fine. Any attempt to express your own opinion independent of Kati's would be shot down. The grades on my three written assignments steadily improved as I tried less and less to make the work my own and more and more to produce something she had intimated she would like to hear. This is incredibly disappointing, frustrating, and frankly unacceptable at the graduate level.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0The TF tried to cover too much material during our discussion groups. Maybe we could have a set of questions before discussion groups? Also on test, if you feel there is a certain point that has to be made then we should be made aware of that, because when you read 80 pages it hard to pinpoint what you feel is most important.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was a very good TF. He gave helpful feedback on assignments, made sure everyone participated in section discussion, and asked interesting questions of the section.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Thanks, Dr. Scholz. I had a nice semester with you!",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max has mastered the art of section-leading. He knows exactly how to distill the class materials, and to make us do the same.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max is very enthusiastic and pointed in his approach to discussion, which was both stressful and helpful for making me stay on top of the reading.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0I like Max. He's a good instructor and did well with what I believe to be terrible course material. We covered WAY to much stuff in a poor way. Sections were as good as they could be given their content.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was wonderful. He really tried to cover as much of the readings as possible. He really did facilitate discussions in sections and I felt I learned more about what we were learning in class in section. Max was very responsive in emails and was willing to meet with students and provide helpful criticism on papers in order to become a better writer.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was a great TF. I really enjoyed working with him.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Best T.F. I've ever had. - Incredibly knowledgeable - Clear and honest about what's needed and expected on papers and tests - Drew out every person in section into participation - Passion for the study of history was conveyed and could be learned from I feel Max, in written comments on assignments and in class, tried to draw each of us to be our best selves, and better students.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was an excellent teaching fellow. He engaged a large section such that all students had opportunity to engage discussions or ask questions. He also posed questions that were helpful in putting the readings into perspective.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Strengths: Very knowledgeable - good speaking skills - shows passion during discussions - ability to get students to participate Weaknesses: does not always grade on a timely manner - may appear harsh on comments written on assignments - grading seems to be too tough",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max is one of the best teaching fellows I have had here. Great organization, high expectations, and helpful feedback to help improve!",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0I liked Max. Thought he did a really good job. Knows his stuff and really seemed to like digging into the material. Not easy to cover as much material as we did.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max was a very strong TF. He encouraged classroom dialogue and always made me feel welcome to provide comment. I appreciated his probing students for textual examples when providing analysis -- I will take this with me through my time at YDS. Max's feedback on papers and exams was very instructive and appreciated. I feel like I became a better writer after applying his commentary\/tips in later papers. With so many weekly readings, I would have appreciated an email before section telling us which readings we would focus on in section -- this would have been helpful. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience with Max as my TF!",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max is a scholar not a teacher. He did not have the necessary teaching skills to lead a section discussion. The room was always tense and he often came unprepared.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max is an enthusiastic and compelling instructor, who clearly enjoys working with students and sharing his love of history. Max applied a variety of approaches to the material during sections, which kept them interesting, while making sure to explain the utility of the approach. The delay in return of written assignments would be one opportunity for improvement. Since these assignments built on one another, any delays created time constraints on the completion of future assignments. Given the number of physical texts used each week, a second recommendation would be to alert students regularly which texts to bring to section.",
    "Instructor: Maximilian Miguel Scholz \u00a0Max provides clear expectations and feedback, and does a good job asking questions that move discussion along."
