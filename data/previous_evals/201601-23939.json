   "comments": [
    "Yes! Even though Professor Blackhawk is not engaging in class discussions, the material itself is really interesting and important! If you are thinking about law school and\/or a career in public policy, you should strongly consider taking this class. It offers you a great exposure to a historical analysis of laws and policies as they pertain to American Indian communities.",
    "Great course for history majors seeking a background in the history of legislation and public policy towards Native American communities. Heavy on the history and not as much law as expected, but still great nonetheless.",
    "Great course if you do all the reading. If you don't, then taking the course will not be extremely helpful.",
    "This class is essential to understanding laws in America. It spans over 400 years of legislation and tribal histories to help you understand why laws and treaties were made and broken.",
    "Badly organized. Frequent last-minute changes to the syllabus. Often seemed like the professor was just waiting for the class to end -- frequently ended 15-20 minutes early. Professor was clearly very knowledgable and passionate about subject matter and was kind to students, spending the first five minutes of class or so catching up and asking how everyone was doing. Assumed students knew a LOT about the ways that US government works which was extremely presumptive and really limited my accessibility of the material and class and my ability to participate in the conversation. Professor was extremely unresponsive to emails and hard to meet with. Completely disregarded my dean's excuse for a very personal issue and gave me a lower grade explicitly because my paper was late even though I had a dean's excuse (which means the tardiness of the paper is approved and should not affect the grade). Needed to use this class for my major but ended up having to keep it credit\/D.",
    "Definitely take this class! Pretty average work load for a seminar, and I learned a ton about American Indian history and our legal system (and its injustices) in general. Ned was also an awesome professor and I would certainly recommend a class with him at some point.",
    "An essential overview in tribal law and policy, with a fair amount of straight-up history thrown in there.",
    "I would highly recommend this to anyone who has taken some history before.",
    "This was a fantastic course that provided an in-depth introductory look at the historyof and contemporary developments in American Indian Law- a topic that is barely covered in law school and even more rarely taught in any undergraduate setting. Prof. Blackhawk conducted excellect discussions about the nature of the legal relationship between Indian tribes and the United States, and he compelled students to think analytically about the principles underpinning federal-Indian law. This was a great class, and an excellent learning opportunity, considering that Prof. Blackhawk is currently Yale's ONLY Native faculty member.",
    "I would highly recommend it to anyone!",
    "Take it! American Indian Law and Policy is a phenomenal introduction to a very understudied field. Seminar provided a great forum for discussion and Professor Blackhawk's insights made this class phenomenal. The workload is extremely manageable, and this course will challenge your perceptions of the law and American Indian history."
