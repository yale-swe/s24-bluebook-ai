    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. THIS CLASS WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME OF MY YALE CAREER. I learned absolutely nothing. Lectures are horrendously disorganized, readings are long and often unconnected to the subject, the syllabus is incoherent, and the assignments, though easy, are a waste of time. I guess if you're looking for a gut, go for it. But that's assuming you don't value your education or care about learning anything.",
    "Definitely recommended! Do the reading, it's fun.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is an interesting subject, and also not very much work.",
    "Take it for an easy writing credit or fifth credit that isn't too much work and\/or because you love the books on the syllabus. Grading isn't terribly difficult. There is a midterm paper and final paper and then two short writing assignments---very doable!",
    "Good class to take senior year. Two papers and a short assignment at the beginning of class, and a take home midterm. Really interesting material covered and opens the door to lively discussion in section.",
    "I would recommend the class. Minimal work with somewhat enjoyable papers.",
    "A non writing intensive writing credit. The books on the syllabus are very interesting, although you don't necessarily have to do all of the reading to do well. What you get out of the class is up to you. If you do the assigned reading and attend lecture, it'll be a very enriching and relatively stress free experience. If you don't, you can still do well without stress, but you won't get anything out of the class and it'll be a waste of your time.",
    "The simple thing is that this class is a gut class. The reading may seem like a lot when looking at the syllabus, but that's before realizing that one literally only needs to read one or two books for the whole semester. There were only 3 assignments: a 1-2 page essay, a 50 word thesis statement and a 7-10 page final essay. The final essay was broken up into two parts where a draft was given to the TA for an initial grade, then it was revised and handed in for the final. All the assignments were incredibly easy, and given that you have nearly a month to work on the final paper, this class is extremely easy. Overall, the (mandatory) sections were interesting, but I wouldn't say that they were incredibly enlightening. Basically, take this class if you're a STEM major looking for an easy HU\/WR credit or if you're just looking for a 5th\/6th credit. If you want to actually learn and have stimulating discussions about American literature, I would suggest a different class.",
    "Great class! You should definitely take it, especially if you're in desperate need of writing credits. This is probably one of the lowest workload writing credits out there in terms of actual writing (there's really just a midterm essay and a final paper). That being said, it's not a low workload class overall. You essentially read one novel every week and there is a mandatory discussion section every week. Most of the TF's are pretty chill, so a lot of people got away with doing a minimal amount of reading. Not all the TF's are like that though, so you have to choose carefully.",
    "I would recommend this to any non-English major who wants to get a decent writing credit. English majors may find the readings to be repeats of things they read earlier.",
    "Wonderful class with an amazing professor, dedicated TA's, and so many interesting novels from a variety of different authors. If you want to try taking a class in American Studies at Yale, this should be the one!",
    "No. The reading list is good but the ensuing analysis was not interesting or new.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, it really depends what you put into the course as far as what you get back.",
    "Fairly easy class. Attend section, show improvement on your writing skills, and you should be fine.",
    "Good class, interesting readings (could be time consuming but depending on your interests it could be worth it), engaging sections, not a lot of writing for a writing credit so take the course.",
    "Solid class!!",
    "A broad course on various important books that explore topics such as gender and race.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS with Birgit Rasmussen. It suffered from problems diverse as extremely debilitating disorganization to extreme lack of content in the lectures, which is pretty impressive considering the absolutely fantastic syllabus. You should download the syllabus and put all the books on your reading list, but don't take the class. If you do take the class, I would recommend skipping lecture and instead dedicating that time to book discussions with your friends. It will be much more productive, and neither your grade nor your learning will suffer.",
    "I would summarize it as a class in which you will read great American literature, learn how to analyze literature, and become a better writer. Furthermore, you will have a good time doing it.",
    "I'd recommend it, especially if the syllabus is appealing to you. Generally, it's a straightforward class with a lot of potential -- you'll get out of it what you put into it.",
    "I would recommend if you're generally interested in readings. Don't take it as a gut class.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject, it is a good course.",
    "A fantastic course. An absolutely must take course if you are interested in expanding your mind while also keeping workload to a minimum.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are a non-english major especially",
    "Would recommend for people who are looking for a writing credit and want to take a literature class that isn't too stressful. If you put a lot into it, you'll get a lot out.",
    "I think it depends on the Teaching Fellow, but for the lecture experience, I would not recommend this course. Its lack of cohesive framework and poor lecture engagement made it seem like a waste of time for the weekly meetings outside of section.",
    "This course is great. Professor Rasmussen is awesome and knows how to be an entertaining lecturer. She is also very understanding that some people can't write as well as others, which makes it really easy to feel comfortable writing in your own style for the assignments. Not to mention the work load isn't as heavy as other classes, which lets you take time to actually enjoy the material instead of constantly rushing to get assignments done.",
    "Take it as a fifth class with an easy TA if you're not a humanities person or if you don't want to do all the reading. Take it normally with a tough TA if you want a great class on minority authors and race\/gender relations.",
    "A nice course if you need a writing or humanities credit.",
    "Although the subject matter of this course is important and interesting, I think there may be better classes more worth your time. A lot of people go into this class because they hear it is easy and just need a writing credit; this is somewhat true, but is also highly dependent on the TF you have. Since there was such a big class this year, there were so many TFs who all graded differently and even set their own deadlines for assignments. I feel that this was really unfair and a big flaw of the class. The professor is the sweetest woman, but I didn't find her lectures to be extraordinarily thought provoking or interesting. That being said, you can get away with not fully reading all the books and not attending lecture if you want--you will still be able to get a decently good grade.",
    "If you're interested in these works then I would recommend this class to another student. I think taking it requires a certain sensitivity towards people of other backgrounds that it was clear that not everyone had, which was unfortunate, so that's also something to keep in mind.",
    "Easy class, light workload, and good books to read!",
    "Great class especially for STEM majors looking for an easy writing credit. Very interesting readings (all on spark notes), and lectures aren't necessary but are interesting if you choose to go.",
    "If you need a gut writing class, go for it. But don't expect it to be super interesting or fun. Lectures are basically useless. You don't need any information from the lectures to do anything. Reading the books is optional, because, depending on your TA, you may not even really discuss the books at all. You write less than you do for a lot of non WR courses, though that's not really a complaint on my end. Everything is really wishy washy. You may feel like you wasted a semester, but if you have an otherwise hard course load, then go ahead. It will probably be better than something like Nature of Genius, but that's not really a high bar to meet.",
    "Overall, the class is what you make it. The books are very interesting so, if you are really into that, you can get a lot out of the class. If you are just here to get the writing credit, the class is fairly gutty and you can definitely pass without doing much work. The three writing assignments are fairly short and straightforward, there is even extra credit. Take the class.",
    "AFAM is a great class for an overview of non-traditional american literature. Though the class could not go in depth for each book, the breadth of topics ensures that you will enjoy at least one or more of the novels. The work load is very manageable and the lectures really interesting. A great class!",
    "This was the perfect literature class to fulfill my American Studies literature requirement! Very little work, and you didn't have to attend lecture at all.",
    "Easy class, great subject!",
    "The reading list is generally interesting (give the lesser-known books a chance), the workload is reasonable, and Professor Rasmussen is a very engaging lecturer.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It is fairly easy, but still opens your eyes to cultures and authors you would not have known otherwise. I especially loved the book by Silko. Take this course! It's easy and you will learn so much!",
    "Race and Gender in American Literature is a great writing course! I enjoyed doing the reading and listening to Professor Rasmussen's analysis in class. This class is really what you make of it so take it if you are interested in the topics! Even if you are not familiar with race and gender issues, you will be pleasantly surprised.",
    "AMST 211 is a great class. Take it! I definitely learned a lot about the intersections between race and gender throughout the course and really liked the reading choices!",
    "Great course to take if you want to enjoy reading some cool books and don't want to feel like you have to take complete notes at each lecture.",
    "I would recommend the course. The readings are all great and the workload is extremely manageable. Great for a writing credit!",
    "This is a wonderful literature course that I would recommend to anybody! The syllabus keeps things interesting, even if you have already read some of the material, and you will learn a ton.",
    "Absolutely worth it. The readings are amazing and most of it will be things you have never read. At the same time, those readings will be the most beautiful things you will ever read. The work load of the class is very reasonable and very light for a writing credit but at the same time that gives you space to really work on each assignment and carefully do each reading. The assignments that do exist are intense and help you learn a lot about both how you read a book and how you write a paper. Professor Rasmussen has carefully crafted each assignment to build up to the final paper and it definitely works! Take this class if you need a writing credit, if you want to read things you have never read before and will never forget reading, and if you want to read American literature from different peoples and female authors.",
    "I think I went twice to this class. The assignments have little to do with lecture. If you're looking for an easy writing credit, you found it.",
    "Take this class! You will be able to better your close reading skills and the curriculum is amazing!",
    "This class was very disorganized and there was very little incentive to actually do the readings or go to lectures because there were so few graded assignments (so no one did any work and lectures were attended by only a fourth of the class). I quite liked a few of the books, but because there were so many, we only got a superficial taste of each. It would have been better if there were fewer books but more assignments for each. Pop quizzes with passage recognition in the lectures would have made people actually read the books and attend the lectures. Overall, it wasn't a terrible class but I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Absolute GUT must take!! Free writing credit!",
    "Overall decent class. Good for someone who has little experience in reading and analyzing literature. Very basic but pretty interesting.",
    "yes, it's a great class and much needed addition to a usually white, male american literature cannon",
    "Take it. Especially if you never had to study ethnic\/ minority groups before (which you most likely didn't if you aren't from a major city with a huge minority population). Trust me. you don't know what you don't know, and what you don't know is crucial to know.",
    "My TA made the class great!",
    "It's a great course. You'll enjoy it.",
    "Very interesting syllabus if you want to widen your scope of literature. However, it is not one of those classes that you feel like you WANT to go to. It is more of an work-on-yourself course.",
    "This is great class - difficult at times but worth it. It was truly a world-class educational experience you will obtain no where else in the universe. Learning takes place in truly extraordinary proportions. More than blessed to have taken it, and now I feel I'm ready to tackle the world whether it means understanding and sympathizing with the convictions, struggles, successes, and failures of our fellow human beings or solving world problems from the enlightened lens of a modern critical thinker born anew from the ashes of innocence and darkness. WGSS 211 has taught me what it means to be human, and has shown me the sacred light, one that will follow me on my lifetime journey. It is now forever engrained in me, in every fiber, in every pore on my skin, that I must be swift as the coursing river, with all of the force of a great typhoon, with all of the strength of a raging fire, mysterious as the dark side of the moon. The readings have taught me that I can defeat the Huns without having to make a man out of me. No, I will carry on without succumbing to either the wills of others or the force of a thousand suns. I am Mulan, I will find my own path, reach high up in the air for justice, end evils, achieve balance for the world, and lead people to not only victories over their enemies, but victories over their self-conflictions, their spirits, both mental and spiritual. WGSS 211. We are the future. We are infinite.",
    "This class was a pretty good way to fulfill a writing requirement. The lectures were interesting, assignments were relevant and not too hard. Overall, definitely worth taking.",
    "This course is a beginner level literature course that is great for non english majors. The books are interesting and the assignments are not too intensive. I would recommend this class for anyone who is looking for another writing credit.",
    "It's a pretty easy class if you are looking for a writing credit. The reading is super interesting, and there's not that much that's required of you in terms of writing. It's a great 5th class to take if you're looking for one and are interested in the course material:",
    "Yes! I am a science major and absolutely loved this course.",
    "Great class, choose a good section leader.",
    "Really fascinating, manageable course that exposed me to interesting racial dynamics that I was previously unaware of.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a wonderful overview of pieces dealing with race and is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 293 to any student who is interested in pursuing greater study of a diverse range of reading (everything from Puddnhead Wilson to Woman Warrior to Beloved to the Declaration of Independence). This class is particularly accessible to students who are not English or Literature majors. Although I attended every single lecture, I noticed that by the third or fourth week, attendance had truly declined, which was a shame. Professor Rasmussen is truly interested in each of her students and it is my hope that in future years, if students decide to take this class, they actually go to lecture! The TFs are very diverse (law school students, drama school students, etc.) and engaged in the course. Take if you need a writing credit or have interest in the class.",
    "I really liked the class, but I think it would've been better if it was a smaller class rather than a lecture.",
    "Highly recommend. Easiest writing class at Yale. You don't have to go to lecture but it is still interesting.",
    "It is an ok writing credit.",
    "Great class if you are looking to learn something while not having to do back breaking work to do it!",
    "This class is fine. The assignments are fair, the reading list is great, and Prof. Rasmussen is nice and a pretty good lecturer. The TFs really matter, though, so make sure you have a good one. I didn't and it made it hard to get much out of the class.",
    "I recommend this course if you need a writing credit. The reading is interesting, and must be done if you don't want to look stupid in section, but lecture is boring and kind of a waste of time."
