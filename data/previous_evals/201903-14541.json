    "Understanding of historical and contemporary views on matters related to geobiology. Heavy emphasis on interpretation of scientific journal articles.",
    "This course gave a great overview of current topics in geobiology.",
    "I developed much greater familiarity with recent literature on the late Proterozoic - early Phanerozoic biosphere. With this came a better understanding of the different approaches being used to understand the timing, drivers, and consequences of evolutionary and ecological changes during this time, from biomarkers to morphology to respirometry. In addition, the field component of this course provided me the chance to see Cryogenian, Ediacaran, and Cambrian stratigraphy for the first time and allowed me to learn new skills such as how to measure bioturbation and identify fossils from this time period. By taking this class I was able to develop several ideas for a minor with Lidya, which I hope to further develop over the coming semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting and varied topics; insightful lectures and class discussions; interesting field trip; clear and concise takeaways. Weaknesses: More \"teaching\" rather than discussions could be useful in some cases. Lectures at Yale were really great but I think that some focused lectures in the field would also be very helpful. Similarly, more direct teaching of field skills would be useful.",
    "I think this class was run very well with a combination of lecture for context and then paper discussion. The field component of the course complement the classroom lectures and discussions well and was important for understanding the stratigraphic context of current work being done in the Ediacaran-Cambrian.",
    "I liked how the class focused on a specific time interval in Earth history yet integrated many disciplines. The Death Valley trip had very clear relevance to what we learned in class, and we routinely returned to our observations out in the field when discussing new topics over subsequent weeks. The final presentations were an excellent way of wrapping up the course and synthesizing what we learned. My only idea for improvement would be to bring relevant fossil specimens to class meetings if any are available, and potentially use them for final projects if this class is offered again without a field component."

    "Yes. It would be a great intro grad student class for any student considering paleo issues. Broad topic discussed were relevant and interesting.",

    "Yes, highly! Especially if interested in fieldwork"
