   "comments": [
    "This course gives you an introspective look at \"radicalism\" in California during the twentieth century (for the most part). It might seem very specific, but many of the things discussed transcend boundaries and resonate in a wider context. I would definitely recommend this course. It's a seminar, so it's hard to get into, and it has a lot of work (lots of readings every week,three essays, weekly reading responses, projects). But it's totally worth it. The in-class discussions are fantastic and Professor Pitti is awesome. He's one of the best teachers at Yale. Take this class!",
    "Radical California covers various topics in Californian history since 1930. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have any interest in California. The only downside is the workload (2 short papers, 2 presentations, weekly reading responses, 1 final paper). Professor Pitti is great, the readings and topics are interesting, and the class gives you a better understanding of California.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. It was in general enjoyable, with some interesting reading.",
    "Definitely recommend it. It's on the larger side for a seminar, but there is plenty of time to have your say. Professor Pitti is the man and I'd recommend any course with him! Beware on the amount of writing!! Weekly reading response, 2 shorter papers, and a longer research paper...but you can do a creative project instead!! He's great. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Radical California to another student, especially one interested in the development of the state. It was eye opening to see how much California has affected the rest of the U.S. and the rest of the world.",
    "Yes, take it! It's an interesting class, and you get to study a lot of movements\/trends that occurred in California. The reading is kind of heavy, and you have to do weekly reading responses, but the class only meets once a week. Also, the final paper can be a little tough, but Professor Pitti is extremely helpful!",
    "Definitely recommend for a really fun seminar with a great professor. Lots of writing, but very interesting assignments and Master Pitti is flexible. Any American Studies major would definitely appreciate this class.",
    "The good: very interesting readings; personable, supportive professor; variety of different assessment formats (from book review to Beinecke research to group presentation).The bad: Professor Pitti doesn't get involved in the seminar discussion as much as he could, and this restraint, while admirable, often leads to a less interesting discussion than we might otherwise have; annoying weekly reading responses; lack of a cohesive narrative to pull the class together (this may be inherently problematic to the notion of calling a state's history generally \"radical,\" because of course it was radical in different ways at different points)Depending on the makeup of your class, this could swing either way between very good and just decent.",
    "i would definitely recommend radical california to a fellow student because the information learned is extremely rewarding. the readings are well organized and provide a great deal of insight on the subject.",
    "Radical California is a typical American studies class. You will read a variety of primary and secondary texts and deal with concepts like immigration, culutral appropriation and gender and sexuality. I would recommend it to a student interested in California or looking to expand their American Studies knowledge.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have the opportunity. Professor Pitti presents a mix of popular and academic materials unlike that of any other class at Yale. We covered everything from cartoonist unions, neo-conservatism, gang culture, and the Berkeley riots. Furthermore, the seminar is a wonderful combination of folks from California and elsewhere in the country, and Professor Pitti takes great pains to make sure a variety of perspectives and opinions are voiced in class, presentations, and projects."
