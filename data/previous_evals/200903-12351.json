    "This class is required for ABET majors so it doesn't really matter if I recommend it or not, you'll have to take it. This was the first year 481 was offered in this form so it will hopefully be somewhat fixed by next year. But I warn you, if the class is anywhere near its current form, you are in for a pretty disappointing semester.",
    "It is a course where you are given a project and you have to meet certain requirements. If you are an ABET major you have to take it, if you are not I woould say that it is a good course to take because it teaches you how to create a device given certain parameters and then present that device through a presentation and a report."
