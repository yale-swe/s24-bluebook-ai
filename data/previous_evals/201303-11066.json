    "People complain about having to take language classes, but with Profesora Reymundi, it was so fun and such a joy. She started each class with funny music videos and songs, and was very organized in how she presented information. She is also very understanding and just really wants to help her students learn. She also speaks only in Spanish throughout, and commands a lot of respect in the classroom while also joking around at times and not deterring people from trying to speak.Take this class and take it with Reymundi!!! you won't regret it! I wish I could take L4 with her too",
    "I would recommend Spanish if you would like a course that will help with the basics of Spanish without being too difficult. The homework can get tedious, but I would recommend doing as much as possible during one sitting on the weekend.",
    "I would definitely recommend Span 130, especially with Professor Reymundi. Although I initially enrolled in Span 130 solely to fulfill my language requirement, I finished the class inspired to do much more with Spanish.The curriculum provides comprehensive coverage of Spanish vocabulary and grammar (and even begins with a review of the very basics for students (like me) who had not studied Spanish in a while). I thought one of the best features of the course was the strong emphasis on speaking. Nearly every day in class, students practiced new grammar and vocabulary by doing oral activities in pairs. The semester also concluded with a 20-minute oral exam.Despite the fact that I \"just wanted to get my language requirement over with\" at the beginning of the semester, I am not only confidently conversing in Spanish with native-speaking friends, but am also looking to continue my Spanish studies by travelling to Spain this summer.",
    "If you're placed into this level, take it. Absolutely manageable and will help you a great deal with the language.",
    "This was a good class in the Spanish sequence. It was a lot of busywork and having class everyday is a lot, but I learned a lot and it was nice to get a lot of speaking practice.",
    "It's a fun and manageable course.",
    "Basically what you expect from L3 - greater expansion of grammar and practice of what you learned in L2. It's definitely a bit more intense but not unmanageable by any means, and I saw clear improvement in my speaking and comprehension as the semester went on. Professor Reymundi was fantastic - she is a fair grader, easy to understand, and both funny and engaging in class. Take it with her if you can. You probably need the class for distributional requirements but it's great to just improve your Spanish as well if you are interested in doing so. I recommend taking it if you are interested\/need to, and take it with Reymundi if you are able.",
    "Spanish 130 is a good review of old grammar, but it still introduces some new concepts. I would not necessarily take it for fun, but if you want or need to continue Spanish, this course is perfect. The workload is very manageable and the readings and movie are interesting. Profesora Reymundi is awesome! She is so nice and she has great taste in Spanish and Latin American music."
