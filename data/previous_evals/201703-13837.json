    "I grew in my ability to think strategically, navigate difficult team situations, meet deadlines, and work as a team. I critically began to understand developing a research framework, results framework, and conducting successful interview. I learned about multisectoral governance, malnutrition, case studies of best practices of multisectoral approach, leadership and advocacy, and Social Behavioral Change Communication campaigns. I began to understand structures of funding and the challenges governments face in implementing interventions and rolling out large scale commitments.",
    "I acquired knowledge of the Ethiopian health system, those involved in combatting malnutrition in the region, case studies to inform how to facilitate the multisectoral approach, how to build out a metrics and finance framework, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about how to work with a client and how to work in a large team. Useful insights in a senior project as we prepare to enter the real working world!"

   "comments": [
    "I believe that there needs to be more team building in the beginning of the structure and an expectation setting time. this made it difficult as the project manager to enforce rules or deadlines when there was no structural support. I feel that the course was helpful, but it would've been nice to have feedback from the previous year's group with professor O'brien. It is hard to learn how to work with a group you know nothing about and dive in head first. We didn't learn until first month that we should meeting another time during the week. I felt that was a weakness, we were just a bit late to the game to know the best practices of a capstone. There should be information sharing between the seniors and juniors so they know what to expect.",
    "My level of engagement was extremely high and I thus learned a ton. The weakness is that while I and a few others did a lot of work there were some free riders who pretended to have done our work and take credit for it- this was frustrating but its par for the course of a project like this.",
    "We would have benefited from a lot more client interaction to guide our work, ensure that we were on the right track, and keep us moving forward towards a beneficial final product. It also would have been great to give our final client presentation in person to the client in a more professional setting. On the strength side, especially as we began the writing process for our final report, Professor O'Brien provided extensive feedback that was very helpful in shaping the final product!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend working with professor O'brien, but the capstone is mandatory. It was a really incredible and fulfilling experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It is very different from a classic Yale course but you acquire skills that you will use in the real world post-Yale.",
    "Obviously this is a Global Affairs senior project, so if you're a Global Major you'll be doing one, but I would recommend Professor O'Brien!"
