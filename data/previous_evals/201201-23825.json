   "comments": [
    "It's a decent forth or fifth class. A lot of reading but most of it isn't required. The entire class consisted of one sustained research paper on a topic of your choosing -- I actually kind of enjoyed writing the paper throughout the semester, though class was not very interesting. A lot of \"prof asks question, student answers\" and very little organic discussion. probably due to the fact that there was like 25 people in the seminar. good, not great.",
    "This course gives its students a very strong foundation in IR theory. You read the essential literature of realism, neoliberalism, constructivism, etc. The way the course is scheduled is very fair. You get time to work on multiple drafts of your final paper, which is a rewarding experience. But I feel this class might be too much \"social science\" for students who are interested in the policy aspects of international organizations. For the first five weeks, what we read were very abstract.I also wish the professor taught us more actual methodology, rather than have us read PDF scans of methodology books.Professor Marinov is very good about commenting on drafts our final papers. He sets up regular office hours in advance. He answers our questions in a prompt manner. I also liked the fact that he is \"broad church\" in terms of methodology, so we are exposed to many different ways of testing our hypotheses. However, Professor Marinov is not very engaging as a seminar leader. Each class felt like a drifting boat on a sea of comments. I wish he took control of the discussions more.",
    "Yes, but know that the focus is on your research paper and not so much the class material.",
    "Definitely. Professor Marinov is great and very supportive if you reach out. The course was just one research paper over with numerous drafts due over the course of the semester, allowing you to really focus on one topic while getting nan overall view in the weekly readings.",
    "The class is basically a great overview of the most important things that have been postulated in academia and the media at large about the functioning and legitimacy of international institutions in their various shapes and forms.It's also a great term paper writing workshop, as Prof. Marinov gives great help and research guidance throughout all the steps involved in writing a solid, publishable term paper. He's an edless source of information on both quantitative and qualitative aspects, and is very open to meeting at any point of the research process.The course can be somewhat theoretical at certain points, so don't take it thinking we'll delve deeply into the internal workings of specific international institutions. But it is all fundamental readings for anyone wishing to study the subject. Within the term paper, too, you can choose to focus on a particular organization of your choice.",
    "A very good class for GLBL and IR majors. An understanding of international institutions and organizations is invaluable in the world we live in, and the class offers good background in issues related to the field. Furthermore, the semester-long research paper upon which your grade is based - while daunting at first - is an amazing opportunity to create your own research under the expert guidance of Professor Marinov.Quite a bit of reading. Your grade is based on participation in class, a presentation on your project (informal), and three separate drafts of the project itself.",
    "No, there are other seminars that could cover the same topics in greater detail.",
    "This is a traditional seminar class in the sense that it is 80-100 pages of reading per week to prepare for a themed discussion. There was a lot of flexibility in crafting the paper, but Professor Marinov gives useful, specific feedback to guide the process. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. Because it is comprised of half graduate students, it is challenging but an asset to a Yale education.",
    "I would recommend International Institutions to a fellow student because it is a fascinating course that helps you produce a well-researched and planned paper that can be used for graduate school applications and the like. I thought it was a great course and nicely straight forward as well. No surprises just work hard on your paper.",
    "This was a very interesting class and Professor Marinov is great. Start early on the readings and really think about them; that is how you will get the most out of this class. In terms of the research paper, speak to a librarian early on in the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class for any student interested in writing their own research paper related to international institutions with full support. This class definitely teaches you the complicated, deep, politics that drive international relations and non-relations.",
    "This was a good class. It was good to work on one paper for the whole semester as practice for the senior essay. However, we got very little help from professor marinov. As for the seminar, it was way too big this year for the discussion to be engaging. I would recommend this class for students want to become better at writing long research papers.",
    "It's a good class for a beyond-basic understanding of how well international institutions are working, but more guidance could be given by the instructor to think more deeply about the legitimacy of these institutions and how they can be restructured going forward."
