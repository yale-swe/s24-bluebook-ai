    "I have a better understanding of how chords and progressions work and can more easily tell how pieces of songs are working together.",
    "Interval and chord identification. Handy practices for sight-singing. Piano lab taught elementary keyboard skills such as basic scales and chord progressions.",
    "Dictation, sight singing, some music theory",
    "MUSI 218 taught me how to sing and listen in both the major and minor modes of the classical music system. The class allowed me to understand solfge syllables while I internalized the major scale as well as the three minor scales found in classical music. In practice, the use of solfge and\/or scale numerals were used in sample works of music, training the mind, ear, and eyes to anticipate the next pitch of the musical tone. It was inherent to understand key signatures and the major-minor equivalents, along with the common clef systems in order to properly read the music. Throughout this course, I developed a better recognition of tone intervals and chord progressions, which are defining characteristics of all harmonic and melodic progressions. With practice, I developed an understanding of consonant and dissonant intervals ranging from a minor second to a perfect octave. The augmented, diminished, major, minor, and perfect versions of intervals were included in the understanding and training. Along with interval training, chord progressions were taught, beginning with the most common harmonies of the major and minor modes: the one, four, and five chords. With time, a developing recognition of tonic, subdominant, and dominant harmonies arose. Additional chords of the scale were added to our periodic listening of harmonic progression\/dictation, each falling into one of the aforementioned categories. These chords are the two and seven chords. Overall, this course pushed me toward a stronger internalization and recognition of harmonies and their functions in music. Training to sight sing and dictate harmonies wrapped up the key concepts of proper listening and feeling of music chords and intervals. These can easily be applied to our daily musical endeavors, whether it be playing or listening, or trying to analyze music solely off musical tones and their relations."

   "comments": [
    "For piano, there is definitely a learning curve that the course doesn't really address. I personally have little experience with piano, and overcoming that to be able to do the coursework took a lot of time and effort. The course does do a great job at getting the different chord types into your head and helping you identify them, which is nice.",
    "It seems as though the protocol for testing was rather disorganized. Often, my instructor would tell us that he did not have all the information he needed yet because he was waiting on the director of the course to fill him in on what he was supposed to be doing.",
    "Strengths: I learned a lot since it was my first music class. Super cool being able to hear subtle things by the end of the course Weakness: keyboard lab was difficult. Figured bass was not explained in class so when we suddenly had to do it for lab it was v confusing",
    "The strength of this course rested on a diverse introduction of music including singing, harmonic analysis, and piano\/keyboard playing. The last of the three helped students to tie in the harmonic analysis toward playing skills on the piano. Altogether, these trainings for the student resulted in a solidified understanding of chords and their function. Along with chord function, the course provided the basics for understanding tonal relationships through interval training and sight singing. I cannot find much room for improvement here since the internalization of chords and intervals were, in my honest thoughts, the main structure for this course, and this internalization was always strongly encouraged because of the activities that were previously mentioned."

    "It's a good course to take if you want to further your musicianship and improve your sightsinging. If you don't want to spend a lot of time on solfege or dictation, it might not be the best use of your time.",
    "As a casual musician, this course was good for furthering the informal knowledge regarding basic musicianship that I already had. I would recommend this to someone who wants to take a low-stress music class.",
    "Yes! It's a small class so you learn quickly and you get to develop a lot of cool skills such as hearing intervals and being able to look at a score and sing it.",
    "I would recommend this course to an aspiring musician, singer\/song-writer, and music listener because it teaches very important fundamentals of chords and tonality based on the structure of a major or minor scale. The interpretation of dominant, sub-dominant, and dominant are introduced in this course, as well as the rigorous introduction to singing major and minor modes. I like to think of this course as one that also tests the waters toward piano lessons or singing\/choral lessons since the practice in this course is identical. Even so, the interval usage and chord interpretation is something any musician may benefit from, no matter what type of instrument or music type of which s\/he plays. As mentioned, the point of the course for me was to build interval and chord recognition, which of course may be applied everywhere that music exists, by anyone who is intent on carefully listening and interpreting that music.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if they were also taking a music theory class and interested in developing their listening skills."
