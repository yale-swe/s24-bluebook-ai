   "comments": [
    "Spare yourself. It sounds interesting and it has a lot of potential, but it's extremely unsatisfying, especially if you've taken any other courses on sexuality. It's also not as geographically diverse as the title would have you believe\u009790% of the class is focused on the Caribbean. The professor has very clear opinions and doesn't really allow for dissenting views to be voiced openly.",
    "TAKE THIS. Jafari is an awesome, hilarious and knowledgeable professor. You get to learn about an interesting region of the world and examine your own experiences of privilege and oppression. Plus, the readings are cool and it's not that much work. Lots of athletes take this, but it's still worth it.",
    "heinous course, don't take it...",
    "I'm not sure how accessible this class is to those with no experience in gender studies or queer theory. This is not a classfor the intellectually lazy. Take it only if you are willing to really work at understanding concepts.",
    "Good overview of unique topics in homosexuality. Not geared toward understanding heterosexual life these two regions.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for a moderate work level but a deeply engaging subject matter- and if you want to analyze the *&%# out of some amazing reggae music! Regardless, this course has completely changed the way I see myself and the world around me.",
    "TAKE IT. IT CHANGED EVERYTHING",
    "The readings were mostly pretty interesting, just be warned that basically all the material focuses on homosexuality in Latin America and the Caribbean, not on sexuality in general. And maybe this class will have some more structure in the coming years.",
    "Take it! It challenges the way that you see and interact with the world.",
    "You should definitely come to this class bearing an open mind and willing to intelligently engage theoretical texts. Professor Allen is very nice and accommodating (not to mention hilarious), but it's important that you read or at least try to understand the material before going to lecture. It's a relaxed atmosphere while discussing a branch of anthropology that you might have had many misconceptions about. The actual workload is pretty light: two essays (3-5 pages and 7-10 pages) and a weekly one-paragraph reading response, but you should dedicate at least an hour per week to the readings, (about 70% ethnography and 30% theory). Definitely recommended!!!",
    "This class is coolest for the readings. If you feel like engaging in the text on a deeper level than what is expected of you in the class, then take it. Professor Allen is the kind of person that would function better in a seminar atmosphere.",
    "Sexualities in Latin America and the Caribbean is a reading and responding course that addresses sexuality in in very specific places among specific demographics. The reading schedule is rigorous and a knowledge of Spanish is helpful, but not necessary. I would not recommend this year's version of the course to a fellow student, but this is the first time this class has been tried out. I think the future versions of this course will make for a totally dynamic and engaging academic experience.",
    "I would summarize it as a theory-heavy discussion of sexuality in Latin America and the Caribbean. If you are not an anthro major, you will find it to be too academic and not very \"real world\". I would only recommend it if you are really interested in the topic from an anthropological perspective. Think Focoult, etc. If you're looking for a more candid discussion on the topic, do not take this class!",
    "Do not take this course.There is no structure whatsoever, and Professor Allen defends the lack of structure claiming that it's his \"style,\" when in fact he has clearly put no time or thought into organizing the course. The readings are horrible--mostly written by his colleagues, and not examples of good scholarship--and they were never covered in class. There were virtually no assignments during the semester, and even though it was the world's easiest A, I would never recommend this to another student. What a shame that this course was offered at a university that claims to value its undergraduates' learning experiences. I really felt cheated every time I went to that class."
