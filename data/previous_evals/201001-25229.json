    "Take it if you're interested in the subject matter, for sure.",
    "If you have any interest in learning about what Judaism is and how it has evolved and remained the same, either as a Jewish or non-Jewish individual, you should absolutely take this course. You won't regret it. The workload is quite manageable and the lectures amazing.",
    "Great class. You learn a lot. The professor is smart, eloquent and nice. The material is really interesting. Relevant stuff.",
    "Great class. Take it if you're Jewish and want an academic look at your history.",
    "Fascinating material, light workload. Totally awesome if you're interested in Jewish history, no matter your religion.",
    "Great way to learn about the in-depth history of the Jewish people (not just Judaism). Sunday school in one semester",
    "This is a great class that will teach you a great deal of information about the religious history of Judaism. Professor Hayes is brilliant and so warm and approachable. The work is totally manageable and the tests are not difficult if you study appropriately (which is pretty simple to do). If you come from a Jewish day school background or have already studied Jewish history in depth, much of the material will be repetitive. That said, I learned a lot of new information and gained a complex perspective on broad themes across time. Take the course!"
