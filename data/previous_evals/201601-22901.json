    "I would recommend the course. I would describe the course as an opportunity to access the key texts of Aristotle's philosophy, leading to his political thought. The course seeks to embed Aristotle's political thought within his broader thought as a whole, enriching the reading of his politics through a deeper understanding of his biology, physics, and philosophy.",
