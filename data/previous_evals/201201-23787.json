   "comments": [
    "It is quite intensive course with a lot of materials needed to cover. Sometimes the equations and theories make the class not very intriguing.",
    "The powerpoint slides created by the professor are incredible. I think this class could have had a little more focus on the SAS, but the professor did do a good job of balancing theory and application.",
    "More time spent using SAS, less time doing calculus.Final survival analysis project in SAS is more useful and practical than an in-class exam.",
    "This course is a very introductory course to survival analysis. Well structured.",
    "A comprehensive, well-taught course on the essentials of theory and the details on practical applications of survival analysis",
    "Wonderful introduction to survival analysis. A lot of information in a very short amount of time, making the final exam one of the most difficult I've taken recently.",
    "This course offered an in-depth view of survival analysis that epi students rarely get in other courses. It was extremely useful solving problems by hand before moving into SAS coding.My only suggestion would be for this portion of the course to be longer.",
    "Maria is wonderful. She is a excellent and dedicated teacher. All teachers should be like her! The work was alot, but there was not a lot of time to teach all the material. I think this course should be a semester long.",
    "useful",
    "I liked this course because there was a lot of useful coding information as well as theoretical information about survival analysis. That class itself was structured well. I enjoyed the class.",
    "It's helpful but a lot of work",
    "strengths: maria is a very good instructor with helpful slidesareas for improvement: would provide answer keys at least for the homework assignments. Would also consider using a little more computer-based computation of the homework assignments. There was not enough time alotted to complete the final exam, perhaps would have been better as a take home. Wonder if the class would be better if allowed to take up an entire semester! There is quite a bit to learn!",
    "The course material was very useful and supplemented my other coursework very well.",
    "I think that students with diverse backgrounds in the same class, for example biostatistics PhDs and physicians make it challenging to fit a course that would not be too easy or too difficult for some students. In opinion this course was better fitted for biostatisticians than for physicians like without any calculus background. For me a less mathematical and more practical approach would be better.I also think it is too much information for a half semester, my suggestion would be making this course a full semester and include labs. It is a very important topic, the teacher is excellent, but unfortunately I could not learn as much as I would like to.",
    "Stength - Notes were incredibly resourceful and could be used without needing a textbookWeakness - Too much material for such a short course; little time for thorough examples (e.g. model building); updates to the slides were made often without students being informed - it would have been helpful to know which slides were added or changed so only those had to be printed\/reprinted; having a homework assignment due during reading week took a significant amount of time away from my studying for other classes",
    "wonderful and excellent",
    "It was very well organized and consistent between the lectures and homeworks",
    "Strength: well-summarized lectures and powerpoint slidesWeakness: inconsistent grading of the assignments.",
    "The class materials are wonderful and the instructions of the professor are very clear and easy to follow. And this class has greatly helped me gain an extensive knowledge of survival analysis.",
    "Maria is an excellent instructor who did a great job tackling a tough topic (survival analysis). Notes are excellent and examples are clear. This course requires one to re-learn calculus in order to derive\/integrate survival and hazard functions. Given the amount of material covered, this should be a semester long course rather than a half semester. Because it was the second half of the semester, with reading week, etc -- there were only 5 lectures for the course, and it was densely packed with info. Tough but worthy course.",
    "Homework assignments were great, but often overwhelming. Repetitive. If there was more feedback on the homework assignments and logical grading of the assignments, the course would be much better.",
    "while most students must have had a solid math base, for AP students who are farther away from highschool it was a bit of a challenge.Maybe having a crash course in calculus and excel in the beginning would help, especially since the work load was so heavily based on it!!!I honestly struggled to keep up with the course load, to finish the final exam on time in class, and I am not sure that I will ever again do Kaplan Meyer curves by hand, ever again!For exercise or homework doing them by hand helps with understanding, but as an exam.;...THe parts of the exam that emphasized reading and interpreting SAS output were extremely useful!!So I am only speaking from my AP perspective: I think I will end up using only 10% of the class material - SAS related...and is too bad, because Maria put so much effort into making superb slides and explaining things at length!I am suggesting to bring more \"practicality\" (from AP students perspective at least): bring articles with survival analysis in them, go through the data and how this was analyzed, intepret more SAS outputs",
    "Excellent",
    "Strengths: comprehensive coverage of material. Weaknesses: theoretical material presented without adequate explanation of how and when to apply it; homework assignments began too late in the course and overloaded us with work during the critical time leading into finals; lecture format was completely non-interactive and hard to follow. This appeared to be a full semester's worth of material, crammed into a half-semester timeframe."

She was very nice and was always very prompt with answering questions during and outside of class. She went through the information smoothly and everything in lecture was very understandable. I do sometimes think that she covered too much in one lecture where she didn't have the opportunity to reinforce or really explain the lecture notes very well. However, I thought that overall, the class was very informative.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio was a great teacher, especially given the fact that she was a new teacher. Her notes were thorough and very informative. If there is something to work on, sometimes she read from the slides. Overall, she'll only become a better teacher.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0The instructor is great; she did an awesome job putting an enormous amount of information on her slides. She is very competent and truly sensitive to students; I think the problem was the course format - short time, no labs and too much math.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent, very clear teaching",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0The instructor clearly cares about the subject matter and her students.

    "Greg score every homework carefully. He is good.",
    "Greg was open to meeting when I could not come to his office hours. I would suggest scheduling office hours at a better time - after concepts have been covered in class and before a homework is due (I know that was out of your control, but in this half semester, the timing just didn't work out between the dates the assignments were due)",
    "Great review of calculus during one of the classes. Easy to understand.",
    "Greg Ryslik was a great TA. He was a fair grader and did a fantastic job with his calculus review. Much appreciated.",
    "Is there any TA?",
    "The TA was Greg. He was fine as a TA. I thought he was very knowledgeable on the subject matter, but was very quick during office hours and expected a lot from us, especially during the calculus portion of the class. Also, the grading of homework was very subjective, which I did not appreciate at all. When comparing the same answers with classmates, different amounts of points were taken off - most were more than I believed was deserved.",
    "he explains things clear but does not grade homework based on a consistent standard",
    "could have been more available and more patient when working with students.",
    "The TA was very helpful and easy to communicate with. He was also funny.",
    "The TA was good. He was always available, helpful and has a sound knowledge of the course material.",
    "Greg Ryslikinconsistent grading (e.g. different number of points deducted for same error on 2 students' homework assignments)calculus lecture was helpful",
    "Greg was very good at holding office hours and answering emails",
    "Knowledgeable, but very inconsistent grading scheme (example: 1) taking off many points for insignificant details whereas taking off much less points for very important concepts, etc. 2) two students lost different amounts of points for the exact same mistake). Did not feel that I am getting good feedback on assignment 3.",
    "The TA is very supportive and always response promptly.",
    "Greg was OK -- seemed nice initially and was sometimes helpful but also declined to help on one occasion that seemed unfair to me.",
    "Illogical grading. No feedback. Not friendly and not very helpful in teaching the material when help is seeked. Needs to communicate more with the professor and think more about the students.",
    "Excellent",
    "The TA was available to answer questions by email and during office hours, which were very helpful. Feedback on the homework was somewhat lacking, and the points systemwas not clear."

    "Nice course. Helpful either in survival analysis and clinical trial!",
    "Definitely recommend - good balance of theory and applied analysis with clear SAS examples",
    "Excellent class to gain a basic understanding of surival analysis, but the homework and final were no joke.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all epi and biostats students. Survival analysis is frequently referred to in other courses, but it is rarely explained in sufficient detail. This course provides the best overview of the basics of survival analysis that I have had, and then goes on to explain parametric models, non-parametric models, model building, and SAS coding. The calculus was minimal, but very useful.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot, but make sure they time is there to dedicate to the class.",
    "useful",
    "This is a theoretical and practical application of survival analysis. I would recommend this class to biostats and other students interested in performing this kind of analysis in the future. The course notes are very thorough. I will keep the lecture notes even after graduating to reflect back on.",

    "Good introduction to survival analysis methods and the SAS code for performing them; a lot of material is introduced in just a few weeks",
    "Highly recommended",
    "It was a very good detailed survival analysis class",

    "Yes, it is very proud to recommend this course.",
