   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about scientific writing during this course. I also became much more comfortable with not only understanding derivations like in other courses, but really understanding them enough to be able to replicated them without memorizing them.",
    "Best complex STEM class i've taken so far. Taught me to appreciate the attention to detail and effort put into deriving and finding simple equations such a f=ma.",
    "This class was more about learning how to approach scientific problems than facts about biomechanics, which I actually found satisfying.",
    "This course helped me gain the fundamentals required to approach simple biomechanical problems.",
    "I learned how to think about the application of mechanics to biological models. This class allowed me to broaden my view on how engineers look at problems by looking at the intersection of so many experiments and theories in biomedical engineering.",
    "This class gave a good introduction to fundamental concepts in biomechanics, such as kinematics and all the balance relations. We never solved complicated problems. Instead we learned the important concepts needed to be able to start to think about these problems.",
    "We learned the basics of continuum mechanics, Navier-Stokes equations, and mixture theory and their applications.",
    "I learned how to evaluate the mechanics of objects as a continuum with the use of material balance and constitutive equations, through the application of these equations to physiological examples.",
    "Fundamentals of Biomechanics, word descriptions of derivations for fundamental laws of continuum mechanics.",
    "I felt like, unlike other classes where you can memorize things, I actually learned a lot in this class. You really had to understand everything very well to be able to apply it to new scenarios not seen before and to be able to re-derive things taught in class.",
    "I feel like this course provides insight into how classic MechE subjects (like MENG 280 and MENG 361) tie into real-life applications, i.e. the human body. In this class I learned to not only think about engineering problems quantitatively, but also qualitatively and the history behind their development.",
    "After taking this course, I feel I have been introduced to a discipline almost entirely new to me and learned a different way of thinking about biomedical engineering problems. I feel comfortable thinking about basic problems in biomechanics qualitatively, and for restricted problems in 1-D, quantitatively. I also feel much more comfortable in my ability to apply mathematics to real world problems and to think critically about different relationships as opposed to simply memorizing them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material is thorough; however, the relation between the material learned and the field in which it is being taught seems abstract at times. At times, it feels more like a math class than an engineering course.",
    "I really liked the current format of the course. I think it throws people a little at first because it's so different from most QR\/Sc courses. It really focuses on concepts and derivations and writing and while this can take some getting used to, I feel like it is positive in the end.",
    "Well taught and very interactive.",
    "Strengths are the lectures by Jay. The weaknesses are the PSETs, which could do more to help reinforce concepts in lecture.",
    "This course was taught very well, which was definitely a strength. The expectations were very clear. One weakness was the lack of availability of practice problems due to the limited scope of the problems that could be solved with the basic fundamentals we learned.",
    "Professor Humphrey is a great teacher, and he was very organized and engaging during class. I think this class was good because it did not just teach us how to solve textbook problems. Instead it talk the fundamental concepts, which has made me more prepared to solve new problems that I haven't necessarily seen before in a textbook. I think this is an important skill. On the other hand, I didn't find some of the homework assignments that useful, specifically the ones that had us find different values for constants online or had us search about the history behind certain equations.",
    "It was a very difficult topic and very theoretical, so it would be hard to teach in a way that works best for everyone, but I thought Professor Humphrey did a really good job of organizing the course in a logical manner that made the material easier to process, and supplementing the material with tangible, accessible examples from biomedical engineering. I really liked how he kept relating new material to the same example with the artherosclerotic plaque, which helped tie all the material back in with each other.",
    "Professor clearly loves the material",
    "I really loved it because I learned so much and the professor was amazing, but I think having more practice problems before exams would have helped.",
    "Not enough feedback.",
    "The only criticism I have of this class is the inconsistency in the homeworks. I found that some would only take 1-2 hours, and some would take up to 10 (especially the writing ones) and I with some of them only assigned on Thursdays, it would sometimes be hard to predict\/allot time for the psets. This class was one of the best paced, best lectured engineering class I have taken at Yale. I felt like I not only learned the equations and derivations, but also the background to much of the engineering.",
    "The course was well organized and fair. The homework assignments never took too much time so as to detract from the overall learning experience, and professor Humphrey could not have been kinder to or more supportive of his students. The main area for improvement raised by students throughout the semester was a lack of practice problems, and while I originally shared this concern, after taking the final exam I appreciate the focus on derivations and thinking about the set up of problems rather than solving them. Learning a broad range of material in 1-D turned out to be more rewarding for an introductory class than learning a narrow range in 2-D or 3-D. I have little negative to say about what was covered in class. My only suggestion might be to show some pictures or more in depth diagrams of experiments. At the beginning of class one day, we were shown cross sections of health and diseased arteries with the proteins we were talking about stained. Including other pictures such as this might have improved understanding."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend biomechanics to another student. To BMEs: yes this is a required course, but you will definitely enjoy it. It kind of threw me for a loop at the beginning (the class is very much derivation and writing based), but now that its coming to a close I understand the value in that style of class. Also, get ready to enjoy Humphrey's lectures. He is an incredibly talented lecturer and a very genuine person. You can definitely tell that he loves what he does and he's here to help his students learn about the things that interest him so much. To Mech Es: a lot of these reviews say this class is kind of a boring jumble of Strength and Def mixed with some bio. Yes you will go over concepts like stress and strain from 280 and talk about concepts from thermo, but this class can be beneficial because its definitely a different style of class. You will become really comfortable with a variety of derivations and also definitely become more comfortable with scientific writing (way more useful than you might think). Also, see above about Humphrey being awesome. Format: 10 or 11 Psets, a derivation and short answer based midterm, a 10ish page research paper, final",
    "Yes, this is a fantastic course.",
    "You should take this class if only for Jay's lectures.",
    "This is a great course for anybody interested in simple physics in relation to the body. It is very well taught. You have to go to lecture, but you will probably enjoy doing so. The weekly homework is usually quite short, and the midterm and final are both very reasonable if you study the material, which professor Humphrey makes easy by being very thorough in class and answering any questions students have. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Take this class with Humphrey. It's a really cool elective for MechE majors. It's not very hard - homeworks are typically very short and the exams are definitely fair, but its an interesting application of mechanics to biological problems. Humphrey is a great professor and goes through everything very methodically.",
    "This is part of the BME junior sequence, but there were a few mechanical engineering or applied math or physics majors as well. I had to take it, but if given the option probably would have looked for something else. This course is a little bit of solids, a little bit of fluids, and a lot fewer applications than I expected. Professor Humphrey also teaches a second course on biomechanics, so perhaps also taking that would provide the applications that weren't there.",
    "It's worth taking the class it's an interesting, basic introduction with applications.",
    "I found the material interesting and the course was well taught, Professor Humphrey was really great and you can tell he cares about his students. But I thought it was very theoretical for a class not required for your major. It's a good foundation for the BME major, so it makes sense to take it, but for non-majors, you may not get that much out of the into unless you plan to continue taking biomechanics classes.",
    "Yes, certainly. You can't bullshit your way through this class.",
    "I highly recommend this! It's been one of my favorite BME classes so far. The professor is amazing and actually cares about his students' learning. His lectures are interesting, although they require a lot of attention because it's easy to get lost at times. I definitely clicked more with the material after the first midterm, so don't be discouraged if it's hard to follow in the beginning because the professor said this is common. I really liked his teaching style and thought the weekly p-sets were fair (I recommend you meet with the TA during office hours as that helped a lot each week to understand what they were looking for). I had to study more for the midterm and the final than for other classes because there is a lot of material and you really need to make sure you understand everything said in lecture. There are a lot of derivations of equations, which require understanding but also a bit of memorization.",
    "Chances are if you're taking this class it's required, but yes I would still recommend it. Professor Humphrey cares deeply about the course material and that reflects in his teaching style and the way he relates to the class. He moves through the material carefully and methodically allowing for questions and explaining real world applications. He is a great teacher.",
    "I would highly recommend biomechanics to another student. If you're a MechE major, this is a great elective and is a super interesting intersection of Meng 280, Meng 361 and basic physiology. Professor Humphrey is fantastic, his lectures are clear and easy to follow, and interesting. Start your research paper sooner rather than later, but that is probably the hardest thing about this class.",
    "This is a fantastic course. Professor Humphrey is the best professor I have had so far. He cares deeply for his students and the course material and goes above and beyond in every respect with his teaching. The workload is generally light, with weekly homeworks taking 1-4 hours to complete. The exams focus heavily on derivations and a few types of problems well covered in class. Critical thinking about problems and equations is favored over simply using a lot of math. Differential equations is not really necessary for this course as everything can be solved by integration."
