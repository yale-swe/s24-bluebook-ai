    "Colonial Domesticity provided me with a robust sense of how social reproduction theory and colonial domesticity might be mobilized as critical lenses that illuminate what would otherwise remain shadowed about the afterlives of slavery and imperialism. I walked away from our seminar with new questions and routes of inquiry that I would like to pursue in my work, as well as critical readings in-hand that I anticipate will help me to do that work in the future."

   "comments": [
    "This course covered a lot of ground. I appreciated the number of different intellectual traditions it engaged with. It was a real strength that Professor Lowe encouraged students to bring knowledges from their own disciplines into the classroom. It was also a unique opportunity to have a number of scholars visit our seminar from week to week. But I also think that the visitors' schedule, which had a new guest scheduled for a number of consecutive weeks, hindered the arch of conversation from week to week. In other words, it was sometimes hard to grasp each of the threads of the course because the focus was on the visitor rather than the work we were doing with the concepts.",
    "I appreciated the breadth of the assigned readings, which brought the themes of the seminar to life. At times, I wondered if excerpting some of the longer readings, especially during weeks when more than one book was assigned, might have made the workload more manageable. While I was grateful for and excited by the opportunity to converse with different faculty members who visited our seminar, I also found myself wishing for deeper conversations as a seminar around their work - though I understand that faculty visits were planned in coordination with the external speaker series! Lastly, our library session was incredibly helpful for getting a sense of how to navigate the university's archival materials as they might relate to our research interests."

    "Yes! I would recommend this course. I would clarify to students that the seminar concerns the bringing of certain analytics to bear on interdisciplinary questions and studies (rather than aiming itself at, for example, providing an overview of a specific field or methods training)."
