   "comments": [
    "Yes! Econ majors come take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I found it far more enjoyable than intro micro, although I did like intro micro. I would highly recommend trying to get into the seminar rather than the lecture. Whether you want to major in economics or something completely different, this class is extremely useful and rewarding.",
    "If you want to take econ, go for it. It is very different from micro first semester, which was much more intuitive and less confusing. Macro is more difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I think it is more interesting and informative than the lecture and students should absolutely take it if they get in.",
    "Econ 111 is a challenging survey of macroeconomics, definitely a higher workload class.",
    "Must take course at Yale",
    "Take this class. Learning macro in a small classroom setting is something you can't pass up - you get the chance to engage with your professor on a closer level and consequently learn better because you can ask questions yourself and the teacher can also gauge how well the class is understanding. The material itself I found interesting, too, and the textbook is so helpful. It wasn't easy, but I enjoyed it.",
    "Better than the lecture",
    "Econ 111 is essentially a study of several key models to the study of macroeconomics. I would recommend it to students with an interest in the workings of the economy. Don't take this expecting it to inspire you to major in economics though.",
    "Econ 111 is a great way to learn about macroeconomics in a small class with a professional in the field who can answer your questions.I would definitely recommend this class because it covers information that is relevant and useful in daily life.",
    "I think ECON 111 is a very tough course because you have to commit yourself to a lot of self-teaching. I learned too late in the course that I should have read the textbook before class, gone to office hours more, and really continue studying throughout the semester. It's a tough course, but if you're up for the challenge and you prefer a smaller class environment, go for it. Just remember that the lecture has TA's and may be easier to follow.",
    "How good this class is will depend on who you ask. I'm an econ major and I loved it. My non-econ friends who struggled a bit more hated it. The problem sets are tricky (I always had to work on them with someone else) but I learned a lot from the class, much more than I think I would have in the lecture. Too bad Sigga's leaving, she was great.",
    "I would recommend this class. The problem sets were definitely harder than those from the micro lecture last semester, but they teach you a lot more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students - definitely much better than the lecture.",
    "Economics 111 was interesting and helped understand the basics of the economy today. It was interesting but difficult as the pace is fast. Nonetheless is it a crucial class for anyone interesting in current affairs or social sciences. It would benefit from more often examinations of exploration of the subject matter.",
    "Intromediate economics. My friends at other Ivies and colleges who took Intro were learning AP material. We went beyond that. I would recommend Econ 111 to anyone who is willing to put in the time.",
    "Psets every week which can take a good bit of time. Curve is harsh. Sigga is a great and friendly teacher but this was her last semester at Yale.",
    "If you're an Econ major, take it over the lecture. If not, probably stay away.",
    "ECON 111 is a great macro course for freshman to take, especially if you're interested in economics. Sigga is a great professor...it's a pity she's leaving after this year.",
    "Great course. Pretty hard, but really good. You should know that there is a ton of math, more than micro, but it still won't give you a QR."
