    "THIS CLASS IS INCREDIBLE. IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE EVERYTHING: CLASSES, COFFEE DATES, CHURCH SERVICES, SEX, AND SO MUCH MORE. ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE!!!",
    "This course will challenge you to engage the material from an academic standpoint without invoking personal stories, but will encourage you to (and even hope that you) engage with the material personally on your own time. Sexuality and religion are both relevant to your life--whether you think so or not. Both things worth spending lots of time thinking about.",
    "A very challenging course. I would probably recommend it Credit\/D (I took it for a grade and am very stressed out about what that grade will be) because there is a lot of work and they grade very harshly (I think unfairly on the midterm). That being said it was very interesting and changes the way you think about religion and sexuality in the US!",
    "This class is tough, but we were warned that on the first day. This class pushes you to think out of your comfort zone, and to question your thought process. That, too, was clear from the first day. Basically, this class is EXACTLY what it seems like during shopping period: a professor that will speak at rates that seem overly caffeinated and will expect you -- nay, challenge you -- to keep up. A set of texts that will demand your focus. A set of assignments that require time and nuance.I wish this class were a seminar, or a more intimate lecture, or at least one that is more \"advanced\" in its coding, because I didn't comprehend, even after all of the warning signs during reading period, exactly how intense this class would be. I enjoyed myself, and got a LOT out of it, but a LOT also went over my head. I wonder if the rigor must be scaled down to match a more introductory tone, or if students should be weeded out by bumping it up to a 200 level RLST \/ WGSS \/ AMST course.",
    "Kathryn Lofton is an amazing professor and very great at answering questions. The class focuses a lot more on societal and gender topics rather than religious.",
    "This is a really great class. The material is interesting, the readings are mostly fun, and the professor is phenomenal. Kathryn Lofton lectures with all the passion of a preacher. Even when a given day's lecture topic was not particularly interesting to me, Lofton's bombast left me totally enraptured. The course aims to change how you think about the world around you. If you take this class, it certainly will.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to challenge your traditional views of sexuality and\/or religion.",
    "Religion and Sexuality has been my favorite class at Yale so far. You will never see those concepts the same, and I came to appreciate them more than before. Professor Lofton is incredibly smart and fun, and even though her class is difficult to understand, she's super accessible and is super willing to help you stay on the right track.",
    "Nah. Way too much reading for relatively lifeless discussion section makes me a bitter student.",
    "Yes! In some ways, it feels like an introductory class (and I think it's designed that way), so it's a GREAT thing to take if you're a freshman. But take it anyway just to experience Kathryn Lofton's lectures and think deeply about some fun subjects. The readings are manageable and always interesting.",
    "Take a Lofton seminar instead",
    "I do NOT recommend it. This class is super theoretical and abstract, which is not obvious at the beginning. Without a WGSS or Religious Studies background, I often found myself lost in the huge questions of the course -- what is gender? what is sexuality? what is ritual? how is sex religious? If those sound like appealing questions to you, maybe go for it. If a ton of dense reading, tough grading (and little advice as to how to improve your grades), and dense theory and a lack of case studies don't sound like your favorite thing ever, DON'T TAKE IT.",
    "Sexuality and Religion was a wonderful class, and I highly recommend it. I learned so much in that class, and the knowledge that I gained will stay with me for the rest of my life. Professor Lofton is amazing, entertaining, and brilliant, and I looked forward to attending lectures each week. Sometimes the class is confusing and really challenging, but Professor Lofton is aware of that and works really hard to guide you through that. There is a lot of reading and many writing assignments, but I loved doing the reading and my writing improved a great deal. This class is really excellent and well worth taking.",
    "Take it. Super interesting. Manageable workload. Great professor. Great TAs.",
    "Grading on the essays is tough. Take it credit\/D if you don't think you'll be able to do all the readings and really engage with the course material.",
    "Amazing. By far the most engaged I've been in a lecture. There are lots of readings and it's easy to fall behind, but the papers are short and manageable.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it. For the love of God and sex, take it.",
    "Survey of sexuality and religion--not what do they believe, but why and how. Interesting case studies and prof lofton is 1. Amazing 2. A fast talker and 3. Good at making contemporary connections. Grading is a little weird (rubrics).",
    "A challenging course in which you are expected to really think for yourself.",
    "A great theoretical study of the history and intersection of the ways in which society talks about sexuality and religion. This class will make you examine and objectify your own experiences, which is really a fascinating experience. Take it.",
    "Shop it. If you like Lofton's style (and I loved it), then take the course. You'll have a great time and learn a lot. If you don't like her style, then this class isn't for you. I had an absolute blast. I'm not sure this is a great class to take Credit\/D, because you really need to have done the readings to do well at all, but I took it for a grade and really enjoyed it.",
    "The readings are fun, fascinating, and totally enjoyable. If you are at all interested in popular culture, or being able to better read the interactions of the world around you, take this course. But it is taught with a particular idea of knowledge in mind, meaning that you won't emerge with names\/dates\/facts at your fingertips, but a stronger sense of how to analyze the world, and even that only if you really take it seriously and try to understand the concepts that can be too easily dismissed as frivolous",
    "This class asks provocative questions about the notions of sexuality and of religion, and delves into the relationship between these two concepts. The examples given in class were very illustrative, and the discussions around them, in combination with the support of the more theoretical texts, were always productive. I'm so glad to have taken this!!",
    "I recommend it only if you are really into the subject material. Be sure to read over the syllabus before you commit to this class. It can be rather challenging.",
    "This class is harder than you're expecting, so I would recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail if you can. Still, I would definitely recommend the class to anyone even remotely interested in the material.",
    "This class will make you want to talk about the subject matter outside of class. It actually infiltrates your life and challenges you to think and challenges you to think differently. I'm really glad that I took it.",
    "Literally the most amazing class in this university-- will change how you think about society, your life, sex, religion, your friends, your relationships. Take this class, could not recommend it strongly enough.Professor Lofton is the best professor in this university. It is worth going to her office hours and talking to her! She cares so much about her classes.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. While this course will not be offered for the next three years, it is easily the best course I have taken at Yale and I cannot imagine having completed my freshman year without it. The course makes you question all your assumptions and provides you with a rich discursive framework within which to understand yourself and the rich relational world surrounding you. One piece of advice: take the course with a friend so you can talk about the themes and examples outside of class. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll quickly find that Foucault, and other class themes, will influence how you think about a much wider array of questions.",
    "I would suggest this class to pretty much anyone, although it might soon become one of the most challenging courses you have taken at Yale.",
    "Take it with Credit D Fail if you have no prior experience in American Studies\/ Gender Studies.",
    "If you are okay with limited structure and you want to think of the world in new ways with not much work, take this class.",
    "Don't take it, not as an intro class, at least. It might work if you have enough of a history background to fill in the gaps; that said, there are a lot of gaps.",
    "Audit this class or take it Credit\/D. The ideas presented are interesting, but can be really difficult to follow and frustrating for someone who has never studied Foucauldian thought before.",
    "Take it!! Kathryn Lofton is incredible. I had never taken a WGSS class before, and it expanded my thinking a lot \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially being in section with WGSS and American Studies majors. Take it, you won't regret it.",
    "If you are at all interested in sexuality or religion, and want to take an introductory WGSS class, this is a great one. If you're a seasoned wgss veteran, take it just to hang out with k.lofton every week! It was a great class to take credit\/d.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing. It is hard to fully describe what this class does, but it definitely changed the way I think about a lot of things, even outside of the class. To start, it taught me how to be a scholar. We read a lot of pretty challenging readings, especially Foucault, but there was a moment when everything just clicked and made so much sense. Though it took a while to get to that point, and I reread Foucault many times, when I finally understood the book, it applied to so many things outside of the classroom. Professor Lofton is such a passionate teacher and has really crafted the class in a clever way. I will remember a lot of her quotes because she is a great speaker. This class is a lot of work, but it was definitely worth it. I ended up taking the class credit\/d and still doing a good amount of work, but for me it was almost more worth it to take it this way because I got to learn the material for what it was instead of worrying about being graded on it. No matter what your major is, take this class!",
    "Sexuality and Religion was my favorite course at Yale. Hands down.I took it on a whim as a 5th class and ended up focusing on it more than any other. I liked doing the readings and writing the essays, because they were so interesting, relevant, and plainly fun. This is a class where you have to suspend your assumptions about the world and be open to new theories about why things are the way they are. It's about so much more than Sexuality and Religion, it is about leadership, family, charisma, love, community, friendship, education, etc. I really look at the world a different way because of this class.Kathryn Lofton is amazing. Her reputation rightly proceeds her, as she is one of the most gifted teachers I've ever had. Her lectures are like performances and I looked forward to them regularly.Seriously, take this class. You won't regret it."
