    "While I very much enjoyed this class, I think the material covered could have been a series of lectures rather than an entire class; and that the class could have been asked to engage with the material a bit more. Rather, we all sat back on our heels and listened to stories from the 60s through today. Leon and Tom are not the most direct and efficient lecturers, and their lectures could have been more structured. Additionally, I feel like the course was often quite repetitive. If this course were to be offered again, I would suggest it be entirely focused on case law; or that it really look deeply at today's political system and discuss legitimate pathways to improvement.",
    "This class often felt as though it lacked structure and organization, but the topics covered were still incredibly important and beneficial to those of us interested in U.S. policy. If you can hang in there with an unstructured lecture-based seminar, it's worth it.",
    "I really cherish my opportunity to be able to attend this class under Leon and Thomas, the writers of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. I feel that in a way the baton of responsibility to protect the environment and the wellfare of people has been passed down from them to us. I feel incredibly honored to take this class and to converse with them. I have tried my best to engage in class and to deliver my final presentation and paper, though the amount of information I have learned is only the tip of the iceberg to the vast and rich sea of knowledge and stories that will take my life time to discover. I am very satisfied with this class. I believe more than a class, Leon and Thomas are serving as models of inspiration for me and my peers.",
    "I think that this was a very good course, although it perhaps could have been shorter. I felt like we ran out of things to talk about towards the end. I also was very disappointed with the final written assignment. I thought that we were going to be able to choose our own paper topics, and was looking forward to that."

    "They offered a practical guide of how policy is made, which is very valuable for folks who don't have experience in policy-making.",
    "Leon and Tom are incredibly knowledgeable, from a personal perspective, about the CAA and CWA process and legislation. Their ability to remember actors and activities is incredible.",
    "The unbelievable wealth of knowledge and experience that Leon and Tom have - nobody should pass up an opportunity to learn from people who have been in the trenches of environmental policy the way these two have.",
    "See above.",
    "The best aspect of the course is that the invaluable experience and knowledge of the instructors in the federal government and about the relevant environmental laws were made during the time that they worked on drafting those laws.",
    "Having the opportunity to hear about the formation of the original U.S. environmental statutes.",
    "The stories told by Leon and Tom were fascinating. I gained the most from some of their tangential stories and comments."

   "comments": [
    "The course could have benefited from some additional structure--so that it was clear to students what was being covered in class.",
    "Addressed this above, but the course needs direction; more material; a focus on the present; or a restructuring to provide a more in-depth exploration of case law (for a purpose) -- the course as is is worth, in my opinion, max 2 credits.",
    "The wandering, anecdotal-heavy, and occasionally hard-to-follow flow of the course could probably be addressed with some time spent at the beginning of each class discussing a roadmap for that lecture and the main concepts that Tom and Leon wish students to grasp. Slightly more time devoted to discussion at the end of each class would also help with thus (but I caution this class from moving too far away from a lecture-style because I think that actually worked quite well).",
    "Three hours was too long for this course.",
    "Would have been good to have more purposeful discussion and Q&A sessions. Also was often difficult to follow lectures, discussion went many different directions at once.",
    "I would have appreciated more structure to this class. I often felt like it was more story-time than a structured lesson about a particular topic. I could have used stronger wrap-ups as we moved through different topics, as well as framework within which these stories could be told."

Otherwise, while the stories told were interesting, I'm not sure they shed much light on how to effect politics today; rather, they cast light on what is, in my mind, irreparably broken in our political system.",

    "This course helped me learn about all of the underlying pieces that contribute to the passing of important environmental legislation, especially those pieces that might not be discussed in a more textbook based course. The course showed how legislation is passed through the first-hand knowledge of Leon and Tom, which was a unique experience."

Leon and Tom are incredibly accomplished and it was an honor to get to learn from their experience.",
