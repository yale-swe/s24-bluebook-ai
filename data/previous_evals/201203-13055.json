    "Recommended! A perfect class to take, especially Cr\/D\/Fail.",
    "I would recommend this class if you really enjoy building\/creating things and are willing to put in the outside hours.",
    "I would not recommend it. Julian does not have the teaching skills to provide a great woodworking class, but if you can bear through that, then this is an ok class. Once things get rolling and you get a feel for woodwork, then it becomes a very relaxing experience when you need to get away from all your other work. There's a lot of outside of class time that needs to be put in to this class so that you can succeed. Do not expect to finish your work only using class time, it will not happen.",
    "Absolutely! It's a lot of fun and you learn a lot of great skills. If you're not an art major, it's very refreshing to be able to take courses different from the norm--it stretches your mind in new and different ways."
