    "A (very comprehensive!) understanding of German history between 1871 and present.",
    "I learned how to make historical arguments, how to integrate sources, how to ask good historical questions, and, of course, I learned a ton of German history. Couldn't have asked for more!",
    "I learned how to make cross-history connections, how to evaluate both primary and secondary sources, and how to construct my own historical arguments.",
    "The course was a great introduction to German history. It was very comprehensive with its topic choices, and the readings were thought-provoking. Professor Allens lectures were impeccably prepared, and I am happy I had a chance to take a course of hers.",
    "So much! Not as obscure a course as you might think, incredibly interesting and well taught. Encourages you to be a better and more critical writer.",
    "This was my first course on German history and I learned all about German history! In addition to that, I got a lot of good practice in improving my writing."

    "This is one of the very best courses I've taken in three years at Yale, hands-down. Jennifer Allen is a phenomenal professor she held the entire class rapt all lecture long, every lecture. She was very accessible (in office hours, after class, etc.) and I think strikes a perfect balance between making information digestible and also keeping discourse sophisticated. I'm really interested in Germany and 20th-century history, so this class was perfect for me, but even if that's not your particular interest, this class is still super worth taking.",
    "The pacing of the class sometimes felt a little odd. Some decades in German history received a cursory treatment, while others were more focused. Sometimes the cultural history felt lacking, and a bit too broad-strokes (still, I'm really interested in cultural history so it might have just been my expectations were higher). The strengths of this course are many. It might be the best taught history lecture at Yale. People say it's a lot of reading, but if anything I thought it could have been heavier. I often wished there had been a textbook to accompany the secondary and primary sources each week, something we could have dipped into to get a further understanding of the historical facts. The lectures were excellent, but they're lectures, so if you miss a bit of information or aren't paying attention, you miss out.",
    "The course is a really comprehensive introduction to Greman history, and Professor Allen really tried to make the content accessible to those who dont know German or general European History. Her lecture speed is a bit high though, and it does require a certain level of time commitment to the course with frequent assignments\/quizzes.",
    "The best part of this class was lecture. It was always well organized and so engaging that time just flew by. Professor Allen is great. I really don't know of any ways that it could be improved."

    "I highly, highly recommend taking this class. This is one of the very best courses I've taken in three years at Yale, hands-down. Jennifer Allen is a phenomenal professor she held the entire class rapt all lecture long, every lecture. She was very accessible (in office hours, after class, etc.) and I think strikes a perfect balance between making information digestible and also keeping discourse sophisticated. I'm really interested in Germany and 20th-century history, so this class was perfect for me, but even if that's not your particular interest, this class is still super worth taking.",
    "This is a fantastic class. Perhaps the best history course I've taken at Yale. Anyone interested in the nation state, in contemporary European politics and culture, or in asking historical questions take this class! Professor Allen is a superb scholar, and she cares deeply about your learning. She was very accessible to meet outside of class, and seems to be destined for great things at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend HIST 254! The lectures were incredibly engaging, and Prof. Allen is singularly amazing (and she is known to occasionally provide treats on quiz days). It is a decent bit of work, however, and the penalty for late work is rather harsh (procrastinators, beware). However, Prof. Allen is understanding and will work with you if you are struggling. If you consider yourself a good writer, the papers should not be too hard, though. In all honesty, this ranks among the best classes I have taken at Yale; in particular, the music at the beginning of class helped to immerse me in the world of the period we were studying. German History, although perhaps a niche topic, does have many parallels with and implications the world of today, and is well worth studying.",
    "Anyonewho is interested in learning German history should take this course! Excellent introduction to the topic. A chance to learn from Professor Allen on its own should probably be enough to recommend the course, too.",
    "Yes! This was definitely one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale. It is challenging but certainly worth it.",
    "Yes, this is one of very few history courses I've taken at Yale and I enjoyed it a lot!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The subject material is fascinating and, more importantly, it is so well taught that it would be a shame to miss out on it."
