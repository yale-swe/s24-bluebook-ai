    "I did my directed research in Professor Kristina Olson's Social Cognitive Development Lab and loved it. It is a pretty big time commitment, so make sure you can handle the weekly lab hours and lab meeting before taking it on. Really great way to get hands on experience with psychology research.",
    "You get to play with monkeys! Enough said! Not a ton of actual written work -- the biggest commitment is just time. Your project requires three 2 hour blocks per week, and one observation block per week plus the weekly lab meetings. But honestly, coming in was something I looked forward to each week, as it released stress instead of adding stress.",
    "The class is basically just research for credit in a psych lab.",
    "Definitely do directed research. It's really fun.",
    "It's what you make of it! Obviously every student does a different project in Cap Lab so everyone has different experiences but I think almost (if not all) participants love their semester. Plus the capuchins are all really adorable (except Felix, who is not my fave)",
    "definitely recommend if you are interested in the research",
    "Great way to gain research experience and carry out your own research ideas.",
    "Directed Reading is what you make of it. It can be amazing because you don't have any official assignments, you can set your own pace, and you aren't bound by deadlines. If you are a self-starter, this is a great way to hone in on a specific research topic without having to cater to the pre-determined topics of a class. You can make your lab work fit into your schedule and easily complete your senior requirement.",
    "Yes!",
    "What you make of it.",
    "Doing your own research is great.",
    "Directed Research with Laurie Santos is fantastic",
    "Absolutely take this class.",
    "Definitely if they are interested in doing hands on research",
    "Do it. I think it's great to have an opportunity to do real benchwork in undergrad and receive credit. You gain a lot of skills that are directly applicable to your future work (if you should decide to go the grad school or medical school route), which is rare in a theory based liberal arts education. You also have freedom to choose your area of interest and expand in that area. I think the experience is what you make of it.",
    "Great! Love the YPEP lab!",
    "Loved the class. Learned about the importance of being independent and conducting research. Everyone should take it.",
    "Psychology 492 is a great class to apply what you've learned in previous psychology courses. I loved my experiment and can't wait to continue working on it next term.",
    "yes - lots of research experience gained",
    "It is a good opportunity to understand what a psychology lab looks like, and what happens within. Take directed research if you want to more about getting into the research field of Psychology - make sure you select a lab that is studying something that interests you.",
    "Yes, if you want to carry out an experiment and be more creative then you should definitely do it.",
    "It's an opportunity to get involved in psychology research and see what that process is like. You learn that it can be really fun but also much slower and more riddled with potential problems than you would expect when you see results nicely summarized in a journal.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "It was research for credit. I'd recommend it if you find a lab whose work you're interested in.",
    "Really great to get to work so closely with someone so knowledgeable. Every undergraduate should try to do some research at some point.",
    "Do this if you want good, practical research experience. This'll be very handy if you're looking to go into a field of research in psychology.",
    "Do it! I've learned more from independent research than I have in any other class",
    "If you care about psychology this is a great way to begin to learn about what goes into all the work behind the scenes in studies. So for those interested in the field, definitely.",
    "varies based on lab and PI. mine couldnt be better",
    "This pretty much depend on who is your supervisor. Personally, I was very lucky and thus found PSYC 492 extremely insightful. It gave me the possibility to do something that I find personally (!) interesting. With such intrinsic motivation I also didn't mind the hefty workload that my empirical project entailed. I would do it again.",
    "Great opportunity to get credit for the research you do. Pick a lab whose topic you care about and make sure your P.I. gives you ideas about the topic of your paper, especially if you want to use that paper to fulfill part of your senior requirement.",
    "Required for seniors obtaining a BS, and very worthwhile. Your experience totally depends on your advisor of course, but in the end you'll write a long paper and gain some valuable experience.",
    "Yes - definitely do it. Just be prepared to organize yourself and stick to your own schedule. No one will be on top of you to make sure that your work gets done.",
    "Definitely - I really enjoyed working in the lab. Everyone is really friendly and they do their best to make our tasks fun. I also got a lot of input on the actual research process. I got to play a big part in crafting new studies, and learned a lot about what actual psych research looks like. It was great!",
    "The work was straightforward and we made so much scientific progress! The course depends on your lab, PI, and Grad Student, of course. I really enjoyed working in Schafe Lab :)",
    "This course is really whatever you make it--you have to find a good advisor\/project, but if you have a clear vision it's really awesome.",
    "really depends on which grad student you end up working for, but i was working with paula in dovidio's lab and she's the bomb, really nice and doing very cool work on overweight stereotypes if youre interseted in that!",
    "I'd recommend that all Psych majors take at least 1 full lab credit before senior year. It'll really take the pressure off of writing a 40 page paper come senior year....You'll thank yourself, I promise. And in general, taking a lab in the psychology department is usually fun and is something that you'll want to talk to your friends about all the time, and your friends will want to listen - psych is so applicable to everyday life."
