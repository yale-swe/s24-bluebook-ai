   "comments": [
    "This seminar was just not very good. Rather than drawing on his vast, fearsome knowledge of world mythology and literature to inform and steer good discussions, Professor Gabriel was a complete pushover, and let super-lazy woodwork seniors slack off and make obviously off-base super-generalizations unsupported by evidence. I have something of an interest in comparative mythology, and expected a chance to really dig deep into the similarities and differences of world mythology and epic across cultures. Instead, the sort of older student who just wants and easy A without reading\/working flocked to Professor Gabriel like moths to a flame. If you're not earnestly interested in the stuff on this syllabus, please just go straight to Woad's and stop wasting the interested students' time. If you want to get a lot of Professor Gabriel, you're going to have to pull it out of him by constantly asking high-level, specific, textually-based questions, and you'll have to fend off the idiots, since he will treat everyone's contributions as equally valid.",
    "Take it. Take it even if you've never heard of some of the works on the syllabus. Take it even if you're not a fast reader or a great writer. This class will make you think and ask questions you never thought you would ask. I had never taken a Lit class before this one, and I felt quite intimidated at first, but I really did learn a lot this semester.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. You discuss unique and interesting topics, read good books, and the work load is definitely manageable.",
    "I thought it was an excellent experience. The books were interesting, Professor Gabriel was very engaging, and the other students in the seminar made this class very enjoyable. Overall, it's a great class if want to read a lot of great books that you may not have heard of.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. A but heavy on the reading but the texts are all fun and often bizarre to the point where you do not feel overwhelmed by the amount of pages. Would recommend to anyone interested in literature as long as Gabriel is teaching the course. He's a fantastic guy.",
    "Yes take the course!",
    "Yes."
