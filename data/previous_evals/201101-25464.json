    "We ran low on digital storage space multiple times, and ran into file sharing issues by saving the entire classes' projects to one server.",
    "It would be very helpul if there could be one or several completed drawing sets made available for reference. We relied very heavily on a CD set that was owned by one of the team members, and I think we would have had a much more difficult time had that not been available.The software training, also, needs some fine-tuning. As we were expected to do most of our work in Revit, the success or failure hinged on how willing we were to struggle with the program to complete the assignments to the required standards. As it were, we spent more time trying to troubleshoot Revit than thinking about our building. There fore, I would suggest that in the future, Revit instruction should proceed as follows:1) John Herridge's 2-day tutorial should be condensed into one day, and be taught all at once or in two morning sessions (Saturday and Sunday) He should work to focus his presentation on only those things that one needs to know in the first two weeks of class (setting up the work flow, sheets, labels, etc) and not go into rendering, structure, or mechanical. There should also be a hands-on element to this tutorial (the second day), where these skills are reinforced through practice. Basically, students should be instructed to set up their projects right there in class, under the watchful eye of an instructor, and ask questions as they arise. This would help eliminate a lot of the frustration and difficulties that people had at the onset with Revit.2) the Revit assistance that we received at the end of the semester should come much earlier, and consistently \u0096 weekly would be great, and if that is not possible, then bi-weekly. This may indeed be more instrumental to the course than the weekly lectures so long as the course continues on its present Revit trajectory.3) libraries of drawing symbols that are built by offices over years should somehow be made accessible to students.4) lastly, the graphic representation requirements should first be tested by the team of instructors and Revit professionals to make sure that there is a direct way to achieve the results that they are seeking. This would ensure that there would be answers to students' questions when they arise. We, on the other hand, were asked to blaze our own trail through the convoluted visibility graphics settings in Revit."
