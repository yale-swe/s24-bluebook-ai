   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. There really isn't any subject remotely scientific that could not benefit from the techniques learned in this class. People should learn that even huge \/ ugly \/ high-dimensional data sets can be understood with the right approach.",
    "Great course if you're interested in Complex Systems.",
    "I would recommend it anybody studying graph theory, dynamics, complex systems.",
    "This course is _excellent_ for anyone who wants to work in any field of science. It's in the G&G department, but all that means is that more of the applications will be geophysics-related; the stuff you learn is applicable to all sorts of quantitative work. The workload is very reasonable - attendance, problem sets (with programming), and a final exam. I heartily recommend this course to all interested parties."

   "comments": [
    "Planning to do research in the field of computational neuroscience, how could a class on complex systems not be helpful! I would gladly take a second course if it were offered, but the first class offered a broad enough survey of techniques to make me feel significantly more comfortable with my large and somewhat ungainly data sets of neurons.",
    "My senior project was related to complex systems, and this course worked wonderfully in giving structure to my research."
