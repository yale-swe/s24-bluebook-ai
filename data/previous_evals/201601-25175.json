    "I think this is a good course if you want the chance to read some foundational texts in critical theory. The focus is definitely on the philosophical side of the Frankfurt School. The subject material is pretty dense sometimes, but became more accessible over the course of the semester with practice reading and analyzing the texts. If you're not very interested in the subject matter this course would probably be painful. Professor Angermann was very accessible.",
    "This was a good course. The texts we read were fascinating and I left feeling like I had some of the main ideas of critical theory and how critical theorists approach problems under my command. It is very textual and the papers enabled us to do close readings of the texts that I felt were very useful. Professor Angermann cares about his students and helped us understand the material outside of class and also was very receptive to students in class. Overall, a great experience. I also liked that he chose a syllabus with many excellent political not just aesthetic texts (the course was taught in the lit department last year, and apparently focused on aesthetics more than we did). The only sad part is that he is not teaching this course again at Yale, so if you are reading this you are likely missing out!"
