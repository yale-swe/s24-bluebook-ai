   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed Global Journalism and National Identities. I thought that, on a broad scale, it provided an invaluable opportunity to assess the future of journalism and the future of the public in the digital age. It also allowed us as students to better understand the value of the education we've received during our time at Yale. I don't think I've ever taken a course that has shown me the value of liberal arts more than this one. The readings were incredibly accessible, and the class discussions were generally fairly interesting.",
    "This is a fascinating course about the role of media in democracy. It poses theoretical questions in a modern context and allows the students to engage in a deep, meaningful dialogue about elements of the course most interesting to them. In this sense, it is a great course that I highly recommend. But only take this if you are really interested because it requires a great deal of reading (you can't get away with skipping out) and classesv2 posting. If you're still interested, this is the right course for you (and Professor Sleeper's mentorship will be invaluable).",
    "This class is only for the worthiest. Or the most interested. At least that's what it'll seem like. The material is pretty interesting though. Make an effort to think and you should be alright. An interest in journalism and abstract ideas is best, as well as a strong sense of civic-mindedness. Sleeper talks about the Yale ethos a lot.",
    "It is a class in which you will learn about liberal-democratic public sphere and journalism's role in it.",
    "Syllabus gets a bit redundant but great for people who want a intro to democratic theory and contemporary political theory"
