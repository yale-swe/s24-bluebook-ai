   "comments": [
    "It was a very manageable and interesting course. As a non-MCDB major premed, I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class to any pre-med friends of mine because it is one of the view classes focused on the human body and medicine at Yale. We need more of these!",
    "ReproBio underwent a bit of a transition this last year, as Mary Klein no longer co-teaches the course. Josh Johnson is now the primary instructor, though the format of the class has not changed much (though the accompanying lab is very different and arguably much improved). The class is team-taught, meaning that most lecturers only give 1-2 of the various lectures that students listen to over the course of the semester. Obviously this can be a good or bad thing, depending on the lecturers who are presenting. I can say that on the whole, I really did enjoy most of the lectures (shoutout to Drs. Minkin, Gariepy, Guess, Sakkas, and Taylor for having particularly good ones). However, others were less good or organized (Dr. Kankel's lectures for instance, while very informative don't use powerpoints and thus are fairly difficult to study after the fact). On the whole though, I did enjoy going to lecture and felt like I learned a lot about reproductive biology throughout the course. The course workload is very manageable. There are 3 non-cumulative midterm exams and no final, each of which is drawn completely from the lecture slides. Questions are extremely fair, if a bit on the easy side. There is also an additional section once a week, but only MCDB majors are required to attend said section. Not being MCDB, I don't know much about what goes on there, but I believe it's more of a primary literature discussion with one of the TFs. Take the course if you're looking for a fun, interesting, and fairly easy bio class that you're going to enjoy. Pre-meds and MCDB majors especially should look out for the lab as a potential option, as I think that it's one of the better bio labs currently being offered at Yale. People interested particularly in reproductive science, OB\/Gyn, reproductive endocrinology, or reproductive technologies will get a lot out of the course, and don't confuse the easiness of exam questions with a lack of rigorous lectures. Much more content is covered in the course than actually is tested.",
    "Very cool introduction to Reproductive Biology. They bring in different lecturers from the medical school for each topic, and these people are real experts in the field who do pretty awesome research. It's a great set-up for a course. Would highly recommend, especially if you find the topic interesting.",
    "Even though I was taking this class Credit D\/Fail, I really enjoyed a lot of the content taught in this class. A lot of the material was relevant to real life, such as details of in-vitro fertilization and contraception methods. There is only one mid-term and a final, with section that is only mandatory for MCDB students. It is a very chill class, if you need an MCDB credit I recommend this one!",
    "A great course taught by many different professors. It keeps it interesting have a different lecturer for different topics and some lecturers are better than others. The course material is fascinating, would definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you're interested in women's health or reproductive health. I did and I came away understanding a lot more about these fields. I would not recommend taking this course if you're just trying to get an easy science or elective credit you could probably skip class and read the slides and take the exams but you would be getting absolutely nothing out of it. Some of these lecturers are truly phenomenal and it's really worth seeing them.",
    "A great course! I really liked that the class was team-taught (we got to learn from so many different doctors and researchers!), and I enjoyed the papers in section. Lots of memorization is required for the exams, but I'd say it's definitely worth it.",
    "Take this course! The professors are fantastic doctors in their fields and the way students are tested is very fair. Light course load but fascinating material. I would highly recommend attending all lectures because the teaching style of each lecturer varies.",
    "I would recommend taking the class if your interested in OBGYN but otherwise the course isn't really worth it."
