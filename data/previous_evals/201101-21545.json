   "comments": [
    "Yes if you need it. Not for fun",
    "Math120 is pretty interesting, definitely better than Math115.However, its still a calculus course. Don't expect incredible lectures or extremely engaging material.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Unnecessarily difficult and confusing.",
    "Take it if you really have to. If you are premed, take the ENAS course. This course is a lot of work and you have to be prepared to work harder than you ever did.",
    "Math 120 is not as difficult as most people say it is but it does get much harder in the end. If you do all your homework, though, and you make sure you are on top of the material, you will have no problem. Gupta is a great teacher and he is very accessible!",
    "Learn how to do double and triple integrals in this course using different methods. Also learn about vectors and vector operations, as well as different coordinate systems.This is not a super-easy course, but it isn't too hard neither. Attending lectures is optional, since all of the content is pretty much covered in the textbook.Some professors are very good. I liked Subhojoy Gupta quite a bit, and I would not have attended lecture if he weren't teaching. Lectures were not extremely interesting, but did manage to pack a lot of information in a format that was easy to absorb.",
    "Yes, if you need it for any requirements. Otherwise, maybe not - Subhojoy is great, but I'm not sure that the material would be interesting enough to motivate someone to take this class if they didn't need to. If you do take the class, TAKE IT WITH SUBHOJOY, HE IS THE BEST. In terms of teaching ability, he isn't that far above the other TAs, but the sheer force of his personality made me love the class, and love math. I definitely wasn't a math person, but Subhojoy's sense of humor and willingness to help during office hours (I went just about every week) really made me enjoy math (to my disbelief) and do well in class. I woke up at 5:30am on math preregistration day to get in line just so I could have Subhojoy, and it was SO worth it. Math defintely would have been miserable without him. He also brought snacks to review sessions and is such a funny person.",
    "Subhojoy is an AMAZING teacher. If you have to take 120, take it with him. I think he makes an extremely difficult class manageable. Math 120 is very difficult. However if you are good at math and have a background in calculs, the class is quite manageable!",
    "If you are interested in math I would highly recommend this class. This is a big jump from Calc 2 but it makes it all the more enjoyable. This course truly allows you to think about Calculus in three dimensions. And being able to think and solve this problems is very self gratifying. If you did well in either Math 115 or Calc BC in high school you will be prepared for this class.",
    "Math 120 is a standard multivariable calculus class. It was a good class if you had to take it. If you aren't interested in pursuing higher level math then maybe avoid it if you don't want to deal with the tricky aspects but overall I would recommend it.",
    "Take it if you need to. Take this with Subhojoy! He is an amazing math instructor! His notes are very helpful, and he is always ready to help students.",
    "It is multivariable calculus. Similar to 115 in difficulty--material is not overwhelmingly difficult, tests are challenging.",
    "Take it if you need it for a major you are interested in just in case and take out of curiosity because the material is interesting.",
    "The instructor makes all the difference so if you can get a good one (such as Gupta) you should definitely take it.",
    "It's a very difficult course. Don't take it unless you love multivariable or it's required.",
    "A fun and engaging math class. Workload is decent, and grading is pretty fair. The only problem might be that sometimes the course materials get a bit too abstract. Also, definitely try to get Gupta\u0092s section if you are still considering. Apart from Michael Frame, he is also very knowledgeable, clear in his thinking and explaining, and very friendly and approachable as well. He provided us with numerous documents on practice questions, summaries in class as well as useful strategies (the most useful thing!) which all make him very supportive. Overall, a very good math experience at Yale.",
    "Indeed, take it with Subhojoy",
    "It is very easy the first half of the semester. The second half is horrible.",
    "I recommend Math 120 for students who have already taken calculus, but need a higher math to fill a requirement. It was challenging, but the material was not absurdly hard to keep up with. Attending office hours, consistently reviewing material, and scheduling appointments with the professor helps so much in this course. Even though I felt I learned a lot and did well though, this wasn't necessarily be reflected in the grade. Test grades were generally low to mediocre. The amount of material learned and the contribution to my math foundation was significant, not the grade.",
    "Take it if you want to be owned by the tests.I took it because I thought I wanted to be an Econ major and therefore needed 1 math course.I guess if you're good at test-taking or studying, you'll be fine...",
    "class was tough for me, but it's definitely doable for most people with a solid calcaulus background",
    "Difficult class because it's very fast-paced. I learned most of the information on my own with the textbook, or with friends, since the professor's classes were confusing. Office hours with the professor were helpful, but sometimes left me more confused than I was to begin with."
