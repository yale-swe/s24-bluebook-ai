    "I really appreciated learning from people in a variety of fields. Professor Schmidt-Camacho and Professor Pitti also had fantastic comments about everyone's work. It was very helpful to learn from how they facilitated the course.",
    "This working group introduced me to graduate-level collaborative research skills. I learned how to provide constructive feedback to my peers. I strengthened my abilities at primary source analysis and close-readings of seminal theory. Through everyone's shared writings, I learned about the richness and diversity of the field of Latinx Studies. From history, to cultural studies, to urban studies, to history of medicine, I was exposed to many modes of thinking and writing."
