   "comments": [
    "Ancient Greek Masculinities was an excellent class which brought to bear modern gender theory on sources from a variety of time periods and genres in antiquity. It is a must for any student studying gender in any period. I also highly recommend it to any student of Classics who would like a more nuanced understanding of manhood and social constraints in ancient Greece.",
    "This is an excellent course which I would enthusiastically recommend. The material is interesting and well-organized, the professor is outstanding, and the work-load is appropriate. The reading load for each seminar can be as mild or intensive as you make it; Emily provides a long list of secondary literature and asks each student to read whichever one or two articles are most appealing. If you read more, you get more out of the discussion. If you are pressed for time, you can do the minimum and still be fine. You also get to tailor the reading to your interests in this way. Assessment consists of a term paper of 3500-5000 words, a short commentary on a 30-line passage, and a presentation on a topic of your choice.",
    "I would indeed recommend this course. It was a stimulating way to learn both about a broad set of ancient Greek texts and a general body of theory. In particular the course's theme is fresh and engaging."

   "comments": [
    "Although I had worked somewhat on gender in the ancient world before coming to this class, the readings (both ancient and modern) broadened my understanding of the material and offered different ways to apply modern gender theory to ancient material. I had the opportunity to re-articulate my approach to gender theory in my own work, and the feedback I received from the class will be very valuable both in writing a dissertation chapter and in preparing a conference paper for the spring. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work through this material with the input and sensitive readings of others.",
    "This course provided a clear overview of masculinity in the Greek world in a number of contexts. It enriched my understanding of the culture and also provided me with a useful lens with which to view and interpret a lot of Greek literature.",
    "This course opened my eyes to a mode of inquiry into antiquity previously unknown to me. One value of a course such as this is that its theme is widely applicable. Though the course proper has ended, its questions can be put to other texts within the discipline."
