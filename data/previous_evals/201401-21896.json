   "comments": [
    "Most fun 5 day\/week class you will have. Selma really cares about her students and about teaching. We have deep, interesting discussions you would not expect to find in a language class. I loved it!",
    "TAKE IT. Selma is a gem and a beautiful human being. She really cares about you as a person; within the first two weeks, she will know all about you and your interests. She also makes the class a really comfortable place to participate rather than force participation. The class is also structured excellently. You'll gain experience reading more advanced texts and discussing deeper topics, but Selma chooses texts that aren't overwhelmingly long. You'll always have time to read the full text without devoting much time.",
    "Yes, take L4. Portuguese is a delightful language, as you already know if you've gone up through L3. This semester is when it started feeling easy to speak and understand it.",
    "If you take this class with Selma, it will not be your typical language class. This class involves reading an excellent selection of lusophone literature, with extensive class discussion and sufficient grammar review. Selma does an excellent job of teaching the course, and it is significantly more interesting than other L4 courses at Yale.",
    "Definitely take L4! It's similar to L3. The workload's not bad and the readings are really interesting. Very manageable and fun.",
    "If you want to read real literature and use Portuguese to engage in (sometimes philosophical, sometimes practical) discussions, take this class with Selma! Most L4 students already have a good grasp of grammar and vocabulary, and she recognizes that and allows the class move away from formulaic tests."
