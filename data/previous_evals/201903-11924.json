    "Basic knowledge of statistics",
    "I developed skills in general statistic principles such as normal distributions, probability, regression, etc.",
    "Lots of theoretical statistics knowledge.",
    "I received an introduction to statistical concepts, terminology, and methods, and I was exposed to the coding language, R, which most effectively allows for communication and creation of the models that correspond to these topics. I had never taken any statistics course in my life, and I found this one to be an enjoyable introduction to the subject. I hope it will prove to have provided me a solid foundation upon which to base further studies in statistics going forward.",
    "In this course I gained a solid foundation of statistics and data analysis.",
    "A very good knowledge of basic statistics. I thought the material was taught well, and the online lectures were helpful when you couldnt make it to class. Basic knowledge of R.",
    "I developed basic statistical analysis skills and their implementation in R,",
    "I had no pre-knowledge about statistics and this course taught me a lot about intro stats! Really interesting!",
    "I developed an understanding of basic statistics \/ math with statistics.",
    "I gained a decent understanding in the foundations of statistical analysis and R coding."

   "comments": [
    "The second half of the course felt very short and I didn't feel that I gained much mastery over R. I wish we had been taught R throughout the semester rather than only gaining brief familiarity throughout the last weeks. JDRS is a great lecturer, though, and I really appreciated that all of the classes were video captured.",
    "2nd semester learned nothing",
    "The course is well organized. Lots of content on Canvas which makes studying easier.",
    "strength: streamed so very convenient even if I missed lecture weakness: none",
    "Strengths - For the first half, I appreciated that I could watch the lectures online. I also really appreciated how many office hours there are for the course as these helped greatly with doing the problem sets Weaknesses - I really hated using MiniTab!",
    "The class moves incredibly quickly, so it's hard to digest the material.",
    "Once the breakout sections began the engagement and attention to each individual student came which was great.",
    "Strengths: JRDS and Prof Brinda are both great, and really care. For the stats half, videotaped lectures are a godsend (gave me more or less 45 extra minutes on class days NOT spent walking, gave flexibility to \"take class\" at other times, and speeding up\/slowing down the lectures is a great thing to have). For data analysis, Prof Brinda and the ULAs were great. I didn't have ANY coding experience, and felt that I could succeed in the class it's not set up to trip you up. I think learning to code in a lecture setting is hard, though even though we walked through examples that were very similar to the homework, I did have to go to office hours to figure it out (not sure if that's just me or an experience everyone else had). not familiar with other coding classes, so not sure if that's a weakness!",
    "This class was really fun",
    "Teaching was a strength of this course, only weakness that comes to mind is the speed (class moves through material pretty quickly).",
    "Strengths: Could structure and resources (all the office hours, online live lecture, psets etc) Weaknesses: should have better organization. transitioning between topics should be clearer and it seemed very discombobulated.",
    "I enjoyed the flexibility and breadth of this course. Its online lectures (for the first eight weeks, at least) allowed me to be in class and familiarize myself with the concepts on my own time, without feeling the pressure of attending lecture itself if my schedule was too crowded in a given week. I liked the take-home midterms and project format of the final, though they did not provide nearly the challenge that I had expected. Nonetheless, I appreciated the slackened workload that they afforded. I'm no statistics expert, but I get the sense that the first eight weeks of the course covered many of the most fundamental and important topics within the field, and that it provided a good basis for further learning in future classes. I appreciated this, as it was my first exposure to statistics. I feel that the course progressed rather rapidly, which on its own is fine. The pace at which Dr. Reuning-Scherer marches through his slides, however, is too fast for adequate comprehension. Even if I had not found the video lectures more conducive to my schedule, I know that I still would have opted to watch them instead of going to class simply because it's extremely difficult to extract the necessary information from lecture or from the slides in the amount of time afforded by the professor. This may be something to tweak. I also found office hours slightly hectic. I do wish I had taken advantage of them a bit more, but when I did go to them, I found a crowd of students swarming around a TA who couldn't do much besides address everyone at once and go through the problem set basically explaining how to do each problem. I'm not saying this is a bad way to conduct office hours, but it was a bit disorganized and different from other office hours I've been to.",
    "A strength & weakness is that the course is live streamed and recordings are posted on Canvas. This is super nice because you never have to go to class, but also can lead to not keeping up with the material (which does move at a fast pace). Also, it's nice having the exams online, but it can be frustrating when you hear of a decent number of students cheating.",
    "Strengths are that it is very thorough course, it breaks off into smaller sections so that you can study a subject you are more interested in. Weaknesses: sometime the information could be overwhelming.",
    "The overall structure of the class is very conducive for an intro stats course.",
    "It was really good! I loved that it was being recorded so you could easily go through all the topics in your own tempo. I also really enjoyed the second half learning R.",
    "The class has strong sections that we go into... but I believe that the main course alfor the first couple of weeks is a bit more quick.",
    "This course is organized horribly. I was shocked to see how difficult it was for the TA's and professor to accommodate my needs when it came to the scheduling of office hours and my technological limitations. If you don't have a laptop that can run the programs, going to office hours will be impossible since most of them must are not done by hand."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is a very solid intro stats class. It's well-taught and the TAs were generally pretty good. I just wish we used a program other than Minitab. I would like to gain programming skills but was not confident enough to teach myself SPSS or anything.",
    "Maybe.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend. Stats courses are very useful and applicable to the real world.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Especially if you have no stats experience from high school, this class is perfect for you.",
    "Yes if you want to learn about statistics and don't know much!",
    "Great basic introduction to stats and programming, highly recommend for someone who wants to see if stats is for them.",
    "Yes, if you need a QR or are generally interested in learning some very basic R.",
    "Yes.. good intro class",
    "Definitely!! Even if you just need a refresher on basic knowledge of stats",
    "Yes. Very valuable for understanding the nature of things.",
    "Yes, if you are in anyway interested in statistics or would like a baseline of knowledge for your industry, then this class will suit you.",
    "Yes. it serves as a good introduction to statistics.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student who hopes to attain a preliminary understanding of statistical concepts prior to advancing to higher-level courses. I'm not sure how I feel about the branching out into specific discipline-oriented groups for the final five weeks. I learned a bit about coding in R in S&DS 106, but I do feel that I might have been better served continuing for the final five weeks with JDRS.",
    "Yes! This is a great way to dip your feet in the world of S&DS at Yale. For me, it confirmed my hope to get a certificate in the area.",
    "Yes, this knowledge will be helpful in the future, regardless of what profession I enter.",
    "Yes, it's a good base for those who don't have a strong statistics background.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn intro to stats this is an amazing course. JDSR is a great teacher that really knows how to thoroughly explain concepts.",
    "I would recommend it as an interesting QR class",
    "If you can get your hands on a loaner laptop from the IT office in the lower level of Bass library, this course won't be so bad. However, I strongly discourage you from taking the course if your laptop can't run the statistical software I mentioned earlier. Otherwise, use the course as a replacement for AP Stats andin the case of S&DS 106an introduction to R coding."
