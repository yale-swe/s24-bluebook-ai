There are just so many ways to do ethnography, some more effective\/affective than others, but the cool thing was just seeing how and why certain approaches were used by the various authors for their respective narratives. I feel like my writing got a lot better too, and I just held myself to higher standards because of the brilliance of Kate and fellow classmates."

It might be good to have one last week where a reading is not assigned, just to do a review\/tour of the arc of the class and to wrap things up. I felt like I was left with so many ends that I can\/need to chase down in the future (a good thing, though frustrating in the moment)."

    "Absolutely. We had a wonderful group of people (mostly grad students and 3 seniors) - seriously I wish I could be everyone's friends, or at least hear them talk about their individual projects or get a reading list from them or something. Discussions were THAT good. You could probably skate by in the class if you just brought one thing to class to talk about (each person shares their thoughts each week, after Kate opens with some of hers) but you'll find yourself wanting to put in that extra work and engagement with the texts. The texts are also pretty awesome, particularly the order in which we read them."
