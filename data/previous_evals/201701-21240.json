   "comments": [
    "Solid groundwork in creating drawings using tone and contour in a variety of media.",
    "Definitely a great way to improve drawing skills, both drawing the figure and drawing from life generally. The amount of time spent working from the model is invaluable.",
    "I learned how to draw the figure.",
    "I learned how to draw people",
    "I learned various methods for recording observation of the figure using drawing media. I learned new ways of thinking about rendering subjects, detaching myself from unconditionally favoring conventional or academic drawing methods! And learned to pursue compelling patterns in my own conceptual or mark making practice.",
    "Portraits. Proportions Producing work fast Understanding the symbolism of female nudes Drawing nude",
    "Drawing figures, proficiency and some abstraction.",
    "Good practice with drawing the body.",
    "I learned a lot about working with different materials, using tone and value, making compositions, drawing people in particular, and looking at things in general.",
    "I learned how to figure draw, using traditional mediums like ink and charcoal."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths There is a lot of freedom in content and style of work Weaknesses Not a varied enough range of models More feedback on homework would be helpful",
    "Overall, I think this course accomplishes what it sets out to do. My one critique would be that when we do crits we often ran over time, and I think the class would have been better if it were slightly smaller. But again, the course was great for improving drawing skills, the final project was enjoyable, and the work wasn't too demanding.",
    "I think that the course was great because Sophy encouraged us to explore our personal strengths and weaknesses. She really wanted us to develop our own style. However, I wish that we received more formal instruction on drawing the human anatomy. I wanted more focus on proportions.",
    "The course is strong because it gives students a lot of agency in pursuing an exploration of drawing and the figure. It also gives great opportunities for studying the live nude with swell constructive feedback. It is limited when students don't bring energy or outside of class effort.",
    "More regular feedback once she accesses level and what we want out of class. Awesome class, learned so much.",
    "Strengths: given how large a range of skills in the class, remarkably good at catering to each student, many showed massive improvements Weaknesses: hard to think of any for such a hands-off structure",
    "I really enjoyed the life drawing sessions. And I thought there was a nice combination of practical classes and more theoretical classes (I mean looking at slides and talking about ideas). It would have been nice to draw more from the model. Also, this might be particular to me, because I didn't have as much drawing experience, but I really would have liked more instruction in the fundamentals of drawing figures--like anatomy and things like that",
    "Drawing from live models was one of the best parts of the course. I really appreciated all the practice we got from observing real people. I also really enjoyed the trips to the YUAG and Beinecke to look at old prints and sketchbooks kept by historical artists.",
    "I thought we were exposed to a fairly wide array of materials and techniques. The only way I thought it could be improved is if we could have gotten more models in the latter half of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but bear in mind that you will get out of this course whatever you put in. There is no huge incentive to work hard in this class and the professor is very relaxed about homework, which makes it enjoyable but not necessarily very intensive.",
    "I'd certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in improving their drawing skills.",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "Yes loved the use of models and media exploration and freedom!",
    "GREAT CLASS. Non art major, loved it got plenty out of it, but didn't die of stress\/too many assignments. Fair syllabus with fair alterations.",
    "Yes, this is the class I work on when I'm procrastinating on other work. It's art therapy!",
    "Yes - take it if you want to learn how to draw the body. It wasn't just a weekly drawing session with a model, but there were field trips to Beinecke, the morgue (optional) and fun projects like a huge mural. The class was relaxed, but I wish it wasn't my 5th class so I could put more time into it. Sophy is amazing and gives very clear feedback, and also great recommendations for where to look for inspiration.",
    "Figure drawing was a lot of fun. It was really nice to draw from a model for a couple of hours each week. The workload outside of class was pretty minimal, but the more time you spend on it the better you get probably. There wasn't too much structure, though, and it's hard to gauge how much I learned over the course of the semester. I would have liked more instruction in the fundamentals of drawing figures--like anatomy and things like that",
    "This is a great class, and Sophy is amazing! You should take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is either a beginner or at an intermediate level with figure drawing."
