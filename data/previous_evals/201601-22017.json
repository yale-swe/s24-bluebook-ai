    "I originally stumbled into this class due to it being the only 10:30 M\/W this semester, but ultimately it was my favorite class all semester! JENIFER VAN VLECK IS THE BEST LECTURER EVER!!! She is also very accessible and loves her students. Go to lecture!!! They might be long but that's where all the information lies. I enjoy class every time! The class has two 5 page primary source papers, a midterm, and a final, but don't let the papers scare you. I was worried at first, but the TFs are so helpful and the paper ended up being easy. Readings can be dense, but the tests are all lecturer and the readings are only for the paper (and even then, you can pick and choose and read only what you need). However, I recommend the readings because they give a good overview\/context for the class. I am a Poli Sci major, and I ended up using this as an IR credit. Such an interesting take on foreign policy from the American perspective. This is easily one of my favorite classes at Yale!!! TAKE THIS NOW!!!",
    "Prof. Van Vleck is a great lecturer. The course feels catered towards freshmen\/sophomores at times (covers a lot of basics, both in the content of the course and in how to become an effective writer) but even as a junior, I found it enjoyable.",
    "This class has a significant work load, however the material is very interesting and I learned new perspectives on American history as a result.",
    "This class covers interesting topics, but the one sided filter from which they are presented is bothering. Most of each lecture seemed to focus on portraying American history as bigoted and full of racism at every angle and did not focus on much else, at all. I signed up to learn about the \"Origins of US Global Power\"; instead I received a narrative about why the history of my country is actually terrible and about why my recent ancestors were part of a horrible, racist group of people who only lived to subjugate others.",
    "Origins is a good class of American history in the context of US foreign relations through time. Lectures are pretty good but are jam packed with a lot of info and therefore sometimes hard to follow. But you know the material already but it is now just presented in a new and interesting light overall. Great for people interested in foreign affairs, as well as, domestic relations.",
    "A basic history lecture on the origins of US foreign policy. Very good class if the subject matter interests you, would definitely recommend.",
    "A great class, take it! Probably easy if you studied much US history before, and really good general survey of US history and policy if you don't know much about these topics.",
    "Overall a pretty good class, but be prepared: the class focuses almost entirely on American racism\/sexism\/any-other-ism rather than an actual look at how the United States developed its preeminent global power.",
    "take it!!!! learned so much about the US",
    "Interesting in that it showed ways in which the US has faulted throughout our history, but never really went over positive things. Good credit\/d course.",
    "Definitely take it! It's one of the best lectures I've taken at Yale. I'd only say be aware that they're tough on grading IDs so you really have to know your stuff.",
    "HIST 122 is an amazing class. As a STEM major, I was desperately looking for something interesting and non-sciencey to fulfill my humanities requirement. After shopping like 8 classes, I settled on Origins because Professor Van Vleck is an incredible lecturer that has a rare ability to navigate a 50-minute lecture without losing our attention. She has subpoints for each lecture but unifying themes for the week, and she made it really easy to understand the journey that the US has taken over the past 350 years to become a foreign power. The midterm and two papers are completely reasonable, as is the final, and the TFs were also super invested. Don't get too worked up about the readings -- while they seem to be lengthy each week, it's only necessary to skim them if you really understand what's going on in class. If I had to make a recommendation, I would say to compile notes with a couple of classmates, because Professor Van Vleck tends to go a bit fast in lectures, so if you can compare with some friends then you'll get all the parts you individually missed. This class is a must-take!",
    "The best US history class to take for a balanced perspective on issues of relevance today. I think it achieves the perfect balance of breadth and depth. I do think the format of the sections can be improved, because most of the weeks ended up being discussions of the primary materials. Likewise for the two papers, they could be of different formats to mix things up a bit.",
    "This is an excellent course for both historian majors and others alike. The class assumes that you've taken a basic American history class in the past. \"Origins of US Global Power\" is about US international relations and the diplomatic, cultural, and commercial foundations of US global power. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who wants to understand how the US got to where it is today and the various ways through which it has deployed its power throughout the world. I would 100% recommend this class.",
    "Great American history course, but takes the approach of global power",
    "Terribly interesting class, not a lot of work- 10\/10 would recommend as a fun 5th class.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. It is a look at US HIstory through the lense of how it gained power and became the nation we know it to be today.",
    "This is the kind of class you come to Yale for. It is, hands-down, my favorite class at Yale (Im a senior). There is a lot of reading but never have I ever been so excited to do all of them. When I first shopped this class, I was still kind of unsure if I wanted to take it so I decided to do the assigned reading because if I couldnt slog through the heavy reading, then perhaps this class isnt worth it. I kid you notonce I opened the book, I couldnt put it down. I was blown-away by the amount I was learning. I actually looked forward to doing the assigned reading each week. Sometimes I had to stop in the middle, put down the book, and just allow myself a moment of silence to feel mesmerized and allow the awe to sink in. The entire class is mind-blowing. I often find myself questioning whether or not I chose the right major. Ive learned so much in this class, and Ive definitely become a better writer because of it too. The implications, motives, and factors influencing our nations foreign policies are things that I believe are necessary for everyone to understand. If you want to be an educated citizen and become more learned and refined, definitely take this class! Its one of the best decisions Ive made here, and I was genuinely depressed when the course ended. Prof. Van Vleck is one of those rare professors who actually makes an effort to get to know her students. This course taught me much more than just foreign policyI learned how to think like a historian and engage in a type of analysis that Im not used to doing. The class is a gem.",
    "A solid overview of foreign relation aspects of US history. Not too difficult but still interesting with a good workload. I enjoyed analyzing primary sources for the essays.",
    "Very interesting class. It's very cool to evaluate United States history through a primarily foreign policy perspective.",
    "HIST122 is a great class and Professor Van Vleck is a wonderful lecturer. The workload isn't overly demanding and the approach to US History is fresh and enlightening. The class is very structured and organized, and is easy to follow. Good for both history buffs and those looking to get into the subject.",
    "Fun class, cool lectures.",
    "definitely recommend for a history class - history major or not",
    "This is an interesting course though it is probably better if you haven't already taken a bunch of history courses. The lectures are engaging and the work load isn't too bad. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would. Really interesting subject matter and great professor.",
    "Please take it before you leave Yale. I would not call it easy but definitely a great class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course for anyone who is interested in the role of the US in international history.",
    "Really interesting class that changed the way I look at US foreign policy. A lot of the same material as APUSH but through a novel lens.",
    "This is a great class to learn about American history and foreign policy. The lectures are very interesting and talks about typical American history from a standpoint more focused on foreign and informal diplomacy, military interventions, and cultural\/technological\/economic influences.",
    "The course is a great overview of the United States' role in the international world. Professor Van Vleck does an amazing job of positioning all of the policy decisions through an international and domestic lens. She makes great arguments which helps students follow lectures. If you like learning about US history, and want to know more about it from not a solely pro-US standpoint, definitely take this course!",
    "Wonderful class that gives you the foundation of American history, or the important parts anyway",
    "Great, interesting class that is an overview of U.S. foreign policy. If you want to go into the specifics of a time period or historical event, this is not the class for you, but it's a great comprehensive look at foreign policy.",
    "Origins provides a great and multi-faceted overview of American history, primarily through the eyes of its foreign interactions. The class also takes into account non-traditional viewpoints, which is so essential in breaking the standard conceptions we hold on history. Professor Van Vleck is a great professor, her lectures are interesting and incorporate more than monotonous text and speaking. This course served as a great basis in learning many key ideologies and thoughts that serve as the basis of American foreign relations.",
    "A good history class, worth taking at Yale. I've heard it overlaps a lot with AP US History classes though, which I did not take in high school.",
    "Yes, great class.",
    "AMST 193 is a great American history if you want your classic liberal anti-American Exceptionalism spin on it. Professor Van Vleck provides the course with interesting theses about American history and some good readings to support them which makes for a very thought-provoking course. I definitely felt like some of the main messages of the course were redundant, however, I enjoyed Professor Van Vleck's lectures and found that I ultimately did end up learning a lot from the course. I would totally recommend it as long as you can tolerate a semester of America bashing.",
    "I thought this was a fantastic course. It provides a great overview of U.S. History focussing specifically on US foreign policy. If the only US history class you have taken was AP US history (or if you haven't taken a US history class) I would highly encourage you to take this class. Professor Van Vleck is great and her lectures are always interesting. The readings are also fantastic, and the tests and papers aren't that difficult.",
    "Looks at U.S. history under a lens of power dynamics.",
    "Hist 122 is a great Amerfican history course.",
    "Decent class. Wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Origins of U.S. Global Power rocks. If you went to high school in the U.S., you've definitely already learned about U.S. history, but this course presents it in such fascinating new ways. I always kind of pushed foreign policy to the side, but it really is fascinating to study how much foreign affairs influenced domestic policies and vice versa. You also study a lot of unsung heroes in this class, which was really cool. Professor Van Vleck is fantastic. Her lectures are extremely engaging, and she chooses meaningful, interesting readings that are worth your time to do. I didn't finish all of them, but I'm definitely going to read them over the summer because they were so cool. The workload is pretty reasonable. I thought the reading was a bit much at times, but from what I've heard from upperclassmen, it was less in comparison to other Yale history classes. You have two essays and two midterms, which are all fair. I really recommend this class!",
    "Solid class - deals with state\/non-state actors' (as well as hard\/soft power's) interactions with American foreign policy, American historical narratives, and American domestic culture - 2 papers & 2 exams.",
    "Professor Van Vleck is great, so I would recommend the class.",
    "Good class to take, talks about the important concepts of US history. Solid amount of informative readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student. It is a great study in the American personality, from its conception through to today."
