    "The course framed the question \"what is Catholic reformation\" very well.",
    "I read very interesting literature from the time period, and gained a unique insight into these exciting times by more closely examining the Catholic perspectives.",
    "Broader knowledge regarding the many facets of the Catholic Reformation; not a monolithic period",
    "I learned a ton about the variety of Early Modern Catholicism. This very variety manifests in the naming controversy - Catholic Reformation, Counter Reformation, Early Modern Catholicism, etc. The names that we use determine the perspective that we take on this historical moment. My view of the Catholic Reformation as somewhat monolithic and top down was reversed.",
    "I learned a great deal about the Early Modern period in European history - the richness and complexity of this time of change in the Catholic Church."

    "The mixture of primary and secondary texts was great. The presentations were also helpful because they allowed students to engage with even more scholarship.",
    "S - Carlos is absolutely wonderful. My fellow students were great. W - There was so, so much reading that sometimes it was tough to get through all of it in time for class.",
    "Great discussion and great group of students. Professor Eire is very knowledgeable and a great discussion leader. Also very helpful outside of class. I think the class could be improved by sticking more to the discussion questions provided by seminar leaders. We still had good discussion, but it was easy to get off topic. Perhaps also limiting the number of questions to 2-3 could help in focusing the seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, it is extremely important material to engage with.",
    "This is an excellent course! Carlos Eire is fantastic, and anything he teaches is great.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Carlos is an amazing instructor and this was a very satisfying class.",
    "Yes. Professor Eire is a very good teacher and he assigns interesting and relevant texts.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. If you want to learn about Catholicism from 1500-1650ish, especially as it relates to the Protestant Reformation, this class is indispensable. It is a good mixture of primary and secondary sources. Professor Eire is also an expert in the field. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Eire is wonderful and the course is full of both historical and theological perspectives on the period. A truly enriching subject."
