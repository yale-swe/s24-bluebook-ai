   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn basic calc- yes.",
    "Yes, if this is new material you want to learn. No, if you already know it and just want a qr credit.",
    "Yes, is not as hard as they say. This obviously depends on your ability ( nothing new here),and instructor if Soumya Dipta Banerjee is teaching it, take it with him !!!",
    "Math 112 is a reallly good class. it really isn't that difficult, it is just the same exact problems on the tests that are in the books, and the curve isnt bad at all.take this class",
    "Yes. It is obviously not an elective but if you need to do it for a requirement it really isn't that bad.",
    "Mathematics 112 04 is an introductory course to the fundamentals of calculus. I would recommend this course to a student who wishes to establish a firm basis in mathematics before pursuing more advanced levels.",
    "I'd recommend it as a great QR.",
    "Would recommend it if you haven't taken calculus before or if your background in it is pretty weak.",
    "Do NOT take this course just to get a QR. Find another class.",
    "Math 112 is a basic\/intermediate introduction to differentiation with a bit of integration (which you will cover in Math 115). I would recommend Math 112 to everyone who needs the credit for QR or for Econ, Pre-med, etc., though I would recommend shopping around for a lively TA that is a good fit for you.",
    "You have to take a QR, so why not?",
    "Take it if you have to, but you learn a lot.",
    "Shom\/Soumya was very helpful and clearly cares about his students and wants them to understand the concepts under discussion. I was a bit concerned about this class at the beginning but by the end it had warmed up and I definitely enjoyed being in it and learning from Shom. It's a tough course, with challenging exams but it's fun to finally learn a bit about calculus and even to have weekly problem sets (if you're a humanities person and are used to writing painstaking papers). Sometimes he went a bit fast for my taste, but he was very willing to backtrack if we had questions. (Make sure to ask if you have questions!)"
