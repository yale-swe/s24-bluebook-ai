    "I think that this course is very valuable for students interested in research of any sort. Although it was a difficult class for me, it was my favorite. Lectures were full of useful information, assignments were instructive, and discussions were lively. I also really appreciated Amity's flexibility in allowing us to modify assignments to further the needs of our individual projects.",
    "Question 1 - - I found the earlier readings most helpful. I didn't find the two books helpful.Question 3 - - Some of the assignments were helpful to my work, but a few (the interview, for example) seemed superfluous the way they are currently set up.Question 6 - - I thought things really slowed down in the second half of the semester. Talking about every single question in class made things tedious and made it hard to stay engaged with such a big group. It also felt like wasted time as we got further and further into the semester and beyond question-generating time.",
    "Question 2: The instructor often went through the slides in the power point very quickly and it was sometimes hard to follow. The information was very good and the instructor is very knowledgeable but the delivery of the lectures was rushed.Question 3: While I thought the outside assignments were useful, I think assignments that are more related to our own research would be useful. I think that assignments relevant to choosing a research topic and making sure that students are on top of finding resources, making contacts, and starting the proposal would be helpful. I also think that assignments related to peer-edits and grant writing would be particularly useful. I felt almost like developing my research project was totally separate from the class and tacked on toward the end. Although we did address our own research throughout it wasn't iterative and therefore I didn't feel as though my project evolved.Question 8: In general I feel as though it is difficult to come into the class not knowing exactly what you want to study- there is not really any room for brainstorming research ideas in the class. I felt like I just randomly picked a research location at the beginning of the semester. I am not sure what the solution to this would be- but this was a challenge for me in the class.",
    "This class helped to guide\/support my research process.",
    "my main criticism of this class is that it seems slightly outdatedprofessor dolittle knows the material well, but there should be more material - specifically more recent material.also, i believe there should be some 'field trips\/lab assignments' component - perhaps just to the library to work through the search\/source processes in real time - this would be very helpful and reinforce some of the individual assignmentsalso this course should be linked to the GIS curriculumall of this said - these critiques arise from the fact that the technology and techniques availability is changing at an incredible pacethe course needs to change - but this is more a simple reality, than any fault of the instructor",
    "The readings were relevant to what we covered in class. The lectures and out-of-class research assignments were really the foundation of the class though.",
    "It would have been helpful to have an earlier deadline for research proposals and possibly to implement a peer review process in class.",
    "It would have been helpful to read other people's proposals before we were assigned to write our own andI would have liked to have more peer-review opportunities."

   "comments": [
    "Professor and TA were down-to-earth, helpful, kind, and thoughtful people. I'm very glad to have made contact with both of them.",
    "Allowing time and care to be spent in putting together proposals.",
    "Class discussions on Thursdays were my favorite part of this course. The body of knowledge that people brought - some of them working on a PhD - was impressive. The debates we had over everything from reading materials to the problems with academia were always interesting.",
    "The Participant observation exercise and the class feedback.Being able to design a small research topic around a particular site of interest and run it was very helpful to see how we feel in the shoes of a researcher. Eventhough I worked with similar goals and under similar circumstances before F&ES, having the time to be introspective about my actions during the experience was very helpful.Class presentations were most helpful to receive feedback and ground my project ideas.",
    "The best thing about this course was being in a group of other students who were all interested in research and developing a project. I wish there had been assignments focused on working with students but I think that I will use the students in this class as a resource throughout my time at FES as I continue to develop and conduct my research.It was also great having a TA who had recently gone through the whole research process and was more than happy to answer any questions about research. She was very knowledgeable and always willing to sit down and talk about anything.",
    "Interacting with other students over their research.",
    "the other students. what drives this course is the conversations and discussions had by students.",
    "The assignments.",
    "getting to share ideas in a symposium style format with our peers (social science MESc candidates). getting to know their patterns and styles, on a personal level as a cohort, will no doubt prove very helpful in the coming yearsthe class was probably larger this year than usual (we had maybe 25 students) so it took a long time to discuss everyone's ideas, comprised a significant percentage of the class - but this was, on the whole, a good thing",
    "Breadth of coverage of methods.",
    "The opportunity to hone my research idea through vetting by the instructor, TF and students, and continuous revisions.",
    "The methods assignments were useful to understanding research process design and class discussions were often engaging.",
    "The TA Jenn Baka was fantastic!!",
    "Workshopping our ideas with other classmates was great and hearing about the challenges people faced were helpful."

   "comments": [
    "The assignments were an absolute waste of time, except for the final assignment. Most of the assignments I completely made up and received excellent grades on them. I stopped doing most of the reading after a few weeks because it was boring and unhelpful (and not necessary to participate in class discussions).",
    "While I enjoyed the course's flexibility, I think it could benefit from having more clearly defined assignment specifications and due dates. Assignments on the syllabus often did not align with what Amity told us in class, which made it difficult to plan, or there were multiple conflicting guidelines for a particular paper, which made it difficult to understand on what basis our assignments were being evaluated.One thing that might be useful to consider: We would often have a lecture on a particular method on Tuesday, and have an assignment on that method due on Thursday, which didn't make much sense to me, because due to time constraints I would have to complete the assignment before lecture. One week when the due date was pushed back, we had the lecture, and then the assignment was due the following week. I think that this was much more helpful for completing the assignment, because we could hear the lecture, then go out and do the assignment.Also, in regards to the question of where the research proposal lecture should go, I think it makes the most sense at the end, but I would put the timeline readings in the first week, so that students can get a better sense of what milestones they should be hitting over the semester.",
    "It needs to be geared more towards getting proposals together - - which is what I thought the point was. It seems to me that the ultimate goal should be researching and submitting to a few funding organizations rather than putting together a hypothetical proposal at the end like a final paper.",
    "A clearer syllabus from the start; there were a lot of revisions as the class went on that sometimes got confusing.",
    "If time permitting, having a statistics\/software analysis workshop would be a great addition to the class.ENcouraging the students to work in groups. This was 'adviced' during the first weeks, and then was not followed through. I found that having this discussion group would have improved the quality of my research.",
    "It would be great if all assignments could be tailored to fit our research.",
    "I think the assignments should be revised to incorporate more editing of student projects. Perhaps with a large class like the one we had, it would have been more beneficial to breakout and work in smaller groups to discuss our research questions. One way to incorporate more peer review could be for every student to provide 3 students comments\/critiques and suggestions on their research questions and presentations. Another idea would be for students to exchange drafts of their proposals.",
    "More cohesive structure of assignments.",
    "lectures were basically recitations of powerpoint slides. that was pretty bad. more discussion of conceptualizing our research, putting it into context. i don't feel like i learned much at all about the history and ideas behind qualitative research. more theory would have been a lot more useful.",
    "The readings were not always terribly compelling. Also, I think that splitting up the presentations into groups and not taking so much class time for them would be great. I'd rather have spent more time working on methods approaches.",
    "better integration of current technologies and methods - not to replace the older methods of field research - these are invaluable - but to complement them---(as above)my main criticism of this class is that it seems slightly outdatedprofessor dolittle knows the material well, but there should be more material - specifically more recent material.also, i believe there should be some 'field trips\/lab assignments' component - perhaps just to the library to work through the search\/source processes in real time - this would be very helpful and reinforce some of the individual assignmentsalso this course should be linked to the GIS curriculumall of this said - these critiques arise from the fact that the technology and techniques availability is changing at an incredible pacethe course needs to change - but this is more a simple reality, than any fault of the instructor",
    "Better readings--examples that illustrate the very best qualitative social science research and foundational works that all social scientists should know would improve the course. It would have been useful to go over a list of all social science methods at the beginning and identify which will be covered during the course and which will not.",
    "Nothing major that I can think of. Perhaps it would be an even more useful class if each of the assignments in which we practiced our research skills could be better related to our project ideas.",
    "We focused on the developing the initial research question for far too long. Not all students were allocated ample or equal amounts of time to receive feedback from the class on research questions. Maybe this could be resolved by having all students write written comments to other students in advance, and then have small group break out sessions to address some of the questions and comments.Please have Bethany Zemba come in and explain the NSF application earlier in the semester. I think I may have been better prepared to submit an NSF application if I had better understood the realities of the process earlier on in the semester.Maybe set up an additional lecture or a TSM on research taxonomy and organization. And maybe more information on how to properly construct a robust literature review.Require students to submit a list of grants and funding opportunities that they are applying to early in the semester.",
    "Learning better how to write a research proposal.",
    "I think there should be groups created after the initial abstracts to discuss research topics and ideas outside of class. The assignments could be organized around commenting on the research ideas of your group members. This would provide a way to get more in-depth feedback throughout the semester and would be a way to skip some of the other assignments that are not as useful such as the participant observation.",
    "The lectures were a gloss on the readings and not generally memorable or helpful. Presenting methods with bullet points is less effective than focusing on stories from field research and debates in the methodological literature.The presentations took a lot of time for how little we got to talk about them, they should have been required to be shorter with much more time for questions and discussion."

I think i know what I want next as a result of this course... so a course that builds on it seems appropriate.going forward, there is a new SIG called SCOPE where students can critiques each other's research proposals and related materials - these informal 'crit clubs' are facilitated by the sense of community arising from the class. this is good - perhaps this connection can be formalized?",
