   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for anyone who wants to read Being and Time or who wants to know more about Heidegger.",
    "An excellent course, recommended if Prof. Harries teaches it again. Heidegger's Being and Time is a challenging work. An interested student would do well to read it once in advance of taking this course - I certainly wished that I had.",
    "Take this class. It's not often that Yale gives you the opportunity to study Heidegger, and it's especially rare when you get a class devoted to Being and Time. Professor Harries knows a lot, so you'll definitely learn a lot from him, even though he kind of lacks charisma in his lectures.",
    "No frills: you read Being and Time and write about it. I loved it, but I'd only recommend it for people with a serious interest in Heidegger or this period of philosophy. If you're up for it, it'll blow your mind. The reading is relatively low in quantity (no secondary readings -just a chapter or so of Being and Time each week) but it's a demanding book.",
    "This is class where you have to do the reading for it to be worth while. The entire semester is spent on Being and Time, so a detailed and intense engagement with the text will make this a good or a bad class. Also, given Professor Harries' teaching style, without having really thought about the reading, there is no way to think beyond his interpretation and challenge or modify it, which, in a sense, is the very point of the class in the first place.",
    "so, first thing to know is that this is not a seminar: it's a 2 hour lecture in a cramped room. the second thing to know is that heidegger really isn't that great. i know you think he is, because you're a literature major, so don't take my word for it: read some. but don't read it like \"oh my god this is so hard to understand, so it must be super profound,\" but instead read it like \"what, beneath all of this verbiage, is heidegger actually claiming, and why on earth would should I believe it?\" When you do it like that, Being and Time starts to get really frustrating. At the bottom, it turns out, a lot of what he's saying is either simplistic\/obvious, or wrong, or (miraculously) both. now, the topics are juicy, and some of the insights are profound, but only in the way that really obvious things are profound: for example, when you realize that you are going to die, that is indeed a very big deal.The problem is that when you do start to get frustrated, Harries is not much help. Now, don't get me wrong: harries is a wonderful guy and a great teacher. He speaks clearly, explains Heidegger well, and generally has a great grasp of what is actually being said. However, he's not good at interacting with students in seminar. because he's just reading from his lecture notes, when you ask a question it can seem like an interruption to his lecture, and he will often cut you off to give a quick retort as soon as he can think of one. I felt that occasionally he was dogmatic in both his critiques and his defenses of Heidegger, and that he was actively precluding the type of critical engagement that makes a class like this interesting. Also, sometimes his commentary felt repetitive; he's got a number of stock points he makes and a couple of stock critiques, almost all of which are explained in his commentary on the origin of the work of art, and almost all of which I would bet he's been making for years and is not liable to change.That said, being and time is an important book, and you're probably not gonna read it on your own. what's more: harries, despite his faults, is a treasure and a wonderful man. so shop the class, see if you like it. some of the other students were a bit more starry-eyed than I. perhaps they're right.",
    "Close reading of Being and Time",
    "An excellent long lecture that requires a certain amount of discipline and sitzfleisch. But you will certainly come out with a good understanding of Heidegger.",
    "YES YES YES! Top 3 classes I have taken at Yale without a doubt.",
    "Take this class, but don't take too much alongside it. Be ready to read and reread the text, maybe do some supplemental reading. Take every opportunity to talk to Professor Harries.",
    "Good class, and it was interesting to follow one book from cover to cover. It was also nice to go into such depth. But you have to read the book and stay on top of things and not fall behind, otherwise you will have no idea what is going on and two hours of Heidegger will be utter misery for you. Also, do not expect a lot of class participation or anything. Prof. Harries will be reading to you from his notes for the entirety of the class. While there is some participation and some students do ask questions, such interruptions are not common. This \"seminar\" had about 27 students in it.",
    "This class is amazing. I'd never been exposed to Heideggerian thought before and the class moved at a quick but not impossibly challenging pace. Harries' notes were amazing and invaluable in helping me keep up and move along. The reading is very dense and difficult and multiple read-throughs are necessary sometimes, but it is always relatively short. The best part of the class is how rewarding it is in the end. The ideas and concepts that are covered are unbelievably fascinating and have had far-reaching effects on my own thought. The class is amazing. Definitely take it."
