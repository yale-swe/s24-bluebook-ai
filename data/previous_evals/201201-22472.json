    "BEST CLASS EVER. TAKE IT.",
    "See response to 344. Seriously the best lab ever.",
    "See MCDB 344 - this is the second part of it. You take both in the same semester. You will have to take both and you should. They are both fantastic!",
    "Excellent class that teaches you both how to do cell bio and how to talk about it.",
    "This class was great! There were no lab reports or homework. We did spend quite a bit of time in lab and sometimes came into lab when class was not scheduled. The class did require that you give two formal talks but both were great experiences. It teaches you how to present scientific work and that is a skill that will be important in years to come.",
    "TAKE IT please! TAKE IT- labs can be fun! promise . see for youself",
    "MCDB 344L and 345L are by far the best two labs I have taken at Yale. Professor Wolenski is one of the nicest, funniest, most approachable professors you will ever come across. He fosters a great sense of friendship and community among the students in the lab. He encourages students to collaborate and to serve as teachers to one another. The lab is very low-stress, in contrast to most of the other lab courses I have taken here. I developed a solid understanding of a wide variety of fundamental lab techniques. I would definitely recommend that students contact Professor Wolenski at least a year and a half in advance so that they can have the opportunity to take this lab!",
    "This course allows students to further develop and refine the skills that they initially executed in MCDB 344L. One of the most beneficial aspects of this course was the opportunity that students had to give a formal presentation on a research article from a leading science journal. This series of presentations allowed students to think critically and ask though-provoking questions about cutting edge research in cell biology and genetics. If given the opportunity to take this course, you without a doubt should. It is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "As I said in my MCDB 344 evaluation, this was a great lab (and be aware that you can't really take just 344 or 345, so you might as well read those too). Dr. Wolenski really brings out the best in his students, and in 345, he did this through a series of student presentations of scientific papers. Two awesome perks of 345: t-shirts and the Thimble Island cruise. Yes, your suitemates will be jealous.",
    "Yeppp. Just email far in advance....like everyone else has probably already said.",
    "Same as 344"
