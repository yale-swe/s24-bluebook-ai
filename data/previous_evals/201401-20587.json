    "Yeah, take French, it's a great language, don't take it at 9:25 AM in TD",

    "I would say it is difficult but if you put in the effort and genuinely want to learn French then you can and will be very successful and see a lot of progress in both speaking and writing.",
    "I would recommend FREN130 as a natural progression from L2, with the opportunity to engage with actual pieces of literature (like L'Etranger) in their original language, which is very rewarding.",
    "If you need to take Foreign language and your choice if French, I would recommend taking L3 with Professor Sherak. You would immensely improve all four language skills. Professor Sherak is always there to help you succeed."
