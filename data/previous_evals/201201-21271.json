    "Yes, especially for someone who has an interest in art and in visual storytelling.",
    "If you rare at all interested or intrigued by graphic novels, this is definitely worth taking. It doesn't have a huge workload, and the books are all very good.",
    "I would recommend this class with the caveat that people know the class is notstructured rigorously. It's very much a \"make what you will of it\" kind of class. The reading list is pleasant, the assignments are benign, and Professor Wexler is very kind. Start working on your graphic memoir earlier in the semester than when the presentations are scheduled to occur. Aside from these critiques though, this class definitely has the potential to be an enjoyable experience.",
    "Very light workload, enjoyable reading. I'd recommend it.",
    "YES, take this class. The reading is just incredible. I had no idea the power of this medium of book, and I am so grateful to have taken this class. Plan ahead for the final project though-- it's fun but time-consuming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I would summarize it as a fantastic foundation course in the genre of the graphic novel.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend the course, just because it was so disorganized and I didn't want to put that much into it, so therefore got little out of it. If you're prepared to supplement the class with your own enthusiasm, it might be a worthwhile course for you to take."
