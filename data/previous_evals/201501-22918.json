    "Fun class, more about exploration of the medium than a art culture\/history survey course.",
    "This class is unique in its focus, and can be very rewarding if you invest your creativity in it. My advice would be to follow up on that article you read for homework that piqued your interest, or keep in touch with the Scriptorium staff about bookbinding opportunities at Yale, or with Special Collections, or any of the other wonderful experts, from Yale or otherwise, whom you meet through the course. The class can be as much a chance to network with institutions in the arts at Yale and beyond, and a survey of varied media, as it is a creative outlet. It is a great way to gain new perspectives and experience with a topic not usually covered in such detail.",
    "I personally really loved this course, and would regret not taking it. However, this is a class that has pretty heavy workload outside of class. I would not recommend this if you are looking for an easy credit or if you already are taking many classes. With that being said, I would encourage any freshman to take it. If gives a different environment to watching lectures and siting in classrooms. The class is 100% hands-on and there are even multiple trips to get exclusive tours and art viewings from the majority of the galleries and museums around campus.",
    "I would recommend this class for students who are pretty serious about art."
