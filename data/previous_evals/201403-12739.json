   "comments": [
    "Introduction to multivariable calculus. It's math, and it's interesting if you like it (I personally enjoy math, and was not necessarily taking the class because it's a prereq for many majors.) Yoav sometimes got flustered at the board but was clearly knowledgable of the material and willing to help outside of class time (he was particularly helpful at office hours.) It was definitely good to keep the class sizes down to about 25ish, as opposed to learning this material in a large lecture. Regardless of instructor, it's important material to know and classes were generally enjoyable.",
    "Math 120 08 was a challenging and sometimes confusing class. That being said, for anyone looking to do courses in the STEM fields, I would not recommend skipping it, because it's integral to other classes. I would recommend the class to another student but warn then that even if they've excelled very, very highly in math classes prior to this that they still will struggle.",
    "It's a hard class and I would only recommend it if you have a dying love of math or need it as a prereq.",
    "MATH 120 is a fast-paced course that covers the essentials of multivariable calculus. It is heavily reliant upon three-dimensional reasoning and visualization, so if these are areas in which you are weak, practice the material as soon as it begins to appear. The exams are not really challenging if one completes and understands all of the homework (the problems are more computational than anything else). I would recommend this course for those who enjoy math or if they need MATH 120 as a prerequisite. Just because it is not MATH 230 does not make the class an \"easy A,\" however, because it still requires significant studying and work to keep up understanding throughout the year to do well.",
    "I would recommend it as long as you keep up with your homework. And don't be afraid to go to office hours.",
    "I would only recommend this to students who have to take the class.",
    "I would recommend math 120, but I would add that the student must be willing to work hard. The class isn't like high school math classessome problems will definitely take you multiple tries, lots of sheets of paper, and lots of time. However, it's all worth it when you finish!",
    "Only if they're interested in STEM",
    "If you have taken multi before, this class is very reasonable. If you've never seen any of it, then it's quite a challenge. The home works are easy, but the test s can be very challenging if math isn't your strong suit. Definitely look through the textbook to get an idea of what the harder material looks like (stokes, greens, pretty much all line and surface integrals).",
    "Yes, but I would caution the other student that there will be people in the class who have already taken multi-variable calculus, and that the student will have to work hard on their own to stay afloat.",
    "Well, it's good if you like Math, and very helpful for someone planning a future in Physics or Economics. I'm not 100% sure what other uses it has though. Not a bad class if you just like keeping your math brain sharp.",
    "I would recommend this course if you need to know the subject matter and are willing to put in at least a little work to understand it.",
    "It is a difficult class. It gets tricky especially after the first mid-term.",
    "Math 120 teaches the fundamentals of multivariable calculus. I would recommend it because it provides the student (who is most likely STEM-oriented) with a good understanding of the math that they will need to utilize in the future."
