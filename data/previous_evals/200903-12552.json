    "Absolutely -- whether for credit in the major or because you really like IR. Monteiro is one of the best teachers I have ever had. I wasn't expecting to say this of a first-year professor when I started this class, but he really has a natural talent for leading seminars. Even when the readings were lost in theory lala land, in class we quickly drew compelling connections between the theory and real world in ways that sacrificed neither depth nor applicability. Monteiro has just the mind needed to lead this sort of seminar and it really showed. I cannot recommend him enough.",
    "Fine course. It wasn't amazing, but it does provide a good background of IR theory if that's what you're interested in (which does help provide background essentially for IR studies in general). BEWARE though that this is a course in THEORY and we did not spend a lot of time at all talking about concrete examples and current events. Therefore, readings were very tedious and dragged out and long. The Professor said he is changing that aspect to include more concrete issue discussions next year, but that is not what we experienced in his first year of teaching this seminar.",
    "Lots of theory but you learn a lot and have great discussion.",
    "a comprehensive study of the main paradigms of international relations; i would take it if you are at all interested in theory",
    "If you know some about IR and like it, you'll probably find this class fine. Professor Monteiro is interesting and very committed to this material. He is understanding and will help you work through any issues you have with the course. Unfortunately for me, I found the material far too abstract to be fully engaging. But others had no such problem, and I think most students thought the class was worthwhile.",
    "This is an excellent seminar on IR theories of realism, liberalism, and constructivism. It deals with fairly abstract stuff with few concrete examples, but the professor makes it easy to understand and accessible. The readings seem long (more than 100 pages a week), but you pick up fairly quickly that the more abstract and philosophical stuff can be skimmed or even just glanced over without it impinging on your ability to contribute to discussion. By the end of the course, you develop a framework for seeing IR events, so that the empirical stuff makes sense within context.Overall, I definitely recommend this course.",
    "Reading. Reading responses. Class discussion. Final paper.",
    "Take it! Know that it's a bit hard, and there's a lot of reading. But if you're a political science major, you won't regret it. You'll manage and come out feeling as if you're an expert on poli-sci theory.I recommend it for any student who has felt thus far that his poli-sci work at Yale has not been engaging enough. This class shows you a whole new side to the international politics arena.",
    "It is a highly theory based class that does a really good job of introducing all different subjects in political science.",
    "If you have any interest in international relations and can tolerate (or enjoy) relatively heavy doses of abstractions in theory (though empirical evidence is discussed as well), I'd strongly recommend taking this course. It presents a clear look at the major IR schools, the histories behind them, and ultimately how each are interrelated. Nuno Monteiro is an amazing professor. He is ridiculously knowledgeable about the subject matter, an engaging and lucid lecturer (he gave short lectures at the beginning of the seminar sessions), and able to prevent his biases from ruining the discussion (he offers them more than he attempts to assert they are truth.) The readings are long and sometimes dry, which is the only true drawback of the course; I wouldn't let it dissuade you from taking it. The grading, as far as I know, is fair and not terribly difficult, so there are no traps there. In essence, if you like IR theory at all, you should minimally shop this, and ideally take it."
