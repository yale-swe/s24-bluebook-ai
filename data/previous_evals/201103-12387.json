    "Elementary Turkish with Etem Erol is the best thing that can happen to you at 10:30 in the morning everyday. The class is always very engaging and fun, and Etem makes sure you actually learn the language. I am confident that I am in good hands and will get to some level of proficiency soon. I definitely recommend this course to anyone who's even mildly interested in Turkey or in learning a new language.",
    "Turkish is a fascinating language. Most people are surprised to hear I study it, but they soon notice how often Turkey comes up in the news and current events. It's a fascinating country with wonderful people. Take this course to gain a greater appreciation of that cosmopolitan culture.",
    "very enjoyable, laid-back for an intro language. I took it as a fifth class and enjoyed the relaxed pace, personality of Etem, and opportunity to learn more about the culture. It's not the most rigorous class, however, so if you're looking for that I might try one of the less laid-back intro languages.",
    "Turkish 110 prepares you for basic conversation and writing in the language. It focuses on building your vocabulary and grammar. Once you learn the basic grammar rules it becomes much easier to understand the language. It also introduces the Turkish culture which makes the class more fun. Professor Erol is amazing and makes the class enjoyable. I highly recommend the class to everyone."
