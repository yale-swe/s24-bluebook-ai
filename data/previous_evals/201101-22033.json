    "Absolutely. MUSI 222 is a really fun class in solo vocal performance. Prof. Lalli is an excellent and nurturing teacher, and Sara Kohane is a helpful and knowledgeable coach. I also appreciated being forced to learn a lot of new repertoire and to perform frequently. Studying voice privately can encourage you to work only on a few songs and to neglect the study of singing as *performance.* Lalli's class, as the title suggests, emphasizes that. I wish I'd discovered it sooner.",
    "You learn classical songs in two different languages and perform them. I'd recommend this as a manageable fifth or sixth course. It's not devoid of work, especially if you're not good at learning lyrics, but it's a lighter load.",
    "Yes. A good course that covered some lesser known songs (especially the British ones) and gives an opportunity to sing in public (in front of class and in recitals) and to practice with a wonderful accompanist! The only thing is that more feedback on vocal aspects of performance would be appreciated. I feel like only people at a high level received this kind of attention.",
    "Yes. Take this class if you want to learn a great deal about classical music and about your own musical ability.",
    "Professor Lalli himself cannot sing. However, this does not stop him from being the most helpful voice instructor one could ever ask for. He has so much experience in the field, having himself been a world-renowned recitalist. He is also kind and approachable, a great teacher, a helpful mentor, and a friend. my voice has grown so much with just one semester in his class, and i'm sure i'll take his class again and again, and continue to see improvements."
