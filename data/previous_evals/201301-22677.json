    "This course is a big change from 130 -- it was a lot tougher. However, I enjoyed being able to continue practicing my language skills. I had already fulfilled my language requirement but chose to take the course. Shop sections to find a professor you like!",
    "Typical Spanish class, similar to high school. You probably have to take it so this evaluation is dumb.",
    "A good follow-up to SPAN 130. Also, a good predatory class for summer study abroad.",
    "Yes! Especially if you took L3, it's a really good way to improve your Spanish skills.",
    "Valle is awesome! Not sure if she'll be around next year, but if you can, take it with her! She understands how to teach you and build your spanish proficiency.",
    "I would recommend it as it will help to improve your spanish.",
    "Good continuation of the Spanish course",
    "Good class - take it for a language requirement",
    "Spanish 140 is an intensive class that really tries to focus on speaking, writing, and grammar. I would definitely recommend this class, even if you don't need it to fulfill a requirement. You will feel much more confident about your Spanish, and your skills will improve greatly.",
    "Yes. Of course, it is kind of required for some... but even to those for whom it is not, this is a really fun challenging course. I wouldnt exactly describe myself as a language-lover, but after this course, I finally feel confident in my ability to speak spanish.",
    "Be glad this teacher is retiring. Absolute waste of time."
