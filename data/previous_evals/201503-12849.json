   "comments": [
    "This is a great course if you are interested in looking at both the past and present world of art through the lens of collecting - so how collections were formed, who collected and what those implications are. The course started with discussion of princely collections and cabinets of curiosity and ended with very interesting discussions about the franchising of museums and the state of the contemporary art world. I would recommend it if you would like a taste of a lot of ideas regarding the central theme of collecting. Professor Rizvi is wonderful! There were great fieldtrips that were helpful to thinking through the material we were reading. I learned a lot in the final research project!",
    "Definitely recommend. It's a good way to parse through the many ethical, political, and social impacts of not only collections but museums as institutions. Readings were relevant to each weeks topic and discussions were very good.",
    "Collecting is a fantastic course on the history of collections from private, home collections to today's \"franchise\" museums. It is both chronologically and geographically broad, while individual projects give the opportunity for in-depth research. The class included a field trip to the Peabody and the YUAG. Professor Rizvi is amazing!!!",
    "A terrific and challenging class! Excellent seminar with conversations surrounding issues of historical, political, and economic issues around collecting and the art world. A fun mix of discussions, presentations, and visits to different collections\/museums at Yale. Challenging in terms of reading and writing workload, but it was always work I was interested in doing. Readings very directly linked to our in-class discussions. Professor Rizvi is challenging and knowledgeable; encourages looking at the museum world through an international lens, with discussions about museums in different cultural contexts.",
    "Interesting. Yes. It guides students to the world of art history."
