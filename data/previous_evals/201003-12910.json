    "This course if very rigorous and the workload can be overwhelming. I would recommend taking it only if you need it for your major. You learn a lot about conducting research and writing papers.",
    "TAke if required. Note that this course will take a ton of work. But in the end your writing and understanding of how to perform psych research and write papers in drastically improved.",
    "Overall a good course. You have to take it if you're a psych major, and you will learn a lot about conducting research and also improve your writing. It was a lot less painful then I expected--it's much improved from the old Research Methods. Even though some material was not really relevant for students who aren't going to get a PhD in psychology (such as myself), it was still worthwhile. I probably wouldn't recommend taking it if you're not a psych major though. Professor Ahn makes the lectures interesting and the course is very hands-on (you conduct your own original experiments!)",
    "Take it if you're a psych major, because you need this training for your senior project. Of all the required courses in the major, this one is probably the most important.",
    "hard, annoying class. don't take this unless you are filling the psych requirement. the weekly quizzes are annoying and these type of papers are really awful to write. on the plus side, professor ahn is TERRIFIC--nice, helpful& SO funny. if you have to take this class, make sure you take it with her.",
    "I would recommend psych 235 to another student.",
    "Okay, so take this class if you're a Psychology major and you have to. Otherwise, stop reading this and go find another class to take.PSYC 235 is a lot of work. Not all of it is necessarily \"hard,\" but all of it is time-consuming. However, you will learn a lot about the experimental reporting process and will get good hands-on research experience, all of which is crucial to anyone interested in pursing a career in psychology.Bottom line: You will get out of this class what you put into it. If you consistently work hard and maintain a good relationship with your TA, you'll be fine. If you goof around and don't start your papers until the night before they're due, you'll be screwed. This is not a class you can BS your way through, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to do well.",
    "statistics not required- i took it after psych stats and i didn't feel like i had any advantage over anyone else, prof. ahn does a good job of getting everyone on the same page",
    "This class used to suck and psych majors had to take it anyway. With Professor Ahn teaching it, however, you learn a lot, become invested in the experiments you conduct, and see what its like to be a psychologist. Overall, it's actually really awesome. I highly recommend this class to psych majors fulfilling their research methods requirement or anyone interested in conducting experiments in general.",
    "Definitely, its a great way to learn to conduct studies and report on them.",
    "Only if you have to take it.",
    "yes",
    "overview of how to think about\/approach\/design experiments, but mostly social psychological survey experiments. We had 3 projects which required 3 write-ups, and various mini-assignments between. weekly quizzes from the (pretty interesting) reading...",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Even if you are not a psychology major, it may be interesting since you get to conduct experiments. Professor Ahn is very skilled at remembering names.",
    "Terrific class. Don't be discouraged by the terrible evaluations from previous years. The blue book says the class meets twice a week, plus section. Professor Ahn actually structures the class into two sections plus one lecture per week. The majority of your grade is based on three projects- an observational project, a small group project, and a final, individual project where you design your own study on whatever topic you'd like. There are weekly quizzes and a small, non-stressful final exam as well. Professor Ahn is so dedicated. If you're a psych major, there's no reason not to take this class to fulfill your research methods requirement.",
    "it's not really an option for psych majors. but if you don't have to take it, don't.",
    "Basic psychology research methods. Great to fulfill the research methods requirement.",
    "This is a very good course. If you are planning to get a BS in the psychology major I would highly recommend this course to help you learn how to write your final research paper. Actually, if you plan to do any research at all, this would be an excellent course to take. The writing style is VERY different from all other types of academic disciplines and it takes some getting used to. I will say that though the course is not necessarily difficult, it does have a lot of assignments. There are three main papers, also two presentations (not that bad, from a person who fears public speaking), a midterm (not worth much), weekly quizzes during the first half of the course (not hard at all: if you do the reading you will do well. I know people say this all the time, but it's actually true, they're just simple multiple choice\/true-false\/fill in the blank)and other miscellaneous tasks. Still this course is useful and Professor Ahn is really amusing and attentive to student needs. She makes you feel as if she understands what we are going through as students. She was very dedicated to the course. She used to be the DUS of Psychology but decided to give up the position to teach this course because Yale has never really had a decent standard Research Methods course before...thus you can tell that she is committed to the cause! The class is uniquely structured in that despite what OCI says, one class a week is a lecture and the other two are sections. This is nice because you get the chance to work in a small class setting with your TA. Overall, I think this course is probably more effective than the other research methods courses and a good option for psych majors.",
    "Really enjoyable! Take it if its with Professor Ahn!",
    "It was a fast-paced course, with some due date always around the corner, but all-in-all, a great ride! A great hands-on introduction to the world of psychological and sociological research. I would recommend taking some form of Stats beforehand.",
    "It was a lot of work. but I learned a lot. Professor Ahn and the TF's really want you to succeed and will help you improve.",
    "AGH dont take it unless you have to",
    "Lots of work. Work hard and start things early if you want a decent grade. Unfortunately this is a requirement and I don't know what to recommend, but Woo-Kyoung Ahn is energetic and makes lectures fun - even if they are at 920.",
    "a ton of work. but it's a requirement for psych majors so you probably have to take it anyway. i think because it was the first year that they reformatted the class, they were overambitious with the workload. I really hope for the sake of future classes they narrow it down to two papers or do something to help out the students because I was very exhausted by this class.",
    "If you have to take research methods for the psych major, I would try to take this class with Professor Ahn.",
    "I would recommend the class for sure",
    "Actually like a roller coaster. Tons of work but also pretty rewarding.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class with Prof. Ahn. She makes such an incredible effort to get to know and help out each one of her students, even though it's a decently-sized lecture class. You learn everything that you need to perform your own research project. Even though the workload sounds intimidating at first (projects, multiple papers, quizzes almost every week, and a relatively easy final), the process is streamlined so that it never feels overwhelming. Plus, the readings are pretty short and fun to do, so I never felt like I was spending too much time on this class. Seriously, you could not ask for a better research methods experience. One thing is that I would recommend taking stats before this class; we did learn how to do the most basic statistical procedures in this class, we didn't have enough time to go over why we were doing the tests that we were doing, and I'm sure that I would've been confused if I hadn't taken stats before.",
    "Yes, take the course! It's really helpful if you want to write psychology\/scientific research papers in your future.",
    "If you're a psychology major, you have to take it. That being said, Prof. Ahn was fantastic, a funny lecturer, and really devoted to the class. I learned a lot about research methods in psychology without reading straight out of a textbook (the way the class is structured is really hands-on), and know that it will be really helpful for my senior essay.",
    "I came into this class with really low expectations given past reviews (with different professors). However Professor Ahn has done a fantastic job turning the class around. She makes research methods fun and interesting, and her efforts are validated by the fact that class is usually full at 9am. Bear in mind, this class has A LOT of work and there is never a moment when something isn't due. However when you look back you realize just how much you've learned.This class teaches you all you need to know about coming up with a good experiment, conducting it correctly, and writing it up. Plus the TAs are great and spend a lot of time giving you feedback so you know where to improve.I can't say enough great things about this class. Do yourself a favor and take it!",
    "SO MUCH WORK. Most of it's pretty straightforward, but you'll always feel like you're falling behind because there are so many assignments to keep up with. Professor Ahn is great. She's strict about rules, but as long as you're working hard she'll go out of her way to help you do well in the class. Still, don't take the class unless you have to. There's nothing terribly interesting about it and it'll take up a lot of your time.",
    "This class was awful for a number of years and now it's FANTASTIC. I did not expect to enjoy research methods, but it was wonderful. Very, very helpful if you want to become a researcher. It also had just the right amount of work.",
    "It's a requirement for the psych major, but I would recommend it over the other research methods options. Very reasonable workload, great, helpful professor and TA's, and very informative.",
    "Recommend. Things you absolutely need to know if you are a psych major.",
    "In past years it has been a drag, but professor Ahn really turned it around and made it not only manageable but enjoyable. There is a lot of work, every week, but if you keep up you are guaranteed a good grade.",
    "Awesome way to get a WR out of the way if you prefer scientific (simple) writing. Professor Ahn is very funny and the class was never stressful. Expectations for grading were quite clear for this type of course. You get to know your classmates in your section quite well. Good progression of papers (observational study, group study, individual study). One of the most relaxed and enjoyable classes I've taken at Yale. Would definitely recommend.",
    "A class about how to conduct research and write a psych paper. I'd recommend it with Professor Ahn - she was very funny and easy to follow.",
    "Challenging, but I now know how to give a good presentation and write a precise research paper.",
    "You\u0092ll definitely learn a lot though it\u0092s quite a bit of work. Meets 3 time a week; one lecture, two sections. You\u0092ll conduct three experiments and write a paper for each (10-15 pages). You\u0092ll also learn how to use SPSS and Qualtrics. Quizzes every week on the readings (they\u0092re easy as long as you do the reading, which is pretty quick). There\u0092s also a presentation and an easy exam to check your understanding.",
    "yes, its a really hard class with lots of random assignments, but at the same time its good because it gives you a chance to get your grade up with each little thing you do. Prof Ahn revamped this course to be a WR this year so your papers will be a large part of your grade, but she lets you revise them so its really not too bad. definitely a more fun class than has traditionally been talked of, so cant complain there!",
    "I took this class as a WR credit. Don't do what I did. Take this class only if you need it. I was nicotine free for seven months, and this class drove me back to smoking. It turned out to be one of the most difficult classes I've taken.",
    "No this course was much more work than needed to be. only take this if you need to for the major.",
    "Absolutely, but only if you're willing to put work into it. Compared to other research methods classes my friends have taken, this seems to be a lot more work than other research methods courses. That said, I've learned more in this class than I have learned in any other class at Yale hands-down. Best class I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "If you don't need it for the psychology requirement I wouldn't recommend taking it. If you ARE a psych major, though, it's a good way to get a WR and the research requirements out of the way simultaneously",
    "You have to take it for the psych major. Otherwise, you should avoid it.",
    "Though this is a requirement, it is actually an amazing class that gives you the opportunity to do research rather than just reading about it. Probably my favorite psych class at Yale.",
    "It's a pre-req for the major, and a good way to get that pre-req out of the way. It's a hard class, and not particularly fun (although designing your own experiments can be rewarding if you put the effort into finding something cool to study), but you definitely learn a lot.",
    "This course was very helpful in teaching you exactly how to do and write up research. However, there was a lot of work with something pressing due every week. One of the better options for psychology majors in terms of research methods.",
    "A difficult and time-consuming class intended for psychology majors. Only take it if you have to for the research methods requirement. It may be easier to get a good grade than in other research methods courses, but it is a lot of work.",
    "It's a fine class and you probably have to take it. I had fun overall doing the projects, but they are time-consuming and you actually must go to class to get good grades. Don't freak out about the initial grading metric, because the revisions help a lot, and when I made the corrections suggested, I found it easy to get an A.",
    "Fellow Yale student: If you think that getting paper cuts in the eyes is fun and enjoyable, then definitely take this class. If not, choose some other psych\/writing course. This was horrible. There is WAY too much work, and if you are a stiffler for getting an A or an A-, do NOT take this course, because you won't get either."
