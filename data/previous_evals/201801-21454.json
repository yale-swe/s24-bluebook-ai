    "A major weakness of this course I felt was the flip classroom. While it does work in some subjects, in this particular class it resulted in very few people attending class as there was little motivation to go if you understood the material. But even if you did have questions, the prospects of them getting answered were not very good. It felt like instructors did not prepare material to cover (after all they are not expected to lecture) and thus when a question was asked, it would take instructors a while to come up with an answer if they came up with an answer. The group work did not improve conditions because often times the only people that were in class were the ones that did not understand the material and needed help. Often times, when I worked with someone neither of us knew how to do the problems and when we asked the instructors for help, were directed to continue discussing the problem which did not result in progress as we, again, did not understand the material and would like to be taught it. The fact that the problems on these group worksheets came from the textbook then led to us solving these problems on our own anyways after class, by ourselves. I do not believe I ever finished one of the worksheets in class. It did not help that it would take the remainder of class for the class and the instructor to understand the problem the instructor chose. I also felt that the questions section of the quizzes were not taken seriously. I do not recall a single time that my questions on these quizzes were addressed in class, again another demotivator to go to class. I stopped asking questions after spring break; they were not being addressed. If instead of the online lectures, which a student cannot interrupt to ask questions, the lectures were in class, I would get the opportunity to ask questions as soon as they come up and not get lost as the lecture progresses. With the online lecture videos, if you did not understand the beginning (which often happened to me) then the rest was not going to make sense. That being said, this particular math department does offer a lot of support to struggling students and I greatly appreciate that. The coaching sessions and peer tutors were incredibly useful. But it would be better if the class was designed to be the support I obtained from the peer tutor and coaching session.",
    "The biggest weakness of the course is the emphasis placed on the \"flipped classroom\" structure of learning.",
    "Class was not very helpful. Professor needed to be more comfortable with the content.",
    "Strengths- many practice problems and great resources in terms of tutoring. Weaknesses- classes were not the most engaging.",
    "This class is a flipped class. For me, the videos that you had to watch before coming into your section were not helpful at all. They were very theoretical and made the concepts very confusing. Going to class is very important for understanding what is going on.",
    "Strengths: it really is a self guided class. I felt that I had the resources to succeed in this class without attending Weakness: the videos are redundant when it comes to lecture. We go over the same thing twice which makes attending class pointless if you get it the first time",
    "Weaknesses: Flipped class. Why have a teacher if you have to teach yourself the material beforehand anyways. No incentive to attend. Strengths: Few come to mind",
    "I think that the videos did not work that well for me, it helped more if someone explained it in person. However reading the lecture before it was taught was very helpful."

    "If this class were not required for their major, no I would not recommend it.",

    "Your standard math class with the flipped model. Not my favorite style but it vibes with some people. Honestly it just ends up being the videos you watch before class again",
    "I mean if you have to take it, do it. Its not a fun class but isnt that hard if youre good at math. Hopefully youre good at teaching yourself the material.",
    "Yes, because it is a necessary level of math that everyone should learn.",
    "For an econ major, no. It was not pertinent to non-math majors really in any way."
