   "comments": [
    "not my favorite but a pretty cool class. fun to be in the BAC and use its spaces and collections.",
    "1 short paper, 1 long paper. Easy workload (readings aren't always necessary) but you have to participate in discussion.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in any type of art, because learning about looking at art and displaying it, applies to all kinds of art at all times. However, you need to be interested and work independently in order to get the most of this class, because you may not get too much out of going to the seminar itself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I came with a background in Victorian literature, and the class really enriched my knowledge of the Victorian period. It gave me great tools for thinking about exhibition practices and improved my visual analysis skills. Imogen Hart is a delight to work with--a wonderful discussion leader and individual advisor.",
    "Highly recommended. Great teacher, interesting class space at the museum, and material that really makes art history seem particularly relevant and important in understanding British society at the time.",
    "It's definitely a course for art history majors. Even within the major, it's probably more useful for those interested in modern art or British art. If you're not sure what area of art you're interested in, it's still a good course for exposure to art-historical theory and criticism (you read a LOT)."
