   "comments": [
    "This is an introduction to trends in 19th century art, focusing on France but with reference to other countries as well. It is structured much like other art history classes, but with much more reading and less visits to the art gallery. Definitely take it if you're interested in French cultural history or modern art in general.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Carol Armstrong is incredibly knowledgeable, the time period is so interesting, and the images are fascinating. The readings are amazing, they range from canonical art historical texts to contemporary interpretations that really round out the perspective in class. Get Max Rosenberg as a TA if you can, he is phenomenal.",
    "I could not recommend this course whole-heartedly. The works covered are interesting, but the lectures are sub-par. There are too many readings.",
    "This class covers good material in art history. The lectures are not the best; they're pretty boring and a little hard to listen to.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!Professor Armstrong is a GREAT lecturer, and the material you learn in this class is fascinating. Prof. Armstrong had very profound insights on the paintings she presented in class, and even if you think you're familiar with Manet or Cezanne, you still have a LOT to gain from her teahcing.If you are an art history major, this class is abosolutely crucial, plus you should really take something with Prof. Armstrong. If you're not an art history major, you'll still get a lot out of it. The artwork is beautiful, and you'll wish you could go to France the minute the final is over.ALSO, Prof. Armstrong also picks REALLY GOOD TAs, which is really refreshing. It means you'll be graded fairly, improve your writing\/analytical skills, and get a lot out of the secitons.",
    "Good class, interesting overview of the period. Not too much work and the tests and papers are very manageable. I'm glad I took it, and I would recommend it.",
    "This is a great survey of some of the most popular and recognizable artists in history (Monet, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Manet etc etc). I would recommend this course to anyone interested in art or museums in any way. There isn't that much work (2 7-page papers, a midterm, and a final) and section is fairly laid back. The readings for section can be lengthy, but the TAs are understanding and give you areas of focus. Plus, Professor Armstrong is brilliant (although she says \"um\" a lot in lecture). Verdict: take it!",
    "The only real objective draw back to this course (in terms of workload) is the amount of paintings, painters, and dates that you have to memorize. It is a lot of work and its intellectual purpose remains unclear to me. But all of the readings were very good (except for two resolutely bad eggs). Professor Armstrong mesmerized me. And both TAs, in everyone's estimation, were very astute, kind, and knowledgeable. 10\/10.",
    "yes definitely if you are interested in the subject or are majoring, but not for a passing interest",
    "Great course on an interesting area of study. Lectures are very well-prepared and interesting.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student for the subject matter, but not for the format of the class or the professor. Also, the papers are not bad, though there is a lot of memorization for the midterm and final."
