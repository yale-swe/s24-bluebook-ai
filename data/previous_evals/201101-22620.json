   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want to continue working on your French but probably not for fun. Even though it is a good class, there is a constant workload with a paper\/week approximately, plus extra grammar exercises, readings, and large assignments.",
    "It is a final review of important grammatical concepts and a great way to improve written language skills. It is a fair amount of work, but the gain is worthwhile. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It is a perfect balance of grammar, reading, writing, listening, and oral practice. You will see your French language skills improve a great deal.",
    "Definitely take if you took AP a couple years ago and are rusty on grammar. It is a lot of work, but it is well worth it because you will improve so much. There is enough conversation to make it good speaking practice, but also enough grammar and writing to constitute a great review of French grammar and style.",
    "Most work I've had in a language class. It's so much busy work, so much that all of the work can't fit into one syllabus. The professor sends you a detailed syllabus each week. I ended up taking this class credit\/d and worked out an arrangement with my professor where I didn't have to do all of the assignments, just because I couldn't handle it with 4.5 other credits. This is not an idea for a good fifth class. I could imagine the class being rewarding if you want to make it your top priority (or at least one of your top three priorities) class-wise for a given semester. I thought someone put it best when they said the class was basically like an 8th grade class, but in French. You relearn a lot of interesting grammar and do exercises, read some stories, write about the stories in small 200-300 word responses, write about groups of stories or books in four 700-900 word compositions (it goes up each time), you have two oral exams (which are just like simple essays you have to prepare to recite), exams that included a grammar section and a written portion where you had to use 20 of your many vocabulary words (memorized). The class was a lot of work, but I'm glad I stuck it out because I am going to France this summer.",
    "F151 is the last step in which you hammer out your grammar skills and learn to write and read French writing without hesitations. It eliminates that hesitation that instills in most students learning a foreign language.",
    "Prof. Sherak was a wonderful teacher. she was incredibly strict, not allowing for even the slightest gramatical errors, and cracking down on each spelling mistake with a heavy read pen. However, she simultaneously seemed truly invested in the progress of each of her students, taking time to see that every single one was making improvements. She was kind, and caring, and conversational. This combination made it such that i saw tremendous improvements in my french over the course of the semester."
