   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of work-- if I could do it all over again, I would take 160 instead.",
    "The texts and grammar exercises are great. This class is a lot of work, but it's interesting and fun.",
    "French 150 was a little difficult for me -- Its nice not to have class every day if you are used to 130\/140, but also still a lot of work. There is quite a lot of reading. It was really helpful for me to arrange a tutor through CLS to answer questions. Also, talking about the context of the book with friends was really helpful.",
    "French 150 is a course resembling the AP French Language high school course, because it focuses on French grammar and reading comprehension. There are bimonthly quizzes, bimonthly essays, and two oral presentations. I would definitely recommend this to a fellow student, especially with Francoise Schneider; she's a great professor who made the material exciting to review from high school.",
    "This course is a lot of work, the work isn't particularly hard and if you do it all you will get a good grade but be warned there is a lot of it and if you have Schneider, she will make you do all of it. There is lots of reading, movies, monotonous grammar exercises which you have to do (if you have Schneider), and writing. That being said, the material is interesting, and if you want to get good a French and are motivated, you will get better with this class. The abilities of the different sections varies greatly.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to other students wishing to make the step from intermediary French to a more advanced level; the 150 course is an ideal precursor to a French literature class, with just the right balance of grammar and textual readings necessary to build a solid, confident base in the language.",
    "French 150 is the lowest level L5 French class. I would recommend it to students placed in it.",
    "i would definitely recommend this class if it's the right level for you. you read short stories and novels and watch films and discuss them in class. the tests (there are 5) focus on grammar and vocabulary. you do a lot of small written exercises for each class to work on both. there are two orals and you also get frequent class participation grades. overall, a fair amount of work but not a hard class. i feel like my french has definitely improved a lot. madame schneider is absolutely the best"
