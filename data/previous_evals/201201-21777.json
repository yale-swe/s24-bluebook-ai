    "Really great class if you are interested in the material. the professors know it cold. three papers and a final is a bit tedious though",
    "YES YES YES YES YES. It's a good amount of work, but the professors are phenomenal. If you like political philosophy, or liked second semester HP in DS, you'll love this class. Deals openly and seriously with a lot of the big questions of life. (Or, at least, what I see as the big questions of life...which granted are sort of skewed towards 'what is the best kind of government' and 'what is equality'...). Whatever. This class is awesome. Take it. 3 papers and a final. It's work, but the papers are actually really worthwhile.",
    "The lectures from both professors are amazing, and the class is well worth taking. The works try to draw from things not usually discussed in DS or intro courses, so the class is ideal if you have a little background already, but want some more in depth knowledge of modern philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this course so long as you have an interest in political philosophy (which you should). The readings were by and large interesting, some were really great, and Professors Smith and Garsten were really great at conducting interesting lectures.",
    "Do not take this class as your first class in political theory. If you have taken Ancient Political Philosophy or Intro to Political Philosophy, I could hardly recommend the class strongly enough. The syllabus was (when I took it, at least) structured around texts not typically found in an intro political philosophy class; we read both big name author's secondary texts (e.g., one in which Locke argues against religious toleration) and other authors who, while important, wouldn't necessarily be the first thought of for this kind of course (e.g., Descartes). Reading the less-well-known texts of familiar authors was incredibly valuable in understanding the nuances of their thought; and of course, some of the less \"typical\" authors contributed immensely to my understanding of the Enlightenment and its legacy and the history of ideas in the West.Both professors care immensely about their students and put a great deal into their lectures. The discussion that happens after the lecture and often throughout is excellent.",
    "This is a course that asks you to think critically about the political ideas of the present day and their origins. If you are in to that, you will like this course: it is taught very well. It gives you a very good idea of the overarching story of political ideologies of the West over the last 500 years.",
    "Take it! These works are important- and you should read them before you graduate!! And this is a wonderful way to do it.",
    "Amazing class. I loved that there were two professors. It felt like an intimate lecture\/seminar, where there was ample room for discussion of ideas in the lecture, but was still a lecture."
