    "Don't take it if you're interested in cognitive science or just musical rhythm. If you're actually interested in experimental studies that merge the two then I would consider it, or else you will not be happy.",
    "Recommended for specialized students. Basically, if you have a specific, intellectual reason for wanting to take this course, then you will probably get something out of it. If not, then read through the syllabus very carefully.",
    "This class is a great seminar, with lots of good discussion and back-and-forth. Prof. Poudrier makes this class her priority, and it shows. It is a pretty heavy workload, with lots of reading and big projects at the end, but an interesting subject and taught well.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any undergraduate student.",
    "Very good theory and study of perception.",
    "A course in research methods in music cognition, with specific focus on rhythm and meter perception. Gets very in-depth into some topics, but seems to brush over others. I would recommend the course only if it gets significantly more cohesive next time it is taught."
