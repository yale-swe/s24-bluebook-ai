   "comments": [
    "It's course that delves into some of the most poignant philosophical theories of all time. I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone, and I now understand why it is a required course for EPE majors.",
    "This course is incredible when taught by Prof. Kapustin. There is a reason that everyone loves Prof. Kapustin - he is one of the most engaging, intelligent, and incredible professors at Yale! I highly recommend that everyone take this course if he is teaching it!",
    "overall yes - the material is boring sometimes but the class lectures are really interesting and professor kapustin is awesome",
    "Take it with Prof. Kapustin. He is easily the best teacher I've ever had!",
    "Recommend. Read important books and big thinkers.",
    "I'm not sure why everyoneis so excited about this course. This just involves reading a bunch of classics that you've probably read before in another class, but with mildly less interesting discussion. The professor isn't really interested in student's opinions, and nothing about the class is really intended to apply to the real world. Also, to be clear, this course is not at all multi-disciplinary; it is just a political philosophy course. On the bright side, not all that much work.",
    "Do it. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "I definitely recommend this course, even to non-EPE students who want a great foundation in some excellent philosophers.",
    "Take this course. Although it may be a lot of reading if you have not done PLSC 114 or another political philosophy course before, regardless of whether you're EPE or not, you'll probably enjoy this!",
    "I totally recommend this course. Professor Kapustin is knowledgeable and approachable; he shows great grasp of the material, promptly answers e-mails, and allows students to make their points in class. The course includes the major works that shaped the Western canon, and the readings seem to have been carefully chosen. You should definitely take this seminar.",
    "Kapustin is entertaining, nice, and measured in his approach to work and grading. Great course.",
    "Classics is required for EPE majors. I took it my Sophomore spring, although it seems that there is no rhyme or reason when to take the class (it is a matter of your personal schedule). Kapustin is wonderful. From shopping both Kapustin and Donaghue, Kapustin is far superior.",
    "You'll learn a lot about the authors, and Kapustin is a great professor. You will be in an overly aggressive class, given the majors, so be prepared for people one-upping each other constantly in class.",
    "An intense philosophical discussion once a week where you might feel like you're grasping the material during class, but then when you're on your own again, you'll end up with even more questions and uncertainty. A good survey of political\/economic philosophy, though!",
    "It's as good as people say it is. Just make sure you take a look at the reading list - it changes year by year."
