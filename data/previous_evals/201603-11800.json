   "comments": [
    "I gained a more in-depth understanding of the recent financial crises. I developed a framework to analyze financial crises and firm balance sheets.",
    "I learned a lot about the US banking system with an emphasis on the 2008 financial crisis.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the US Banking System.",
    "This class gave me a very good overview of the US Banking System, with a bit of history, a bit of math, and a fair amount on recent regulation. I would recommend to anyone interested in learning more about banks and their function in our economy.",
    "A more comprehensive understanding of the different parts of the banking system work together (their roles, their interactions). We focused a lot on how bad decisions (in hindsight) led to the financial crisis.",
    "It was a wonderful overview of the U.S. banking and financial system. Learned a great deal about the 2008 financial crisis. As a senior going into the finance industry after graduation, it was a great opportunity to learn about the industry as a whole.",
    "Great job teaching the US banking system! learn about banking assets and liabilities, leverage regulations and history in US banking",
    "I learned about the history of the US banking system, how it has evolved to get to where it is today, the global financial crisis, bond math, markets, etc.",
    "I learned so much about the US banking system. I am not an econ major, and I had never taken a course that delved into the specifics of banking before. I learned so many new terms, and I now feel like I have a much better grasp on how banking works and affects the financial system. Reading about financial news is so much more meaningful now!",
    "Economic understanding of the banking system, Dodd-Frank reform, how to look at a bank'a balance sheet.",
    "I developed a lot of understanding about the commercial banking system and its systemic and idiosyncratic risks. Since banking is so complicated, it's critical to cover balance sheets, deposits and insurance, mortgages\/Fannie\/Freddie, fire sales, securitization and structured products, and more. Fortunately, we covered all of these topics and more, to great effect."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Why do we have a final paper due before reading period and a final exam during reading period? Not the best structure.",
    "No weaknesses.",
    "Professor Pascutti is extremely passionate and willing to take time out of his day to teach students of all levels and interest in finance. The material is very useful whether or not you're going into finance.",
    "I think there could be somewhat more structure in terms of notes and handouts.",
    "Pascutti is a very engaging, entertaining professor who makes you want to listen and participate in the course. He has lots of great stories and teaches you in a way that is more accessible than other econ professors. Really loved that we got to analyze a certain firm during the crisis for one of the essays. Quizzes are more specific\/harder than you think, but if you pay attention you'll do just fine.",
    "The small class size was extremely helpful in our learning. Very interactive.",
    "long course, it was 2 and a half hours, but he always kept it interesting",
    "SO MANY STRENGTHS! It is very easy to learn in the format and size of the class and very easy to engage with the materials and ask challenging questions. It is incredibly interesting material, and taught in a way to understand but also be able to critique certain practices and regulations, deregulations, etc. The format for grading is great -- quizzes, two papers, class participation, final; many chances to bring your grade up. No weaknesses!",
    "Prof. Pascutti is a great teacher who brought so much energy to every class. I like that he gave us notes to review the day before class - it helped keep things organized. I also liked the balance sheet assessment that we did in the middle of the term. The one thing that I think could help in the future is if we had more practice problems for bond math and\/or for the quizzes. Great course!",
    "Strengths: Professor Pascutti is incredible, the material itself was very relevant and engaging. I especially liked the part of each class in the beginning when we discussed current events in the financial world. The workload was perfect. Weaknesses: guest speakers would be cool and could add some more perspectives to the class.",
    "STRENGTHS: Prof. Pascutti is fantastic and engaging; diverse survey of topics that are all important; Prof. Pascutti is very accountable about the class; grades come from a lot of different sources; good readings and discussions; generates a good understanding of the banking system. WEAKNESSES: could use some more concrete examples (possibly attained by looking more closely at numerical data or analyses); I think some more depth in particular topics, like securitized products, could be great; the papers had no prompts, assignment guidelines, or direct instructions, and so it was tough to write them."

   "comments": [
    "This class teaches you a lot about analyzing financial crises and firm balance sheets. However, the final exam is during reading period and the final paper is due before reading period. Not the best structure. Pascutti is a nice guy and does provide lecture note outlines, which is very helpful for quizzes. His grading is strange, and he tends to have reached conclusions about certain topics without being open to other interpretations. He might appear open to them, but it is better to go with a mainstream view than a non-mainstream one for the grade. Overall, I'd recommend the class for the exposure to balance sheet analysis and engagement with financial markets.",
    "I found this course very interesting. There are weekly readings and short responses. The instructor cares a lot about the class and takes feedback very seriously.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. You will never get a professor who cares more about a subject or his students like Professor Pascutti. The grading is extremely fair. The quizzes were neither easy nor extremely difficult, and the papers helped me understand the material more. Very highly recommend this class.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're interested in finance",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Prof. Pascutti is very knowledgeable and cares a ton about making this class great. It provides a very solid overview of banks and their function in the US economy.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can get into it! Not very mathematically rigorous but super interesting.",
    "It was a wonderful overview of the U.S. banking and financial system. Learned a great deal about the 2008 financial crisis. As a senior going into the finance industry after graduation, it was a great opportunity to learn about the industry as a whole. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in finance or the banking industry.",
    "YES, a thousand times yes! This was an incredible econ seminar -- and overall, the best class I have taken at Yale thus far (I took this in the fall of my senior year). Professor Pascutti is truly amazing, and is so passionate about the subject which is contagious. He is willing to work with you and explain the material in many different ways so that you will understand. Not an incredible amount of work - class participation\/weekly emails; 3 quizzes; midterm paper; final paper; final exam. Lots of chances to show your knowledge and to engage with the material. TAKE THIS CLASS - I could not recommend it more!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Prof. Pascutti is a committed, engaging teacher who is always available for help. I came in not know much about the banking system, and I learned so much. The workload was very reasonable, and the readings were interesting.",
    "100% take this class, especially if you're a senior Econ major or just looking to learn about the banking sector and the challenges it faces today. Pascutti is an absolute legend, hands down the most engaging lecturer at Yale. He drives over an hour each way to New Haven for just a couple hours of office hours. He'll discuss serious stuff like Fannie's failure and mix in hilarious personal anecdotes. He was on the front lines in finance during the last 25 years, so he has a wealth of knowledge and is always happy to answer questions. He calls on students very frequently but never in a negative way. The culture in his classroom is intellectual but lighthearted and funny. You will learn an incredible amount about an industry that's always changing and is highly important to understanding today's economy. Strongly strongly recommend this class - one of the best if not the best seminar I've taken at Yale in my 4 years.",
    "Definitely recommend! One of the few classes of its kind at theory-driven Yale, this class will give you a solid grounding and understanding of the structural risks to the banking system. Further, if you want to understand the truths and myths of parts of the financial system (even if you don't want to study finance), this class is a must-take. Professor Pascutti is quite the chiller, really engaged in class, and is responsive to feedback and suggestions."
