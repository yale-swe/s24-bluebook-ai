   "comments": [
    "Music 210 is obviously necessary for a music major, but any musician would truly benefit from it. Besides being a great introduction to composition, it will greatly improve your ear and overall understanding of music. It is entirely manageable and the grade is completely based on homework and projects. The textbook is a little dry, but Rick Cohn is absolutely brilliant and wonderful.",
    "I took Music 210 because I wanted to do lessons for credit. However, this course is very helpful in terms of learning the fine details of late 18th century composition. Although a lot of the chords we studied were review, I learned a lot more about the intricacies of voice leading, counterpoint, and special techniques.",
    "Good course; it is quite difficult if you cannot play an instrument--piano would have really helped. Rick Cohn is quirky but a very knowledgable professor and a very nice man.",
    "A good, solid grounding in music fundamentals. I highly recommend this course if looking for a broader understanding of music.",
    "If you are interested in learning the basics of music theory, this class is perfect. It doesn't move too quickly and I found the part-writing assignments fun. Even though, you basically learn how to write late 18th C classical music, you can easily apply what you learn to other styles. The class isn't too much work and it's awesome. Even if you're not a music major, you should take this course.",
    "This class was able to cover a large chunk of the theory of late 18th century music. After looking back, I was quite impressed by the amount of material we covered. This class could be improved by covering more non-protoytpical composers, like Beethoven. This class is most concerned with the nuts and bolts of theory. If you want to be a music major, or are taking lessons for credit, you have to take this class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR COHN! My favorite class this semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend Music 210 to another student - it vastly expands a functional knowledge of harmony, and if you enter the class like I did, well-versed in theory but less than knowledgeable about how to apply it to compose, it will do wondersfor you. I do have to warn that the daily homework takes a while, especially if you want to achieve high marks, as there are usual small things you will forget that will be deducted severely, but overall a worthwhile class."
