    "Holly Jones was not very helpful or invested in this course. She used the discussion sections that she led to complain about the amount of work she was asked to do compared to the pay scale her job was in. To me, this is an inappropriate discussion to have with her students. She was in charge of grading our final project, because she would be impartial given that she had not read our papers on which our final projects were based. She made it clear that she had no interest in grading our projects, which makes it difficult to want to invest time in completing the project. Compared to other TAs I have had at F&ES, I was quite disappointed.Professor Schmitz did a good job trying out a new class. I think overall there was some miscommunication about his expectations for us and our expectations for the class. I know he is concerned about meeting the needs of all students (as far as making the class accessible, covering enough topics, etc.) but I still think the class could benefit from being more focused and more advanced.",
    "The class is mainly focused on explaining biogeography theory, and only a few times the link to conservation was elucidated. I was expecting more of this, a practical approach to modern day biogeography.The Professor is very knowledgeable and approachable, and presents an outside view of the school as well as of the subject which brings novelty into the classroom",
    "The course material was interesting and Dr. Stevenson really knows his material, he is very knowledgable, easy to talk to, and interesting to listen to. The pace of the class was really relaxed and slow--there were no out of class assignments at all until the final. It wasn't always clear what the reading assignment was for each week and how it correlated with the lectures. Overall the lectures were a little scattered and didn't seem to build toward anything, lots of repetition."

    "The fact that the emphasis was on coming to class and learning from the lectures, not on completing assignments or worrying about grades. It was nice and small and the instructor was dynamic and interesting to listen to.",
    "The overview of the theory as explained by the ProfessorHe consolidated many dispersed ideas on biogeography",
    "The field trip to the botanical garden, and Professor Stevenson's lectures were always interesting.",
    "The class was very friendly and mellow, it was enjoyable to be there if that is what you are looking for. Dr. Stevenson is a really nice and open professor, it felt like having a relaxed discussion with your friends about biogeography. Work was very light. The field trip to the botanical garden was really interesting."

    "Good opportunity to learn another side of conservation and a different aspect of ecology (outside of the biology facet).",
    "Understanding the migration and distribution of species (trees in my case) at the geological-scale can provide important insight into the nature of the current ecosystem configuration. Not only biologically but also ethically (where does the forest we know today comes from?) and predictive power (what will it happen to it if current conditions change-as they are?)personally, this class reinforced the concept of 'ecosystem instability' which challenges the primary state of forests. this concept is essential to the protection and sustainable useof the so-called 'tropical secondary forests' which under the current view are seen as resource-deprived. However, it very well could be that these 'nutrient-deprived secondary forests' are the first stages of the mature forests we observe today. This may sound obvious, but it isn't in reality and has important conservation implications",
    "I am interested in the conservation of biodiversity, and this course helps put the current distribution of biodiversity into a bigger historical\/geographical context.",
    "I am studying ecology and this seemed to fit in well, however, not sure I really learned much."

    "Yes and no. Yes, because I learned a lot about many other groups of organisms and thus less time was devoted to trees and forests which are my main interest",
    "Not really, it was a pretty thin class. If you have never had ecology or biogeography before it might be more worth it, but it is a lot of repetition if you have background in the material. But the field trip was fun and it was a good review of the concepts.",
