   "comments": [
    "This class is a big drop off in work from 150 simply because students only meet three times a week. Still, it is a great way to maintain your Chinese ability, though by this level, you won't advance very far beyond your current level without immersion opportunities and whatnot. The topics of the lessons and conversations are interesting and fun and Shen laoshi is really nice.",
    "Shen laoshi is very nice and also very flexible with homework. However, to be honest, this class didn't add anything to my Chinese. I barely retained what I had from CHNS 150. We didn't have much chance to speak up or drill in class. Also, the material is not that challenging. Try to get into a higher level one if you can.",
    "Chinese 154 is the logical follow-up to Advanced Chinese II. Take it if you're not feeling bored with the regular Chinese Sequence at Yale. If you're looking for more of a rigorous challenge, try one of the other L5 courses.",
    "This is not a good follow up course to a summer\/semester experience in China. You should take one of the Chinese lit or film classes instead. It is difficult to maintain your fluencyin Mandarin due to the lack of speaking time in class.",
    "I didn't find Chinese 154 useful to my particular aims, but I also have a strong interest in literature and I really wanted to improve my reading proficiency in that direction this year so that I could read formal and literary writing (including media Chinese) on my own time and so that I would be well-prepared for literature courses in the Yale department afterward. I didn't feel that Chinese 154 helped to that end, but I could see Chinese 154 helping a lot for a student who was less advanced in Chinese than I was (closer to 150 level) or less interested in developing skills in reading and more interested in a straight \"language\" course.",
    "If you want to say that you have proficient Chinese, you really need to take this last year of the language track, and probably do some study abroad as well. You really can't get around it. Plus, this course is a lot more fun and interesting than the earlier levels.",
    "Yes, If you want to keep learning chinese after 151, 154 is a great class.",
    "People's standard complaint about Chinese after the first year is that you never make as much progress as during the Light fellowship and that your Chinese abilities decay just as a result of a less rigorous program and the fact that you are no longer using the language each day. Given that this attrition is inevitable, I'd still recommend these courses just to maintain the reading and writing you have gained while learning new vocab incrementally."
