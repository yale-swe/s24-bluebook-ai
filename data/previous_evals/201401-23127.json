    "Graduate level, second semester quantum mechanics, a pretty standard class.This really is only appropriate for Physics\/Applied Physics PhD students, or those planning on enrolling in a PhD program",
    "We sort of all have to take it, so I don't know about recommending the class to a fellow student, though it's definitely fundamental to one's knowledge of physics so that is important. The class provides an overview of more advanced topics in quantum mechanics.",
    "It is one of the most difficult core courses. The homework's are very tough and the exams are brutal but it is an essential course.",
    "Glazeman will grill you with problem sets and hard tests... but you will learn!!",
    "Well, unfortunately this is a mandatory class, so of course one has to take it to do well on the quals. But otherwise, no, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would strongly recommend it to every student majored in physics, it's basic and necessary. We need to take this course before we can understand quantum field theory.",
    "Tough nd interesting. Especially if you are working in condensed matter physics or related.",
    "I highly recommend the class",
    "I would recommend this course (it is a requirement); however, it was the hardest course I took this semester.",
    "Great application of quantum mechanics taught by a great professor.",
    "Awesome course, you need it.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course.",
    "It was approximately what I expected for a Quantum II course. It was definitely difficult. The midterm and final seemed excessively difficult.",
    "Of course yes. This is a course worth taking twice."

   "comments": [
    "The course material is fairly important to my future career and research, but because of the problems addressed above, I can't say my understanding is \"deep.\" I absolutely learned of phenomena and methods that will be useful to me, but I wish I had learned them better.",
    "This didn't really contribute to my dissertation\/research in any way, but it depended my general physics knowledge in the fundamental fields.",
    "This course is essential for a student in physics. So from this point of view it helps a lot.",
    "I work in Quantum Computation. It formed a base of ever research activity I am doing.",
    "Make me realize that quantum mechanics is interesting.",
    "The contents are closely related to our research and some problems from problem sets give me very clear physical pictures."
