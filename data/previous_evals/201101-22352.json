   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course for anyone interested in Hist of Brazil. Warning - You won't get much of 20th cent history, so be ready to focus on the colonial period and the first republic.",
    "Definitely. There are some classes which I would say that only people in need of rest-of-world credits should take. This is not one of them. History of Brazil and Daniel Botsman's History of Japan are two rest-of-world classes which I, as an American history concentrator, would have enjoyed regardless of distribution requirements. It's a fascinating course, and Professor Schwartz is an unparalleled expert. Take it!",
    "The class is about the reasons that Brazil remains as it is today. You get an idea of the major themes throughout the history, the social tensions and the colonial period very well. You will not spend much time on the modern history, however. I ended up writing my paper on more modern times so it let me study it further, which was very interesting.",
    "I loved History of Brazil. I have learned so much about Brazilian history in one semester, and the history itself is fascinating. The main weakness is that it tries to cover 500 years in one semester, and we rushed through more recent history. Professor Schwartz is great and the workload was manageable. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Definitely take it. I'm an American history person (the United States of America) traditionally, but taking this class made me wish I had more exposure to Latin American studies.",
    "I think Brazil is an up and coming world power and is an interesting country to learn about that I didnt know about.",
    "Includes all the history of Brazil from Portugal's colonization of it to almost the present. Good overview of a country currently projected to become a world superpower. Interesting facts and development to know.",
    "No",
    "Definitely take it, great ROW history. Don't really have to do the readings, and the lectures are easy to follow.",
    "Take this class if you need a ROW without too much work.",
    "This is a standard history lecture. Survey course on Brazil \u0097 1 midterm, 1 final, 1 5-7pp. paper. Very laid back, but interesting and engaging. I'd recommend it if you're into Latin America or Brazilian culture!",
    "Yes, take this class...both if you are a history major and need a 300 and if you just want to take a not too difficult interesting elective.",
    "This course covers about 500 years of Brazilian history, from its founding up through the late 20th century. The work is reasonable for a history course (section, a short paper, midterm and final) and it's great to take if you're at all interested in Brazil or need a good credit to take to fulfill the history major requirements.",
    "If you're a Latin American Studies major or are genuinely interested in Latin America, you will enjoy this course. Professor Schwartz is adorable, knowledgeable, and extremely passionate about his area of focus. There is a lot of reading, but you don't have to do it all to do well in the course. However, be aware that this class WILL be populated with uninterested history majors looking to fulfill their non-Western history requirement. On the one hand, you will probably be much more knowledgeable about the subject and will be able to make broader connections to Latin America generally, on the other hand a class-full of senior history majors chilling on facebook during lecture might get under your skin. This is not a reason to not take the class though - it's great and I slightly preferred it to Prof. Schwartz's Colonial History of Latin America if you're choosing between the two.",
    "yes i would definitely recommend it. its easy and its interesting amterial",
    "This course is similar to other history lectures at Yale -- but it's on a great\/somewhat unusual topic, and the lectures themselves are interesting and engaging. I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn more about Brazil\/Latin America generally, or if you're just looking to explore an area of history you've never learned about before! It's not too difficult either. The workload is light but you still learn a lot of interesting stuff.",
    "This course will offer you a really comprehensive look at Brazilian history from about 1500 to the present. Professor Schwartz also includes a lot of social history, like history of Samba, to supplement the political\/economic history that is pretty standard for a history lecture course. Some of the readings got too far into alternative\/revisionist\/Marxist theories of Brazilian history for an introductory history, and it's hard to apply that critical eye to a history you are just becoming familiar with on a factual level. That aside, however, it's a very solid course that I recommend without hesitation. It has made me really want to see Brazil and maybe even learn Portuguese.",
    "I recommend History of Brazil as one of the better World History lectures as well as a great lecture for the history department in general; don't miss Prof Schwartz before stops teaching the course; a good amount of reading, but you can learn to focus on specific chapters and issues",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, probably one of the best rest of worlds available. Schwartz is a really great professor, but there is a lot of reading.",
    "Yes. It's a good ROW history, solid lecture, doable workload. It skims over the 20th century pretty quickly, but you get a good sense of how Brazil has developed over multiple centuries.",
    "Professor Schwartz does what most other professors teaching Rest of the World classes don't do: provide the political history of the region. This is essential because otherwise you will forget everything 2 weeks after taking the course and feel as if you were wasting your time in the class. Hence, I feel as if I will remember much of Brazilian history for a long time. Schwartz is a lively and engaging lecturer, and he gives a great overview of Brazil's 500 year history. Highly recommended.",
    "Professor Schwartz is a great lecturer, and you will definitely learn something!",
    "Brazil is a fantastic option for a rest of the world class in the history major. If you are looking for a class for this reason OR if you just want to take a good course with a reasonable workload on an area you know nothing about, take this class. Professor Schwartz's lectures presented the material in a dynamic way, incorporating personal accounts, paintings, photographs, and other primary documents. I liked how he spanned the entirety of Brazil's history and made connections to the development of the colonies--something more accessible to us. Now I feel like I understand this area of the world so much more.",
    "Yes, Professor Schwartz is a very engaging lecturer and the material is really interesting.",
    "I would recommend it for ROW. It was interesting and relevant and professor schwartz knows what he is talking about. the work is manageable and interesting. fun to learn about a country that is so big but that you don't know that much about.",
    "I took this to satisfy my history major requirements. It was a great choice. The lectures were interesting, the paper topic was of your choosing, and the midterm and final weren't too difficult.",
    "A surprisingly interesting class, given the dryness of Schwartz's early lectures. Give it a chance and you'll really start to savor the weirdness of Brazilian history. A decent oasis within the regrettable desert of \"Rest of the World\" history courses.",
    "History of Brazil is interesting, because Brazil's an interesting country especially as a counterpoint to the US and the other Latin American countries. It's useful to understand this country, as it is one of the rising BRIC nations. The class was solid but not riveting. I would say the same for Professor Schwartz's lecturing and for the readings. There doesn't really seem to be any \"must-take\" rest-of-the-world credits, though (which is unfortunate), so this is a good choice."
