    "This is a great course. It's very challenging but very rewarding. I would highly recommend this course to anyone, in any discipline, with an interest in formal models and political economy. John's approach is unique and insightful in many ways. The greatest part is that John gives students the tools to critically assess the \"models as window dressing\" used by social scientists. You will learn how to interpret and create basic models and be introduced to more advanced ones.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 517 to a student who had already taken a microeconomics course and was comfortable with the material. I do not believe that other students have been able to learn a great deal from this class.",
    "For students without an econ background, a more intensive math review than the poli sci math camp is needed prior to this course. Overall, a useful course but may be difficult to take during the first semester in addition to a full load that includes other methods courses.",
    "An intense course that is equivalent microeconomic preparation as an economics major."

    "I learned a lot about modeling. But the biggest point I want to make is this: I see almost no reason whatsoever why this course needs to be a prerequisite to take the game theory course next semester. If it is, there needs to be a much more coherent narrative that guides the formal modeling sequence. As it is right now, I feel that my time would have been better spent taking a different class, assuming that I could then take game theory.",
    "The course provided an interesting engagement of a few specific models. I am not sure how useful this will be to my future research.",
    "Increased understanding of why scholars work from models. Prereq for game theory course."
