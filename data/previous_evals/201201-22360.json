    "Pros: You learn a lot about a region of the globe that's becoming more and more important. It's fascinating history. There's no final exam, which really lays off the pressure at the end of the semester. Just two small papers (2 pages w\/presentation), a midterm, and a final paper.Cons: Lecture is kind of hard to follow. Readings vary in quality.All and all I'm very happy I took the class.",
    "If you're interested in SE Asia, take this class. I've learned a lot from this class. It is a mixture of grad\/undergrad students but there's really no curve in the class and the grad students don't take the midterm, so it doesn't really matter. You do have to attend lecture and section, but there's no final, just a final paper, which is great. Go sit in on tr first lecture, it's pretty representative of the rest of the lectures.",
    "Southeast Asia cannot possibly be a fundamentally uninteresting place, but that's what this course made it. Don't take it. Professor Kiernan knows an incredible amount and seems nice, but this is a lecture and he lectures with a monotonous voice. However, what killed it for me was the TA, persnickety and with a tendency to go off on tangents, so if it were a different TA it might not be so bad. Lots of reading every week, unless you have a chill TA who won't care if you don't do it.",
    "This course fell into that unfortunate category of classes that look good at first but end up disappointing you. That the lectures weren't going to be thrilling was obvious from the beginning, but there was only a midterm and an eight-page paper, no final. And the original posting on OCI said that there wouldn't be any discussion sections. Sounds perfect, right? Except that there actually were sections, and the sections turned what would have been a standard ROW lecture course into something that kept making me want to bang my head against the wall. The TA, Brian Turner, majored in agricultural studies as an undergrad and is studying the economic history of Southeast Asia, so he would go on in section for fifteen minutes about the rice crop in Cambodia and we would all fall asleep. Plus we had to do two oral presentations in section over the course of the semester, which we then had to turn into two-page summaries. This wouldn't be that big a deal except that we had to read a bunch of extra books on the lecture topic we were presenting on, which meant a lot of extra work. To be clear, the course material itself is valuable stuff\u0096\u0096recent history of a region almost none of us know much about\u0096\u0096and Ben Kiernan is possibly the world's greatest expert on the Cambodian Genocide. If the sections would go away, then this would be a decent course that I would feel I could recommend. And if there were a different TA, and there were more people in each section (there were six and eight people in the two discussion sections this year because the grad students didn't have to do section), then it would also be better. As is, I wouldn't recommend it unless you really want to learn the material and can deal with a lot of inanity and boredom.",
    "Relatively interesting material if you need a rest of the world requirement. Kiernan seems like a boss and has contributed a lot to the modern understand of Southeast Asia history, but he writes better than he lectures. It's not great, but it's a rest of the world that's not too difficult.",
    "Interesting class, definitely worth taking",
    "I think that the class is a decent ROW credit for history majors.",
    "This class provides a good overview of Southeast Asia, essential for anyone who wants to learn more about this increasingly important region.",
    "Interesting overview",
    "This class is pretty boring, regardless of interest in the subject. It does not have much work, and the section is easy, but you will be bored."
