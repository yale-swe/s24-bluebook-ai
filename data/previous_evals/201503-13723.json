    "Yes. Fantastic course for anyone interested in journalism, radio, or storytelling. This class gave me a creative outlet to do interesting work.",
    "But for the first couple weeks of the class when we were completing little projects--most of our time was spent working on and in class critiquing of each other's final projects. I probably did ten versions of my final project.",
    "I would recommend Radio Journalism! It was really fun, pretty low-key, and I learned a lot. A good time!",
    "Radio Journalism is a fantastic course for anyone interested in storytelling, writing, or more. Everyone should try to take it, and if you get in--definitely take it!"
