    "Recommend",
    "I think this material is very useful and I really enjoyed reading stochastic processes textbooks and working through problems. However, as it is, this course was poorly organized, and I would not recommend it unless there would be significant changes made. Otherwise, I would recommend to any student interested in stochastic processes to take the MITX online course (I completed the materials for that course simultaneously with this one, because I did not feel I was learning in this course).",
    "Would recommend for students with a little statistic background",
    "Good knowledge, but it might be a better idea to just learn it yourself.",
    "Yes!",
    "It is a great course for people who want to know renewal processes and markov chains.",
    "Wonderful!",
    "Yes.",
    "Good",
    "It gives a brief introduction of different random processes. I would recommend it to students who is interested in statistics."

    "It is a very good introduction to stochastic process."
