    "The Professor has a lot of experience which added valuable perspective to the course.",
    "David is definitely a knowledgeable and innovative planner, but the course was somewhat disorganized. The assignments were vague and unclear and it felt like the entire design of the class could have been thought through a little better in advance. The flexibility of the final paper was appreciated, but the first two assignments didn't really exist at the time the syllabus was written, and were invented as we went along. That said, the field trips were interesting and the conversational style of the lectures was engaging.",
    "Question 15- there are not alot of courses focused on urban sustainability or planning at FES. For students who have an interest in these issues areas, I would recommend this course. I would also suggest FES look at a way to expand curriculum focused in these topic areas.",
    "Professor Kooris clearly has broad knowledge in the course area; I think the class would benefit from more explicit structure. Maybe more focused case studies or directly comparing policies in a class exercise could be useful. I think three hours is too long a block for lecture. I did not find the weekly assignments useful, and it also didn't make sense to give out grades for them after all assignments had been completed.",
    "The course content was fascinating, but because the course was often structured as a discussion, the overarching framework was harder to grasp. I found structured presentations with slides to be helpful.",
    "The course was interesting and learning from an experienced practitioner like David was terrific. The lectures tended to wander, and I had a hard time identifying the themes at some points (they blended together maybe a bit too much). Also was sometimes hard to tell what was David's opinion as opposed to general planning knowledge. I really appreciated his flexibility and availability. Both field trips were a lot of fun.",
    "David did a fantastic job! I would have liked for the weekly assignments to be more rigorous, perhaps that might involve actually copying the format of a city plan. Starting the final paper earlier and discussing with peers might have been good too. Overall, I learned a ton and loved it!"

I would have liked something earlier so that I could have made changes to how I was doing the work.",

    "More clarity on what is expected for assignments, and more timely regular feedback on weekly group assignments.",
    "Some of the topics are very technical and if you don't know much background information it can be hard to understand examples. I think this class gave me exposure and basic knowledge, which isn't a bad thing. The group assignments were probably only helpful for the first two times.",
    "Design of the syllabus and class requirements, and the design of the lectures vs. discussion time.",
    "The course was somewhat disorganized at times and directions for assignments were fairly open ended. In addition, we spent most of the class listening to David lecture which was interesting, but three hour lectures can be tiring after a while. Perhaps mixing up the way students were learning in the class would be helpful.",
    "Lecture organization. The professor's real world insights are valuable, but sometimes overall concepts can be lost in the story telling.",
    "At the beginning, I felt that many acronyms were used in the class without explanation",

I would have liked to see more discussions and lectures surrounding social\/environmental injustices in cities and a deeper analysis of what could be done differently.",

    "The group work could have benefitted from clearer direction and feedback. Our group didn't receive feedback until after the group work had been completed, making it impossible to improve, which was very frustrating. The benefit of the group work was that it created an opportunity for students to discuss material outside of the lecture time.",
    "The weekly group assignment was not helpful at all for my group since we do not collectively has an interest in the same city. We ended up working on a city close by simple for the sake of choosing a city. However, we didn't know the city well enough and were not interested.",
    "Not necessarily more useful than working alone.",
    "Though my group was great, weekly group assignments were not as helpful because they became repetitive and expectations and key takeaways were not clearly defined.",
    "Learned a lot of from one of my team mates, who had more background in the field than I did. That person was really wonderful to work with. My other team mate was not at all on board, didn't do the readings, barely his part of the project, and nearly plagiarized part of our submission (thankfully caught that before handing it in). In all group projects, there should be a more formalized way to provide feedback, as I don't think all of us should have benefited equally from the work we submitted.",

It is also a great course for people pursuing different areas of study, because it gives insights into how our world is structured around us. David Kooris is an excellent lecturer, and fills class with experiences from his career as well as the basics of urban planning.",
