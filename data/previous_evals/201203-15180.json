    "I would recommend it to a fellow student: I would say it gives a good background for future more advanced study of the topic. It is a good foundation on which to build up for research projects.",
    "This course was a very worthwhile experience, and I would recommend it to all the physics graduate students. The theory becomes pretty abstracted from whatever physical system is under study, and while this abstraction is kind of a neat thing, it also makes it easy for a student to become lost in a lecture or completely miss the point of a homework problem. It took a lot of help talking with some knowledgeable friends for me to get the most out of this course. It's a fascinating class, and I wish that I'd spent more time having those discussions and thinking about the material."
