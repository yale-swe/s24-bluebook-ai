   "comments": [
    "The class is mixed with guest speakers and student performance, I like the format a lot.",
    "Good learning and exposure to broad specturm",
    "The sequence of topics and guess lecturers give a flow that aligns with the storytelling itself. I enjoyed the ability to offer concepts that helped understood the essence of storytelling, how to use art and visuals to narrate business ideas or decision (from my perspective)",
    "It's really wonderful to be in a room with non-theatre students, and all the lectures are so different and interesting. I wish we had more classes like this in the drama department. I think having more interactions with other graduate schools is so important, and it's something that we're missing in this school.",
    "IT was cool to have various artists come in each week and share their perspectives on art and communicating with the world. There were definitely some artist that sparked great conversation, and had some very profound views on how to impact the world. I left the class many times questioning my own art and how it can be used as a catylist for change."

   "comments": [
    "Might be good if the class can add some teaching, about the fundamentals of the field.",
    "The course can do with more learning techniques and more hand ins throughout semester. more discussion could be encouraged, more thinking and talking about subjects. More input from lecturer. Possibly weekly pots on learnings from class.",
    "Engagement among classmates, I barely knew people in the class as there seemed to be a disconnect. I would suggest activities that would require people to get to know each other and visual storytelling as a medium to do that.",
    "- Different classroom. There are so many people who take this course, and 101\/Annex is not the best space. Especially in the warmer months. - More opportunities to interact and communicate with students from the other schools. It's such a rare thing for us to all be in a class together, but we never really had the chance to meet one another. It's so wonderful to hear everyone's presentations at the end of the semester. Everyone's so smart and talented, and they have so much to share - it would've been great to get to know them earlier. - Wish the 2nd year costume designers could've taken this class with their fellow classmates their 1st year.",
    "1. There should be a printed list of visiting artist given at the beginning of class 2. More time should be given for final presentations, so that everyone who prepares a presentation can present. 3. Im not really sure how this can be addressed, but Some of the Artist gave great presentations, while others kind of just talked without any real direction or point. This made it easier to disengage. 4. The room is very packed and hot... could it be in a bigger room if the class is going to let that many people enroll. 5. Give better introductions to who the artists are( a brief write up could be included with the list I mention in suggestion #1)"

    "as above- great speakers- wish more time to explore them and discuss",
    "The class should help provide projects that can help people to think through the application of visual storytelling in their career.",
    "Wendall is such a wonderful and positive presence in the drama school, and I'm so appreciative of all her efforts to give us a more diverse experience.",
    "While it's great to have such a variety of artist coming in each week, it would be nice if the presentations could have even slightly a common thread...we had a presenter who was an award winning designer, but he chose to talk for an hour and a half about a failed performance of my fair lady... that was agonizing! consistancy...however that would be."
