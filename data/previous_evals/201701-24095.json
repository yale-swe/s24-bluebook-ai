    "This class gave a great sense of the themes and trends of U.S. foreign policy over the past century, as well as diving into the specifics of many important events. The class is somewhat militarily focused (though one could easily argue that U.S. foreign policy is as well) but does a pretty good job picking a good set of events to focus on. The focus of the class is the final research paper, which is a crash-course introduction to in-depth historiography and extended primary source research, which is a must for any history major.",
    "I had never written a historiography before, and this class was extremely helpful in walking me through the process and giving me the necessary materials and information to complete my paper. I also, of course, learned quite a bit of history along the way.",
    "I learned how to write an essay looking at primary sources and applying what previous scholarship had contributed to the topic in order to develop a personal argument.",
    "I definitely got better at constructing analytical historical essays, especially by using primary sources. By extension, I improved my skills as a researcher, especially in terms of ability to use archives, databases, etc. to find primary source material (but also secondary source material for historiographies, etc.)",
    "Ability to write about history, better research skills, better structure in the process of developing a long paper",
    "Ability to think critically about a specific period in history How to analyze primary documents and use the library resources How to write about foreign policy using primary documents Different themes in U.S. History (1917-2000) and a lot of background information about American Foreign Policy before that."

    "I liked the hybrid lectureseminar style of our weekly class meetings that gave Prof. Parrott a bit more time to talk and give us insights on the historical contexts of what we were about to discuss. I also liked the research paper assignment and appreciated that Prof. Parrott made us start early on it. I was a bit thrown by the early response paper assignment, which seemed to require research but also recalled more personal-opinion-based reading response assignments of other classes. Prof. Parrott should outline the expectations for that assignment a little more clearly in future classes. I appreciated the breadth of reading provided but wished the assigned readings had been a little more focused. I often felt like 80100 pages from one book were too much and I would have gotten more after that reading if I'd been able to focus on a particular section.",
    "No weaknesses. Very strong teaching style, great reads, all around great course.",
    "This is a great course. However, I think it was a bit too fast at some points, and we didn't gain a full understanding of each unit. I appreciate what Prof. Parrott was trying to achieve by assigning two updates before the final paper was submitted, but I would have liked for those two assignments to be a bit more open ended. For example, in using secondary sources I would not have written up paragraphs summarizing the arguments of each, as was assigned for one update. I think progress updates are a good way to make sure we started early and developed thinking over a period of time, but I think they could have been more open ended .",
    "Good course reading list.",
    "The readings were great and the right amount. Professor Parrott gave the exact right combination of background Le Turing and asking for conversation, and was great at creating good discussion.",
    "I think for a junior seminar there could be more reading. I don't people don't often say that, but I think it would help students get even more out of this course.",
    "Strengths: Good use of primary documents, well-designed syllabus, good lecture in class, thoughtful grading scheme (in that students had feedback on a smaller paper before the larger paper and midterm participation feedback). Weaknesses: I wish that the final paper was less weighted and that it was worth 30-40% instead, like final exams usually are. Instead having two smaller papers before the final paper would have helped student improve their writing more, I think."

    "This class killed me, but I enjoyed the process. If you are interested in the topic it is a great class, otherwise run for the hills (AKA a gut class you won't have to work like crazy for)",
    "I recommend this seminar. I took it as a sophomore and was somewhat unprepared for the reading load and the challenge of the final project. That said, the class was a great challenge for my historical abilities to conduct meaningful primary source research and read critically and comparatively. This class focused more on historiography than other history classes I've taken, which was an interesting and different approach that I found valuable. Be prepared to take on the heavy reading load and the serious endeavor of the final project (20 pages) and spread the work throughout the semester. If you can, you will get a lot out of this class, which goes way beyond AP US and will give you great insights into the trends and changes in US foreign policy over the past century.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in foreign policy and the history of the time period this is an excellent overview with very in-depth analyses and detail.",
    "Yes!",
    "Good class but a lot of reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is prepared for a heavy workload and an unusually demanding paper assignment in foreign policy. It was rewarding, overall, but it required a significant investment of time and energy, especially in terms of completing the paper and all of the tiered deadlines leading up to submission of the final draft.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes this is a solid course on the history of American foreign policy in the American century.",
    "Yes, because it helps you think about foreign policy in a holistic way and the teacher gives great lectures and makes use of resources in an effective way."
