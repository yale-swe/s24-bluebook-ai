    "NO. Really boring and you learn very little",
    "You can learn a lot about water flow and how models work in this class. The main weakness of this course is that there is too much time spent deriving equations when we should really be learning about how to apply those equations. The other weakness is the lack of similarities between our homework and our exams. The homework assignments are focused primarily on Matlab and modeling, but our exams were focused on answering questionsthat are normally found in the textbook. It would have made more sense if he assigned problems from the book so we would have had to apply the equations he derived in class.",
    "Only take this if you are actually interested in the subject matter. Otherwise it is pretty dry.",
    "Great class if you have had previous experience with water resources"
