    "I respect Curran as an artist but he is not a good instructor. Often times he showed slides on artists and their works without really telling us what to look for and how to appreciate photography as an art. Critiques were not quite constructive either. Not much feedback is provided on how to make progress from one critique to the next. What I dislike most is the final critique. First, he suddenly sent us an e-mail over the thanksgiving break and asked us to submit a proposal. Before that, there was not much discussion on how to approach the final critique. Second, in class he said the final critique would only last 3 hours. It turned out to be almost 6 hours. The class was not that organized as it had been shown in the syllabus. I've talked to my friend from another section and he seemed to enjoy the class much better. I would suggest one to take the class with a different instructor.",
    "I characterize this class as a 'project based' course with supplemental readings and the occasional field trip. I believe the course gives students a great amount of freedom to explore subject matter that they're interested in while providing an extensive survey of photography history, from the early 20th century to current practice. I would strongly recommend this class to anybody who is interested in learning the basics of photography. I believe that the instructors and the labs are a great asset to anybody who is interested in learning more about making pictures."
