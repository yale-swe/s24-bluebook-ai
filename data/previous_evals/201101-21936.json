   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a great survey of important Latin works. Prof. Freudenburg is fantastic, if you get the chance to take it with him.",
    "Okay, not wonderful. Class is more about Roman culture than the literature itself, but the exams are literature-heavy and you are expected to do the work to make up the difference. Freudenberg is great though, and I would recommend the course to anyone with a strong interest in Latin Literature yet may not be able to get through the entire reading list in Latin.",
    "If you want the chance to read a bunch of Latin works that you may never otherwise get around to, this is a great way to do it. Great class.",
    "Take it if you're a classics major and have to take it",
    "Good course-- take it for a fairly easy credit, but keep in mind you do read a fair bit. Past that, light workload.",
    "This class is definitely accessible to non-majors. The reading load is not too heavy and if you are interested in the subject matter, it can be interesting. Professor Freudenburg is a mediocre lecturer.",
    "Nominally a survey course of Latin literature, but overall much more focused on the culture of the time period. Not a problem as that was very interesting too, but probably a lot less literary analysis than you'd expect. The professor is wonderful and the lectures are truly interesting. By the end you'll have a pretty comprehensive knowledge of Latin literature (breadth-wise). A great class.",
    "Yes. The reading list for this course is fantastic, and Professor Freundenburg is a great lecturer. Keep in mind though, that a knowledge of Latin can be very helpful in this course, adn mot of the other students will be classics majors.",
    "Don't take this course if you're a Lit major. It's geared toward Classics majors; Prof. Freudenberg often discusses the Latin of the texts for a class that's supposed to be in translation. Powerpoints are unclear. Also, it's a fair amount of reading.",
    "CLCV 255 is Intro Latin Literature. You basically read the most important works of the literary tradition, which provides a great story for how the literature evolved over time. The majority of the students in the class are Classics majors who have read some, if not most, of the books, so non-majors may be weary. Despite this I would recommend the class, as it was really great. Kirk was an great professor and didn't deliver boring lectures. If I have one tip, though it might be obvious, you should do all of your reading on time, as I didn't and got wrecked on the weekly quizes. Do you reading. Take the class.",
    "This class will give you a run-through of the highlights of Latin literature. It doesn't delve particularly deeply into any work but does show the general lay of the land and may stand on its own or provide the basis for further study. For Classics majors, I understand that the course is meant to make sure that everyone has a solid common base in the material, and I think the class accomplishes that. Since the texts are treated on a fairly basic level this course is probably most appropriate in one's earlier years. It is a better foundation than it is capstone experience. It doesn't require any particular background knowledge, to the point that you will be told who Augustus is if you don't already know.",
    "A great class. Take it if you are interested in Latin Literature or literature in general. The grading is a little tough, but it is worth it.",
    "In its present form, there are some problems with its course. The chief issue is that it has to cater to a wide range of students, from dedicated classics majors to interlopers from literature and other disciplines. Naturally, this leaves no group happy. Classics majors have to take this class but would prefer not to, while literature majors who take this class can find themselves outgunned when their peers seem to have studied everything before. Take the class if you have to take it. Otherwise, look to different courses that the department offers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who is interested. Professor Freudenburg is a great teacher and has a genuine (and slightly contagious) passion on the subject matter. The workload is not too bad, but it definitely helps if you are already familiar with some of the authors that we read.",
    "For what it is, this class is great. Reading Latin poetry in English is kind of unsatisfying, and so I thought we may have spent a little too much time on that.",
    "This class had a fantastic reading list; truly the final piece to my liberal arts education. Do all the reading, because it's a treat, although there's a lot of it. Be sure you like the professor (if Kirk is teaching it again) and your TA, because they will make or break the class for you."
