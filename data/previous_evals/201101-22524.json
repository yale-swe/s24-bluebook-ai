    "TAKE IT. It will be one of your favorite courses.",
    "Definitely take this class whether or not you are interested in biology. Most of the discussions are about sex and society. You learn amazing things in this class that you wouldn't learn anywhere else. The only work this semester was a powerpoint and a paper, which you are given the whole semester to do.",
    "If you can get in, definitely take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Repro. Bio. to any student who is interested in biology, issues of gender and sex, reproduction, sex, sexuality, and the effects of these various disciplines on social issues. It's a great small seminar, where most of the work is in the way you think. There are two presentations, one final exam, and one final paper... it's definitely manageable.",
    "This seminar has come to be known as \"the sex class,\" and while it's true that it covers pretty objectively awesome material, the most valuable lesson is in exercising a different way of thinking. Harvey's just great; he's incredibly passionate about his life's work, and he challenges his students to be inquisitive and rely on their intuition. If you're interested in rooting out and discussing the ways reproduction has shaped EVERYTHING, take it.",
    "What an incredible class. Harvey is the best. Workload this semester was similar to last semester. No assignments most of the semester, then a research paper and class powerpoint presentation as the final exam. I never felt overwhelmed by the research, Harvey provided great personal interview resources and information for my topic. I am so glad I was a part of this class."
