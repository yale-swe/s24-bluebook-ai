   "comments": [
    "Fundamentals of statistics that I had no idea about before, all of the necessary basics I developed as much as I could in the time allocated in one semester.",
    "The course is very effective as an introduction to Stata--by the end of the course, I felt I had a solid knowledge base and an understanding of how to analyze real data with relatively simple tools.",
    "I learned Stata commands to conduct basic statistical analyses.",
    "A solid foundation in STATA, statistics theory, and statistics best practice with an INCREDIBLE professor.",
    "I feel super comfortable with Stata now. Think I gained more out in that department than in actual stats.",
    "Beginning multiple regression, intro stats course",
    "great intro to stats course. grieger is the most effective math professor I've ever had and class was as interesting as stats could be. He has endless patience.",
    "By far the most useful skill was learning Stata and applying it to answer real-life questions.",
    "I can't believe I actually learnt quantitative reasoning skills and enjoyed it! I think this class was an incredible introduction to statistics and it's sociological applications. Professor Grieger is out of this world amazing, really understanding and genuinely cares about all his students.",
    "I learned how to use Stata, read bi-variate and multivariate regressions and use how to use statistics in the real world.",
    "I learned stata and basic statistics, this class also gave me the opportunity to think beyond the numbers and think critically about what exactly we were trying to find from the results.",
    "This class was an incredible intro to statistics. I learned more in this class than in the other general intro to stats, and even though I consider myself terrible at anything mathy, I felt as though I really learned the material.",
    "I learned the basics of statistical analysis and also Stata, a stats program, which was completely new to me. I learned the actual mechanics behind the correlations that we see all the time in news, research, etc.",
    "Not only did I learn the statistical theory but also the programming side! Grieger teaches so much in the most relatable way ever:"

   "comments": [
    "I think it is much better than a statistics lecture course and would definitely recommend to people who want to learn the basics of statistics. The smaller class is great for engagement with the material and professor.",
    "I loved the content and I LOVED Professor Grieger. I wish we had gone through the material a little bit more quickly and then with the extra time, had more sociological discussions.",
    "Professor Grieger did a great job of explaining statistical concepts, making relevant life and academic connections, and trying to keep the class engaged in a relatively dry subject. However, the course moved much too slowly and I got bored easily. I wish the course was three times as fast and felt as if I could learn this information on my own. The problem sets included too many directions and hints, which seemed like everything was being handed to us on a silver platter. I felt like he was trying to cater to people who do not have mathematical intuition and insufficiently challenged students who were comfortable with high-level math and coding.",
    "This course is incredible.",
    "Maybe it's because I'm more STEM than a sociology major, but I wanted more from this course than it actually gave me. I think the course could have moved much faster; lectures were so slow. I love Lloyd and I know he has the potential to push this course more, whether that be incorporating more sociology or more statistical concepts - I really really wish he did so. Also, I wish we used more data sets. I think its super cool how the psets are based on real-life data sets, but using the same two for all ten of our psets got really stale.",
    "Great class, no need to change it!",
    "Please make this course meet twice a week for a shorter time. Prof Grieger is amazing, but two hours felt long. If it wasn't for his energy and enthusiasm, not sure how motivated I would have been to keep coming to class.",
    "This was the best math-heavy class I've taken at Yale. Grieger metbatudents where they were and made sure everyone had the resources to get the assistance necessary to do and learn well.",
    "I thought the entire class was great. The structure, the assignments and tests and the instructors were all amazing!",
    "I thought the class was paced well and I really liked the format of weekly problem sets and a final project that built on the skills we learned in class in a way that was applicable to the real world.",
    "Nothing but strengths!!! Prof Grieger was so helpful, TFs were so available! Homework was more of an exercise than cumbersome!"

   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend for someone looking for an intro statistics class, it is doable and possible to succeed but you have to be prepared to put in work, especially for the problem sets, but they are doable and there is always help available.",
    "yes, Professor Grieger is excellent and you will leave with a good understanding of introductory-level Stata.",
    "I took this course to fulfill a QR requirement (I'm an English major, which is a somewhat unlikely background for the class) and really recommend it--the class rewards many of the things humanities majors tend to do well, like interpretation of data and summarizing statistical output \"in layman's terms,\" since you end up doing a lot of that in the homework assignments. There's only fairly simple programming and no calculations by hand, which is also a bonus for someone who's adept at the conceptual side of things but might struggle with the math. And even better: there's no high-stakes assessments, only weekly problem sets and a take-home final. It's not a gut, in that it's a sometimes challenging course focused on developing a programming\/statistical language for thinking through important sociological issues, but it's also completely doable for someone from a non-STEM background.",
    "If you have never touched statistics or programming in your life, this is the course for you. Otherwise, it is too basic and I would recommend an econometrics or applied statistics course instead.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale looking for an introduction to statistics, especially those interested in the social sciences.",
    "This class wasn't want I expected; I think I wanted more than I actually got. This course was more about Stata than about stats. There was not much that I didn't learn in AP Stats. So, don't take this class if you're hoping for something really rigorous, but it is a fair class for those who aren't mathematically-minded or are look to improve on their Stata. It was honestly too simple for me; lectures were slow because Lloyd wanted to go through every single thing slowly. That said, Lloyd is super sweet and such a cool person, and it was a joy to see him every Tuesday. He is very invested in teaching, and that saved the course for me.",
    "Yeah Lloyd is awesome and such a great lecturer.",
    "YASS TAKE IT srsly",
    "Very yes.",
    "Overall I would recommend the course for a math credit for non math majors. I wish the section times had been organized beforehand because it is really helpful to be able to go to them but mine and a few ther classmates schedules had already been sealed by the time flsections were released so we were unable to go the usual ones. The TA's were generally pretty flexible with office hours though so that was helpful.",
    "Yes! Not too much work, very fair professor and TA, and you learn an actual skill! Stata is such a great software to know and class was pretty fun with Prof Grieger.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It's engaging, fun and useful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this especially if you're loooking for an alternative to the stat 101-109 option. You have a chance to learn the same information in a smaller class environment and you have the opportunity to get to know the professor and other students well.",
    "This class is amazing. Whether or not you have a mathematical or statistical background, you will learn a ton. Prof. Grieger is incredible and teaches stats in a perfect way to learn.",
    "This is a great class. I am not super interested in quantitative methods, but I learned skills that felt really gratifying, because the course was formatted in a way that was really cumulative and focused on real analysis of actual social phenomena. Professor Greiger was really engaging and good at explaining, and both he and the TAs made themselves very available and helpful. The assignments were comprehensive but not overwhelming.",
    "OMG YES. I can't tell enough people how much I loved this course."
