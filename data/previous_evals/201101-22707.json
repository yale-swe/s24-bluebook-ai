   "comments": [
    "A workshop will always be fun, but as verse classes go, this was a disappointment. We got little feedback and the course was in general very disorganized",
    "If you want to improve your poetry writing, you must take this class. There is so much that you cannot learn from anyone else except Professor Zarin.",
    "Take this course because the students will be brilliant and because you will learn plenty from the wisdom of its instructor. (Although do be prepared for some humongous egos, and please leave yours at the door).",
    "The Writing of Verse is a great introduction to the writing of poetry. Your poetry will improve drastically by the end of the term. This is a class for which you always need to be ambitious. Better to turn in an unsuccessful poem where you try something than something you can already do. Professor Zarin and your fellow classmates will be great resources in improving your work.",
    "Prof. Zarin mademe comfortable withmyownpoetic voice \u0097 excited tocontinue writing verse.A really great professor, shemay fool some withher hands-offstyle.For a long timeI didn't realise how much I had learnedFrom Prof. Zarin.",
    "English 460 is worthtaking for the exercise of writing a poem every week and for the chance to read and learn from talented student writers. Know that there is no structure to this class--no syllabus, no readings, no preparation for workshop. Professor Zarin does not offer a lot of guidance (she will meet with you in office hours, but never hands back written work), so for the most part you have to be the one teaching and pushing yourself."
