   "comments": [
    "A lot of insights into different forms of Islam and major parts of their theology. I would consider this course as primarily a history of islamic ideas more than a class in theology. Most of the theological discussion is done in section but you will get graded mainly on your ability to memorise and write about different theologies, as in a history class.",
    "Nuanced understanding of different approaches to understanding God, divinity, and religion in Islam.",
    "I gained a solid foundation in Islamic intellectual history. I read a good balance of primary and secondary sources and was able to clearly understand the positions, motivations, and arguments of many of the major movements in Islamic theology, including the classical theological schools, the falsafa movement, Salafism, Shi'ism, and many more.",
    "This course is a survey of Islamic theology and philosophy. It covers the rise of Islam through the Classical period pretty thoroughly, then it skips to the modern period for the last two weeks. It outlines the main ideas of all the important Muslim thinkers.",
    "Learned a lot about the history of Islamic thought.",
    "I learned a lot about Islamic theology- was great!"

   "comments": [
    "The course is high workload and lots of reading is assigned each week. The professor is upfront about this and the reading van be rewarding but I feel an effort should be made to cut down some unnecessary parts that don't ever get discussed or tested.",
    "Prof Griffel is a fantastic lecturer because he is such a knowledge base. He's like an encyclopedia. Lectures in the beginning part of the semester were incredibly well organized. Lectures became less and less organized (and harder and harder to take notes on) as the class went on. I felt like this became an obstacle when I was studying for the final. I would encourage him to provide some kind of lecture outline to the students (a handout maybe) with the topics he plans to discuss so they can keep track. Especially in heavy lectures I felt like I was a spaghetti strainer trying to catch all the knowledge, but there was a lot just falling through the cracks. That might help.",
    "The class is amazing at giving you a systematic introduction to various theological and philosophical ideas in Islam. I felt after taking it as though I had a newfound appreciation for Islamic thought, and it has even made me think about what I want to write for my senior thesis. The lectures are great, but I think with such a small course the class could have had a more interactive lecture setting. The class is so weighted towards the last week, with 35% of the grade coming from the final paper and 35% coming from the final exam, that it can be stressful come reading week. I think that a class that had a more even balance of graded assignments throughout the semester would be an improvement. I also wish that the class spent a little more time on the falasifa, maybe just a week more. I felt as though that portion of the class was a bit rushed and given the centrality of the falasifa to later thinkers I thought they could have taken up more time.",
    "I liked Professor Griffel's lectures and found them engaging. I was also quite happy with the mix of breadth and depth: we covered a ton of ground over the course of the semester, but each week we also chose an issue or two to dive into deeper. Workload was reasonable.",
    "Lecture is great. I thought there shouldn't have been section, and maybe there should have been more time for lecture. But the lectures were incredibly clear, engaging and helpful.",
    "More visual aids would be very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Any student interested in Islam at all will benefit from taking this class. If you are Muslim, you will learn many many things, so don't be put off by the relatively basic first week. A must take course if you are interested in the Middle East or identify as Muslim.",
    "I would recommend the course to those interested in philosophy and religion or Islam. Not a class to take with interest in none of the three because it has a pretty strong slant towards engaging with those fields in a way that probably wouldn't be interesting to someone there \"just for fun\"",
    "Definitely take this course-Professor Griffel is an amazing lecturer who very clearly explains a wide variety of complex theological and philosophical ideas in Islam. The midterms and finals are also fairly straightforward and the paper gives you a lot of freedom to explore your interests in the subject material. It is not a particularly easy course, although if you attend lecture and do the readings you will understand the material well enough. It is not a gut though, and you will have to do a fair amount of work to get the grade you want.",
    "This is a solid course if you have any interest in the history of Islamic thought or even understanding the origins of modern Islamic thought. But be prepared to memorize a lot of names and dates (and vocabulary, if you don't speak Arabic) for the exams.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, but you should have some background information prior to the course."
