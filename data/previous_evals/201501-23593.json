    "I loved the variety of topics we looked at and the class was very insightful in many ways!! Thank you for making this possible. Also the small number of students made it a great class and we had a great atmosphere of sharing knowledge.",
    "The trips to the Beinecke were my favorite. I particularly loved the Ripley Scroll and the Voynich Manuscript, and seeing these is taking me down paths of inquiry that I never would have been led down otherwise. The Map Room in Sterling was so evocative; I loved the navigation instruments and hearing the story of the map theft. I was also very grateful to go to the Coin Room in the YUAG.",
    "Getting the chance to see exhibits and collections that many Yale students don't get the chance to see was the best thing about the course. Additionally, it gave me the chance to think about environmental topics in a different way than in any of my other courses at Yale. The humanities are an important and often-overlooked way of approaching environmental topics, so I appreciated this chance to think in a new way."

    "Given that the class is on Wednesday afternoon 1-4pm it is a very difficult time to allocate it without other classes overlapping. I had a hard time to be sure that I can make it to all the classes because of this. Is it possible to offer it on Friday's or later in the afternoon 4-8pm instead ? I think that there might also be more students who will be able to take the class.",
    "It would be nice if there were a more substantial discussion portion of the class. Class discussions seemed to happen organically as the semester progressed and we all felt more comfortable with one another, but it would have been helpful if the class had included more formally included a seminar-style discussion component."

It was very insightful and loaded with knowledge and reflection on topics (role of museum, role of image we give something, beliefs, symbolism,...) we don't often think about when we are focused on hard academics."

    "I appreciated the philosophical slant, and literal time-travel during our field trips in understanding how people in different eras associated and interacted with the environment. In other courses in FES, the learning is more technical, specific, scientific, and does not address the thought processes and philosophy of the environment. This emotional angle is completely important in our careers as we deal not only with the environment but how people approach the environment, and it shapes how we strategize our management of this relationship.",
    "I chose this course because of my interest in knowing more about Yale and the opportunity to combine my rather quantitative class content (other classes) with something truly creative and inspiring. It was the best balance and choice I could have made. Thank you for all the wisdom you shared with us. I appreciated the freedom and looseness (= not lot of workload) of the class and the opportunity to discuss among each-other the topics we worked on. Also, I appreciated Paul sharing and introducing to us all the incredible things we have at Yale. Thank you!"

    "This is a incredible class which allows you to discover topics linked to the environment and how we perceive it through-out history! The class is unique and offers you the chance to get to know Yale in a completely new manner. Paul is incredibly wise and shares his wisdom with us during the class-sessions. Be prepared to listen and reflect on the topics you look at. I learned a lot! This is a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience! So don't miss it!!!",
    "Definitely take this class if you want a flexible learning experience that takes you to all corners of Yale and urges you to consider the position of various cultures and Yale within the world and history, through the lens of an environmental ethos. There is a lot of fascinating material, and I am very glad I took it.",
    "This is an excellent, albeit unusual, class. It's a great opportunity to think creatively in a way that gets overlooked in the more technical classes that are the norm at FES. It's also a lot of fun!"
