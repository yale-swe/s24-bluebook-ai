    "Developed the basics of music theory to analyze the harmonies of 18th century music, as well as compose short pieces in the classical style. I thought that it was very interesting because it made me appreciate music a lot more, and has changed the way I see the piano pieces that I frequently play.",
    "I learned the fundamentals and tricks for part writing in early 18th-19th century classical music.",
    "In this class, I learned the fundamentals of various patterns in the classical musical style. I learned about different types of intervals and chords and how they relate to each other, and in what progressions\/sequences they are usually found. I learned about sentences and periods in musical phrases. I also learned about voice leading, and did a lot of practice with both writing and analyzing music written for four voices. I learned about string quartet form, and that it is relatively simple to compose a theme and variations and a string quartet, if I use existing music as models and apply and what I have learned from the course. Overall, I gained a better appreciation of the patterns found in 18th century classical composition and the ability to analyze the structure of music."

   "comments": [
    "I think the overall structure of the course is very good: everything builds on the previous thing so that it is generally very coherent. I think it could be more engaging at times, but otherwise it is a fun course. However, as somewhat of an introduction to music theory (although Music 110 is somewhat of a prerequisite) I think that it would be helpful to have some more review of basic concepts or terminology.",
    "I appreciated the level to which students were encouraged to learn theory through composition, though as a critique of the course and perhaps the department at large, I wish the scope of material wasn't limited to such a short period of time, and to exclusively European, male composers.",
    "Strengths: The class was very well-organized. The pace of the class allowed me to feel relatively comfortable with a new concept covered by the end of class, and the homework was not tedious or particularly long, but extremely relevant to help solidify my understanding of the material. I was initially a little nervous that there was no textbook, but the notes and readings provided by the instructor were sufficient for understanding the material. I thought it was helpful when the instructor would go over the homework by having students write their work on the board, and talking us through the analysis. My favorite part of the class was when the instructor would play musical examples illustrating the concept we had just learned and explain them afterwards, so that we could hear how both 18th century and contemporary composers used the theory we were learning. I particularly appreciated that illustrative examples were chosen from different musical historical periods, so that I could see how the use of a particular concept (for example, a sequence) was applied and changed over time. Weaknesses: None really spring to mind; I really felt that this was a well-taught, well-paced class. Perhaps I would suggest that the instructor could provide a course overview or summary at the beginning or end of class so that I could better orient myself in the material, i.e. pinpoint what \"unit\" I was currently learning about. This would have helped me better connect the different concepts to each other in my head."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to those who have an interest in music. A background in some form of classical music would be preferable and extremely helpful, though it is not necessarily a requirement. Workload is not to bad, and the way things are graded allows for opportunities to learn without punitive measures.",
    "Only if you are serious about pursuing music theory. I don't think this class taught me much about composition in the real sense because the rules for part writing are fairly antiquated.",
    "Obviously, this course is required to any students wishing to explore more advanced music course offerings, but even as a musician who occasionally arranges string parts, I appreciated the practice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, even to students who are interested in, but not necessarily majoring in, music. The class is not a lot of work, but you learn a lot, and the classroom atmosphere is very conducive to learning, asking questions, and making mistakes. The most valuable elements of this class are the homework (and the corrections you receive on it) and the in-class musical examples. If you ask questions where you don't understand, the class should be very straightforward. Starting the midterm and final projects as soon as they are assigned will also give you more time\/room to be creative, which makes the class more fun."
