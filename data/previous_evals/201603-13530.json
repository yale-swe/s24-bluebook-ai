   "comments": [
    "It was okay. Some of the speakers were better than others, but still overall pretty enjoyable. I would love for it to be more engaging with more participation.",
    "I enjoyed the course overall. As with most courses utilizing guest lecturers, some were more enjoyable and engaging than others. Overall, I thought the course was a good initial exposure to global health, though there was some repetitiveness of topics and I would have enjoyed a wider variety of global health topics.",
    "It was good to hear from different speakers and their work each week. This opened up some perspectives.",
    "Great course! It's so important to understand that health exists in a global context, and this course did a great job of introducing us to different relevant topics. The guest speakers were all awesome. Some of the speakers covered very similar topics, and I think it would have improved the course if they had presented on different things.",
    "Some of the lectures were not great but of the lectures I found interesting, I thought they were absolutely wonderful.",
    "Boring speakers that are not engaging. What a missed opportunity to teach topics in global health.",
    "Okay. Dependent on who teh guest speaker was each week. Some speakers were repetitive (i.e. multiple speakers adressed refugee health from a similar perspective). I suggest a speaker on aging health + global implications...that was really lacking.",
    "Courses that are non-credit and require you to listen to a speaker and always hard to by attention to. As such, I don't think I got that much out of this class. A global health introductory course should have more student engagement, and should likely be for a credit. It would incentivize people to pay attention more.",
    "Overall, there were a variety of topics from great speakers, but some lectures repeated (the refugee crisis, HIV\/AIDS, etc.). It would also be nice to have an initial or ending \"lecture\" that gives more background regarding why global health is important, history of global health initiatives (MDGs to SDGs, etc.), key players in global health (WHO, donors, etc.), greatest burdens of disease, and just more general statistics. I felt that the lectures were suitable for people with a global health background, but if someone were introduced to the field for the first time, some brief introductory info would be appreciated.",
    "This course was not very coherent and repeated many topics, both from lecture to lecture and by covering items the YSPH core classes cover.",
    "This course was good but not great. The quality of the speakers need to be improved as well as the diversity of topics covered. It would be nice to have the speakers be a little more engaging as well, perhaps involving students in some way. Some of the speakers were just incredibly boring.",
    "I would have appreciated more variety in the lecture topics.",
    "This course is too basic for someone who knows a lot already about global health. I get why it's required, but it felt very simple and cursory. Perhaps would recommend MPH students take the global health foundations course taught by Kaveh first and then take this course, but have this course be more nuanced and complicated. The idea that \"early childhood nutrition is important for health,\" for example, is obvious to anyone who studies this topic and felt like a waste of time sometimes to have to go to class. However, a couple lectures were great - ACT Up lecture by Gregg Gonslaves and the non-communicable disease lecture. I wish lectures had been more interactive (like the very first one!)",
    "The course provided a safe environment for people to talk about their opinions in Global Health. The course did not do much to teach me about Global Health and so I stopped attending 3\/4 of the way through the semester. This course demotivated me from pursuing a future career path in global health.",
    "I liked the variety of topics. I know a lot of people who haven't worked in global health thought the course went over their heads a little. Maybe more baseline lessons on global health topics as part of the readings (acronyms, etc.) such as MDGs, SDGs, key players like USAID, PEPFAR, etc.",
    "Topics were various and interesting, and some overlapped.",
    "It was good. I liked the variety of people who came to speak. i also like that it was designed for you to absorb information and not add to the already congested work load.",
    "strengths - nice overview of global health weaknesses- some speakers could have been a little better. but overall, they were great.",
    "Great selection of speakers, broad range of topics, wonderful seminar. Only gripe is that people are very hungry during the seminar since it is at dinner time.",
    "Each individual guest speaker contributed to the overall picture of global health and the role health professionals can play. In general, all speakers were engaging and provided a great conversation about global health and what the future of work in this area may involve.",
    "I love how different speakers give us different perspectives of the global health.",
    "Its a great course.",
    "I really appreciated all the guest lecturers and the inspirations.",
    "Interesting speakers, wish we would have had a speaker on global health ethics",
    "interesting speaker series covering a variety of topics, however lacked any continuity or flow over the course of the semester.",
    "I liked the different topics of global health that were covered and the variety of speakers. Through no fault of the course however - there were a few lecturers that I had heard in different classes do the same presentations.",
    "It was nice in that it went over a broad spectrum of global issues, but majority of them seemed to overlap. I wish it had consisted of more topics such as chronic diseases. It felt as if most of the subjects were on HIV and refugee health issues.",
    "I felt that this course did not live up to its potential. It lacked cohesion among speakers and a logical order of material. Its level of detail was appropriate neither for introductory students of global health nor for more advanced students who have taken previous coursework in global health. I would suggest replacing this seminar requirement for the GH concentration with a more structured, traditional lecture style intro class for 1st years and a more advanced, discussion-based seminar for 2nd years. It doesn't make much sense to invite noted scholars to talk about their areas of expertise in a huge \"seminar\" when many students don't have the slightest grounding in global health concepts. I think students would find it more useful to receive the foundational material first then be able to engage the guest speakers later in more meaningful discussion.",
    "This is another weekly seminar so it doesn't require much effort. I thought that the readings and discussion questions should be posted earlier if the instructors wanted students to do them. We frequently received them on Wednesday night or Thursday morning when the seminar was on Thursday night.",
    "Good, enjoyed learning about different topics in Global health even though not in the concentration. Touches on larger topics in healthcare as well.",
    "Clearly important topic but the lectures all felt relatively precursory.. not sure how the series could be modified but didn't feel very engaging",
    "The course was good in that it offered an overview of important global health topics from a variety of speakers. However, I would have liked the class to have been tied together in some way. It felt very disjointed. It was also at a difficult time of day, and it was sometimes hard to pay attention to the less engaging speakers.",
    "Strengths: Lectures touch upon multiple topics\/issues of global health. All are relevant and important to hear in an increasingly globalized U.S. Weaknesses: Lectures could be a little repetitive when it came to the questions asked (e.g., many asked \"what is the definition of global health\").",
    "I enjoyed the course, although it came at the end of a particularly long and grueling day. The subjects were sometimes too general and basic, but I understand that all students come to class with different experience and backgrounds. I enjoyed the sessions on the refugee crisis.",
    "A good intro lecture series to global health",
    "A great lecture series consisting of interesting topics and compelling lecturers. I always looked forward to class."

The seminar was really run by the TA's Katie and Kelly with Anjuli there at times as well, but she mainly just sat off to the side. I think Skonieczny could anchor the course a little bit more, help students to tease out key concepts and important questions to think about.",

    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0Thank you for the semester. I really like the idea of the no laptop policy. I also understand that some students really need their laptops. I think it might be helpful in the future if the students without laptop could sit in the front whereas the students who need to use their laptop could sit in the back?! I also fear some of the possible side effects of this policy but I think people who use laptop should not sit in the front to minimize distractions.",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0This is a seminar, so there was not really an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0All the lecturers were clearly experts in their fields but for whatever reason course itself was not super easy to pay attention to",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0A wonderful leader of GH curriculum innovation at Yale",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0Mike always took time to make himself available to students and was a great course facilitator. I would have appreciated his input more often during the class."

    "This course provides us opportunities to hear speakers from varying backgrounds within the field of global health.",
    "Great if you are thinking about doing stuff with global health.",
    "The course provides a good overview to global health, and I would recommend taking the course if you are unsure about pursing the global health minor, as it helped me in deciding whether I want to pursue the concentration.",
    "This course is an interesting seminar series that gives students the opportunity to hear from a range of speakers and gives them an insight into global health.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a great introduction to global health topics and a wonderful way to meet some of the people who are doing global health work.",
    "I think this was a great seminar and am looking forward to continuing it next semester.",
    "I highly recommend this course as a way to learn from a diverse group of experienced international public health professionals. Each week covered a different, inspiring view of an aspect of global health.",
    "It is a weekly speaker regarding a broad global health topic. The interest level of speakers varies. Pretty painless, and worth to have a concentration in global health.",
    "I definitely would have dropped this course if it weren't required. That said, it was nice to meet the guest speakers and have the opportunity to talk with them after the lecture.",
    "Required for the global health concentration at YSPH. Unless you are trying to do that, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "A good overview of global health if you don't know much about the topic and a good chance to interact with students from other Yale schools. But, a waste of time if you already know a lot about global health. No work though, so not that hard.",
    "Weekly seminar with guest lecturers speaking on a wide range of global health topics.",
    "Necessary for the requirement. will allow you a chance to meet different professors and network into fields that you are interested in. good learning oppurtunity to see how you can develop your future career",
    "introduction to global health",
    "This course was made up of seminar sessions discussing different global health topics, structured as a lecture by an expert in the field followed by a class discussion. I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Would recommend even just to sit in. Lots of really great people speaking and food after!",
    "A great course to get a general understanding of what global health is and what can be done in the field. Additionally, an understanding of what has been done. A comprehensive course on global health with a comfortable and engaging setting.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student if he\/she is interested in global health track. This course really help you decide if you're interested, and in which aspect are you particularlly interested.",
    "Great course. Exposes students to key issues in global health.",
    "I recommend it to anyone interested in the field of global health",
    "A interesting speaker series if you are interested in global health, very little work outside of attending the speakers",
    "interesting lecture series. Tough timing to make every thursday night, would be better earlier in the week. wide variety of topics and speakers, some more exciting than others depending on what your interests are. doesn't necessarily provide a foundational introduction to global health, just glimpses and pieces of a very complicated puzzle.",
    "Very introductory. Students with strong academic and professional global health experience should be allowed to exempt.",
    "I would recommend it for a student who was interested in global health and wanted to see what they could do in the field in the future.",
    "This is a requirement for the GH concentration, so you don't have much choice... Basically the format is a guest speaker every week who talks for an hour and a half about a random topic in global health. Unfortunately there isn't a lot of linearity to the course or background material provided, so if you are new to global health, you may be hunting for additional perspective... I recommend reading Skolnik's global health 101 and taking the other intro GH classes at Yale. Hopefully they will reform the seminar to address the wide variety of backgrounds from which students are coming and add some structure to the seminar.",
    "This is a weekly seminar required for Global Health Concentration people. A free meal was provided, and the speakers varied in topic and quality.",
    "Good, enjoyed learning about different topics in Global health even though not in the concentration. Touches on larger topics in healthcare as well.",
    "Decent precursory\/broad outline of global health but late class time",
    "Many of the courses I took this semester were heavily U.S.-based. These lectures provided a welcome change to what I was studying, and introduced me to issues that do not necessarily receive much media attention but are nonetheless important to hear.",
    "Lecture series on GH topics",
    "A great series of interesting lectures on various different areas of global health. I would recommend the class heartily to anyone interested in the field."
