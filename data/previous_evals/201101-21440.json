    "This is a really interesting class with (mostly) interesting readings. The core of the class is discussing the transition to modernity and all that has come with it. I would recommend the class to anyone who is interested in modernity and how modern societies have formed. What was really cool about the class is 4 of our classes were in the Yale University Art Gallery where they took art out of storage that was pertinent to our class and we discussed it.",
    "the readings were pretty sweet, but I couldn't talk about them much because the seminar was 30 people. The conversation was a little unwieldy and I would have preferred the professors to focus it, or else just give something more like a lecture about the readings and the practice of sociology. I don't think I came away from this course with a greater understanding of what sociology is. Also the blog element was kind of awkward. It didnt engender a conversation, it just was a way to write reading responses.",
    "It's a great class. If you're interested in Sociology, absolutely take it. The professor is the best person ever.",
    "I would not recommend this class simply because it lacks direction. The readings are interesting, the projects are fun, but I didn't feel like I came away with any formed ideas--just fragments from different sociological viewpoints.",
    "Everyone else seemed to like this class. I on the other hand absolutely despised the class. Some of the readings were interesting, others were long and tedious. The teachers were dry lecturer. Use of the blog was less engaging than it is made out to be. I came out of class wondering what we even talked about in class. I personally found it to be discussions full of itself, talking about nothing, going nowhere, coming to no conclusion, and generally very very boring. Everyone else seemed to enjoy it, but for me, never again. I honestly don't really know what the point of the class was. The class is very easy, if that is any consolation.",
    "Once a week. 2-hour long discussions (sometimes boring). I would say to take it if you were really interested in the course. I would probably recommend and introductory course in sociological theory first, such as a lecture and then take this course where you actually read the full text and further discuss them. Also, be ready for some blogging, lots of it!",
    "An interesting introduction to Sociology, but it lacks a coherent structure. Take this class if you have some background in sociology and know you're interested in it-- otherwise, you will be lost and bored.",
    "YES! Absolutely! The readings are great, the professors are great!",
    "This is a fascinating course about the nature and definition of modernity, and it's a good introduction to cultural sociology as an academic discipline. Professor Adams is great- thoughtful, clear, engaging, easy-going. However, I had a number of problems with this course: it was bigger than a seminar ever should be (near 30 students), it was taught by two people at once (a strange dynamic in and of itself and further frustrating because Prof. Adams was clearly the better teacher), and it tried to integrate experimental components (art gallery sessions, a student blog) somewhat clumsily. They're going to address a lot of the concerns raised this semester and I'm sure this course will be less of an experiment down the road, but I wouldn't recommend it unless its structure is drastically changed and especially unless it's taught by only one person (hopefully Prof. Adams).",
    "The Sociological Imagination touches on a great deal of sociological concepts, beginning with the transition to modernity. It spans many cultures and eras, and if you are at all interested in sociology, take this course. It will introduce you to societies and time periods in a sociological light that is truly interesting.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student only if they are interested in the field.",
    "This is a great introductory seminar to sociology. If you think you might be interested in the field, definitely take this. The reading is usually very interesting, although sometimes long. Students each had to do 2 long-form blog posts over the semester and comment once a week, so the workload wasn't too bad. The final is very open-ended and is similar to the visits to the Art Gallery or you get to play Civilization. Adams is a fantastic professor and you should come away with some new insights into society.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student as it was very enjoyable. Got to spend several classes in the art gallery and when we weren't we got to have great class discussions about things that affect the world around us.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material and books that we read was very interesting and classes are fairly laid-back. Also, Gallery sessions were a definite plus.",
    "Sociology 121, The Sociological Imagination, is a wonderful introductory course to sociology that anyone interested in the major should take. One gets a chance to read major texts in the field and talk about them in a very philosophical and intellectual environment.",
    "Sociology 121 was an introduction to some of the concepts, methods and scholars of the patterns and systems of social behavior. It is discussion-based, with four classes incorporating material from the Yale Art Gallery that represent five \"sociological objects\" -- the sword, the book, the map, the clock and the mask. There is a lot of reading. I would recommend this class to another student only if it were offered in smaller sections than it was this year."
