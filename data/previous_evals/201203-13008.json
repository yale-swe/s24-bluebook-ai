   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this course! A short presentation and and paper. You can write about anything as long as it has a company. No reading necessary and no class discussions.",
    "Wonderful Class. 1 paper 1 presentation.",
    "Good econ seminar. Not too stressful.",
    "Good class. The material is interesting, and I feel like I have a better grasp of financial terms used in newspaper articles now. Light workload, with a midterm paper (3-4 pages) that is then expanded into a final paper (12-15 pages) on a topic of your choosing. You get to explore any topic related to corporate finance that you would like, so it's a great chance to research something that you may always have wanted to look into but never had the chance to.",
    "Yes. An interesting course, not a ton of work. It is more like a lecture than a seminar though (professor Tri Vi Dang usually takes the majority of the class time to present notes off of a powerpoint). Especially since there were about 30 kids this semester.",
    "Corporate Finance was a great senior seminar. Light workload and really interesting material. Professor Dang did a great job at making things simple and easy to understand. Definitely recommend it.",
    "Great senior seminar option. Learn broadly about topics in corporate finance, with flexibility to dive deep into one subject you are really interested in through the term paper.",
    "Take it if you want to know more about corporate finance, but not in depth, because the class only addresses the very basic concepts. Also choose this econ seminar if you want an easy A.",
    "Super manageable class with only a paper and final presentation on the final paper for course work. The lectures are interesting and professor Dang explains things very well. Unfortunately, since the last several meeting times are dedicated to students presentations, less material than is ideal is covered, but it's a trade-off. If you're looking for a light workload and good prep for finance related jobs and interviews, this is the course.",
    "Definitely take it - not too demanding and will provide a good overview of the basic concepts in corporate finance.",
    "This is a really chill class, with much latitude in the topics you can delve into. Not much regular reinforcement of topics covered in the seminar through regular assignments or tests (and is much more of a lecture class than a discussion-based seminar), but Professor Dang is a fair grader, makes himself very available to his students, and gives great advice on final papers (which make up almost all of your grade, in addition to the proposal for the final paper and class discussion). Take this class, especially if you are going through full-time interviews in the fall for jobs in the financial sector!",
    "Yes take it. You will learn as much as you put into it.",
    "Corporate Finance is a wonderful seminar, particularly if you have a difficult semester and need to satisfy the Economics department requirements without involving yourself in a time monopolizing class like Investment. The class sessions are lectures with minimal student input, yet interesting, particularly for the career aspirations of a typical economics major. The only work required is related to the final paper, and nothing is graded with particular harshness, likely because Tri Vi Dang speaks English as a third language (note that this will make the lecture difficult to understand sometime, but the associated presentations are excellent.) The class should create little stress until the end of the semester, while being an interesting topic. If you are looking for a highly intellectual and fulfilling academic experience, this class will disappoint; in all other cases, it is a relatively easy and thoroughly interesting overview of corporations and private capital."
