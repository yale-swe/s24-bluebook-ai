   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class. The course material is interesting, but you are better off reading it on your own. The discussions are poorly led and have very little direction. The papers are extraordinarily easy and the professor doesn't engage with the students or with the material. It's basically just a waste of time.",
    "The readings are super-interesting, but you better do them or you really won't get anything out of this course. But this isn't one of those \"it's what you make of it\" classes - the discussions are just so unsatisfying that the readings are the main thing you'll get from it.",
    "YES! TAKE IT!",
    "The Junior Seminar changes every year but this year it was called The Politics of Compassion. The course tried to understand how conemporary literature and art fosters compassion - or not - in different historical contexts and different geographic areas of the world. We examined genocide, civil war, great power war, natural disasters, among other catastrphoic events in an effort to understand different theories about how such events come about and also about how compassionworks as a response to and impetus for these events. It's a really great class that it's hard not to relate to your own life. Not to mention there are tons of cool contemporary films and readings Amina knows a ton about and shares with the class. I found it very comforting to read enjoyable literature every week and to discuss with a very engaging class seminar.",
    "I took this class because I couldn't get into my first choice Junior Seminar, but I think it was a great deal. I ended up studying material that I otherwise would not be reading. There's a lot of reading and I could never quite be sufficiently prepared, but everything worked out. Wrote two or three short papers and made a small presentation on the last day of class. The class really depends on the instructor, so if Amina doesn't teach it again, the class will be something entirely different. It's all discussion."
