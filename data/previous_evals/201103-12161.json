   "comments": [
    "Awesome course! Very interdisciplinary, and will expose you to topics and perspectives you would never otherwise come across.",
    "I highly recommend this course. So great.",
    "This is such a phenomenal course! Professor Almeling is a fantastic discussion moderator and also incredibly knowledgeable in her field. The subject matter is compelling and consistently provoked great class debates. This is the first seminar I have taken where every student was actively engaged in class and excited to be there. The diversity of students attracted to this course allowed for insightful and fruitful discussions between science and social science majors. I highly recommend this class, it has been my favorite seminar so far at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in genetics and its intersection with society. Great for both science and non-science majors.",
    "I definitely recommend this course! Professor Almeling is great and very knowledgable. The course draws students from both the sciences and the social sciences so class discussions are especially interesting!",
    "Great class! There's a lot of reading but it's interesting so easily manageable. The weekly memos take some thinking to write at first, but they get easier as the weeks go by and is actually an extremely helpful skill to learn. Most of the class is participation and memo writing, which is pass\/fail so it's not hard to get a good grade. She also let me write a group paper (double the length, but it was way more fun).",
    "Gender Race and Genetic Testing is absolutely phenomenal! Almeling has created a BRILLIANT course the intermingling of science and sociology. The course was timed perfectly, the readings were interesting, class discussion was thought-provoking and entertaining. While the weekly reading responses were frustrating in the beginning, they're surprisingly worthwhile as a writing exercise.Even the hard core science majors in the class (bio, MBB, MCDB) were intrigued by the class and found it just as worthwhile as the sociologists and other social science majors.",
    "TAKE IT. Regardless of what your specialty is, you will learn more than you ever expected to. The class needs both science and social science-oriented people. Despite the advanced seminar number, Professor Almeling is one of those professors that is open to learning from her students so there is nothing to be intimidated about.",
    "This class is one of the best I've taken at Yale. Rene Almeling is a terrific, well-organized professor; she did an excellent job of guiding discussions and articulating her expectations. As my first seminar, Gender, Race,& Genetic Testing forced me to become comfortable contributing to and engaging in class discussions. I was really satisfied with the readings; theywere interesting and generally did a great job of weaving together the various disciplines we were exploring. My only complaint -- and it's a minor one -- is that the Weekly Response Memos were a bit of a challenge to get a hang of; I was never really sure if I was doing them \"right\". I was grateful, though, that they held us all accountable for the readings; it made our discussions all the more enriching.",
    "Speaking as a science person, this was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. This class was SUPER interesting, and the discussions were so much fun; this might be the only 2-hour seminar I've ever been in which I wasn't constantly checking the time. Professor Almeling is wonderful!",
    "Great course. I highly recommend this if you are a science student (speaking as a science student myself). It humanizes what I learn in my science lecture classes and gave me a new perspective of how I view various issues. Work load is very manageable and Professor Almeling does a great job of keeping the discussion interesting.",
    "Sociology 311 definitely reflects all of the elements explained in the course title: Gender, Race, and Genetic Testing. If you are interested in genetics and how the subject plays a role in today's society as related to gender and race, this is the course for you! Professor Almeling is very knowledgeable on the subject, and she clearly cares about what her students have to say. There is a solid amount of reading for each seminar meeting, but it is definitely manageable and worth it. There is only one major assignment which is a paper at the end of the semester. The criteria for the paper is very flexible. It can be a research paper, a study based on interviews or a survey, etc. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "This is quite a good class, though not totally cohesive. It taught me that I dislike sociology, but that's not the fault of the course. I'm just not very interested in \"normal\" people, so if you aren't either, you might want to try anthro or WGSS instead. That said, Prof. Almeling is great, and the readings are interesting, and you get to talk about pregnancy a lot (bittersweet if you are not heterosexual\/fertile\/etc.)Be aware that this is not the most WGSSy of courses, if you are here for that and not SOCY."
