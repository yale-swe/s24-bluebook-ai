   "comments": [
    "This is a good anthropology class, but it might be a little tough for beginners. It was a nice introduction to all things Russian (religion, politics, culture) but you need to make sure you REALLY want to know a lot about Russia before taking the class. Professor Rogers was great, and the graded coursework was relatively light, but the readings were sometimes difficult to understand and long.",
    "A good intro-level anthro class if you're at all so inclined. Otherwise, it's an interesting complement to a political\/historical background on the post-Soviet era.",
    "YES! This class was really great. The professor is great! The material is incredibly interesting and allows you to gain a great new perspective of the world.",
    "Anthro 209 is a good class. Professor Rogers is a solid lecturer, and the readings are generally interesting. The assigned reading is a lot, but it is not always necessary to do it all.",
    "This course involves questioning the commonly held (Western) beliefs of the Soviet Union and life in the Soviet Union post-collapse. I would recommend it because all of the lectures were very interesting. Professor Rogers was never boring and really engaging.",
    "This is a good course if you're looking for an easy introduction to the post-Soviet Russia. The class will give you the snippets of the society through ethnography, but you might be disappointed if you are looking for any coherent theoretical background. The lectures are pretty easy to follow and usually fun, the class has a very light reading load. The class is not very rigorous, I was a little frustrated because I didn't feel like I was taking the most out of the class.",
    "Take this if you are interested in the subject matter. If not, this is going to be difficult. There is a reasonable amount of reading and very reasonable workload otherwise. You do have to be willing to think about the readings though, otherwise you won't get anything out of it. Professor Rogers is clear and relatively concise and he has real experience with the subject (he did fieldwork in the early 2000s in russia). If you are thinking about the anthropology major or something involving Russia, you won't get much closer to the real deal than this class. He's an expert in his field and I do recommend this course.",
    "Take it if you are into Anthropology. If your a history person, skip it.Overall a fine lecture but definitely nothing spectacular.",
    "After the Soviet Union is an interesting, enjoyable small lecture course. It covers various aspects of the late-Soviet and post-Soviet era and experience from an anthropological perspective. Most of the readings are interesting, but they're usually a bit long and rather intense.",
    "A distinctly different view on political structures in the former Soviet Union than a political science class would talk about, and better for it. I would recommend it for any poli sci\/international studies student who wants something different, but not too different.",
    "it sort of turned me off anthropology as a discipline though i enjoyed listening to professor rogers and found the readings interesting, i was not impressed with the overarching themes of making statements based on ground level observations.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It allows a fantastic lens to understand properly a region of the world that I think most of us have many (false) pre-conceived notions about. The period\/region in themselves are fascinating, but at the very least, it's interesting to understand how anthropology works: by looking at how things work at the ground-level, rather than accepting general theories and vague explanations.",
    "This is a good class. Its appeal may be limited, though, since its very much an anthropology class and its materials do not extend much into other fields of interest. If you're interested in anthro and the Soviet Union, though, take it.",
    "I would def. take this class. it is very interesting and taught well.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and would definitely recommend it. It's a great way to look at culture, consumption, and religion from an ethnographic perspective while questioning the accuracy of terms such as socialism, capitalism, and democracy in describing them. Professor Rogers' lectures are very structured but still engaging; the small class size allows him to involve students in discussion when appropriate. The readings are generally interesting and not too theory-heavy (there are exceptions), and the take-home midterm and final were not too bad, though I actually might have preferred the chance to write a research paper instead. One disclaimer: this class is NOT \"Intro to Russia.\" I think a lot of people were expecting a Russian history or politics class. While we certainly do cover history and politics, this is an anthropology class, so be prepared for that.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS if you're enticed by fascinating ethnographies of various communities within the former Soviet Union and a silver-fox prof with infectious passion for his field (not to mention hilarious and instructive stories of his own experiences in post-Soviet Russia)."
