   "comments": [
    "I would and I have recommended English 120 to just about everyone I have ever spoken to. I would say it's a personal essay writing class that explores the genre of the essay and allows you to develop your voice.",
    "I think ENG 120 is a rewarding class if you're willing to put the work in and be okay with not getting A's.",
    "ENGL 120 was a fantastic introduction to writing at Yale. Initially, I thought that I was a great writer, but I quickly learned that that was not the case. However, by the end I learned so much that I felt like I could once again call myself a great writer. It tore me down and built me back up, stronger than before. I would not take the course unless you're prepared for blunt comments. I would also not take the course unless you're prepared to hit the ground running, as there are only five grades, and one poor assignment could really hurt your grade.",
    "English 120 is a reading for craft course, based on the principle that becoming more astute readers will make us better writers. You read both professional, published essays, and other students' work, in the almost-weekly workshop. You complete five essays, submitting a required draft for each; the entire class will workshop at least one of your drafts. I loved this course. I learned a lot and truly enjoyed the work. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "English 120 is a great class for anyone interested in writing creative nonfiction. the workload isn't tha bad and a lot of the readings are interesting, but a lot of the time the writing assignments are hit or miss.",
    "English 120 is the class for you if you're interested in exploring the way we can use writing to understand the world and ourselves. E120 is the perfect combination of interesting literary analysis and deep self reflection, and I highly recommend it to anyone.",
    "Take this class. You will not only read incredible works from essayists, but also have the most stimulating discussions over them and over your own writing. Shifra is amazingly helpful and always willing to meet with you if you need to!!",
    "I would recommend it if you are really interested in improving your writing and\/or are an English major"
