    "no there was never enough disk-space and it was a huge problem.",
    "I find it a bit suspect how Revit is being forced upon us, even if and when it is a completely inappropriate program to use for specific buildings.",
    "SI\u0092s emphasis on Revit was not helpful. Revit is a strong software in the context of an office with established detail families, plot styles, and fixed plans. When a design is being revised on the fly by novices, Revit becomes an impediment both to production of drawings and learning about detailing. It is a slow, clunky program suited more producing CD sets for walmarts than DD-lite sets student projects. In my group's case, we learned the most when we stopped using Revit and worked our detail section in CAD."
