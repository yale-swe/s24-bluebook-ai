   "comments": [
    "I would if you're at all interested in clinical work. It is early, but she brought breakfast for us every week.The only thing I would caution is regarding field placements\/Fellowship Place. The unstructured social hour that you are there for is challenging. Because of scheduling conflicts, my second semester there was kind of bad because it was 2 hours of the social program because I couldn't fit into a 1 hour group.",
    "Great class if you want direct experience working with clinical populations and\/or don't want to take exams. The papers are easy and overall you can get an A with minimal effort.",
    "No, it's honnestly a waste of time. the placement is cool but the class is not worth the bagels at 930 in the morning.",
    "This class is a weekly lecture with readings and presentations, as well as a weekly visit to a local clinic\/residence. The experiences of this class are really meaningful for those interesting in clinical psychology. Take it!",
    "In this class you have to meet for a weekly seminar, go to 2+ hours of a field placement every week, do a weekly reading response, and a weekly journal entry. The classes are very boring and disengaging. Considering the time put into this class, I got almost nothing out of it. I would not recommend this class to another student. It's a waste of time and 2 credits.",
    "Clinical is a good class, if you are interested in pursuing a career in clinical psych. However, it doesn't go into tremendous depth, and there are a lot of topics covered, so don't expect it to be too instructive in the actual practice of clinical psych. However, if you get a good placement, that should teach you (if you pay attention) a lot about therapeutic relationships, and your own strengths\/weaknesses.",
    "This class was excellent -- it is rare for undergrads to gain exposure to clinical populations, but for those who plan to go on to careers in clinical psych this experience is crucial. The lectures were hit or miss, but those that were hits made me think more critically about mental health care.I appreciated Professor Lockhart's knowledge of clinical psychology; most professors at Yale have knowledge that is more research based than clinically-oriented. However, I often found Professor Lockhart to be rather stubborn and close-minded in her opinions. Occasionally I felt like she would ignore students' opinions that differed from her ownduring class discussion. I would become frustrated when, rather than encourage us to form our own opinions, I felt like she tried to push us towards her own point of view.",
    "If you already took it the first semester, you're taking it anyway, so this doesn't really matter. I didn't like the course this time around as much. Basically, we went over a large variety of clinical psychology topics, and each student was responsible for making a presentation on one of them. So each class consisted of about three student making long-ish presentations about their topic. This became pretty monotonous.At the same time, it is nice this semester to be more comfortable at fieldwork, and you definitely see more gains this time around.",
    "yes if you want to do service in this context, don't take it for the seminar.",
    "Only take it if you really want to do the placement, and don't mind being a bit bored and frustrated at times. Also, remember that it is a full year course. It lasts a long time.",
    "Again, the field placements were good but not integrated into the course. Second semester, there was a frustrating amount of work considering there was no focus to the class.",
    "recommended. though field placement is a lot of time during the week and difficult without a car",
    "Psych 356 is just the right amount of work. You have to turn in a journal entry about your field placement experiences and a reading response each week. The field placement can be pretty rewarding, though frustrating at times because your buddy can't go offsite or because the staff seems to be adding to the problems. Choose Children's Home when you are given the option - Bernice, the program director, is great.",
    "Awesome. Take it. Great experience.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in Clinical Psychology! The field experience (while it varies depending on your placement) is an amazing opportunity and you should take advantage of it! There is a lot of writing (journals, thought questions, final papers) but none of it is too difficult and the journals really do help you make sense of your experience. It's also nice being in a class that lasts the whole year. Kristi is overall a great professor, and while the discussions in seminar can sometimes feel like a waste of time, you should take this class.",
    "I took this course because I thought it would help me decide whether or not I wanted to pursue the field of clinical psychology (which has been a recent offshoot interest from my main interest in education). It didn't really do this. The once a week seminar component is very very hokey and survey-heavy, with lots of cursory glances at major schools of psychology and pyschotherapeutic interventions. The work is ridiculously light, and encourages you not to read articles throughly, and articles are seemingly random and often out of date. The once a week placement - while varying wildly by the place you work - was a much much more valuable part of the class. I formed a close relationship with my mentee at a residential psych facility for teens, and gained a lot of insight into what it takes to be a part of the helping professions. However, I was much more Big Brother mentor (trips to the library, getting icecream, going fishing) than psychologist. This may seem obvious since undergrads are severely unqualified to do any serious therapy, but the lack of access at my placement (Children's Home) to any sort of psychological records and lack of formal discussion of the placement in class meant that it really was just about forming a buddy buddy relationship with a person. This is great, but can be easily gotten as an extracurricular. This class felt like an good extracurricular, rather than an opportunity to gain access and experience with serious clinical interventions and ways of thinking. Again, though, the experience variesby placement and other students at Riverview, Safe Haven, and especially Yale New Haven might say other things. Kristi is enthusiastic and talkative, but much more retired practitioner than academic."
