    "study of how performances of various kinds inform and create the american identity. this does not only include traditional performance like musicals and plays.",
    "Defined key theories of nationalism, affect, and performance, and then looked at the ways American identities have been formed through performance. I would recommend this class very strongly, because it will teach you about an important subject and will also teach you how to be a better student\/academic.",
    "The reading was diverse and interesting. The discussion between students and the professor was rich and always dealt with the main points of the text. The themes of the course all came together and everything had its place. Though the types of performance we read about and watched were not that different, we covered a lot for the time we had. And we covered them well. Prof. McGinley is awesome, understanding, and a great teacher. A majority of the work is the reading and it is a manageable amount. The final paper is a lot shorter than final papers in most Am Stud classes and she gives a lot of input and suggestions to really help you handle your topic well.",
    "The course is good for those who are interested in Theatre Studies. It is interesting to discuss what \"performance\" truly means and what it is to be \"American.\" My only major problem was the fact that there were two rather large reading assignments each week. I think classes tend to go better when there is just one large reading assignment to do each week.",
    "PAI offers an introduction to theoretical discussions of the topics of performance, nationalism, and American identity by reading various theoretical texts and cultural artifacts of performance, such as musicals or American Girl Dolls. This class is most suited for students interested in delving into some pretty dense theory and then applying it to some very interesting and often fun American cultural artifacts. It's not a survey course and it is not limited to \"theater\" per se, it is much more about thinking on an abstract level and considering the social and political implications of the production of culture.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it.I can say completely honestly that I looked forward to every class--and to the reading.Professor McGinley leads excellent discussions, and you will be challenged to think.Take it!"
