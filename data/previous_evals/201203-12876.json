    "Pchem was a strange class. The first half of the semester was kind of hard with all of the thermo stuff. But then the pace of new material slows to almost a halt in the second half of the semester. I didn't really see the point of this class, especially since I had already taken thermodynamics for chemical engineers the year before. Besides thermo, we learned a little about kinetics and electrochemistry, but all of the things we learned weren't really integrated. It was just helter-skelter learning. At least Cross was pretty entertaining and good-humored, and the tests weren't bad. They were based on homework questions so they were very fair.",
    "PChem with Prof. Cross was really good. It's like a more rigorous version of Chem 118 in a way. He's funny and is really good at teaching the material. The last week or two of class, though, was really all over the place.",
    "Essentially a more advanced verison of Gen Chem. Most likely a requirement for you. Many people have an idea that class is extremely difficult which I disagree with. It is not different than any other science class, if you simply take the time to learn the material you will do well, unless you are unlucky on exams, which due to the grading structure has a large effect on your grade. Even minute errors that cause you to find the incorrect final anwser can lower your grade significantly, and the exam does not present much residual time to check your anwsers.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need to. If you do take it, going to class isn't required, just read all his lecture notes (they make more sense than the oral lectures anyway) and make sure you can do all the problems in the problem sets. Go over his practice tests and make sure you got those down, then you'll be ok.",
    "No, I would not recommend it unless you have to take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, but you should know what you're getting yourself into. This is a hard class, it will confuse you, but if you have to take it, make the best of it and enjoy the ride.",
    "This class is surprisingly interesting. Lectures are usually engaging and Cross is a really interesting lecturer that is sure to make even 9:25 lectures not terrible. The material is actually bearable as long as youread the textbook and go to section. You probably have to take this class for your major if you are reading this evaluation, so best of luck, its not as bad as everyone hypes it up to be!",
    "See the syllabus, but it's pretty much two-thirds thermodynamics and one-third assorted topics on kinetics",
    "Great class. PChem with Cross is a lot of fun; don't listen to people who tell you otherwise. You get to do lots of really fun things with differential calculus that feel like the final payoff to learning the quotient rule in BC Calc in high school. The stuff at the end feels more disorganized, but I thought the presentation of thermodynamics and equilibrium at the beginning were terrific.",
    "Chemistry 332 is a very theoretical, math-based approach to many of the basic concepts of chemistry, including thermodynamics, equilibrium and kinetics. For intuitive, qualitative learners I'd recommend organic chemistry; for mathematical students, this course. That being said, I am by no means a quantitative learner but I survived this course, so it's not impossible if you're willing to put in the effort. Yes, I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in delving into the more math-based details of chemistry.",
    "Only take it if it is required for your major. The class is dry - you will often fall asleep. Prof. Cross is very nice and funny, but his teaching style did not work for me. The workload is not bad at all - one problem set a week, 2 exams, and a final. However, I think the class would have been less of a struggle if I had consistently devoted more time to it (instead of just working on it one day a week to do the p. set and then cramming before the final).",
    "This was one of the most disorganized, frustrating lectures I've sat through. Professor Cross just derives things all lecture, writes inconsistent notes on the board, and then expects you to figure out how to use what he has given you on homework and tests. Section was pretty helpful, but I really did most of my learning form the book, which is saying something considering how bad the Atkins\/DePaula text is. If you have to take the class, at least the workload isn't bad. If you don't need this for your major, though, I certainly would not recommend it - at least not with Professor Cross.",
    "I'm an MB&B major who took this course because CHEM328 wasn't offered this semester. It's not too bad, but reminded me that some of my calculus is a little rusty.The book was very helpful, so if you go over the notes he gives out in class and read about them in the book, you should be alright. Also find a good TA, Becky saved my life.",
    "First semester physical chemistry basically teaches you things that you are already familiar with from general chemistry, just in much greater detail. You finally get to sort of understand where enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy come from thermodynamically. If you haven't learned so before, you get to find out that everything you learned about chemical equilibrium was in fact an approximation. Concepts covered were thermodynamics, phase changes, mixtures, chemical equilibrium, electrochemistry, the kinetic theory of gases and chemical kinetics. With Professor Cross the coarse load isn't all that difficult, but it will take a lot of effort if you actually want to understand the material. Homework wasn't too strenuous and didn't factor much into the grade. I feel like a lot of the concepts of this semester are sloppy by nature, in the sense that everything is basically an approximation. I'm looking forward to more mathematical rigor next semester. I would only take Chem 332a if you have to for your major because on the whole it is not that inspiring and perhaps not all that useful. This year the biologically focused version was not available so the class was full of MB&B majors as well.",
    "Very fair and reasonable workload. And the curve is very generous; I'm still not quite sure how I pulled off an A. That being said, the material is dense and challenging. The textbook is fairly useless, although the lecture notes were pure gold. Also, if Cross is teaching this again, be aware that the end of the course (where he talks about his research with lasers and partition functions) will make zero sense.",
    "The material is very interesting. It's fairly math heavy and derivation heavy, so but I didn't mind the abstraction.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you absolutely had to take it. The psets took a ridiculous amount of time and very little was taught in class that helped with this. Exams were also very challenging.",
    "The workload for this class was surprisingly light: weekly psets that only took a few hours, reading that was sometimes helpful but always optional, and fair exams. Cross is a boring lecturer, so you really have to make yourself work to go to class, read the lecture notes and textbook, and study for exams (but you do need to study for exams). In terms of material, you derive a lot of the stuff you learned in gen chem and do more math with it. I loved it. No reason not to take it!",
    "Chem 332 is hard and boring because the material and the way it is presented is not intuitive. Professor Cross is hard to understand, and there is some hand-waving in section. If you take this class, challenge yourself to question and understand why every topic is relevant to chemistry and why you are studying it. Knowing the why will help put each section into perspective so you can ultimately remember all the equations and apply them on the test.",
    "A good introduction to physical chemistry. Not the most interesting lectures, but everything- tests, problem sets, etc.- were very fair.",
    "Boring. Problem sets are only a few questions, but you probably won't know how to do them. Tests aren't so bad. All equations had to be memorized... :(",
    "Even if you don't have to take this class, I still recommend it as long as you know the following: the material itself is a bit difficult, and Prof. Cross presents it in a deceptively easy way; eventually, it becomes manageable; the textbok is REALLY helpful; and both the professor and TAs are willing to help you whenever you need them.",
    "Decent class. Professor Cross is very nice, but a little disorganized. The book was very helpful for understanding the importance of the concepts we learned in class, which Professor Cross did not emphasize, sometimes leaving me confused as to the purpose of what we just talked about. The material was interesting, although I enjoyed the first of the three units the most, by far. The exams are not difficult, although the final was much harder than either of the midterms. The grading is also very generous. Overall, I would recommend this class.",
    "I never in a million years thought I would say this, but this class made me miss orgo. This class was easily the worst I've taken at Yale, and its utter irrelevance to pretty much anything besides theoretical physics and\/or math made it unbearable to take. Couple that with a needlessly complicated textbook and a professor who's lectures were as unfocused as they were uninteresting, and orgo looks like a walk in the park. This class is called physical chemistry with physical applications, but it should really be called theoretical physics with way too many inapplicably complex partial differential equations.",
    "Take it if you want to to show what you can do. If you're taking it for yourself, do yourself a favor and just read a (better, less jumbled) book instead.",
    "Chemistry 332 01 is an in-depth study of thermodynamics and kinetics. Although there are many concepts to master in this class, the professor makes it very clear what he will cover in the exam. If you're interested in learning an in-depth thermodynamics and kinetics, this is a good course to take. Keep in mind that the formula sheet will not be given during the exam, so you need to memorize them all especially for the final.",
    "This class was okay. I got a good grade so I'm happy but I didn't really feel like I learned the material that well, I guess other people just learned it worse than me. As an MB&B major, I did not really feel like I had the appropriate math& physics background to succeed throughout the class but I guess it didn't end up mattering. And I'm sure I'll use maybe 1% of what I learned in the future, so I do feel kind of like this was a wasted credit. That said, it certainly wasn't the worst (science) class I've ever taken but the material just doesn't interest me enough for it to be one of the best. I found the workload to be very manageable: maybe 8 problem sets the whole semester (not every week) and 2 midterms and a final. Not sure how all of this was weighted, which is perhaps my one complaint.Professor Cross was an awesome professor: very funny and nice and made it fun to come to class. He was very approachable and accommodating. I can't imagine having taken this course with any other professor, becase it would have been far more painful. That said, I often found myself turning to other sources to clarify what we had discussed in class, be it wikipedia, the TAs, the textbook or other students. I'd like to think this is my own fault, and not Professor Cross's, since I am by no means a physicist. It would have been nice if more biochemistry could have been integrated into the course, but I understand that there were extenuating circumstances this semester. It was such a relief to see Michaelis-Menton kinetics amid all the thermodynamics and stat mech though! Also, exams were graded the next day which was much appreciated!!!!In sum, I recommend this class with Professor Cross but only if you are willing to put in time to try to keep up with the material (as I did to the minimum extent possible). People got really low grades on the tests which can only be due to complete apathy or perhaps a complete unpreparedness to take the course. I had no major qualms with anything about this semester's pchem class but I will certainly not be taking the second semester, since I am not interested in or good at the material.",
    "This year was a bit of an oddity in the course - physical chemistry for the biological sciences was not offered, so the class was a ragtag collection of chemistry, engineering majors and MB&B majors, all of which had marked variation in preparation for the course (the biological sciences version was cancelled only a few weeks prior to classes). However, Professor Cross was an excellent instructor, though the class felt at times a bit too easy (though the final exam certainly wasn't) and deviated from standard curricula (the last two weeks were spent learning about experimental techniques and software).",
    "with james cross, lectures weren't helpful at all but the lecture notes online were decent and everything was in the textbook. if you have to take it you have to take it, but otherwise it felt a bit like wasted tuition because I had to teach myself everything and going to class added nothing.",
    "very boring class, will definitely reduce your interest or passion for chemistry, but since its required, there's really nothing you can do about it",
    "This class isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too bad. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require much more work than gen chem (I took that the year before), but the actual material was harder\/more complicated. I took it after chem 114 and 115 and got an A in the class without too much struggle. You barely use the periodic table, but you learn a lot about the math and physics behind thermodynamics and kinetics. Make sure you know the equations well. I had Prof. Cross, and his exams weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad at all, but everything was very math- and equations-based, so know the equations themselves and their implications. Prof. Cross is a good lecturer, gives good notes, and is approachable, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also really old. But he knows it and makes jokes about it so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really an issue.Lab: I took the lab (CHEM 330L) simultaneously. I would recommend it if you also have to take the lab, since you end up learning the same equations and some of the same topics, so it reinforces the material when you have to study similar things for two classes.For ChemE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s: Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to take pchem before orgo \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Idid (you barely use orgo again in the required courses). Especially if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking CENG 210, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge amount of overlap between 210 and pchem, so make sure you take them simultaneously or take pchem before 210. Like the lab, it helps if you take them simultaneously because the material is doubly reinforced (especially helpful for understanding phase diagrams and kinetics, which are covered somewhat more in-depth in 210).",
    "This class is very boring and unexciting. Do not expect much from it.",
    "Since Physical Chemistry with Biological Applications was canceled this year, MBB majors had to take Chem 332. If they bring back pchem for bio majors and you have the option not to take Chem 332 and you are not particularly interested in the subject - don't take this class. Professor Cross's lectures were unengaging and confusing, the material had so few biological applications that I had trouble caring.",
    "Math-heavy physical chemistry course that focuses a lot on learning the theoretical models necessary for modern thoeretical chemistry experiments. You cover things like gas laws, thermo, and very basic kinetics. The last third of the class became very experiment and procedure based. Less math, more memorization of things like how femtosecond lasers work. I'd recommend this to well-prepared sophomores and juniors.",
    "Pchem isn't too bad. If you're a chem major or have decent quantitative thinking skills, it'll probably be a breeze. I didn't have to take it for my major, but I really like chemistry, so I took it for fun with my friends (who had to take it for their major). Professor Cross can be a bit dull\/dry, so you might find yourself missing the occasional (read: each and every) lecture, but that's probably for the best anyway. In class, he just copies his lecture notes (which he posts online) on the chalkboard, without much else. Needless to say, the attendance rate dropped exponentially with time. Fortunately, if you just read the chapters and use his lecture notes to review and solidify your grasp of the material, you'll be fine. If you're a chem major, you have to take this. If you're an MB&B major, I can't offer a comparison with the bio version, since they cancelled it this semester, but I guess I would say shop both. If you're just looking for a fun science course, take this if you really like chemistry and are good at math, not if you're looking for a class with engaging\/dynamic lectures that'll increase your desire to learn the material, cause you'll basically be teaching yourself. One huge plus is that the psets are ridiculously easy...if you just get together with some friends they're doable in 2 hours or less (especially if you don't care about actually learning the stuff at the time).",
    "This course is deceptively difficult. From the onset, it seems as if you know all of the material and can cruise right by, but there are definitely some nuances to the material that are not strictly intuitive. Take this course if you have to for your major, but be prepared to do more work than you think.",
    "This course is PChem. It's a tough course because it strikes an odd balance between mathematical rigor and conceptual chemistry. Plan to devote lots of time to it.",
    "This class is not easy but it's better than others you'll have to take. The material is straight forward and with Cross's notes online you know what you have to study. It's interesting material and unlike organic chemistry, you don't have to second guess everything you're doing because there are calculations and they are straight forward.",
    "Chemistry 332 is a very interesting course, but I would only recommend it for students very interested in Chemistry, most likely majoring in Chemistry or another major that requires the course. I say this only because the material is quite challenging and the coursework is time consuming. So although it is a great course, any student looking for a great course where all the learning is done in lecture and the homework is minimal should look elsewhere.",
    "Lots of partial derivatives and derivations. A good math background is definitely helpful. I thought it was a hard class, I heard some people say it was the hardest class at Yale they had taken, but of course, some people got through okay.",
    "Physical chemistry is a demanding but fascinating subject. Most likely you have to take it but if you take it with Cross it will be that much better. My advice to you is to really go over the practice finals in preparation for the exam.",
    "Yes. Not a bad class, lectures are super boring but the actual tests aren' that difficult.",
    "This course finally really explains what exactly thermodynamics is. Before taking this class, I guarantee that you truly cannot answer the deceptively complex question of \"What is enthalpy?\" or entropy or anything else for that matter. This finally puts it all into perspective. I have also heard Chem 118 referred to as baby pchem; I would refer to it as zygote pchem: Chem 332 is much much harder and very different.As an MB&B major who was forced to take this class because they cancelled the pchem with bio apps, I have to say, it was doable. It wash't the nightmare I was expecting. Weekly psets (actually, we only had 8 of them) due Mondays were annoying, but doable over the weekend. However, be prepared to focus VERY strongly on simply memorizing equations and exactly how to use and interpret them. I made the mistake of spending too much time trying to master the conceptual stuff. Focus on the practice exams!! Midterms are only 3 questions each and the final is 6, so studying is a big gamble. Your best bet is to master previous questions. The calculus required is really not that bad, once you figure out the very few partial derivative tricks that you can use over and over.I wouldn't recommend it unless you are really into chemistry. I don't think it will really help your typical MB&B or bio major.",
    "Very dry material, but even if you get below average you'll get a good grade. Go to review sessions.",
