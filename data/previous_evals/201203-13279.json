    "If you have any interest in visual art, take this class. Don't make the mistake of thinking animation is child's play: Gerow's selections are vast and quite representative of animation history, and even national traditions within that history. I would not be surprised if this course inspires more animation courses to be offered in the department. Readings highlight important points in the theoretical history of animation, and could present a challenge to those unfamiliar with film studies, but he remained in tune throughout the semester to what students were and were not understanding, and worked to make key ideas clear to everyone. As a freshman, I once took a film class with a session entitled \"Animation: The Death of Cinema.\" I encourage aspiring film students to look here for a much more modern, inclusive approach to film history.",
    "If you are interested at all in animation, absolutely yes. The films\/shorts we cover are extremely entertaining and you get to follow animation from the 1900s to the present. Professor Gerow is not the most lenient grader though - you definitely have to know your stuff, so put effort in this class - just because it's about animation doesn't mean it's a gut class.",
    "This class is a very academically-grounded historical survey of animation, along with critical theory discussions within and across different eras of animated film. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course with the caveat that one should not expect to spend much time watching animation as a percentage of the coursework involved, it is a very reading intensive class.A very good class for any film studies major, giving new perspectives on cinema in general from an aesthetic standpoint.",
    "Yes, take this class. It teaches you many different ways to think about many different works. It can be exhausting at times, but it's well worth it.",
    "Yes. Interesting material, and professor Gerow is great. There is a fair bit of reading, but otherwise the work load is pretty light. One midterm paper, one final paper, and one short class presentation.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class. You get to watch all sorts of animated films for credit, what better way is there to spend Wednesday night? It's a great introduction to both film studies as well as animation.",
    "This course is very interesting to take although you will be reading a lot. The films covered in the out of class screenings are usually very interesting and do a good job of covering a lot of ground between them all. He will usually keep things engaging by viewing shorter films in lecture and leading discussion with the class. If you like cartoons, I'd highly recommend it. If you are a fast reader or are okay skipping readings here and there (credit,D,failing this course is a really nice break from your studies), the workload is minimal, with short weekly responses to the screenings and two essays (5ish and 10-15 pages).A warning for those thinking of credit-D'ing and skipping too many of the readings: make note that although the midterm essay can be written largely independently from any in-class readings, the final paper requires extensive use of them so either find a final paper topic early or make sure to cover the important ones."
