   "comments": [
    "This course taught me a lot about refugees in literature and about the problems in Canadian culture I previously knew nothing about. I am so glad that I took this course. I feel like my writing skills increased and my insights about literary analysis and critical refugee studies also increased.",
    "Fascinating look at literature of Canada under the specific topics of refuge and refugee writing. Reading responses, discussion, and a look at critical theory of politics and race all came into play.",
    "Critical thinking skills on analyzing what makes a refugee narrative distinct and universal, how we define and represent refugees, etc. Presentation skills in the presentation assignment. Knowledge of modern Canadian issues and publishing industry.",
    "This course gave me a widespread introduction to Canadian fictions of refuge. I further developed my critical thinking and analyzing skills through close reading of literature, poetry, and political theory. Most importantly, this course has taught me that literature can never stand alone; it is closely related to our world and calls for action and social participation.",
    "This class taught me to think critically about the type of texts that I would normally approach as \"fun\" reading, i.e. novels I would pick up to read on my own but would not immediately recognize as being rich sources of social inquiry etc. I was introduced to a whole body of literature - Canadian literature - that I hadn't thought to approach before. And it got me to think about present day issues of refugees and immigrants and how they are cast in the public eye.",
    "- became a better writer - analyzed critical readings - understood that engagement with and healthy criticism of countries considered the best at refugee relations is important - how to engage with writers -why fiction is important to study in the context of real human issues",
    "You will hone the skills that generally come with any English seminar - improving your confidence in critical discussion, becoming a better writer, etc. In this particular class, you will also develop your global awareness, especially on the issue of refugees and humanitarian work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class main strength was its size, the novels, Thy, and the level of engagement of the entire class. I was not expecting this to me my favorite class this term, Thy and my other classmates helped me learn so much about a topic I knew almost nothing about, and it has really made me want to take more courses in the humanities. It was a lot of work to have a response due every week but it made me really think about the novels.",
    "Strengths: -The professor was very good about giving us feedback and focus in our written work. She really put the thought and effort into reading and commenting on our reading responses. She took the time to meet with us all individually and was very understanding about our workloads. She was also very kind to all students and made everyone feel welcome and able to participate intelligently, which is a skill not all English professors have developed. -Class was engaging, and everyone in the class seemed very interested in the topic, so we had good discussion -Classmates were intelligent and thoughtful people, very willing to help one another out. -Course material was refreshing and probably the only time I'll read English literature through a Canadian lens instead of an American\/British lens. Weaknesses: -The professor designed the course in a way that she barely needed to teach anything: the class met once a week, and students were divided into groups such that one group led a class discussion nearly every week. We didn't even have class the final week, meaning that our professor rarely had to be engaged or in charge of the class discussion. She was often out of town and it felt like her focus wasn't really to be a professor at Yale. -Course was at times confusing - Canvas wasn't always updated with information, students weren't notified about how or when to submit assignments, and I often had to resort to asking other students about what to prepare for class the next week. -The course seemed to lose steam the final two weeks. I would focus on clarifying the course material. Maybe condensing the focus of some of the books, and then limiting students to a 30-minute presentation so it's not all abstract discussion. It would be nice to have a little more direction in the discussion too.",
    "The presentation set-up is a good element of the course, because it enables students to take the lead on discussion (although the presentations could be shorter, I think -- sometimes they took up almost half the 2-hour class period). The booklist is great and diverse. Although we were already reading lengthy novels, there could have been more theoretical readings on the side.",
    "The strengths of this course lay in the curriculum and the professor. Professor Phu carefully curated a list of literary works and organized the class based on theme. These themes gave us a good overview and introduction to fictions of refuge. Sometimes she asked us to read theory papers that supplemented our theme of the week. These papers were a bit dense, perhaps too much for a 200-something listed English class. The works we read were diverse, showing us the diversity in \"refugee literature.\" Professor Phu is a brilliant scholar and a warm teacher, and if she were teaching this class at Yale again, I would highly recommend it to my peers. One weakness of the course lay in the class structure; it always seemed like our class ran too short and our discussions unfinished. Professor Phu was always happy to meet with students outside of class to continue these discussions, so that was one way to overcome this. I think perhaps we could have split our class up so that the first half of class, Professor Phu would lead a discussion about our latest reading material; then, the second half of class, a brief student presentation could open a discussion on the previous week's readings, so that the class would be familiar with the book before listening to a well-prepared presentation.",
    "I felt that the format of this course, particularly the weekly reading responses that Professor Phu provided helpful feedback on, were key to making this course as interesting and engaging as it was. I also enjoyed the group presentations that we had almost every week - Professor Phu engaged very closely with each group to ensure that group members and the class audience alike would be able to gain from the experience. I had a lot of fun working with my group, and thanks to Professor Phu's guidance and high expectations for us we engaged deeply with the novel in a way that I have never done before in a group setting.",
    "I loved the use of outside speakers. You really taught us to engage in and outside of the classroom. You also recognized how to create a safe and positive space for everyone. I am so thankful for this course. There is nothing I would change.",
    "The class thinks deeply about the experiences of refugees in Western nations and how those are presented, through a variety of angles, in literature. The guest speakers that Professor Phu brings are wonderful, and discussions are pretty much always engaging. This can be a tough class to gauge depending on your background in refugee studies. If you've had extensive background in the matter, the class may be more interesting than it will seem for others because the material can be difficult, emotionally, to read. Professor Phu makes it clear that this might be the case on the day of the first lesson, so students go on and take the course at their own discretion."

   "comments": [
    "If this class is offered again - take it!! Was such a valuable learning experience. Highly recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's quite a lot of work, as we read a book nearly every week, in addition to a weekly two-page reading response, and some longer written work, but I found the course material refreshing and valuable. It's probably the only time at Yale you'll look at Canadian literature of any sort, and looking at it through a critical lens regarding ethnicity, race, and migration, made it all the more valuable of an English course. That being said, it's a little scattered and I felt at times that we were doing a lot of unnecessary work given that most of our classes were group presentations or guest lectures.",
    "I definitely would - it was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is a great course to encourage you to think about the intersections of critical refugee studies and literature, the landscape of modern Canadian fiction (which is an important part of studying anglophone literature, but one otherwise neglected by the Yale English department), and novelistic writing, in general. The books on the syllabus are fun and though they vary in quality, they all add a different angle to the themes and questions covered throughout the whole course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students, especially given our political climate. The curriculum was well planned with wonderful contemporary Canadian works and supplementary political theory papers. Professor Phu is extremely well-versed on the subject, and in addition to her academic brilliance, she is warm and kind and welcoming to all students. She planned a symposium for the class, inviting renowned scholars and authors, and this interaction helped me immensely while writing my final paper.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course material was both interesting and felt vitally important during a time when issues of refuge are at the forefront of many people's minds. Moreover, Professor Phu created a truly safe space for people to share thoughts and discuss.",
    "Please take this course if it ever offered again. I wish Thy could be a professor at Yale. She really should be.",
    "If Thy Phu is still teaching at Yale, I highly recommend this course for anyone who might be tired of English courses that solely revolve around old dead white authors. You will read contemporary works, from Canada (who ever goes into a bookstore and says: \"Today I'd like to pick up a novel by a Canadian author?\" ... Exactly), and you will get a rather broad perspective on refugee narratives and the different forms that these may take. Thy is a longtime scholar of refugee literature and well versed in the Canadian literary canon. She invited some of the authors whose works we read down to guest lecture, and they were all simply wonderful. Discussions tend to be very open, and Thy is very accommodating to talking about the sections of each text that students in the class felt most compelled by. You can expect some heavy subjects being brought up, but you're taking a class on refugee literature, so don't come in expecting fairy tales. I really enjoyed this class, and although I am an English major, many of my classmates were not, and they seemed to enjoy it just as much."
