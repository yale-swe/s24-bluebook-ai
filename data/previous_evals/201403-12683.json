    "I came in with very high expectations and they were exceeded. Professor Dufresne is the most dedicated professor I've had at Yale--she puts in more thought and effort into the course than I've seen before. Also inspiring, encouraging and wonderful to work with. The class is taught so that you really understand how the law works and how policy functions. Our engagement with real time law and policy issues along with the experience Professor Dufresne brings in makes everything in the class very real. The class is a lot of work, but each assignment you do will have a clear purpose and skill related goal. I learned more about policy in this class than all the other policy focused classes at Yale. Of course, you will learn TONS about the law as well. If you can get in, there's no reason to take a different class over this if you have any interest in children, policy or the law.",
    "This class basically deals with all elements of children's law and policy: juvenile justice, adoption, child welfare, due process, education\/schools, parental rights, and basically everything else you can think of kid-related. DEFINITELY TAKE IT!!!! It's an incredible class. The one drawback is the high workload, but it's the type of work that you will want to do, plus Dufresne does so much work for the class that it's not a problem for you to also do so much work because she probably does infinitely more work than you ever could.",
    "Definitely. It gets you thinking about children's issues in entirely new ways. It is the best possible preparation for learning how to write and understand policy. Prof Dufresne is the best",
    "Great! Broad introduction to children's law and policy. Quite literally. Most of the work is focused on law itself (oral arguments of famous children's law cases, reading those major cases), and on policy itself (learning about CT children's policy and practicing how to make your own policy). Very smart and motivated students from whom you can learn a ton. Required outside group discussions with them are very helpful, too.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. get ready to do tons of work, so make sure you care about the topic. But if you are pre-law, interested in policy or love kids, or all of the above, then take it! If you are as lucky as I am, you will be in a class with super intelligent, passionate, eloquent people who share your interests and make you think through societal issues in a new way! All the work and all the readings are so worth it. And you will eventually appreciate oral arguments.",
    "The course demands lots of time and effort, but you get out of it as much time as you put into it. It was really interesting and rewarding as long as you did the required work. I would definitely recommend the class to someone interested in juvenile issues in general, from adoption to juvenile justice. You get the enough amount of policy and law. Just be aware that most of the policy discussions, besides your final policy project, tend to be CT-centered, given Prof. Dufresne's direct involvement with the issues at the local level.",
    "Phenomenal class if you're interested in the topic. More practical than theoretical - this includes all the homework assignments (about 1 per week). Oral argument preparation once a week as well, although you only present once throughout the semester. A lot of work but well worth it.",
    "Absolutely. You HAVE to take this class if you are interested in the subject matter. Dufresne is incredible and makes the class very comfortable. You learn so much and also have your mind expanded in thinking and discussion about the issues. It also makes you care and want to get involved, and Dufresne is happy to talk to you about ways to do so. It is a lot of work but if you do it it's very rewarding because you feel like you actually understand something as opposed to most humanities classes.",
    "This was by far the best course I have taken at Yale. You will gain a ton of insight into both theoretical and practical applications of law. More than anything, Professor Dufresne was outstanding. She exuded and inspired passion and cared about each student's learning. If it sounds at all interesting, take the class. It will undoubtedly be a great decision. The one caveat is that you should not take this course during a heavy semester. You will have to (and more important, want to) devote huge amounts of time and energy into this class.",
    "Yes-- if you're interested in law or children & family, you should definitely take this class. It is definitely very subject specific, but for me, I had never had experience in either law or the subject matter, though I was interested in both. It was an excellent introduction to law.",
    "YES! Take this course! True, its more work than other courses, but the work is always interesting and involves lots of group work, so you're guaranteed to have support from classmates. It is totally worth it for what you get out of it.",
    "Children's Law and Policy gives you a comprehensive look at legal issues that concern children and families. Most classes feature oral arguments and discussions. The professor takes a fairly practical approach; this class is not at all philosophical. The professor is really wonderful. Although she takes a long time to get work back, she gives very thorough comments. She asks good discussion questions. The class also attracts an interesting group of students. I enjoyed getting to know many of my classmates, and became friends with more students in a class than has every happened before--and I'm a senior. I think there are some misconceptions around the workload for this class: -The grading for the homework was not all that harsh. -The amount of reading declines over the course, and some weeks there is barely any, so you can catch up. -The oral arguments are actually very chill. Be prepared, of course, but you basically just sit in your seat and read through notes you prepared. -There are only about 4-5 homework assignments besides the final project. You're not doing lots of work each week. -The final was not bad at all. You certainly needed to be prepared. But I finished with plenty of time. And a mastery of every legal issue was not required. I'll just note finally that the hype around this class may be slightly overblown. Don't get me wrong; the class is great. I don't think anyone who's interested in this material would at all regret taking it. I definitely loved it. But many people absolutely gush about this class, and though I totally recommend, I'm not gushing. Sometimes the discussions were a little boring. Sometimes I thought the class missed the big picture. But overall, still great and highly recommended!",
    "Absolutely - one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. If you are interested in law, or in children's psychology\/development\/education, you should absolutely take this course. And even if you're not, you should still consider taken this course. It was the most engaging seminar I have had at Yale. Whether or not you think right now that you are interested in legal issues surrounding children, this class will inspire you, challenge you, and be greatly rewarding.",
    "If you can get into this class and you are not frightened by smart people and reading, then you should take it. Reasons why: 1) cool assignments 2) great discussions 3) a chance to get to know the other students really well 4) oral arguments that amount to essentially in-class debates and are awesome 5) brilliant professor who frames the class in a unique way. Reasons not to feel bad if you can't get in: 1) you would have felt really overwhelmed by the super long emails professor Dufresne sends 2) you won't have to buy a 200 dollar book."
