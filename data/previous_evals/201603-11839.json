   "comments": [
    "I was able to better locate myself within the social formation and read the classics on which many Third World scholars base their thoughts.",
    "In this class, I was introduced to the field of Third World Studies and the history of ethnic studies. This class was incredibly important to me because ethnic studies is the field that I have found my intellectual home in, and by learning about the 1968 Third World Liberation Front, I was able to connect my own subject-position to those who were willing to give their lives and bodies for the creation of ethnic studies. As someone who is thinking about going into academia, this class was valuable to me because it was very theory-heavy and we had a lot of reading, so it challenged me to be an efficient, organized, and critical reader.",
    "This course helped me critically evaluate society from a plethora of new lenses and allowed me to better articulate where and how I stand among others in terms of extant power structures. This course was incredibly enlightening.",
    "I learned how to analyze social phenomena like race, class, gender, as well as global distributions of resources, that I see or experience in my life every day. I learned what causes these dynamics and how, which was really helpful in understanding the world around me, as well as my own identity.",
    "Historical analysis, understanding of theory and philosophy",
    "I developed so much vocabulary from the various works we read, and it really grounded my academic work as a whole. Prof. Okihiro will make you think about constructions such as race and the nation in entirely new ways.",
    "I learned a lot about Third World Studies theorists and the mechanisms of colonialism.",
    "This class gave me an incredibly valuable foundation to writings of resistance and theory. I take a lot of ER&M classes and it finally tied them all together for me.",
    "I gained a better base of theory with which to analyze minority populations within the United States. I am now better able to conceptualize present day and historical relationships in terms of power and wider narratives of oppression. It also gave me a vantage through which to critique movements based in identity.",
    "This class challenged me to engage in eight readings weekly and engage with each author's arguments critically. It was a different experience to enjoy many authors a week, in comparison to two or three in most other classes. The vast exposure, however, is one of the reasons I enjoyed this class and learned a great deal.",
    "While I don't think it's possible to fully articulate what I've learned from this course, one important skill I developed is the ability to locate power within the social formation. This course gave me a deeper understanding of what power is and how it has been channeled into select identities throughout history. Because this course, I more fully understand some of the contemporary issues of inequality that exist within the world today. I also learned to think more abstractly and theoretically thanks to this course.",
    "The best part of this class was definitely the reading list, although it was a lot it covered so many important topics and filled in necessary gaps in my knowledge of neoimperialism constructions of race",
    "I learned to situate myself within the theory and history of Third World Studies.",
    "I loved this class! It opened me up to another world I would never have known about. Professor Okihiro illustrates the struggle of the Third World through amazing lectures and readings. Overall an amazing class.",
    "By taking this class, I was put into a position that allowed me to contemplate my own subject position in the social formation. In discussing the this subjectivity with respect to race, gender, class, and sexuality, I was also able to be given a better grasp on understanding the relationships of power within the world.",
    "I learned how to critically engage with heavy theory while also developing my own arguments.",
    "I gained a whole new understanding of race and racial formation through this class. I learned new ways of approaching radical political economy, colonialism and imperialism, and the intersections of the identities and categories along which power is expressed. I learned a whole new vocabulary to talk about the politics of power and oppression. I also learn about critical theory and philosophy, in particular post-structuralism.",
    "Intro Third World Studies provided me with much more theoretical analysis experience than I expected. The course materials will be incredibly useful to me in future classes, and I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning more about a variety of fields of theory - the texts are applicable to many fields of interest and majors. This has been one of the most useful courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "This course teaches mostly about the theoretical field of Third World Studies.",
    "I learned so much about the history and theories behind oppression based on race, gender, sexuality, class, migration\/immigration. This class truly gave me to the vocabulary, theorists, and tools to be able to talk about these issues that involve the marginalized. I had never dealt with material like this, it was eye opening. I absolutely loved this class for not only the content, but for the wonderful professor and TAs.",
    "This class has completely changed and shaped the way I now look at society. There are no words to describe how much it has changed my worldview. It has not only taught me about the history of the Third World and the theories in Third World Studies; it has also led me to critically examine and question the foundations of society in a way that nothing has ever done before.",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale so far, by far. The topics discussed go deeper than your regular Ethnic studies class. You learn about power dynamics, identity, creation, gender, and so much more. You learn about yourself as you learn about these topics too. I learned how to write concisely about complicated ideas. I learned how to get through dense theoretical work. And I learned how to balance out different theories and create my own from them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe I'm just not used to having theoretical academic readings but there seemed to be way more readings early in the semester than I could handle, especially since most readings were quite dense and theory-oriented. Readings got cut down later in the semester which helped a lot.",
    "Strengths - the topic is really interesting and especially important in our current political moment. Weaknesses - I think the amount of readings should be reduced, from 6 readings per week to maybe 4. I feel like having so many readings prevents students from engaging with each of them thoughtfully and forces us to do a lot of skimming.",
    "The weakness of this course was that it was very easy to get by without really applying yourself to learning the material. Everything was very theoretical and not very concrete. The stregnth is that professor okihiro is fascinating character and can provide a very interesting prospective of the world.",
    "The lectures were rambly and hard to follow. Also the intense level of academic terminology put me off. But readings were great. TAs were great.",
    "very disorganized, disjointed course. The lectures were disconnected and themes were unclear",
    "I think it's pretty impossible to do all the reading.",
    "Strengths: detailed overview of systems of oppression Weaknesses: theoretical but without a praxis",
    "The strength of the class is Professor Okihiro and his amazing scholarship. He is such an amazing lecturer and has brilliant insights. I do think the class could be a bit more organized in terms of grading policies.",
    "I personally think this class would work much better as a seminar.",
    "I thought this course had wonderful lectures and materials. The sections were also very helpful and open. However, I wish the readings were a bit more consolidated and that there was a better trajectory within the syllabus.",
    "Prof. Okihiro and the TFs were really great in making sure we understood the material and the arguments made. At times, it was difficult to follow lectures with the lack of any visual aid; nevertheless, Prof. Okihiro's outlined his lectures in a way that we as students could follow the theories presented.",
    "The strengths include the fabulous reading list from an eclectic group of authors, the TFs, and of course Professor Okihiro. It could be improved by a more organized structure to lectures as they sometimes were scattered and difficult to follow.",
    "At first there was some confusion about the way grading was going to work so in the future I think if reading responses weren't graded for points and from the beginning just kept it holistic, that would eliminate some confusion.",
    "Strengths: engaging lectures, enjoyable sections",
    "Too much reading that required ttobhigh if a level of prerequisite knowledge about the subject for a supposedly intro course.",
    "The course was a bit disorganized at the beginning, but once grading policies and sections were solidified, class ran smoothly. On the flip side, the syllabus was thoroughly put together. The readings assigned for each week were cohesive and complemented one another.",
    "The professor is a fantastic teacher and human being. The readings are often fascinating and the lectures are rich and engaging. Students had trouble speaking in lectures though They were meant to be interactive, in part because there is a strange pressure to speak correctly. Also the section discussion was limited, in particular because the reading load was too heavy to be realistically completed. Criticism of my writing by the teaching fellow was limited.",
    "Very interesting material, but the volume of readings was a little unreasonable in the beginning of the year. Lectures, though also interesting, could be confusing at times since they weren't structured in any particular way.",
    "The class was wonderful. The only weakness I had with the class was the readings. There were a lot of readings and it was hard because we were taught to skim the readings\/read critically, but they were so interesting that I really wanted to read all of them in depth- which wasn't very possible given the time we had in addition to the rest of my courses. The professor heard us, though, and decreased the readings at the end of the semester.",
    "This course is amazing; Professor Okihiro is perhaps the most engaging and charismatic lecturer I've had the pleasure of taking a course with, and the information presented in this course is so incredibly important and life-changing. At times, some of the theory was difficult to keep up with as someone who did not have any background in ethnic studies\/WGSS, but in general Professor Okihiro was good about answering questions and clarifying."

   "comments": [
    "Overall a good course, although since ER&M is pretty self-selecting if you're considering taking it you probably already agree with everything that's going to be said. If you like dense readings on critical theories of race and colonialism, etc, then you'll enjoy it more.",
    "This course is taught by a legend, and is very fulfilling to learn about history in the context of power.",
    "This course centers around the theme \"locate your subject-position within the social formation.\" In that sense, the course is all about connecting our personal lives and experiences to the theory, scholarship, and knowledge base centered in \"Third World Studies\" (or ethnic studies). I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the field of ethnic studies. It is important to learn about the history of the field, and Intro to Third World Studies does a really good job of connecting the current field's subject matter to the 1968 Third World Liberation Front and then drawing further connections between the field's history, present moment, and where it is going in the future. Gary Okihiro is also legendary in the field of ethnic studies and especially in Asian American Studies. He is very obviously incredibly brilliant - but also funny and really cares about the material and about the students. It's hard to engage more personally in a large lecture course, but he encourages everyone to visit his office hours and get to know him. If I had a criticism of the course it would be that the amount of readings is really overwhelming - it definitely is a lot of reading, but the class isn't really that difficult in general. Just reading responses, a midterm, and a final essay that's actually very interesting to write.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in theory and ethnicity race and migration. You definately get more out of this course if you are very interested in the topics and engage with the material.",
    "This is a great course with a minimal workload. The content of the course tackles a broad range of topics and writers that help you evaluate the power structures in society from many different lenses. The class and final paper also ask for a fair amount of introspection, so if you're into trying to better understand and position yourself in the world, this will help.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! Prof. Okihiro is amazing, and the material really formative.",
    "Yes, I would! The readings in the course are really essential. They will truly help you understand not just a random body of knowledge, but how the world around you works, on a sort of fundamental level, as well as your place in it. I think everyone should learn the things that are taught in this course as sort of a baseline for operating in a globalized world.",
    "Yes. It offers a great overview of the systems of thought that contributes to our understanding of the world today.",
    "Yes, take this course! Professor Okihiro is wonderful, and you will read some amazing pieces that are important for your academic work and life in general.",
    "If you're tired of thinking that the Western world has thrived without being challenged, take this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the theory behind ethnic and third world studies. Professor Okihiro is amazing and will engage with you directly in lecture. The readings are classics that are enjoyable and thought provoking. Other than heavy reading loads, there is very little work. It would probably be a good fifth class!",
    "Yes, take this class! It will change the way you look at the Third World. Plus, Prof. Okihiro is amazing!",
    "I would strongly recommend that students take a course taught by Professor Okihiro. Even though his lectures can sometimes be scattered, having the opportunity to learn from a man of such wisdom, humility and humor only comes around every once in awhile. His course will revolutionize the way you think about contemporary issues of inequality.",
    "Yes I would, even thought sometimes the schedule and lecture was disorganized, Professor Okihiro is really great and it was really cool to be taught my someone who like was an active player in the theory we're reading from like the 60s and 70s. He's great and the reading is great.",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend this class to another student. It is informative and life-changing.",
    "Not unless shred wee goig g into this subject, for the level of engagement and he degree of difficulty were quite high for a class Ithat does not relate to my future field of study.",
    "This is a class that should be offered every semester, and - in an ideal world - backed to the point that everyone has an opportunity to take the class before they graduate. Not only does it provide the language and ability to discuss both relationships of power with respect to identity in the past and present, but it makes one more aware of the different dynamics at work within the world. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Unlike most courses, Third World Studies teaches students about the formation of field. We read very crucial theorists and formulated our own ideas. There was a lot of reading, but all were very important and thoughtfully chosen. The course was a bit disorganized at the beginning, but I'm sure it will run much more smoothly if taught again. Professor Okihiro is a force in the field and loves to engage with the students. It was a tremendous pleasure.",
    "Professor Okihiro is amazing. The readings expanded my understanding of how race, gender and ethnicity operate and some theories to help understand the constructs that structure our society. The class does not present dogma but a bunch of ideas to be challenged and questioned and understood.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Okihiro is an excellent lecturer, and I hope that I am able to take a course at Yale with him again. The teaching fellows were also incredibly helpful! I hope that this course will be offered again, if so I will definitely recommend it to all students, regardless of major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! Really interesting; be prepared for lots of reading. Good practice for reading quickly for big ideas.",
    "Absolutely, take this class if you are into ER&M, African, Asian, Native, Latinx studies. It will truly equip you will the tools and vocab you will need to comprehend and discuss topics that will come up in your other classes.",
    "In my opinion, every student should take this class before they leave Yale. Obviously that's impossible, maybe moreso considering it's uncertain this course will be offered again, but I absolutely think that everyone should give this course a try. It seriously changed my life and the way I look at society, and it's an incredibly important and essential look at the true histories and power structures underlying society and creating structures of oppression today. Professor Okihiro is astoundingly sharp, charismatic and engaging, and hilarious, and I truly hope Yale does the right thing and brings him back to teach this course and other courses.",
    "Amazing class and very relevant to today's racial problems. It'd be great if more classes like this were offered at Yale. It would be a great class to serve as an ethnic studies requirement because it touches on a lot of topics white people should have a better understanding on."
