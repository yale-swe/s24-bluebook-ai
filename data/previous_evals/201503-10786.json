    "I would recommend this course if a student has never seen any solid state physics. Otherwise, skip."

    "It really gave me the background for the type of research that I do (phonons!). Homework questions were often applicable to research that I am currently doing and will do in the future.",
    "Somewhat helpful.",
    "The course was very helpful for research and I have already found many of the materials useful during my first semester.",
    "This course did not deepen my knowledge."
