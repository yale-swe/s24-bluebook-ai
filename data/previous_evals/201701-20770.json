   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the class size, very interactive with classes of 15 or fewer, and I think the textbook is really helpful. Also the activities done in class are very helpful in preparing for the quizzes and tests. The only weaknesses are maybe needing to do more in class speaking.",
    "The strength of this course was the level of engagement that it required and the daily work that allowed us to learn the language much more efficiently. I believe a weakness would be that we spoke English very often in class and I sometimes didn't feel prepared for oral exams.",
    "The strengths are that you are required to only speak in Italian so you learn the language faster. A weakness is that sometimes the class moved too quickly and I was confused about certain aspects of the language.",
    "The teachers are very nice and accommodating. However, I first had Sandro and he was a horrible teacher, so I changed sections. The teachers seemed to very disorganized and things were constantly changing. Also, this were not conveyed clearly or correctly are work or exams."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. I also enjoyed L2 italian much more than L1 as the pace is a little slower even though the material is a bit more difficult. Italian is a fun language and all the instructors are amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was a great language to learn and Luca was a wonderful professor. This course allows the students to learn about Italian language and culture in an interesting way and the workload is not excessive.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I like that the way that this class was taught. I felt like I learned a lot. Also, my professor was great so I really enjoyed the class!",
    "I love the Italian departments as they are always fun and friendly. The workload is manageable and coming from learning Spanish before in high school, Italian is a great transition."
