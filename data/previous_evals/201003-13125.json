    "Maybe take it if you're looking to branch out. The course ends up being more about Haskell (for Great Good!) which I don't think I'll ever use.",
    "learn haskell and the principles of functional programming through music applications.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. You learn functional programming, which is quite interesting. The music application makes it a lot more interesting. The professor is great. Excellent elective.",
    "This is more of a programming course than a music course - it's more about functional programming. By the time you get through some basic Haskell, you don't have time for terribly complex demonstrations of algorithmic music. Most of the programs used to generate music that we learn about are very rough, though you will learn about a few different methodsof algorithmic composition. Not recommended if you're primarily interested in the musical aspects. For functional programming, though, it should be worthwhile.",
    "not a very good course. lack of structure. didn't learn enough haskell or computer music to make it worthwhile.",
    "This class is fantastic. Not only does it give you an opportunity to screw around with musical things, but it teaches functional programming which is a little different way of thinking (Remember Scheme?). Prof. Hudak is one of the best teachers in the CS dept., he makes all the material very clear, and the homeworks are sometimes challenging but always do-able and often fun! Take this course! A great elective for CS.",
    "I would definitely recommend 431 to anyone who wants to take an interesting computer science class without a whole lot of work. You learn a lot, and the nature of Haskell means you won't spend a ton of time writing lines and lines of code."
