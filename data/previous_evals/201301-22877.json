    "DS History is highly recommended, especially with Professor Hill. In his section, you will not miss out on the main points and significance of the assigned texts. Plus, great advice on writing essays.",
    "Great class. Take it seriously and do all the reading",
    "CHARLES HILL IS AMAZING",
    "If I could begin freshman year again and decide whether or not to take DS knowing what I know, I'm not sure that I would do it. It's not for everyone, and I don't think I got out of it everything that I could, because I simply didn't have time to do a lot of the readings. Much of that was bad time management, but some of it was simply not having enough time, so it's important to factor in what you expect your year to look like when deciding whether or not to do DS. If you're on a varsity sports team, think long and hard. If you're in two or more musical groups, think long and hard. If you're going to be doing theater, which is very time consuming, think long and hard.That said, many people adore DS, and would do it all again in a heartbeat. Think about what you want to get out of your year, about how well you manage your time, and about what you are going to want to do besides classwork.Don't be afraid to not take DS if you don't like it during shopping period, and don't be afraid to drop it after first semester. But keep in mind that this advice is coming from someone who wasn't the biggest fan. Talk to as many people as you can about it, and try to get a sense of whether or not it's the right thing for you.",
    "I loved this course and looked forward to having it every Tuesday and Thursday morning. Professor Hill absolutely makes waking up at 9AM worth it.It is the only class that I have ever taken where I walked out everyday feeling like I understood the general outline of the text (obviously it is difficult to understand in detail in the Directed Studies context).Professor Hill knows the texts extremely well and offered fascinating insight.No criticism! An amazing class and the best Directed Studies section I took all year.",
    "I'm personally not an H&P person, so my answer is going to be significantly less enthusiastic than others' may be.Professor Hill is great at framing the big picture and tracing big themes throughout a work and the semester, but less good at closely analyzing the text. Whether or not you like the class will pretty much depend on whether or not his personal style appeals to you. The essays are ridiculous though. It's usually 3-5 authors in the span of 4 pages. At its best, it forces you to trace themes throughout works; at its worst, you're relegated to summarization.",
    "Hill has been the most interesting and transformative professor I have had at Yale so far. I would not trade this class for anything. His methods are unorthodox, and his grading often seems frustrating, but you will be a greater student and thinker for it. Take this class.",
    "Veered into the terrible rather more often than I'd like.",
    "Take it! Hill is a unique professor who will push you to really think, while also providing insights of his own. It's a lot of reading, but it's such important stuff that you'll (hopefully) enjoy it.",
    "Great, as usual. Thanks!",
    "The spring semester of DS history covers a lot of the most important thinkers in history, and it is very interesting how it all connects to our present circumstances. Charles Hill is a legendary professor, but frankly, he is overrated. He leaves the responsibility of going through the overall text to the students--he doesn't talk for the first 45-50 minutes of class. Then, in the last section of class, he goes through some huge overarching 1-2-3-4 linear argument that he tries to fit the entire work into. Looking at things one-dimensionally, 1-2-3-4, is characteristic of how he teaches. For papers, I've never seen anyone return papers in such a timely fashion. He is a hardworking professor. However, his paper topics are ridiculous. I thought the whole point of DS papers was close reading and really getting to understand an aspect of the writer's argument, but Hill's paper topics span 3-5 authors. The last one was about 5 authors and their ideas about liberty. He wants us to also come up with a 1-2-3-4 overarching argument that can fit MULTIPLE authors within. I was unhappiest about the first prompt, \"what would Machiavelli say about Luther's On Liberty,\" because I felt like it was collapsing two works of a completely different nature--a manual \/ self-promoting political handbook for a prince, versus a religious text. I appreciate that he was trying of make us see connections between the works, but you simply cannot synthesize two works in such a way--it takes away the individual value and merit they have on their own, it mixes up the different ideas and arguments of completely different natures, artificially simplifying them.",
    "Everyone should take DS. It addresses the foundational thoughts that pretty much describe every other thought we encounter today. It just makes you a better person.",
    "I would take this course, especially with Charles Hill. He is not the typical professor--he has a unique way of understanding and distilling texts to their essential themes-- but I appreciated his take and found the class thought-provoking (though he can be intimidating at times)."
