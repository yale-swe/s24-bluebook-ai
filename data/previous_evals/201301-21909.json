   "comments": [
    "French 172 was an introduction to the Muslim Orient as viewed through the lens of French literature since the 1600s. It allows us to explore all different literary forms and many different opinions and cultural ideas, all of which were incredibly interesting. I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student.",
    "There's a fair amount of reading. But not too many assignments (just 2 papers, 1 presentation, and 1 oral exam). It's a great class, that will only be better if people participate regularly (i.e. DO YOUR READING).",
    "The spring 2013 edition of French 172 was incredibly interesting. If you are interested at all in the evolving relationships between Europe and the Middle East, this study of Orientalism in French literature is an exciting literary perspective on that. While the reading is plentiful, the actual assignments are not overwhelming.",
    "no comment",
    "I would recommend this class if you enjoy reading. There is a lot of reading involved, but it is interesting and I learned a great deal about the middle east.",
    "This is a good literature\/culture course. If you take it spring semester, you will read many books and excerpts of books and plays to get a sense for how the middle east was portrayed in literature between the 17th and 21st centuries. It's actually pretty cool. The workload isn't awful. The 75 minute classes are a bit long though! But no section. It's a roundtable, discussion based kind of class. There are readings for each class, and there are also two 5-7 page papers, a class presentation and an oral exam.",
    "I would recommend it so long as you know you'll be interested in the material - it's very niche and specific. That said, it's really interesting stuff and you're studying hugely important French authors, and Orientalism is really relevant to a lot of literature, which I hadn't really realised before. Personally I loved it."
