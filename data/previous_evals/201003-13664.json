   "comments": [
    "It can sometimes be a little boring but you do get to read some interesting german literature. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to work on their reading and writing in German.",
    "Take it! It's a very interesting class. And not too much work to do. You'll get to read many German novels and improve your writing.",
    "German 150, at least with Professor Niesz, is much more a German writing and literature course than a grammar-based course, so it's not the class for you if you're trying to decide between L4 and L5 and want to work on grammar. If you've already gone through L4, or can speak enough German to get around in Germany, TAKE THIS COURSE! Although there was not as much practice speaking as I was hoping for, you get a ton of practice with reading comprehension and writing short (2 pages double-spaced) essays. (Also, the emphasis in each section of GMAN 150 just depends on the professor, so you can kind of choose if you'd like to work more on speaking or reading.)",
    "I would recommendit if you're looking to keep up your German, work on your writing, but aren't necessarily as interested in speaking the language. The texts are all very interesting and vary in difficulty level. The essay topics are generally interesting, and getting used to writing 2 pages in German is a good skill. Be sure you have a pretty solid foundation in grammar, as you won't really go over many grammatical topics.",
    "Yes, although I would warn that you're probably going to grow more in your writing than anything else. Although the choices for literature were a bit odd in some cases, I enjoyed most of it, and it was well presented.",
    "Yes, definitely. Class was very low stress and amusing every time. There isn't much opportunity to practice conversational German but there are language tables for that if that's what you're interested in. Mostly reading and talking about different aspects of German culture and history."
