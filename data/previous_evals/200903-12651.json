    "If you're interested in shipwrecks, shipbuilding, etc, take it. If you like learning random collections of facts, take it. If you want to have a cool professor who is really tops in his field, take it. If you absolutely care not at all about shipwrecks and the various tools used to excavate sites underwater, take a pass on it.",
    "no necessarily useful information unless you plan to go into underwater archaeology but very interesting and good for sparking interest in archaeology in general. not very much work but great class.",
    "If you have time in your schedule and it is offered again and, by some miracle, John Hale returns to teach at Yale again, take it!",
    "The lectures took the class on an incredible journey. We started with the history of the field of underwater archaeology, and then looked at a series of significant shipwrecks, submerged sites, and technological developments that led us to understand how significant the field is today. I would most definitely recommend this class.",
    "Hale was visiting from U of Louisville this year, but if you are lucky and privileged enough to take this class in the future, you MUST take it. I have never had a professor who cared so much about my education and loved his topic of study so passionately. If anything, lectures could maybe be a bit more organized, but considering that this was the first time this course was taught, all is forgiven. Learn about shipwrecks and submerged cities and other awesome stuff. You don't need to do any of the reading, but it is fascinating stuff; I ended up not having enough time in the semester to read for this class, but I look forward to reading our book over winter break. Workload is light: short artifact report, take-home midterm, longer paper, and a straightforward\/reasonable final.",
    "I don't know if this class will be offered again since this was the first time. It was by far the most interesting class I had this semester, and it had the lightest workload. Just take notes in class every day and you'll have all you need for the midterm and final.",
    "Take it! Class lectures are interesting, the history flows like one great story, and some science concepts add in a nice mix of fields and subjects. John Hale is well worth it.",
    "This class was super interesting and easy to go to. I never felt like I had to go to class because lectures were always different and covered a wide range of time periods\/geographical areas. It was so neat to learn about archeological sites underwater, it was something that I never thought I would study at Yale.",
    "Underwater Archaeology was a very interesting class that gave a great survey of the work done on shipwrecks and submerged sites. It not only covered a wide variety of wrecks\/sites and their impact on the understanding of past civilizations and cultures, but also the development of diving and the technologies that made the field possible. For anyone interested in the past or diving, this class really gives you a new understanding.",
    "the class was excellent, little work and phenomenally interesting.",
    "Absolutely take it.",
    "Pirates, scuba, Vikings... do you really need any other reasons? Too bad it's only being offered once.",
    "BEST CLASS EVER. I absolutely loved it. If you are at all interested in the subject material, the lectures are easy and actually fun to listen to, even though they are an hour fifteen, and the workload is very light, even if you do all of the reading. The papers are short and straightforward, and Professor Hale is the most endearing, approachable professor I've ever seen. He is passionate about the material and has been personally involved in this stuff, so he really knows what he's talking about. The optional field trip during reading week was also really fun and we got to meet real, textbook-worthy underwater archaeologists.",
    "Really incredible, fun, novel class. Youll never learn about this stuff anywhere else. Its also a really exciting class to take because its such a new field that you really do feel a bit like a pioneer.",
    "Underwater archaeology was a great class. Even if you are not an archaeology major, there is definitely something for everyone in the course. The worst part of the class was that it was at 9 in the morning.",
    "You learn about the archaeology of shipwrecks and submerged sites. What could be cooler? The 9 am time was no problem at all, since the lectures were like watching the history channel for an hour. If John Hale ever has the chance to teach this class again, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It is the best class that I have taken so far in the archaeology department.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "If this class is taught by John Hale, definitely take it. He is excellent, and the class was a lot of fun and very manageable. What other class includes pirates, samurai, the Titanic, AND Vikings? Don't miss it.",
    "An introductory course into underwater archaelogy, comprising the history, methods, and most important findings of the field. Definitely recommended for its interesting content and excellent professor.",
    "YES. Regardless of whether you're interested in archaeology, take whatever class Dr. Hale offers. Your will NOT regret it.",
    "Underwater Archaeology is a class that is exactly as it is called: a class on the archaeology of shipwrecks, sunken cities, and other submerged sites. I would highly recommend this class because I actually enjoyed it.",
    "Take this class! It's amazing. You will learn a ton and actually remember it a year later because it's so interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "This is easily one of the best classes at Yale in absolutely every regard.John Hale is one of the best professors I have experienced in my four years at Yale, and I implore you to consider him for a teaching prize. His course, Underwater Archaeology, was engaging and fascinating and I came away from it with a wide breadth of knowledge in a field that was entirely new to me. On top of that, Professor Hale genuinely cares about his students, both in the classroom and out. He is a model for how the collegiate atmosphere should function. For example, he created beautiful certificates of completion for each student in the class. Usually, this sort of thing could probably come across as a joke, but it was actually extremely touching in this case, because we were all so invested in the course.John Hale brings honor to Yale in this arena as well. Underwater Archaeology is a field on the precipice of becoming huge, and John Hale is one of the field's giants.On the last day of class, as I listened to Professor Hale, I became prematurely nostalgic when thinking \"Many decades from now, when I think back on the wonderful people I was able to learn from during college, this image of John Hale talking about underwater archaeology will be what I conjure in my mind.\"",
    "I would absolutely recommendUnderwater Archaeology to another student. If it is taught by John Hale, it is a must-take - it is one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. I learned so much from this class simply because of how interesting it was. Before taking it, I could never have guessed I would be taking a course that would teach me history, archaeology, anthropology, and even law and ethics all in one package. TAKE IT.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Hale is great. It is not too much work and you learn so much. It is a really interesting subject matter; regardless of what your major is, I am sure something in the course will capture your attention.",
    "If a class like this is ever offered again at Yale, I urge anyone interested in either shipwrecks or archaeology to take this course. Every minute of this class was incredible. Both the course material and the professor were amazing.",
    "The class is a survey of underwater sites, what was discovered, how the site became submerged, and the methods of excavation. I would recommend the class to people interested in archaeology, ships, and people just looking to find out fascinating information.",
    "Absolutely. Take this class. What is underwater achaeology, you might ask? Shipwrecks, sunken cities, lost treasure, ancient human remains, the Titanic, prehistoric settlements. This stuff is super interesting. I didn't know if it would be,but it is. This is one of the best classes I've taken in my four years and John Hale is the best teacher I've had. He genuinely takes a real interest in his students and cares deeply that everyone is engaged and learning. He makes time outside of class to see you. He may take you and the class out for some pizza at Yorkside with a Danish archaeologist\/karate champion. You may go see Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute to meet the people that discovered the Titanic and build underwater robots. Hands down, John Hale is the best teacher I've had in my four years. He absolutely makes this class worth it. His passion for the material could make anything intersting, but the nice thing is, the material is already super interesting.",
    "This is the BEST class I have taken at Yale. If you have the chance absolutely take it!! It was wonderful on every level. Professor Hale is amazing and creates the type of relationship that should exist between a Professor and student. I feel honored to have take this class and think it could easily become one of Yale's great classes. You are genuinely excited to go to each class.",
    "Yes! Although an unconventional subject, Professor Hale is FANTASTIC. You will learn far more than just underwater archaeology because archaeology is inherently tied to other disciplines such as ancient history and geography. A really fun class. I actually enjoyed getting up for the Monday 9am sessions, which says a lot. If Hale is back to teach it, TAKE IT!!"
