    "The second half of Social Enterprise in Developing Economies was extremely project-based with very little class time. It requires teams to keep track of the deadlines and write their case throughout the year. Overall, it was been a great experience that definitely brought me closer to my team and the entire class.",
    "The best class at Yale. The reason Yale is so incredible is because the resources it gives you to have unbelievable experiences. This class is just one of those examples.",
    "Really awesome class and the case study project is so worth it! It was an incredible experience. The second half of the course is at times disorganized as you work on finalizing the case projects, but it is still a great class. I'm really sorry it won't be offered next semester.",
    "Yes this is the best class at Yale. The content is interesting and you get the rare opportunity to do field work.",
    "The yearlong course setup was great for getting an in-depth understanding of what has already been done in the space, and then giving us some time to put together our own cases. Summer experience observing a social enterprise was so valuable for understanding the challenges they face. Bo was a great professor - I think he truly cared that we were learning and engaged.",
    "Meet cool people. Travel the world. Hang out with Bo.",
    "Take it, absolutely, if you can get in. It's a lot of work, but it's truly unique.",
    "It's a great introductory class to the major topics in social enterprise and takes you from an introduction point of knowledge to a deeper understanding through practical research and experience. It's quite unique and I strongly recommend it!",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. Take it if you have the chance."
