   "comments": [
    "This class is great! I didn't need it for a major or anything - I took it senior year as someone who likes to sing but has never sung this kind of music before. You have one rehearsal per week (about 2 hours) and 2 major concerts per semester (both of which are very fun.) I could probably complain about the fact that it's a full credit when science labs are only 0.5 credits, but whatever. I enjoyed it a ton. Take it if it appeals to you.",
    "It is an amazing course that both offers an in depth look at specific historical moments in music and a creative outlet for a group of talented musicians. Everyone interested in early music or singing in general should take it!",
    "Early Music is a really fun and wonderful class if you love to sing and are interested in discovering very different music. Working with our teacher, Grant Herried, is a complete joy- he clearly loves early music and is incredibly knowledgeable. Be prepared to learn music fast and sight-read and perform even if you don't feel 100%. Take it!",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this to another student! It's a lot of fun, and you'll definitely put your sight-reading skills to the test learning multiple new songs each class. There's very little homework as long as you come to class focused and ready to sing! This was seriously a great experience and a really refreshing class amidst all the crazy at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class! It's a great exercise for sight singing and it's a lovely way to spend a few hours a week singing. It was also pretty awesome to sing a concert in the Beinecke Library.",
    "Beautiful beautiful class! Take it! Wonderful exposure to a range of gorgeous early music, great instructor, barely any work outside of class, and you get to sing lovely choral music with other talented singers.",
    "An excellent course. Good for those who are continuing from the first semester as well as those jumping in now. Grant is a great teacher: he's a cool guy and an amazing musician. You'll have a great time in this low-stress class. No written assignments, a really short reading assignment, and two fun concerts. Beware that the quality of the performance is dependent on the other people taking the class. Sometimes there are less capable singers who drag the group down.",
    "Do you like to sing? Are you marginally confident at sight-singing? Take this class! It is a fun experience and very little \"work\" in the traditional sense. If you're singing in a new language or having a little trouble sight-singing quite so fast (this guy) it will just be all the more stimulating! Grant is a great conductor and you will learn things \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0music things and history things and ensemble things!",
    "If you have any interest in early music, this class (or its fall-semester counterpart, MUSI 223) is the place to start. When I mentioned to Grant that I (a lapsed cellist) would like to learn viola da gamba, he immediately arranged for me to borrow an instrument and set me up with weekly lessons with Rosamund Morley of Parthenia, the New York\u00e2\u0080\u0093based consort of viols. The early-music world is intimate and generous, and this is a great way in."
