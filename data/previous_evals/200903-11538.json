   "comments": [
    "Interesting material. don't take it with pinango unless you have a high tolerance for rambling lectures",
    "It's a good course, not too hard, but interesting nonetheless.",
    "This is a fun survey course that gets you thinking. It doesn't go in an easily followable order and that can be frustrating. It crawls into logic but you can never really tie any of it down in an easy way, since it's all newly developing research. I enjoyed playing with the many ideas put forth and reading the interesting articles. It isn't an overwhelming class--if you just stay on track and go to lectures, you'll do just fine. GO TO SECTION, it is SOOOO helpful I can't even say. The class is hard to grasp, if you feel like \"what am I supposed to know?\", just go to section and your prayers will be answered.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.I quote directly from my notes, taken verbatim from Prof. Pi\u00f1ango's comments during lecture:\"This class is a torturous journey.\"\"Some professors will give you a toolbox, teach you how to use the tools, and then expect you to use the tools on the test. This class is not that class.\"Prof. Pi\u00f1ango self-described her class as a \"torturous journey.\" She smiled when she said it. In lecture. In front of the whole class. This was the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Language and Mind is really just about language and very little about mind. If you have a basic understanding of linguistics and will attend and participate in every class this is a great class. If not, don't take it because you must be over-invested to really learn anything.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student; every aspect of the course was interesting (the readings, lectures, sections, even the exams).",
    "It's a good course, but you won't realize it until the end. Section is optional but crucial -- Professor Pinango is sometimes hard to understand and she scares many students off in the first week with the complexity of the readings. Over time, you get used to her teaching style and the material, and take away some important lessons from the course.",
    "Language and Mind was a fun class for me, although it helped that I understood the material pretty intuitively; some of my friends did not have such an easy time. That said, this course was my lightest course this semester. I found the readings very interesting, and although they are rather lengthy, I didn't think they took long to read nor that the length of the readings was at all unmanageable. The problem sets are all optional, which was definitely a plus, and they were generally harder than the tests. The class doesn't have a textbook, so you basically have to go to the lectures. If you take this class, go to at least the first section, even though they're optional; they were extremely helpful to me and others.",
    "In the end it covers mostly grammar-- very little \"mind\" which is disappointing if you expected that from the course name (Language and Mind). I would recommend only if you have some prior linguistics knowledge.",
    "I would not recommend it to anyone unless you are interested in actively discussing linguistic concepts in a seminar-like environment.",
    "The class can get tough if you don't study or attend the discussion sections.",
    "This is a somewhat confusing but ultimately very interesting course. The material required more thought and attention than other classes, if not necessarily time, which I sort of think is a good thing. Plus if you come out the other side of the \"journey\" successfully, you probably have a much better grasp on the concepts presented than if they had simply been handed over. I would recommend it to students who can be independent and are willing to think.",
    "I would not recommend it",
    "a haiku:Please don't take this classunless you really have toI didn't like it",
    "LING 117 is an attempt to figure out the relationship between language and mind through a distillation of our intuitions about language and language acquisition into a standardized model.",
    "Lecture was incomprehensible, often interrupted by tangential questions that made things even more confusing.",
    "This class is about the structure of language, and only briefly touches its implementation in the brain. The instruction is difficult to follow, and if you find it hard to understand on the first day, leave then because it does not get easier or more structured. The only way to survive in this class is by speaking up with the professor in class, because even if your ideas are wrong, she will hold up the whole class to make sure you understand it.",
    "An approach to language that asks the most basic questions about how language functions in relation to the mind.",
    "This class was a little too philosophical for me. There was a lot of 'what do you think' so I never really felt like I knew what was RIGHT until the end when we were reviewing...",
    "Great class if you are okay with leaving tons of questions unanswered with respect to the field, but then again, that is the nature of the field.",
    "I would not recommend this class to everyone because I didn't get that much out of it. I got the same info from this entire class as I did in intro to cog sci (which talked about this over two days)...",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but you should expect to be frustrated at first. Also, it is worth it to struggle through some of the tougher readings. It might not be apparent at first, but every reading Professor Pinango assigns helps build on the overall goal of the course.",
    "Language and Mind is a semester-long exercise in the process of linguistic inquiry. It is certainly about the process. Your assumptions will be challenged, but rarely will the answer be presented as simple and absolute. Class discussion is interesting but sometimes feels tangential, and at times utterly disorienting. The homeworks and exams aren't especially difficult, they just require you to think. It's a very interesting class, but only if you like the style; if you don't like Maria's approach in the first few days, you won't like the class. Overall, though, I found the class very interesting and thought-provoking."
