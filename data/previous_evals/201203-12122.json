   "comments": [
    "Amazing! I've heard critique that Deb's class does not teach \"technique\", but that is only on the surface. You will grow as a writer, an actor, and a person, and you will NOT regret having taken this class.",
    "YES! Great course!",
    "I would recommend this class. It teaches you more about yourself than \"Acting\", but I think that that is far more important in the long run.",
    "I would recommend THST 210 to another student. It is a prerequisite for the Theater Studies Major, however, it is far more enjoyable and interactive than THST 110& 111. The course is not a course in acting. It is a course in performance. Your experience in the course depends on your professor. The key is selecting the professor who will challenge you and help you to grow as a performer and as an artist.",
    "Yes yes yes! If you can take 210 with Deb, do so. I switched into this section and am so glad that I did. This class turned me on to the world, my own creativity, and the wealth of resources available in creating performance. While traditional scene study is not a large component of the class, I urge you to try something non-conventional and take this. Establishing a practice of writing everyday and creating my own performance pieces was one of the most satisfying aspects of my semester. Without a doubt.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this course! I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly speak more highly about it. This is a class I will always remember. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned and grown an incredible amount, had so much fun, and really had a chance to get to know everyone in a deeper way than in any other class I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken - 210 fosters a really amazing sense of community. Deb is the greatest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 kind, supportive, generous, fun, brilliant, inspiring, and has the most incredible sense of humor. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve accomplished so much throughout the semester - It was exciting and rewarding to see the culmination of everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work in the final performances. I miss our class already. The BEST course I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class only to prospective theater majors, and those with limited performance background eager to learn more.",
    "Acting 210 is one of the central parts of the Theater Studies curriculum, and it's wonderful. You're going to learn something completely different depending on which instructor you get, but no matter who it is the course is worthwhile and inspiring.",
    "I loved this class so, so much-- I could have gone to it every day. Lots of fun and interesting exercises, and you learn and bond so much as a class. Professor Margolin's class has a lot of writing exercises, and the semester ends with a self-scripted 10-minute performance project, which is so, so rewarding. It's also just wonderful to do scene work in class and get feedback. 210 makes 110 and 111 absolutely worth it. Such an excellent time.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! You will absolutely 100 percent not regret it."
