   "comments": [
    "I took this course as someone with a fairly strong math background but no linguistics background, and found it to be pretty easy. The people in the course whose background was the reverse of mine definitely struggled a little bit though. I didn't learn much, if any, new math, but seeing what I already knew applied to a subject previously completely foreign to me was pretty cool.",
    "First a caveat: I'm not a linguistics major and took this class on a lark since it had good evaluations, so I don't really belong to the group of students for whom this class was intended. Especially at the beginning, it really is a math class, and a fairly easy one at that, so if you have a strong math background you may be rather bored. Later topics about finite state automata and Turing Machines were new to me and therefore more interesting. The weekly problem sets are easy and, as you move on in the semester, have a fun puzzle-like quality to them. The take-home exams were definitely the best part of the course--they let you see how the abstract systems you learn about could be used in linguistic contexts. Prof. Jarosz is very nice and a decent lecturer who tries to engage her students. Learning from her is far more pleasant and efficient than learning from the textbook, so I gave up on the readings after a while. As to whether you should take this class, I'm sure it would be good if you were a linguistics major. For others though, I'm not sure it's as good of a choice.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR A QR. DON'T DO IT!!! It's not what you think it will be! I came to every class and most of the questions on the final were still incomprehensible to me. It doesn't involve ANY of the kinds of linguistics that I thought it would. Most of the topics come from computer science. It was very clear who in this class was a math\/science person, and who was taking it for a QR (me). It was a gut for the first group, and a really frustrating waste of time for the second group. Take intro micro instead.",
    "I took this class as a QR, and I have very mixed feelings about it. It could have been worse -- I didn't have to deal with numbers or in-class exams, which are the scariest things for me as a Humanities major. For that reason primarily I enrolled in the class. However, it ended up being pretty confusing logic \/ computer science stuff that doesn't really relate to linguistics much at all. And the class was full of people who were Econ \/ Linguistics majors taking it as a gut, and who therefore has 100 averages, which was kind of demoralizing. Gaja is nice, but she didn't slow down for us slow ones, so we ended up kind of lost and trying to work through these logic problems in small groups ourselves. I don't know if I'd recommend it -- I definitely wouldn't rule it out entirely, because there are much more painful ways to complete a QR, and it wasn't the worse. That said, there were also moments when I just thought, 'this sucks.' If you can find something easier and more relevant to the real world, take it. But if you end up in this class, find a great study group.",
    "fun class, you learn basic maths if you haven't before. good refresher also. gaja is very nice.",
    "A really fun subject! Also, pretty interesting work. However, as a mathy (non linguistics) person the subject material wasn't really that hard. I would've liked to learn more about how such formal foundations can be applied to linguistics problems. There were a couple problem set problems and midterm\/final problems that gave us a flavor of what that may look like, and were really enjoyable, but unfortunately we didn't get too much of it :(",
    "Although this class is in the linguistics department, it has a significant math component. The class consists of learning (or in some cases reviewing) a bunch of mathematical concepts and then seeing how they can be applied to linguistic problems suchas sentence construction, phonological change, and semantic meaning of quantifiers. As a linguistics major who had taken several math classes, I really enjoyed the class. I learned some new math concepts and some new ways of thinking about linguistic problems. For those without linguistics or math backgrounds, the class was a little more difficult, and those with math backgrounds were sometimes bored because they already knew the math. Gaja Jarosz is a great professor though, and she really worked hard to make sure everyone understood the concepts. The problem sets started easy and got more and more puzzle-like, usually with a few pure math questions and a longer linguistics application problem. The two take-home exams were fun and gave me a chance to problem solve without ridiculous time pressure. Gaja Jarosz and Mike, the TA, were really helpful whenever I had a question about something, so I wouldn't discourage people without a math background from taking it. While I think the class is a great experience for anyone, the workload will probably be significantly different depending on how much math background you have. Overall though, a fun and interesting course."
