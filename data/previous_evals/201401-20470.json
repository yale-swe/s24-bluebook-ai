    "It's okay. The first few weeks are really interesting. The second half is just researching a paper.",
    "It was such a fun and interesting class. Most of the semester is spent walking around museums or taking trips to the Conservation labs to use microscopes and infrared technology and x-rays. But thankfully the technical part of this class isn't too difficult. Everyone assumes you have a pretty basic knowledge of what an x-ray is, and so throughout the course you have a 'supervisor' (someone who works for McClure in the conservation department) who teaches you how to use the equipment and helps you out a ton with the research.",
    "Excellent intro to technical art history that will help decide whether to go into the profession."
