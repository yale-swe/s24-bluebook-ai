    "Yes, but only take it if you're interested in literary Chinese. Could be a boring class for ya. Don't take the class if you want to learn the grammatical structures. This class is a little bit more advance than that and you're expected to know them already.",
    "Definitely, you will read a lot of great Chinese writings from different dynasties, and yet all the writings follow the gu wen movement and you gain a cultural appreciation of gu wen in the Chinese literary history. Great professor.",
    "Though the course was an excellent opportunity to be exposed to some of the formative texts of the Chinese literary tradition, I would caution a student only to enter the course if he or she feels very confident about his or her classical Chinese. The course moves quickly and is entirely translation based; especially non-native Chinese speakers can get behind quickly, and it is easy to feel a little overwhelmed. The quizzes are fair but tough, as one has to complete them in a short amount of time. That said, the texts were well selected and the arrangement allowed students to view the development of certain ideas (persona, nature, etc.)throughout the tradition. Professor Lu is a lot of fun, and you definitely should not miss an opportunity to take a class with her during your Yale career. Just make sure that if you want to take this one, you feel prepared for it."
