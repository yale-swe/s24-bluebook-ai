    "See question 1 for summary. I would recommend Professor Duval's course to anyone with an interest in Renaissance poetry, Rabelais, The Aeneid, and especially to anyone with some prior knowledge of the epic and of Greco-Roman mythology.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Renaissance literature and the theory of imitation that informed interpretations of classical literary models. It provided an excellent model of how to conduct an analysis of this type of literature which could potentially be used to examine imitations of any number of classical texts in the same time period and beyond.",
    "An interesting if not wholly satisfactory course. Tough for non-Renaissance specialists due to fragmentary structure."

    "This course helped to fill an important gap in my knowledge of French literature and gave me a new appreciation for several Renaissance writers.",
    "It was a nice excursion into the Renaissance\/early modern period."
