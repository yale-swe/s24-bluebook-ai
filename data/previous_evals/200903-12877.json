   "comments": [
    "If you got a 5 on the AP exam and are looking to satisfy the language requirement, definitely take this class. It is the least amount of work of all the L5 freshman Spanish courses. In a nutshell: before every class, read some article or part of a short story, then discuss it the next class. Sometimes you have to write a page about what you read. It is not too difficult, and the reading material generally isn't bad but might be a bit boring at times. There were no grammar lessons (although there were a few vocab tests) so whether you actually improve at Spanish entirely depends on whether you choose to speak a lot in class. There are 2 oral exams which serve as the midterm and the final.",
    "I would recommend it to students who want to better their conversational skills. Take it instead of advanced grammar because you learn grammar anyway in this class and you can always meet with the professor if you need help with grammar.",
    "Its a great chance to improve your fluency and confidence. If you are not already a pretty good speaker, though, you're grades will not be amazing because the vast majority of the grade is on speaking. There is some written homework and some chance to improve your grammar, but not much. The workload is very small and the payoff is big in terms of improving fluency.",
    "It is a lot of conversation and reading-- not much writing at all. However, this is precisely what I was looking for in a Spanish class. The homework you get is usually just reading, with a few writing assignments thrown in here and there, and it's a reasonable amount. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to take an L5 Spanish class.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who have a decent background in spanish grammar\/writing\/reading but who feel that they have not had a sufficient opportunity to practice their speaking ability.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 150 to a student looking to maintain his\/her level of Spanish.",
    "Yes, definietly recommend it!",
    "You talk about a lot of things in Spanish: stuff like the death penalty, short stories, the environment, etc etc. You also do a court role play, 2 debates, 8 written assignments, and 2 oral exams. Take it if you want to improve your spanish speaking because it definitely helped me with my speaking skills. The workload is not bad and is interesting because they are talking about every day topics. You also learn a little bit more about Spanish culture. Make sure to get a good professor because that matters a lot. Sonia is really great, so try to get her if you can. Oh and you'll probably be taking the class with a lot of freshmen, just fyi.",
    "Definitely. This was a really fun course that improves your Spanish speaking ability while maintaining and honing your writing skills. Energy is great in class and the topics are changed fairly frequently to keep things moving and the students' interest up. Learn a solid amount of vocab."
