    "I developed a broad understanding of what International Organizations are and how they work by exploring the IR literature on the subject. I also developed a bit more of an understanding of causal inference and empirical IR research.",
    "The most important insight I gained was an appreciation of the levels at which organizational cultures can be parsed. The course readings provided levels of analysis ranging from global-geopolitical down to the individual and even psychological perspective; that minute a level of analysis is rare in the more broad discipline of political science. Bureaucratic cultures can operate in an entirely predictable way, but that fact may make the organization under control of those apparatuses seem unpredictable. The class heavily analyzed what exactly goes into an institutional statement or stance, and how valuable those statements actually are. I was most struck by the idea of informal delegation brought about by apathy; intuitively, in an organization with a lazy CEO the middle manager is king and much of the literature in this course helped me to understand how that dynamic played out in organizational and international arenas."

   "comments": [
    "I thought it was an excellent course!",
    "The readings covered an impressive variety of issue areas and explanations of organizational cultures. Each week rounded back to the fundamental tripartite analysis of cause, effect and external factor. Clarifying each papers contribution to fleshing out that basic model helped ensure that we had a clear understanding of where all these authors were situated in the literature. The Guzman reading was a bit long for the point it aimed to communicate; otherwise I had no particular complaints. The variety of readings in the course provided an interesting and robust collection of ideas to serve as a platform for my final project. Additionally, the article review papers in particular helped us get practice writing with brevity and synthesizing major points into one concise statement."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in IOs. It gives an excellent survey of the IR field and theory around how IOs matter.",
    "Yes. International institutions are an indispensable part of the education of any political science student. The subject can be presented in a very boring way. Prof. Pratt avoids this pitfall, in large part by exploring a synthesized variety of issues in the functioning of international organizations. Fundamentally a student will emerge with a better appreciation for the significance of the dispositions and actions of international organizations."
