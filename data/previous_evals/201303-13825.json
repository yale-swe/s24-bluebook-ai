    "PIA is an experience, and it will take over your life. But if changing the world is what you want to do, it's absolutely worth it. I have zero regrets, and feel changed as a person after this course. I have never been in a seminar in which every single student was so dedicated -- not about their own grade, but about actually producing good work. We met for dinners, and conducted class ourselves when Maxim was not there. As a result, the class bonded unlike anything I have ever experienced. We had a million e-mail threads going at any given time, and even sent e-mails to each other during class to strategize. Now, it's important to know a few things going into this. There is a lot of reading. Over the semester you'll get better at knowing when you actually have to do it (at the start, it's pretty much mandatory). Maxim will never follow the syllabus. Surprise assignments will pop up, and deadlines will move around. You will not know your grade at any point. You'll get really, really, really frustrated by this class. But you'll work harder than you ever thought a class would make you work, because you want to make a difference.",
    "Philanthropy in Action is a great course in understanding how philanthropy has been such an important part to the history of America and how it continues to be relevant if not more important today. The course coved a lot of information and it was one of the most rigorous courses that I have taken at Yale so far, but it taught be how to think critically. It made me challenge my views and come up with coherent arguments.",
    "This class is absolutely one of the most thrilling and valuable experiences you will have at Yale. Where else will you get the chance to meet with real life philanthropists, hang out with a veteran in the field, and donate $100,000 to charities of your choice (as a college student!)? Very rare opportunity, very rewarding experience.",
    "YES! Very interest class without too much work. Learn about how hard it is to evaluate charities and learn a bit about the historical context and modern day debate. Also, give away 50k + It was the highlight of every week, but very exhausting in a good way!",
    "Hands on experience in philanthropy. If you get into the course, definitely take it. It's a opportunity that is really incredible. It's not the most structured experience, and I didn't do much of the readings past the first month's, but I learned a lot and really enjoyed it.",
    "This is an incredible opportunity to learn about the nature of philanthropy in America, act as philanthropists and study under an incredibly talented and interesting person. Absolutely take this class if you want to be challenged, are interested in the intersection between philanthropy, government and business, and like applied learning (the class has the opportunity to give away over $50,000!). Be aware that this class requires a significant commitment due to the ability to act as philanthropists. Professor Thorne expects a lot, and can issue assignments close to the deadline, but it is well worth taking this class and gaining a mentor in Professor Thorne.",
    "A class where you always have to be ready to argue. Professor Thorne will always counter what you have to say, so be very specific with your argument and evidence. Also, you give away money to charity, so hopefully that encourages you to put a lot of effort into the class. Reading is a lot but it is not necessary at all to read everything. Not too much work, get close with classmates and have fun. absolutely take it.Only qualifier: you do learn a lot of different perspective in the class, but I have no major take aways from class.",
    "Crash course in examining the history and logistics of philanthropy. You look at how to evaluate NGOs, fundraise money on your own, allocate money to NGOs, and become a philanthropist. I would recommend the class if your interested in taking an unconventional class with an unconventional but loving professor, and don't mind a lot of independent work and broad discussion",
    "This class is nothing like any other class I have taken at Yale. You learn beyond the subject material - at times classmates will be frustrated by the \"hands off\" approach of Professor Thorne. In the end of the class though, you will realize how much you get out of this class - you learn not just about philanthropy but also about decision-making psychology. This class brings together a diverse group of students, which I also appreciated.",
    "Absolutely. No idea how he grades (I never got any of my assignments back or any real feedback on anything), but the experience is worth it.",
    "A class with a lot of potential, but poorly organized and not very well run. Take it if you want to do some interesting readings that may challenge the way you think about improving society. Don't take it unless you are ready to be very hands on."
