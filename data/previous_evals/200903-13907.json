    "I think the doctoral seminar is a great class to offer for entering doctoral students. It helped orient us and make us feel part of the F&ES community.",
    "This is a required course.",
    "Yes, I think it is a great way to be introduced to the school and fellow incoming doctoral students. I also really enjoyed the opportunity to speak directly with the speakers from our seminar series.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course very much.",
    "A combination lecture and student-presentation course, designed to give first-year doctoral students a broad introduction to current trends in environmental research, and to develop relationships with each other as intellectual resources. It was well taught and worthwhile; I'd certainly recommend it.",
    "Even if this course were not required, I would recommend it. It is great to hear and get a chance to talk with so many guest speakers, as well as to listen to other students present research proposals.",
    "The course is designed to give students perspective on the wide array of research and work that can be done by FES students. The course brings in a number of speakers for a seminar series and gives students an opportunity to converse with the speakers in a close, intimate setting. I would recommend the course because it is a great way to gain exposure to different types of environmental research and work, and it also gives students the opportunity to learn directly from professors and practictioners at all different stages in their careers.",
    "It is a very good class for the first year PhD students. It helps to build community with the fellow classmates because it is probably the only class that all the students of the same year take together. Attending to the weekly FES seminar is very useful in getting to know the academic atmosphere of the school.",
    "Summary: This is an introductory course for first-year PhD students where we attended the Wednesday lunch seminars and then had first-hand conversation with the speakers. We were given advice and direction by DDS, Dave Skelly, and were given the opportunity to share our research interests with our class and provided feedback. The best part of this class is that it doesn't require assignments that are out of the realm of our normal\/expected activities as doctoral students. For instance, our graded material consisted of submitting copies of the grants we submitted throughout the semester. I appreciate that it didn't uncomfortably force us to write our prospectuses in our first semester, but rather was a sounding board for our research ideas.I would highly recommend this course, especially with the changes that have been made since last year's class."

   "comments": [
    "The main assignment for the course was to write a review paper or a research proposal and then give a presentation about your interests and plans, to an audience outside of your field.This was pretty challenging, especially the presentation.I wrote a proposal for the EPA STAR fellowship. I was able to gain feedback based on my presentation before turning in my final draft, and this was helpful. I am still planning to more or less continue with the research plan that I had put forward in this fellowship application, so the work was very relevant to my dissertation plans.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed the course and was glad for the chance to take it.",
    "It's really helpful for my research.",
    "More than extending my knowledge of my discipline (which it did do, to some extent) the course gave me a good introduction to what's going on in other disciplines related to mine. This was exciting, and really worthwhile; I wouldn't have found the time or opportunity to develop this awareness without this opportunity. I'm sure it will contribute to my dissertation in many ways, although I'm not far enough along on this to be sure exactly what those will be yet.",
    "The course greatly expanded my knowledge of environmental work by giving a broad range of perspectives. The course contributed to my research by helping bridge gaps across disciplines and by exposing me to interesting interdisciplinary topics that could be incorporated into my own work.",
    "Attending to the seminar and the discussion sessions with invitedspeakers, were very helpful to learn from them about their own work and how scientific research is make.",
    "This course made me realize and appreciate the breadth and depth of research that is going on in FES. It also helped me familiarize myself with the school, personally and professionally.This course helped me collect my ideas for my dissertation and research."
