   "comments": [
    "The class is essentially trying to answer the questions \"how many languages are in the world?\", \"what determines a language versus a dialect?\", \"what makes languages unique\/similar?\", and \"how are languages related?\" We are given readings on these subjects and discuss them in class. Outside of class we research an endangered language and write five 2 page papers on different aspects of the language, which are compiled to form the final paper. The class, however, was not what I expected. I found the material to be inaccessible as we were never formally taught about the terminology of linguistics. Instead we had readings which were very hard to understand and class sessions which were the same. The professor was boring and I really did not feel like I got much out of the class. I would not recommend taking this class unless you have previously studied linguistics. Considering I took this first semester freshman year, I wish I had taken another class.",
    "Linguistics 008 is a course I'd recommend if you're interested in language diversity and endangerment as I am, especially if you want an introductory linguistics class that isn't overly technical. I enjoyed the first half of the semester particularly--the readings were mostly introducing linguistic concepts, and the amount of work never became overwhelming. Every week we had to submit three discussion questions based on the week's reading, and every other week we had to write a short paper describing a specific aspect of the endangered language we had chosen to research for the semester, but both the questions and the assignments were graded on completion, which was also nice. Professor Anderson can be intimidating because he likes to challenge assertions, and sometimes I found his lectures boring, but he is obviously very knowledgable about the world's languages. I liked the specific examples he gave during lectures. Overall, this wasn't the best class I took this semester, but it was on an interesting, important topic and wasn't exceedingly difficult. It was a good class.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that covers a wide variety of topics. We touched briefly on many different ideas that expand into many subject areas outside of linguistics. Some of the things we talked about related to things I learned in my economics and psychology classes which was great. I would recommend it to someone interested in cultures and languages, and it's a good introduction to linguistics without being bombarded with technicalities.",
    "It is a great way to learn about the most fun parts of linguistics (namely about all of the crazy languages out there) without first having to commit to linguistics and take the technical syntax and phonology courses.This course does even introduce you to syntax and phonology (and theories in the linguistic world) so you can sample them.This course has opened the way I think about the world, and has in some small way inspired me to be a linguist, if only at heart.",
    "LING 008 is a cool class to take if you're interested in sociolinguistics. I really enjoyed learning about the cultural aspects of linguistics and language diversity and endangerment; I also realized that I don't particularly want to be a linguistics major. If you're looking to take this course because it's a seminar and want a small forum for discussion, you should look elsewhere, because there wasn't much chance for discussion in this class.",
    "An introduction to linguistics through the study of language diversity and endangerment.I would recommend it only to someone who already knew a little bit about linguistics or who was interested in linguistics as a field, but probably not to someone who thought the class would be purely about endangered languages.",
    "The first two\/thirds ofthe class were linguistic anthropology, which I found very interesting. The other portion was more focused on linguistics - syntax, phonetics, etc. I learned a lot, and it isn't much work. Choose your endangered language carefully (if I hadn't been fluent in Spanish, the research would have been difficult). I recommend it if you are interested in linguistics or in cultures of the world.",
    "I would recommend it because the material was very interesting and Prof. Anderson is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter.",
    "This course focused around the question of how many languages there are in the world. We discussed the difficulties in counting the number of languages, how languages are born and how and why they die, and whether or not there are any universals among languages. The material is quite interesting, but the class was often quite boring. Professor Anderson is a nice man, but he talks very slowly and quietly in a monotone voice, and students often fell asleep. I can't really say I recommend this class, but I think there were others who got more out of it than I did.",
    "I went into the course not expecting it to be as technical as it was. Ultimately, part of the assumption of taking linguistics, as I learned this semester, is that one will never have a full grasp across the board of the study's application to each language. The in-class experience on a daily basis is somewhat boring because of the degree to which the subject matter becomes technical, but one does survey the many sectors of linguistics. The films we watched were veryinteresting and I thought our best classes came from discussion about our experiences with language.",
    "Excellent class that definitely targets the two aspects of the course title (both diversity and endangerment). You learn a lot about linguistics in general as well. Excellent professor too, although be prepared for some dry lectures. Overall, recommended.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students for its interesting material. I'm so glad that I learned the things about language that I did in this course. I went into this class with no prior knowledge about Linguistics, and am glad that I took it even though it was boring sometimes."
