More importantly, I gained the skill to read, understand, and think critically about scientific papers and research, which will remain with me long past the locations of the various Brodmann Areas."

    "This course was extremely interactive. I loved how open the classroom was to asking questions and engaging in topics that interested all of us.",
    "Strength: The lack of a textbook & fact that all of our readings were primary journal sources. Weakness: It occasionally felt like we were getting off topic, but by the time we made it to the final I realized we had learned an *immense* amount, even if it wasn't all originally on the syllabus."

    "The class is difficult and it's a lot of work, but it's definitely one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale. This course definitely requires you to learn and approach the material in a way you might not be comfortable with, but that was very refreshing.",
    "I would *absolutely* recommend this course to a student who is interested in neuroscience but from a more cognitive, rather than biological, perspective, or to anyone interested in language\/linguistics--it's so important to understand the processing side of the theory."
