    "Interesting class, although they were way more films than any other FILM class at Yale. And they're all well over 3 hours long.",
    "Yes! A big time commitment but totally worth it. I loved it and learned so much from the films and the class discussion. It's opened my mind to a new culture, and I am really grateful for that.",
    "Yes! It will be taught by someone else next term so it may be a completely different class. Still, definitely recommended if you want to watch Bollywood through a critical lens, including films from the 50s to the 2000s. The courseload can get heavy though, a decent amount of readings and the films are roughly 2.5 to 3 hours long.",
    "Really interesting topic! Not having seen any Bollywood films in the past it was an eye-opening experience and i really enjoyed it! Good for film and non film majors!"
