   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to someone who is interested in theory, and also to someone who is interested in American government. It was not a clear-cut political science course, and instead dealt with tricky issues of the structure of our government and why we follow it. The discussions on the judicial system were particularly enlightening.",
    "I would recommend it. The reading load is manageable, so you can actually think about what you read and talk about interesting arguments during the class. Some experience with political philosophy would be helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in what the class is covering otherwise you might be a little bored. I really enjoyed what the class covered so I was always interested in the material, but I can see someone who isn't that interested in democracy and constitutionalism being bored.",
    "Interesting class, interesting readings. More about democracy than constitutionalism, and a large focus on the role of the court as an antimajoritarian check on democracy.",
    "I would definitely recommend Democracy&Constitutionalism. It was a great seminar with a very specific yet interesting topic.",
    "Yes, it's a very interesting class and you come out feeling that you've gained a thorough understanding of the tension between democracy and constitutionalism. It's a good theoretical background for constitutional law.",
    "Definitely recommend to anyone interested in the titular topics."
