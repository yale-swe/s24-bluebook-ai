   "comments": [
    "This is a very good course to maintain or develop speaking and hearing skills. There is a lot of daily homework, so it definitely isn't easy, but your French will improve dramatically. You also learn a lot about contemporary French culture.",
    "This is a great class. There is certainly a fair amount of work on a regular basis, but the assignments are varied and interesting. No grammar, Hallelujah.",
    "FREN 160 is a fantastic class--the readings are short but interesting, the excursion into French culture is fascinating and well-rounded, and the conversations can take really interesting digressions and still be technically on-topic. It's a great way to practice speaking French in a rather low-stress setting. One caveat--class is three times a week, which means assignments for each class (reading, writing, listening, films) and that it's more time-consuming than it might seem. But I would absolutely take it again if I could, and you should too!",
    "An intensive language and cultural study; highly recommended if you plan on studying abroad in France. It is difficult - attending class is great fun, though anticipate spending 15-20 hours a week preparing written assignments and discussion topics - but also a very rewarding experience. I am pleased with the improvement in my speaking, written, and comprehension skills.",
    "Take it! Take it with Schneider if you can -- it's quite a bit of work but it'll be worth it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend that course, it improved my language skill a lot. It contains a balance of written assignments and conversation. Focus on vocabulary build up was really helpful in building up the language proficiency. I feel that over the semester my language ability improved a lot.",
    "French 160 was a very interesting course and I recommend it. My French spoken and written French improved dramatically. The reading consists of articles and textbook readings, no literature. The course was all about social issues of France: the recent elections, religion, employment, immigration, environmental issues, etc. Mme Schneider is lively and upbeat. The only weakness is that we occasionally spent too long on one point and the conversation became dull. Overall, I learned a lot in this course and am very glad to have taken it!",
    "A lot of work, but your french will definitely improve.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it really teaches a lot about France that one does not usually learn otherwise. It is a great class for expanding one's skills of the French language, but it can be a lot of work."
