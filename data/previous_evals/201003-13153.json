   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class if you like metaphysics. Winkler is a great professor and the material is super interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course only to the brave and true lovers of John Locke.",
    "Kenneth Winkler is awesome, and the subject matter was excellent.",
    "Take it. Winkler is one of the best discussion leaders I've ever had. He's responsive but on track, passionate but not overbearing, a great listener and a devoted thinker. He also has this wonderful way of making students feel like the comments they make are actually making him think about things in a new way. this is a sharp contrast to many philosophy professors, for whom the general attitude is: I've thought this all through before, and you guys might pick up on bits and pieces. Winkler has thought it all through before, but it's still fresh and vivid, and the freshness is contagious.",
    "This seminar provided a great opportunity to study two big philosophers of the early modern period, Locke and Berkeley, in depth. I would highly recommend anything taught by Professor Winkler.",
    "A great intro to early modern empiricists.",
    "This course is, as the title suggests, an in-depth look at the philosophy of Locke and Berkeley. There is a heavy emphasis on Locke - we spent, I think, 10 out of 13 weeks on Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding. The seminar discussions focus both on textual interpretation and on working out the philosophical aspects of Locke and Berkeley's arguments. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in getting to know these two philosophers very well.",
    "This was a good class. Professor Winkler is one of the most charming professors I've had, and he always makes you look forward to class. This wasn't the best philosophy class I've taken, due to a combination of my frustrations with Locke and the occasional slowness of the discussion. But the texts are worth reading and Winkler is a good teacher.",
    "Professor Winkler is one of the best teachers in the department and he really knows his Locke and his Berkeley (he edited the Cambridge Companion to Berkeley). He assigns a lot of reading (around 70 pages of primary material and 60-80 pages of secondary material every week) but it's worth it. All this reading is not only good for the soul, it's good for your philosophical thought and philosophical writing. If you're a philosophy major, you have to make sure you take a class with Professor Winkler, and if he's offering this one again it is highly worth it."
