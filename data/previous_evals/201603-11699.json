    "I reinforced a lot of what I had already learned in high school spanish. When you do innumerable, mind-numbing worksheets every day it's hard to not have anything stick.",
    "Greater knowledge of vocabulary and grammar of Spanish language.",
    "Good intermediate Spanish skills.",
    "My Spanish speaking, writing, and comprehension abilities increased dramatically. This course truly helped me with learning how to think in the language as opposed to constantly attempting to directly translate from Spanish to English in my head. The course was also a great introduction to writers and stories in the Spanish speaking world.",
    "I reviewed basic and intermediate Spanish grammar concepts. I practiced speaking, reading, and writing Spanish more effectively.",
    "Overall Spanish 130 is a good general grammar course. It is mostly a review of what is learned in Spanish 120, but with a few more details added.",
    "Reading, writing, and speaking in Spanish. Spanish grammar and lots of vocacbulary."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: we covered a lot of tenses and grammatical concepts. I also loved tambin la lluvia--I'd watch that again even outside of class. Weaknesses: many of the stories and short clips we watched were irrelevant and boring. They just seemed like senseless sources for new random vocab words (which we never go over in class and then are relentlessly tested on). Improvements: Less focus on irrelevant vocab. More practice speaking in front of the class. A clarified syllabus with only one column for homework (also put page numbers before activity numbers please). Also more interesting stories and less strange videos.",
    "Strengths: very consistent and usually interesting. Weaknesses: takes a lot of time. Sometimes inundated with busy work.",
    "Strengths: - Commitment to speak solely in Spanish in class; this forces students to actively construct their thoughts in the language as opposed to giving them the opportunity to use English primarily and Spanish secondarily - The amount of partner work - The presence of redacciones as assignments and the ability to revise them and learn from our mistakes Weaknesses: - The pruebas were difficult in a way that wasn't helpful to learning; their structure (i.e. drawing on vocabulary from memory without a word bank) was less preferable to the way the exams were designed - Sometimes the answers to the problems in the cuaderno complementario would be released late the day before the assignment was due",
    "Strengths of this course are that it is organized and logical but a weakness is that it takes a lot of time and work to actually learn the material.",
    "The course is good overall, however sometimes what you put the most work into is the least important. There is a lot of busy work and homework assignments that are supposed to give you an opportunity to practice new skills, but that fail to do this. Also, sometimes (like the in-class compositions) it seems like the focus is on what you are saying rather than building the skills to know how to say it. For the in-class compositions, I found myself struggling to come up with things to say about the picture, and struggle to incorporate all the phrases we had to use. I think this would be more helpful if assignments like these were a response to a reading or personal account so you didn't have to take as much time trying to come up with some sort of story. Also, the syllabus was extremely unclear, and sometimes the homework directions were confusing and indirect.",
    "The teacher was fantastic.The class was good for improving speaking and writing skills. Meeting every day was not as fun, and sometimes class activities were boring."

   "comments": [
    "No! Unless for some reason they are forced to take a language. Oh wait, Yale forces students to waste $2000 per credit hour on courses unrelated to almost all available majors.",
    "If they want to learn Spanish better or need to fulfill a language requirement, sure. Otherwise, why?",
    "I recommend L3, or any language course in the Spanish department, because despite the high workload and 5 days a week meeting schedule, it is still an interesting course and as someone who did not take Spanish in high school, I developed a decent level of proficiency in Spanish that I believe may be required in the modern Western world.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is designed at a level that pushes students to the next level and challenges them while not being impossibly difficult. L3 was a very valuable experience and I feel prepared to tackle L4 in the spring semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to build upon their Spanish skills and gain a better grasp on their speaking, reading, and writing skills.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this immersive Spanish class very much and feel that my Spanish has improved significantly.",
    "Yes, the class was good for reviewing Spanish grammar and improving speaking and reading skills."
