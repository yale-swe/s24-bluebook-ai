   "comments": [
    "Professor Smooke is a really fun and easy-going professor, and I often find lectures enjoyable. The TAs were very helpful and supportive through the semester. The material does get increasingly hard and so lectures will become increasingly dry, simply because we need to go through long and arduous solutions. Overall, the exams were very fair, not unreasonably easy or hard. One weakness of the class was there could be better exam preparation materials. Though it would be mentioned in classs, a list of exam topics posted on Canvas would be helpful to refer back to. Even though there is a lot to cover, if its possible to focus more on the applications of the math to model real world situations (physics, engineering), I feel I would've really enjoyed and benefited from that.",
    "This course was good at teaching differential equations, but it felt sometimes as if the applications were introduced without sufficient motivating explanations. During class the lecture would suddenly switch from theory to applications, without any warning from the professor. The homework assignments also tended to be ahead of the lectures in terms of content, so it was difficult at times to do the homework more than a few days before it was due.",
    "I feel like the introductory material and some of the Fourier series discussions could have been very insightful and helpful to my introductory Math and Physics courses, but I would have liked more context to understand what the equations were mechanically doing and more concrete applications of the equations, which -- especially toward the end of the semester -- felt rather arbitrary or disconnected. Much of the homework was either plug-and-chug or required extensive internet searches in order to understand how the theory applied.",
    "Strengths: Smooke explains things decently, and he's a big chiller. You get the stuff you need to know in your other classes about ODEs and PDEs pretty painlessly, and the four tests \/ no final structure was nice. Weaknesses: Fell asleep more times than I can count in the class. I also definitely learned a ton from the textbook instead of lecture.",
    "Weaknesses- Content was too all encompassing, felt like there was too much material to cover adequately. Save for the beginning of the class, most of the semester we were only taught the very bare minimum surface layer of concepts. This was fine in terms of grading because the tests were extremely simple (one had an average of a low 90). There was only half a day dedicated to an intro of linear algebra concepts before we were taught how to use linear algebra to solve diff eq. The class should cut down in content and instead focus more on depth.",
    "Professor Smooke is great - he's a really engaging lecturer and makes sure to tie everything we're doing to examples that are relevant and interesting to the students - so for the vast majority of us, physics and engineering. It was really helpful to see where the concepts we had were applicable. As someone who really dislikes math courses, Professor Smooke made it bearable and even enjoyable at times - this is probably the best experience I've had in a math course at Yale. He gives us fun facts about mathematicians in class and then puts them on exams as extra credit problems, which makes cramming for the exams a little more enjoyable.",
    "it was overall fine",
    "Strengths - this is a super fair class when it is taught by Smooke - homework is very doable and the tests strongly resemble the content on the homework Weaknesses - if you needed help, office hours were at weird\/inconvenient times",
    "Overall a very strong course in general with no weaknesses",
    "Very well structured and well taught. The one recommendation I would have is to make sure that the homework corresponds to the classes that had been taught and not future classes.",
    "Strengths - good textbook, good TFs Weaknesses - terrible classroom for lecture; constant rescheduling of assignments",
    "I wish there were lecture notes or that the professor posted his notes after class in case I missed something or could not read the board. I used the lecture notes from Professor Bennett who taught the course the previous year from a classmate. They helped soooo much! Also, read the textbook it honestly helps.",
    "I think that we covered a lot of material in this course over a short period of time, and I like the idea of having four midterms instead of a final. This made the course way less stressful.",
    "I thought that it was taught well, and I think that the homework was long but helpful to learn the material.",
    "If you're taking it you probably have to. If you don't have to do not have to don't even think about taking it.",
    "I enjoyed this class! The pacing of the class was good; we learned a fair amount each week without feeling too overwhelmed with new material. The psets were sometimes very time consuming, but necessary in order to learn.",
    "Posting a summary of what is going to be tested on would be really helpful along with more use of canvas to post dates of exams would be helpful. Otherwise the course was really well run",
    "I enjoyed this class! It was not the best taught math course Ive had, but it is probably the best math class Ive taken at Yale. Some issues I had with the class is the professor did not consistently and clearly write in an announcement, email, or on the syllabus which sections would be on exams - which caused some issues. Additionally, I did not feel like there were enough office hours and the office hours that were provided were really short and didnt leave enough room to ask a lot of questions.",
    "Strengths: the class was taught in a lectue hall with nice desks Weaknesses: boring, poorly taught, no sense of how any of the material related to the rest of the class, the rest of math, or any potential applications whatsoever",
    "Best part of this class is that exams arent accumulative. Four exams, no final. Great layout. Exams are all fair. Material is difficult but not impossible with studying. Smooke is great and funny. A bit better organization of topics would help. Kinda just is jumps right into things without us knowing whats going on.",
    "Strength: Great engaging prof Weakness: Fast paced",
    "Smooke is the best. Take classes with him. His lectures are clear and easy to follow. The homework follows directly from the lectures. The exam questions come directly from the lecture and homework. No surprises.",
    "The professor and TAs were very clear with the material.",
    "Strengths: homework helped me stay on top of material and i like how many of the problems were connected to physics problems. Weakness: I felt it was easy to get lost in lecture simply because prof smooke spoke a very fast. Sometimes I felt like he didnt cover all the material needed to do some of the homework so I had to rely on the books explanations very extensively.",
    "I thought this course was great. The psets were a little lengthy but by the end of them you really knew what you were doing. The classes were slow enough to follow in their entirety and the testing scheme was fair and conducive to high grades.",
    "Strength: The Professor. Mitchell Smooke is a legend and this course proved it: he is charismatic, knowledgeable, and really attentive to students. Weakness: There was not much interaction between TAs and students. I honestly did not know that we have peer tutors until the last week.",
    "The course meets on a few Fridays early on in the semester in order to be done with the class before the end of reading period, allowing you to get the course over with and focus on other classes during finals period. Its a bit annoying at first when meeting at the beginning of the semester but its totally worth it. One weakness is the lack of board space in ML 211; some problems are really long and it could help to use a different classroom with larger boards.",
    "Great professor, he goes a bit fast so it helps to take thorough notes and go back to fully understand them later. Gets through all the material though. The material is relatively interesting and in my opinion this was way better than math 120. TAs were always available accommodating and super helpful, as was professor. Tells funny stories as well Weaknesseswouldve liked a bit more application or a bit more context for when and why these types of equations are used. Class was mostly about methods of solving them",
    "Strengths: material is taught clearly, exams are broken into manageable chunks Weaknesses: not a lot of opportunity to engage with material outside of class (ie office hours, other resources)",
    "Well structured, could have used a little more coverage of linear algebra in the material especially considering its relevance to differential equations",
    "The homeworks are actually very helpful. Although they are long, that ends up being good for reviewing and learning the material. The lectures are straight out of the textbook, which makes them feel not very important.",
    "Strengths: it teaches you what you need to know I guess. Weaknesses: pretty much everything else.",
    "The strength was Prof. Smooke who was very kind and entertaining. One weakness was that lectures were often difficult to follow",
    "I thought the lectures could be hard to follow at times.",
    "This class is the most \"lecturey\" lecture I've had at Yale, which had its pros and cons. The class moved at a very consistent pace, which meant I always knew what to expect each class, more or less. There were also lots of asides to talk about the mathematicians who discovered the topics we were learning about. However, I feel like a bit more of a varied class structure would keep things fresh. He occasionally did some experiments in class that were related to the topics we were learning, and those often helped clarify why the stuff we were learning mattered, and it broke the monotony of 75 minute long lectures.",
    "The course was taught very well, though I would have liked to have worked through more examples. Also, I wish that the tested material would have been more clear.",
    "Good, important content but the professor wrote illegibly and didnt do a good job explaining. Followed the textbook almost word for word. TAs were great",
    "Could be improved by putting the class notes online",
    "Very straightforward, follows the textbook almost to the letter so very easy to keep up with what's happening, exams are fair and extremely easy. Mitch Smooke is great. Overall, great course where you get exactly what you expect.",
    "Strengths: Homework was designed to ingrain understanding through repetition Multiple non-cumulative exams split the workload into manageable chunks and prevented the content from snowballing if we got behind Gave some historical background on the mathematicians who invented the tools we were learning Weaknesses: The room was a problem for me. I couldn't see the board, even with my glasses, and eventually gave up and decided to rely on the textbook."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think it is a good option if you need to take Differential Equations at Yale.",
    "Definitely! If you care about actually learning how to solve differential equations, this course will teach you that. Some of the applications covered in the course may not be relevant to everyone, but they serve as useful examples to practice the more abstract solving techniques.",
    "Sure, if you're interested in a subject that uses differential equations in some way. It's not that interesting a topic on its own, but super important in other things.",
    "No, I would suggest taking the ODE only course, even if you are an engineering major. My suitemate took the regular ODE course and came away with a stronger understanding of the fundamental concepts of diff eq.",
    "If you have to take differential equations for a major (I took it for physics) then take it with Smooke if you can - he really makes it bearable. I personally would not have taken it if I was not into physics, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't.",
    "Yeha why not, especially with Professor Smooke. He is a decent professor and the class is organized pretty well (there are no finals just 4 midterms).",
    "I would recommend this course! I thought it was really well-taught with a surprising amount of real-world applications for a math class (for reference, I feel other ENAS classes dont have the same level of real-world applications as this class). Its a pretty fair QR class. Professor Smooke was a really good instructor, and really did a good job of making lecture engaging and not exclusively pure math derivations.",
    "I would most certainly recommend this course to other students. It is very helpful in understanding important physics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and electronics equations and theories.",
    "If you have to take a class in differential equation, I don't see why you would want to take any of the other classes offered.",
    "Yes! Take! It isn't bad if you do the work and you learn a lot.",
    "no",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although differential equations may have no direct implications in your study if you are not majoring in a STEM field, I feel that the course is the best math course I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to STEM students due to the vast applications of differential equations.",
    "Only if you have to?",
    "I would recommend this course for stem majors. I learned a lot.",
    "Anyone doing anything with STEM should definitely take this course. It's incredibly interesting and makes understanding so many processes much easier",
    "absolutely not. I mean, nobody takes a math class for fun, so idk why my recommendation makes a difference. but if you don't have to take this, please don't. for your own sake.",
    "Only if you need this class",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was a good survey course in ordinary differential equations.",
    "You will need the class if you are an engineering major. Although the class does get through the material, I think it could be better taught. For the most part, I self-studied for this class and paid little attention in class. You will notice that half the class is missing until exam day, in which way more people show up. My advice would be to just self-study since the earlier lessons arent hard to comprehend. Sometimes the professor will assign psets on lessons that wasnt covered in class and will proceed to teach the lesson after psets are due. It would beneficial if you learned the lesson beforehand to understand the material as I was often lost in class and the professor often goes off topic. The one good thing is that there are extra credit on the exams but the questions are often based on the off topic things discussed in class. To make the best of the class, I would learn the lesson before and come to class to see what other examples there are.",
    "Yes! But especially if it's taught by Mitch Smooke. He is the best. I learned a lot in this class and felt like by learning exactly what was given to us you could do super well on exams. Smooke is just a total joy.",
    "Yes, without reservations, and especially with Professor Smooke.",
    "Yes. If you understand the psets, you will do fine in the class since the exams are just applying what you practice in the homework.",
    "Youre probably taking this course because its in your major. If Mitchell Smooke is teaching it, take it. Sometimes homework assignments are long but his lectures are really easy to follow and his exams are not unnecessarily difficult.",
    "Yes. Smoke is awesome",
    "Yes, I honestly enjoyed it even though it was required. But professor Smooke also greatly contributed to the success of the course. Take it with him if possible !!",
    "Yes, it is a manageable and fulfilling math class",
    "With Prof Smooke, yes. Good to learn the various different techniques of diff eqs. Much more oriented toward engineering \/ applied math majors, don't bother if you're a pure math person and want to do proofs",
    "I'm not sure what the MATH version of differential equations is, but this one seems alright for learning generally what its about. It is mostly ODEs, we only spend about two weeks on PDEs so its not a very thorough look into that. The class is mostly just memorizing the formulas (they were given on the test but memorization was necessary for correct application). For a more thorough explanation of why certain solutions applied to given problems, I'd guess the math course is better, but for just learning how to solve different types of ODEs this was a good class.",
    "It's a standard differential equations courses... except extremely disorganized. How grading works is not clarified at the beginning of the semester, and the 4 (four) exams were very disparate in terms of difficulty. The last exam is also right in the middle of reading period, so if you have other classes that tell you in advance that you have work during reading period... it might be a bad time. Assignments are also very disorganized - he assignments are often not uploaded on time, with incorrect questions the assignment. If this happens, you may not know the questions on the assignment were incorrect, until the morning that they're due.",
    "Yes, it is probably a required course but regardless I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, Professor Smooke is a legend",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, it was certainly a very comprehensive course. We covered a ton of material, more than the average Yale class in my opinion, but it never felt too rushed.",
    "Yes, Professor Smooke is easy to follow, and teaches in a clear manner. The assessments are fair and overall it's a useful and well taught class.",
    "Yes. The material's not going to blow your mind, it's a standard intro class, but it's great with Mitch Smooke. Very straightforward and honestly quite easy. Just follow along with the textbook and you'll be fine. Weekly psets that are fair and mostly just a lot of plug and chug. 4 exams throughout the semester that aren't cumulative, which is great.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless required by your major.",
    "Yes, I would. It covered both ordinary and partial differential equations in one course without getting bogged down in theory or proofs. It was very useful and taught the skill in easily digestible chunks."
