    "Absolutely. It is fun, engaging, and inspiring learning how to machine yourself. At one point we made a screw and you learn just how much work goes in to making a screw by yourself with these machines (obviously not how it is done on the large scale). Essentially, you gain appreciation for how things are made.",
    "Yes. Very useful training and skills. Interesting class.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Absolutely take this course if you are at all interested. I was worried that I wouldn't have the time (I was taking 4.5 other credits and am very involved extra curricularly). In the end, since the course didn't have any homework or tests, it was very manageable.",
    "Yes. Best hands on course ever.",
    "This course is zero credits, but it's a lot of fun. You go to Wright lab for three hours a week to mess around with huge machines and hunks of metal, and you learn how to bend them to your will and make high-precision cuts. By the end of the semester, you will have created your own tiny steam engine, which you can and should show off to all your friends until they become sick of your bragging. Oh, and also Dave gives you cookies. What more could you want? Most of the people in this class will be grad students (and most of them are in the chem department), but undergrads regularly take it as well.",
    "Yes, especially if you can see a future in anything machining. The class will give you the tools to be a machining pro and David is very nice and helpful."
