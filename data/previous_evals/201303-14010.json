   "comments": [
    "This was Prof. Alam's first year teaching it, so I think she still needs some time to get her bearings, but overall it's a pretty solid survey course. The readings are very doable, and I thought the Gandhi reading was particularly enjoyable. That being said, class does get a bit boring at times. Consists of 2 reviews (each 10%), participation (10%), a midterm (30%), and a final take-home-style paper (40%). My biggest criticism would be that for all the assignments, you get a grade and not much feedback.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who likes History",
    "I took this class because I needed another ROW; plain and simple. I think that the class was interesting, but I wish that there had been another one that I could have taken. I probably would've enjoyed it a lot more.",
    "This is a great course if you want an overview of South Asian history since the Mughal Empire. It covers all the major topics, and is interesting.",
    "It's not a good class. Dull.",
    "A great introduction to South Asia today. Not too heavy on work, but papers relatively difficult to gauge in terms of what she is looking for. Class discussion can be slow sometimes.",
    "A really good class - I learned so much! All of the readings are the right length and the right mix of commentary and the writing of great Indian thinkers. I thought the lectures were interesting too; because the class was small, Professor Alam could ask us questions and engage us as students more."
