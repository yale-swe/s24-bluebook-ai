   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course extensively covers Ancient Greek and Roman medical knowledge, the foundation upon which it was built, and societal background that surrounding the medical practices. It also delves slightly into Egyptian and Mesopotamian medicine, but ancient medical traditions from any other part of the world are only discussed if students decide to make a final presentation on a topic outside of our curriculum.",
    "Ancient Medicine and Disease was a phenomenal introduction to the history of medicine as it taught students to connect more specific, medical trends to broader societal trends. This course taught me how to close read ancient texts as well as how to express ideas concisely, as one page comparison papers were used to gage learning throughout the semester. Besides learning about ancient medicine, this course connects modern ideas to the historical ideas discussed in class; for example, after reading about the ancient usage of spells and chants to heal, we read an article on the modern implications and uses of the placebo effect.",
    "You gain a wide-ranging view of ancient medicinal practices in Egypt, Greece, and Italy. Overall, as a science major, the class was somewhat interesting, but a lot of the reading felt like busy work. However, Professor Lamont is one of the smartest and kindest people there is at Yale, and you all definitely learn something new in her class.",
    "I learned how different factors influenced medicine in antiquity such as gender and how different medical theories developed and were practiced in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. Skills I developed were being able to read, understand, analyze the various medical treaties and texts, as well being able to synthesize the arguments of different articles in the response papers.",
    "I learned a lot about how knowledge was transferred in ancient civilizations regarding medicine. Throughout the whole class, I also had to learn critical reading skills in the humanities by reading primary texts and secondary sources.",
    "- developed skills in analyzing primary source materials - learned how to write a history paper",
    "I garnered a great understanding of classical medicine.",
    "I learned about ideas about health and medicine in primarily ancient Greece, but also Mesopotamia and Egypt. I gained skills about critically thinking about ancient texts and about societal implications of the customs.",
    "- concise writing (two one-page papers required succinct writing when responding to long academic articles), it was frustrating in the beginning because it felt like time was not productive spent, but it is definitely good practice for writing in general - survey of wide range of topics related to ancient medicine (facilitated by the design of the course syllabus and especially by the student presentations that covered a very wide array of topics)",
    "I learned a lot about the origins of our current medical knowledge and about the viewpoints and ideas about health and disease in the ancient world. This course gave me a new perspective about our current knowledge, for what we consider correct today may be completely obsolete tomorrow.",
    "I learned how to parse through primary and secondary sources documents with great detail and how to pick up on the little things. Before taking this class, I struggled with writing and organizing my ideas succinctly so the 1-page assignment was incredibly helpful for that. It was really interesting to learn more about the Classics and its cross-section with medicine and scientific thought. I feel so much more knowledgable about the healthcare system and the inherent biases within that system that stem from antiquity.",
    "I definitely think I learned to read and synthesize primary sources as well as present my thoughts more eloquently.",
    "This class was very insightful and Professor Lamont was very helpful in allowing me to develop skills necessary for analyzing primary sources and historical readings. I learned about the fundamentals of medicine and their origins in ancient medicine. I also learned much about the tradition behind the profession of medicine.",
    "I learned not only about the history and origins of western medicine, but also how it influenced modern medicine today. Additionally, I learned how to write one page response papers, present a research project on a topic of my choice, and write a research paper on the research project.",
    "I learned how to analyze Hippocratic texts and scholarly articles about them. I gained an understanding of the ancient world, especially ancient Greece, and was able to trace this cultural influence to the present day.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze scholarly articles and also learned how to dissect primary sources. This course helped me understand how to read difficult texts and find common themes throughout multiple articles and pieces.",
    "I developed skills in analyzing primary sources from Ancient Greece to draw out themes and connect them to secondary sources. I also learned just how influential these ancient texts were in developing elements in our society and medicine today, such as the existence of gynecology and the evolution of the Hippocratic Oath over time.",
    "This course enhances my critical thinking and deep reading of texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: engaging in-class discussion, manageable workload, interesting readings from the past and present; wide array of topics covered by the end of the semester Weakness: when I took the course, the class was a little large making full class discussions a little bit more difficult, but this is very minor",
    "The strength is the amount of topics that we covered in the class. While some topics were definitely more interesting than others, most weeks had stimulating discussions. The weakness is the amount of reading and the lack of discussion about many of the readings in class.",
    "A strength of this course is that it is well-structured and organized. The first class gave an overview of everything we were going to discuss and it was amazing to see how well-connected everything we learned was. The readings were interesting sometimes repetitive, but I found it helpful in remembering and being able to apply the overarching themes we were supposed to take away from the readings and Professor Lamont does an incredible job of breaking down the readings, discussing them, and giving historical\/geographical\/etc context. The only weakness of this course was that for me I feel like the title of the course gives off the feeling of a more wide variety of ancient medical practice would be looked at but we mostly focused on Ancient Greece (probably because of the lack of preserved extensive treatises in other ancient civilizations like with Hippocratic medicine). I found though that I got to learn about other societies through the student presentations, which were really fun.",
    "There is a lot of repetitive reading in my opinion but you really get to choose what you want to focus your attention on in this class. The subject of your essays and how you decide to interpret primary sources.",
    "- assignments allowed students to pursue their own interests in relation to the course material - course readings were really interesting - made good use of Yale's resources - Cushing Library, etc. - course felt more like a lecture class than a seminar because there weren't many opportunities for student discussion - seminar was a little big so it also took away from the experience since some people had to sit at the back of the classroom and not at the main discussion table",
    "I loved the course, but I felt that we could evaluated other ancient perspectives on medicine, perhaps some more incorporation of Oriental analyses.",
    "The course is well taught and includes a variety of readings including both primary and secondary sources. The course did not seem to function as a seminar, but rather as a lecture. Some readings were redundant and not very applicable to the class's focus. It could also be improved by looking at ancient medicine and disease in the Eastern world.",
    "Strength: - very self-driven, you can make what you want out of this course (in terms of what topics to focus on, but also in times of how much time and effort you would like to put into the course) - wide range of topics (though the syllabus might focus on Graeco-Roman medicine, there are always opportunities to make connections to the present and other ancient societies) - clear expectations (the syllabus makes very clear what readings are covered, what assignments are expected by when, etc) (really designed to help you succeed in the class: before writing a research paper, there is a presentation before the class after which you can receive feedback to get a better understanding of how to write the paper -- the syllabus breaks seemingly daunting tasks into smaller portions) Weakness: - engagement: it might be frustrating at times if not the entire class is engaged with the content\/has completed the reading; partly it was the set up of the classroom this year where people on the inner table was more likely to engage in conversation than people sitting behind in individual chairs - there is definitely the opportunity to explore a topic in depth, but given the nature of this course, it will mostly be a broad survey",
    "The strengths are that the readings are very interesting and engaging. Moreover, Professor Lamonts passion for sharing her knowledge about this topic is another high point of the course. A way in which the course may be improved and student engagement may be enhanced is by mixing readings with another kind of learning instrument such as videos, guest lectures, field trips, etc. I believe videos and presentations would be the most useful in helping cement what we learn in the readings (that sometimes are very dense)",
    "The class structure is very clearly laid out and easy to understand. A standard workload is readings for every class and an in-class discussion about those readings. There are two 1-page papers, a final exam, a 10-15 minute presentation, and a final essay. The professor is amazing at fostering discussion and grades very fairly. The only thing that could be improved is maybe the inclusion of more in-class text analysis to break up the repetitive structure sometimes.",
    "The professor is amazing! You truly feel like she cares about both students and the subject matter. However, it is structured somewhat more like a lecture than a seminar.",
    "The strengths of the course lie in its emphasis on discussion during class. Class is very engaging since it is a discussion between us students and Professor Lamont. One weakness could be the diversity in readings. Although much was covered, I believe most time was spent on the Hippocratic Corpus; however, it would have been interesting to explore other cultures or other aspects of Greek or Roman medicine and culture.",
    "Some strengths were that the discussions on the assigned readings were very thorough and because some of the readings were difficult to understand at times, the instructor always made sure that the class understood the main topics to analyze from the readings. I think incorporating more recent articles to connect it to the historical contexts and issues would be helpful and productive.",
    "Strengths: The material is fascinating, and Professor Lamont is great. It's not too much work, and the material is framed in a way that makes difficult texts accessible and relevant to the world today. You could tell that every reading was selected carefully to fit within the broader themes of that week in an interesting way. Weaknesses: Because the class is taught as a lecture, it definitely doesn't feel like as much of a classroom community as I was hoping from a first-year seminar. We often started interesting conversations about vaccines or other health debates today in the last few minutes of class, so everybody was anxious at that point to make it to their next class on time. I would've loved having more class time spent on discussions connecting the themes to the present day. The readings were sometimes unevenly assigned, so we often had much more reading to do from Monday to Wednesday than from Wednesday to the following Monday.",
    "The readings were sometimes really repetitive and a little excessive at times.",
    "I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course! I felt the readings prepared students for class and the discussion really helped our understanding of the articles and primary sources. Since class was predominantly discussion-based, it was great that the questions that we had while reading could be answered and we could talk about not only our opinions but also how these important related to society as it exists today.",
    "It could be improved by having a couple more discussions that arent solely based on the homework readings."

   "comments": [
    "If you have any desire to take this course, you should absolutely take it! Professor Lamont is incredibly kind and has true concern for the wellbeing of her students. Her empathy results in a well-curated course with really meaningful readings that deepen one's understanding on a broad array of ancient and modern topics. The class also explores relevant themes, specifically exploring the development of racist and misogynist thought in antiquity and to the present.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who is interested in science and history for sure. If you are thinking about majoring only in science, and dont have a strong interest in the history of medicine, then I would definitely not recommend this to you.",
    "I would recommend! You learn a lot about ancient medicine which could be interesting for someone who is pre-med to get a view of a different, more holistic approach to medicine and healing that in many ways can still be relevant (ex. Dietetics).",
    "If you are really into humanities, I would recommend taking the class. However, if you dislike big readings and are here to try and learn medical vocabulary, this is not the course for you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any other student interested in the classics or medicine, especially pre-med students. I think that this course provides valuable historical context to many problems and healthcare disparities today and provides a well-rounded history for anyone who wants to go into a healthcare profession.",
    "I would.",
    "Yes: - most of the class is interested in pursuing careers related to medicine, it is extremely gratifying to know students who are passionate about the humanities and understanding origins of healthcare practices - there is a lot of flexibility in directing your own learning - syllabus clearly thought out and communication of expectations always clear - professor extremely approachable and definitely adds to the learning experience",
    "I would definitely recommend it to those students interested in learning about the practices and ways of thinking of the ancient world and to those interested in understanding the origins of our medical knowledge",
    "I HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone who likes history, medicine, anatomy, and maybe even philosophy. The professor is amazing and attentive. This is is by far the best class I've taken this semester. For one class, we discussed the theories surrounding diet in Ancient Greece so we had breakfast at a hotel and another day we visited the medical library. The readings can sometimes get long but the workload is definitely manageable and worth it. I have for sure talked to so many people at the amazing discussions we've had in this class.",
    "Yes, this is definitely a great way to get a humanities credit as a STEM or social sciences major! You will also find yourself learning very interesting material you had never thought about before.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student since this course teaches many valuable skills, such as being able to analyze primary source readings and being able to write a research paper.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to any student, particularly those who are pre-med or interested in public health. I learned so much from this class, and I'm still interested in pursuing medicine and now interested in public health as well. Professor Lamont is an amazing instructor who cares about her students and her students' success in the course.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the history of medicine and medical thought and\/or the ancient world. Just a heads up - I wouldn't recommend this class if you get squeamish reading about descriptions of surgery, injuries, bodily fluids, etc. There were definitely a few readings that were a little graphic for my taste!",
    "I think that this is a good course for someone who is interested in history and who like discussion based classes.",
    "Absolutely! This course was by far my favorite class of the semester. Being able to start off college in a small classroom setting with a professor who genuinely cares about each and every student really helped my transition to college. I feel that this course not only taught me how to be a college student (how to write concise essays and analyze ancient texts), but also taught me how to be a student in the classroom and truly engage with the thoughts of others and understand others' perspectives, especially in the final projects of the semester, which many students chose to write about what medicine looked like in their cultures. I highly, highly, highly recommend this class to anyone who might be interested in medicine, archaeology, public health, or ancient civilizations, it was by far my favorite of the semester!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The course material is very interesting and professor Lamont is great."
