   "comments": [
    "This was a class that failed to capture my attention, that is not to say, however, that the works did not either. I am glad to have read what I thought was a well selected collection of ethical readings, but the lectures were hard to sit through and I feel that I don't understand a lot of the works or insights shared in class. This was an uninspiring introduction to philosophy, but one I am grateful to have taken.",
    "Lecture is somewhat dry; the content is mildly interesting. Take it if you have to, but if you don't, don't bother.",
    "An introduction to a handful of thinkers on morality, but by no means an exhaustive review of philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's not bad as prereqs go. The workload is light- three 2,000 word essays- and Harries puts full transcripts of his lectures on classes v2 so you don't necessarily have to attend class to follow along.",
    "I would recommend it but understand that your experience will depend on your TA and how they interpret the course. Interesting but hard course in terms of papers not in discussion.",
    "Not really suited for those who are not philosophy majors, or who do not already have a background or interest in this area of philosophy.",
    "I definitely recommend this course if you are interested in philosophy! This was my first philosophy class ever. The syllabus was great and Professor Harries' lectures were helpful to understanding the books we read while leaving room for us to think critically on our own. I found the papers very challenging and would have liked more guidance on that, but I still really enjoyed writing them.",
    "I took this class per recommendation of a friend, but I hope no one else is forced to sit through this class. While it wasn't too demanding, I felt like I wasted a class this semester when I could have taken something much more intriguing.",
    "It was a good overview of a lot of philosophers. Writing the essays was hard but other than that not a ton of work.",
    "If you are looking for an introductory philosophy course, this may not be the best one to take at first. I felt as if a lot of the information, and many of the papers, were esoteric and would only be interesting to advanced students concerned with the nuances of philosophy. Also, Professor Harries includes quite about aesthetics, which I actually quite liked, but it is something to consider when taking the course. The three papers are not too difficult to \"pump out,\" but aren't particularly intellectually rewarding either. I found myself, quite often, doing them just to get them done.",
    "Take the course if you want a simple introduction. Nice to take credit\/d.",
    "A survey course covering a few major thinkers. Good readings and thought-provoking lectures, but very unstructured overall. Professor Harries is clearly a brilliant thinker, and he dares to go outside of the mainstream, mind-numbing intellectual backwater that is the philosophy department at Yale under its utilitarian leadership. His lectures were always interesting, and he was available to meet separately with students throughout the semester. As a suggestion, his lectures would improve further if he spent less time summarizing readings and challenged students' creativethinking more. Take it only if you have to - there is much to learn from Harries, but this format isn't the way to do it.",
    "Good introduction to Philosophy.",
    "A great introduction to the biggest names in philosophy, without much work at all. The three papers had interesting prompts, and the lectures were thought-provoking as well. I would recommend this class for people interested in philosophy, thinking about applying to EP&E, or looking for a 5th credit.",
    "If interested in beginning to study Philosophy, take it.",
    "Great course that goes through a variety of subjects. Excellent to take for any educational or professional path.",
    "Enjoyed the class, reasonable amount of work.",
    "An introduction to western philosophical thought. Pretty standard.",
    "Phil 175 is a basic introduction to ethical thought.",
    "this 'intro' course is not intended to spur enthusiasm for ethics\/philosophy...the lectures are terribly dry and boring...only later on, once i started reading lecture notes, did i realize that harries' ideas and his connecting of various ethical themes were brilliant. i loved reading lecture notes, and its great they were posted, but listening to him speak was not worth the hour.don't take if youre trying to get intrigued by philosophy. take it if you have a specific motivation to be taking it.",
    "Karsten Harries is clearly brilliant and very, very articulate. From previous shopping and conversations, I believe that Prof. Harries makes the content\/course much more enjoyable, and far less stressful, than other professors have. A HUGE plus was the fact that all lectures were distributed as PDFs - while it did disincentivize regular attendance, it also made the material and points made in lecture much more absorbable. As a future recommendation, students would have been more engaged if during the lectures, more interjections\/digressions had occurred during the reading of pre-prepared notes. Overall, the authors\/readings were well-selected and the course was cohesive. The three papers were very manageable, and the topics enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely. Excellent source texts. Thought provoking lectures. Appropriately challenging philosophical subject matter and essay topics, though accessible even to someone with little experience in philosophy.",
    "Philosophy 175 is a good introduction into ancient and modern philosophical thought and the big ideas that transcend history. I would recommend this course.",
    "Very good basis for ethics and western philosophy in general.",
    "A sold intro to the foundational theories of ethics. The workload consists of a decent amount of reading and three essays, so is extremely doable and allows you to delve into the philosophers' texts deeply.",
    "Yes, great intellectual \"Yale\" class. The class is not much \"work\" from week to week. However, when the essays come, you can expect to do many hours of editing. Drafting your arugment (premises and logic) takes the most time. Once you have a solid outline of the argument, the essay comes easily.Take this class if you want to challenge your critical thinking. However, most likely credit D the class if you take it with Shelly (I took it with Karsten Harries) - a shame that he scares people away from this course and philosophy.",
    "General overview course, nothing special. Take Harries' other classes, they're much better",
    "Go for it, especially with Professor Harries. But try to take it when you're a freshman or a sophomore.",
    "Based on what I've heard, I would absolutely take this class with Harries instead of Kagan. It seems as though Harries approaches it much more like the introductory course that it is, and he's a great lecturer.",
    "Yes I would recommend PHIL 175. In essence, the class is a very fundamental overview of the philosophical canon; if you want to study ethics in any capacity, you should read these specific authors. While Professor Harries' lectures are almost irrelevant to the coursework itself, he is a great speaker and lecturer, and I enjoyed the time I did spend in lectures. The work itself consists of only 3 papers, and I personally enjoy writing papers more than anything else, so if you are in the same boat, the class can be both engaging and manageable.",
    "Interesting overview of some basic moral theorists",
    "YESSSSS!!!! This is why you came to Yale!",
    "I would say that this is a good crash-course in philosophy, and to take it if your high school (like mine) did not have a course of the like, but that if you had already taken a philosophy course, then maybe avoid it."
