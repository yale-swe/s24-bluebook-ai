   "comments": [
    "I think this course really helps make the first semester in the program a smooth transition. To have my third class be less high pressure and less reading, really helped me get used to the feel of graduate school (especially as someone coming in from undergrad with not other graduate school experience) and the AMST community. This feeling of a cohesive community really came through for me in getting to know some of the professors (the best parts were getting to know better the professors I was taking courses with and learning about professors I might be interested in working with in the future). Additionally, I loved that it was an opportunity for our whole cohort to be in the same place once a week interacting and thinking with one another. I think we're a really close group and Mary was able to help foster that sense of community, non-competitiveness, and support.Overall, while the content of the course wasn't the most stimulating for me, I think it is a great required, introductory course for first years in the program. I would definitely suggest it to other students, although I think it works best as a required course.",
    "Yes, I think it builds an important sense of community within the cohort, who are people we will be working with for years on end. As it is required, there's also not much of a choice.",
    "American Scholars is an opportunity to familiarize yourself with not only your fellow cohort but with the department faculty as well. It's your chance to ask professors those burning questions you have about research or any other questions you may have regarding graduate school. I would definitely recommend American Scholars (even though it is mandatory) to those who want a better sense of the field.",
    "Good basic class.",
    "American Scholars is an introductory course designed to acquaint first-years with American Studies as a field, as well as introduce them to the faculty and program at Yale. I would highly recommend this course (it's also required) for first years."

   "comments": [
    "The course provided a description of the types of work that can be done in American Studies at Yale. In the future, it might be helpful to have professors discuss some of the major trends and questions in the field more generally in addition to their own professional biographies.",
    "This course provided an excellent introduction to American Studies, as well as a good opportunity to get to know students and faculty in the department. I appreciated learning about the trends and debates that have shaped American Studies in the past and continue to do so today. The research proposal was a helpful way to sharpen my ideas about future research. A great way to start the year!",
    "American Scholars' greatest strength was its introduction to American Studies as it exists here at Yale. In that sense, it did deepen my knowledge of the discipline.",
    "I think one of the funnest and most valuable discussions throughout the course was, What is American Studies? The fact that we could not come up with a single all-encompassing answer is both scary and exciting. I think the point of thinking about this question was not to come up with a \"right\" answer but to build a sense of community through exploring all of the possible subjects and methodologies that are explored in the field. Although it often caused some anxiety for me, exploring questions of methodology and discipline in the course (and outside of it) helped me expand my view of American Studies as a field, what areas I'm interested in exploring, and see where I might fit in. For me, this personal introspection was one of the best things about my first semester in the AMST program and I feel the course helped me think in a productive ways.I would say the course did not necessarily contribute to my \"dissertation\/research\" except for helping me realize that the project I had come here with was not one that I want to pursue on such a large scale. However, I don't think I would have come to that conclusion without doing the research proposal component of the course and in that sense the course helped me a lot in thinking about what kind of questions I want to ask, what the larger significance to the topics I'm interested are, and the methodologies I want to employ.",
    "This class, as stated before, was useful in getting to understand more about the discipline. As I mentioned, I wish we could go through some of the readings for the discipline, but I look forward to doing so this winter break. This class contributed to my research in having frank conversations about ethnography with a large community. Additionally, the proposal forced us all to work on a small chunk of our research, which I deeply appreciated. I hope this will develop into a chapter of my research.",
    "American Scholars taught me how open-ended (yet not infinitely so!) American Studies as a field can be. Each professor brought with him or her a special insight about the field. Discussion both during and after the professor's visit was helpful in fleshing out the questions one had about the reading material or any other topic at hand. The research proposal assignment was extremely helpful in helping me think ahead to my dissertation, as it forced me to consider my fundamental interests without the pressure of aligning the proposal with a certain topic or theme, as is the case with any other seminar.",
    "It deepened my knowledge by allowing me to interact with professors in a fairly wide range of subfields within American Studies. The prospectus exercise was useful in contributing to my dissertation\/research, especially since I plan to use it.",
    "Yes, it exposed me to a range of disciplinary fields that I was not previously acquainted with. It also gave me new ways to think about how I might tackle my dissertation research. The library study skills were also immediately applicable."
