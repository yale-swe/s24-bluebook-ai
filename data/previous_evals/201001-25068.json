    "Absolutely. It's a great non-bullshit way to get a QR without dealing with number and staying in the Humanities - but it really is math, and sometimes hard math, so only for the thus inclined.",
    "It's not a lot of work, and the material is definitely interesting at times, but just makes sure you keep up with lecture, not that that's incredibly difficult to do in the first place.If you're at all mathematically inclined - awesome, you should have little trouble adjusting. If you haven't been exposed to formalism and rigor, then get ready to think in a different way. If you've taken any upper level math class, proofs won't be too bad. If you haven't, just take a little more time, and you'll be fine.Take it, but it's definitely not an easy QR if that's what you're looking for.",
    "Do it. Work hard, get a solid study group, and don't lose track.",
    "From the perspective of a math\/science person, math logic is a very interesting, pretty easy course. The material is not that mathematically deep, but gets at some great philosophical problems, and can be very puzzling. Lectures aren't especially useful, but lecture notes and the textbook are. The problem sets are fairly challenging, as is the take home final, but there are no exams to worry about.",
    "Take it! Fun fun fun.",
    "Only take this class if you have a fanatical love for mathematics. The material is not very interesting; it's really just formalizing the logical structures you'll learn much more effectively in First-Order; and the professor does a poor job of conveying the progressive accretion of knowledge throughout the course. Still, it's a good course to pick up logical habits of mind, and there's a feeling of accomplishment to be had when you turn in the staggering take-home final. The TAs are your saviors.",
    "This is a very interesting course. All the lecture notes are handed out in class, otherwise there would be no real point in going. Section is completely optional; it takes place regularly and I think most people go (?) but you can easily get an A in the course without it if you have some familiarity with proofs. For math majors, some of the explanations might seem elementary, but most proofs are rigorous and there is a lot to be learned about the structure of logic. The workload is really light, only five or six problem sets that take less than two hours apiece. The final is take-home, and some people really struggled. It takes a long time to complete (think 20-30 hours) and has significantly more challenging questions than the Psets. However, it is fair, and definitely doable. Take this class if you have an interestin learning the theory behind first order and sentential logic, otherwise you will be bored. Sun Joo is very funny, but can be tough to understand sometimes.",
    "Highly recommended! This course serves as a very good introduction to formal logic and to writing proofs.If you take this course, you will really feel like you have a very solid grasp of logical principles and logical reasoning. Professor Shin also has a sense of humor and can make even the most abstruse and tedious concepts appear alive and engaging.If you do not like math or want an easy QR, this class in not for you.",
    "I would highly recommand it to those who want to major in philosophy or those who want to know more about the big picture of our logic system.",
    "It was a very well-organized course. By the end, everything came together perfectly, and Prof. Shin did a great job of keeping the bog picture in view all the time. Prof. Shin was funny, witty, smart, and made the course a whole lot of fun. And a great teacher, by the way. You absolutely do not need Phil 115 - this course stands completely on its own.",
    "One of the most difficult classes I've taken at Yale. This is one of those classes where the material is surprisingly simple, and so when Sun-Joo walks you through it in lecture you understand, but when you get to the problem sets, you forget everything. Definitely an interesting course, but be prepared for some incredibly difficult work. Don't miss a single lecture, and you'll probably want to attend section even though they are not required.",
    "A great class. I loved every minute of it. The lectures were concise and helpful. The problem sets were not too difficult. The final was slightly more difficult than I anticipated. The section that I went to was great, but I heard the other one was not as well organized and much bigger.Sun-Joo made the class. She is so funny and witty during lecture. She gives insight into the history of the subject as well as the motivation behind many of the techniques\/proofs that we encounter. The textbook is very dry and Sun-Joo's lectures are necessary to get through the class. She is also extremely welcoming during office hours.Do not recommend as a gut QR. I am a math major so the Psets and final were pretty easy but for non-math majors or people who haven't seen much theoretical math and proofs may struggle a lot unless you have a friend in the class.",
    "Definitely! Not too difficult, and very interesting. More for the mathematically-minded however.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course, especially to prospective math majors who want an intro to proofs class. You'll study part of the foundations of math, like why induction works! You don't really need to have taken Phil 115 before this.",
    "I would recommend Phil 267 to another student. The professor is great, the material is interesting, and the workload is miniscule. It may be more difficult for students who don't have a background in proof-based math (or logic), but it shouldn't take long to get into the swing of things regardless.",
    "This is the only class I've ever taken where I felt like I genuinely did not understand what was going on. But, in some ways, I stilled liked it. The material is challenging because its hard to keep rules and definitions straight, but when you figure out how to do a problem on a homework assignment, it is very satisfying. I've never taken a class like this (I'm not majoring in Math and Philosophy, and I'm not a Philosophy grad student like many of my classmates are), so this might be less challenging if you have some familiarity with proof writing, deductions, etc... One thing to keep in mind is that you can get a lot of help on the homework assignments, but for the take-home final (which is worth 40% of your grade) you are mostly on your own. Just be careful and make sure you're keeping up with the material.",
    "This is a very good introduction to mathematical logic. It is very different from the 'First-Order Logic' class--requires more work. Also, the final is considerably more difficult than the problem sets.",
    "Somewhat interesting; very mathematical. The professor Sun-Joo Shin really cares about the students and about getting concepts across clearly, and she can be very funny in lecture.",
    "It's a workout for your brain. It's some really deep and interesting concepts but unless you have a really strong of mathematics its sometimes hard to see the whole picture.",
    "An experience in appreciation of the great minds of logic and in coming to understand the limits of your own intelligence. A lesson in humility but also in the importance of perseverance and diligence. Material is interesting but only if you have a vague interest in logic at first. Otherwise, don't bother. The problem sets are difficult and the take home final is quite challenging. But as long as you seek the help that is there (office hours!), you'll be fine.",
    "This is a demanding class, both in terms of intellectual rigor and time commitment. But if you're interested in the ideas behind the metatheorems of first-order logic, you'll get a lot out of this course, and you'll really feel like you've accomplished a lot by the end. You won't truly learn the material until you finish the take-home final exam; know in advance that it will take a LOT of time to finish during reading week. I would recommend taking 4 instead of 5 classes the semester you take this class, especially if you're just a philosophy person and not a math genius (like myself). But the work is not unreasonable or unfairly graded; the average of your 5 best of 6 problem sets counts for 60% of your grade while the final is 40%. Also, plenty of partial credit is granted for proofs on the problem sets.",
    "This is a great introduction to mathematical logic. Will be very easy for people accustomed to proofs from math classes.",
    "Amazing class. Hands down one of the most intellectually-fulfilling classes that I've taken here. The work load is heavy, 6 problem sets throughout the semester (which are basically semi-long proof sets) and a long take-home final over reading week. Thus this is one of those classes where if you want to do well, you can. And it's not designed like that to be arbitrarily easy; proofs are hard and take a large amount of discussion and questioning. This class is designed as such because it is truly the best way to learn how to do a proof. If you enjoy programming, you'll like this class because it brings a lot of the same gratification. I would recommend this class in a heartbeat; it's a lot of work, but you learn something very worthwhile and are fully capable of getting a good grade at the same time.",
    "It is a study in the language and structure of sentential logic and first-order logic. Prof. Shin has organized the material extremely well. You not only feel rewarded by understanding how to manipulate the structure and, through proofs, learn about it on your own, but you understand how the meta-language supports the structure and the proofs.",
    "This course has a very specific aim - to prove the Soundness and Completeness of First-Order Logic (and Sentential Logic, on the way). You will learn a lot about both logical systems on the way to proving those theorems, but there is also a lot that you will skip. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic course. The workload is entirely manageable, the professor is great, and the TAs (especially Sungil) are just about the best you will ever have at this school.",
    "Phil 267 was a great class. Even though the class revolves around proving the completeness theorem, the skills that you learn along the way are important and the concepts you learn along the way are really interesting. There are certain things that I had kind of taken for granted, or never really understood why they worked. In order to build a foundation, Professor Shin started from the bottom up and explained why these things that I had taken for granted are actually mathematically sound. The problem sets were a lot of fun and the class was really enjoyable.The class is also accessible for non-math majors who are at least a bit mathematically inclined and still really interesting for math majors.",
    "This class is a lot of fun if you enjoy manipulating information in a challenging way.",
    "Math Logic is definitely much harder than First-Order Logic. I would recommend taking it only if you are truly interested in pursing philosophy, logic, or math; as a sort of general-interest follow up to First-Order Logic it was both too hard and not particularly relevant to my academic life. That said, I think that if Math Logic is what you want, the class is an excellent way to get it, and Sun-Joo is a great teacher.",
    "A lot of work without much of a point. Like my friend said, \"So we're spending all semester to prove the validity of a system that nobody ever uses?\" I was hoping it would be a continuation in some respect to \"First-Order Logic,\" but there was no real connection between the two classes.Also, the text book is absolutely terrible, and help for the material is impossible to find online. You're pretty much stuck with lecture notes, which are not easy to decipher.This class is probably not the best option for somebody looking to just fill a QR requirement or looking for an elective.",
    "I never went to class but damn it I had a good time taking this course and especially working on the final. I said this before to a friend, if Math Logic were all that I had during Finals it would be fun to just devote the time to solving the problems...but they're kind of a bitch if you have a lot to do during reading week...Still, TAKE THIS.",
    "Though listed in the Philosophy department, 267 is really a math class. From this standpoint it is invaluable for anyone interested in logic and foundations of math, but i can see how those without a math background would not enjoy it.",
    "If you took First Order Logic and think this course will be similar, don't take this course. If you are looking for a pretty hard math type course, take this.",
    "Mathematical Logic is a detailed examination of the metatheory of first-order logic. The goal of the course is to prove that first-order logical systems are both sound (meaning that anything that can be deduced from a set of symbolic premises is true when the premises are true) and complete (meaning that any symbolic proposition that is true whenever a set of premises are true can be deduced from those premises). If that sounds interesting to you, absolutely take the course. Prof. Shin is wonderfully funny and a very good teacher. You don't need really PHIL 115 (I took the class without it), and all the set theory you need to know is covered in class.",
    "Math Logic is a well-presented, well-organized math course that happens to be in the philosophy department. If you are looking for an easy QR, look elsewhere, as this course becomes highly rigorous despite a slow beginning. If, however, you are looking for a very interesting QR that has no numbers and requires no mathematical experience, this is a great choice that I heartily recommend.",
    "I would not recommend this class for those interested in the Philosophical side of it - we did not do much philosophy. Instead, this class concentrates on the mathematics backing up different systems of logic. If you are more of a math person, or if this sounds like what you're looking for, then this is the class for you.",
    "I recommend this course if you plan on doing logic or higher math in the future. If nothing else, you'll get good practice doing proofs.",
    "The proofs of the soundness and completeness theorems. Sun-Joo is great.Be advised: PHIL 115 (First-order Logic) is barely adequate preparation for this class. Math Logic tends much more to the Math side than to the Philosophy side. If you haven't seen set theory or induction before, you're going to have a hard time. It's not impossible, but it will be difficult, especially if you don't have a particularly math-inclined brain.",
    "Philosophy 267 is required for the math-philosophy major. In that sense it is a necessary evil. Otherwise, only take this course if you need it for comp-sci or have an esoteric interest in the subject matter."
