    "Amazing! Indonesian is pretty simple grammar wise, so you basically learn a lot of vocab. You can converse with your language partners by the 2nd or 3rd week of class. You learn a lot in a short period of time, and Pak Indriyo is the nicest man on earth. This class is not difficult, but it is really really fun and incredibly interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "take it if you're interested in east asian languages",
    "Yes, if youre looking to try a new language or if you arent sold on one of the traditionals like spanish",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend Indonesian. Indonesian is a wonderful course taught by hands down the kindest professor at Yale, Pak Indriyo. I learned an enormous amount of material and with the one on one meetings I felt like my progress was continually being monitored.",
    "best beginner language",
    "I would recommend this course because it's a great class to take and you learn a relatively different language in a short period of time."
