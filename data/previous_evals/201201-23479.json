    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. It was so interesting and taught me to think critically about the way people are portrayed in all media, not just Indian media. The workload was very manageable. I wish the class were a bit later in the day, but otherwise it was amazing. Even at 9am, it was worth waking up for and definitely kept me engaged and interested. TAKE THIS CLASS!!! You won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about Indian popular culture and history through looking at the media and transitions in the media over the years. I also recommend this class to anyone who enjoys films in general."
