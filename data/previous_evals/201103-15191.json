    "Only take this course if you have a strong grounding in Middle Eastern Politics. Professor Lust is nice, but her expertise in the subject makes her a tough grader. She assigns a lot of academic reading; if you don't like statistics, avoid this class!",
    "Yes, I would recommend. It goes well beyond an introduction to the region.",
    "Great class for people who already have a solid understanding on the region.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. Professor Lust is insanely knowledgeable and amazing! The course is really interesting--there are a number of topics to cover in the syllabus and a variety of important readings on them. It give you a general sense of the literature on the middle east as well as an understanding of various important topics in the region. there were lots of grad students so it definitely gave a very interesting perspective and they tend to be really familiar with the region so it's definitely helpful. TAKE ITTTT!!!"
