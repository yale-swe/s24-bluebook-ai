    "Take it",
    "All that it is advertised to be - a composition and analysis essay for every composer we study. Professor Friedmann is wonderful - so accessible and a great, open minded teacher. Analysis assignments were tough for me because they happen bEFORE you study each composer - but composition assignments are okay if you put in the time. Professor F gives comments and then you revise!",
    "This is a wonderful class. Take it if you're interested in analyzing 20th century music in an intuitive way that tries to make sense of what the listener hears, not just making connections between barely-salient features that one can only see by squinting at the score. Friedmann is brilliant, and you will gain much through listening to his analysis of various compositions.",
    "a fantastic model composition-based approach to the study of such early twentieth century composers as debussy, bartok, stravinsky, schoenberg, and webern. prof. friedmann is brilliant and incredibly helpful to those who seek out his assistance. I would highly recommend this course to anyone with a strong basis in theory and prior interest\/exposure to the music of the early twentieth century. I would also recommend taking this course along with friedmann's set class-based ear training for twentieth century music- in conjunction, these two courses make for an excellently paired aural and theoretical study of this music.",
    "Fantastic. Michael Friedmann has an incredible mind, and teaches this music soulfully. You learn various systems of analysis without ever losing sight of visceral musical markers, particularly phrase and gesture. In particular, Professor Friedmann's classes on Schoenberg were a revelation. A really special experience.",
    "MUSI 305 is an in-depth look at selected short pieces of Debussy, Bartk, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and Webern. This semester, Debussy and Schoenberg seemed to receive the most attention (closely followed by Bartk), partly because of scheduling and partly because Prof. Friedmann especially likes Schoenberg. Absolutely take this class if you're interested in any or all of these five composers. You'll receive a variety of analytical tools you can use as well as getting the opportunity to try your hand at model compositions (which are very helpful!). Perhaps more importantly, you'll get to be in the same room as Prof. Friedmann twice a week for over an hour, absorbing his wisdom and perspective--and that makes the class right there."
