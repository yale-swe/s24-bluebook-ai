    "I would describe this as a course that close-reads a series of major and diverse American texts, simultaneously trying to trace a series of common themes or issues between them and embracing the uniqueness of each text in very intimate readings during class discussion. I would recommend it to anyone who is working on American literature.",
    "I would summarize Regions, Hemispheres, Oceans as I did in question # 1, and I would recommend the course to every student in the English Department. While Americanists can make direct use of the course materials, other students can apply the courses insights to their own fields."

    "The wide-ranging array of texts in the course was very useful for expanding my sense of my field in American studies, and the broad theoretical framework for the course will continue to shape my future research and dissertation.",
    "Regions, Hemispheres, Oceans helped me look at American literature from a number of new perspectives. As I begin my dissertation topic, I am excited to maintain the transnational awareness that I developed in this course."
