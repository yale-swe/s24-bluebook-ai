    "Music 820 has the ambitious goal of placing mostly western feminist and gender theory in conversation with ethnographies on a wide array of cultures. I would recommend this course to another student, but advise that they should be prepared to do outside research on the music discussed in each ethnography in order to have a foundation upon which to base their discussion.",

    "It gave wide exposure to a number of ethnographic writings and revealed some ways in which ethnomusicologists have successfully included considerations of gender and difference in their musical scholarship."
