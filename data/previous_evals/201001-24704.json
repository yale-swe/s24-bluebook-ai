   "comments": [
    "It's basically what the title says it is-- a class on the history of southeast Asia. The countries are discussed one by one, and are not linked by themes, so there is no overarching social history as in other regional survey courses (like Schwartz' \"Colonial Latin America,\" for instance). It's an interesting class, and is a good way to get a third world credit.",
    "Professor Kiernan is amazing - the king in his field, and a great lecturer. The course material is also very interesting, and lectures are well organized. Take it.",
    "Yes. It's a good class.",
    "this class fulfills a major for the history requirement and isn't too hard - but be warned. it is pretty boring.",
    "A survey of several Southeast Asian nations since the beginning of nationalist, anti-colonial movements. Not too much reading or work: two short papers, a midterm, and a final paper. Not having a final exam is a huge bonus for a history lecture. Kiernan is a terrific professor; if he is teaching this course, you should definitely take it. Overall, a good way to fulfill the requirements for the history major: you will learn something valuable and not have to deal with an excessive workload.",
    "Most people coming into this class knows almost nothing about SE Asia. This is a great overview course. The workload is manageable and the professor is very knowledgeable in the field."
