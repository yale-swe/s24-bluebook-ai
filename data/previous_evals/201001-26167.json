    "I would definitely do so, but with the caveat that having a project of interest maximizes its potential. I had to choose something during the course and although I learned a lot I'm not sure that the paper will survive the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's more to the point than most other classes in the department, since it's actually about doing research. If you have a lot of other courses that you really want or need to take, I wouldn't make this a huge priority, but I honestly feel like the department needs more courses like this.",
    "A combination of reading and more technical econometrics designed to re-focus prior polisci courses in the methods sequence explicitly on the question of causal inference. Definitely recommended."

   "comments": [
    "Although I don't have a dissertation topic, its lessons will improve it eventually, especially in the area of causal identification.",
    "This course created a pretty awesome checklist of things to think about when you're starting to write or edit a paper, or when you're a referee commenting on somebody else's paper. It also managed to break me out of this funk I've been in where I often fail to look for the right kinds of data. Watching how everyone else is creatively coping with identification problems has sometimes distracted me from engaging in valuable, straight-forward projects. This class gave me a great perspective on doing both (dealing with identification and keeping projects grounded in reality and feasibility).",
    "Gave me lots to think about in brainstorming research design for dissertation work."
