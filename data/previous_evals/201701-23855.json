    "1. Could we learn more about creating actual projection design 2. Could we practice more projection design 3. There should be an actual syllabus of what is going to be covered in the class. 4. There should be more time for presenting projects, it not really fair to assign a huge project and then not give the time to present it and get feedback. 5. The Bring in Da noise project seemed to be assigned as a direct response to a discussion about how the class only covers the western cannon. The issue with this is that the assignment seemed not really thought out, and a bit insincere. 6.If the media class is not going to be mandatory anymore, one of the Thursday class, or maybe a few, should be dedicated to teaching the class computer programs needed to complete the final project."

    "Overall some of the discussions about theater, art, and the world have been stimulating (sometime infuriating), but I can't really say I learned a lot about Projection. I did learn some, but not enough to call this an intro to projection design class. This school already devalues projection, but how can we rally behind our fellow projection designer if we are also not taught its values\/fundamentals."
