    "Instructor: Keith Krumwiede \u00a0yes",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Excellent resources.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Keith Krumweide, while an excellent critic, was terrible with organization. Knowing when\/where class meetings are held, details of assignments, and clarity of the schedule and expectations of the course in general are very important. The lack of organization and communication detracted from the value of the studio as a whole.",

    "Instructor: Michael Young \u00a0The woodshop\/metalshop\/allshops should have some scheduled access over the Thanksgiving break week as many students use that time to get their projects underway.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The library's hours are pathetic.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The resources were more than adequate."
