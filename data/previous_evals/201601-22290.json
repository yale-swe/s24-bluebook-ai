    "Absolutely brilliant course, with a cleverly arranged disposition of topics in microscopy and rather appropriate amount of work. The instructors really at the frontier in their fields and are able to provide helpful insights in both practical and theoretical aspects of optical microscopy.",
    "it's a lot of work for a 1\/2 credit course.",

    "I came from a virtually non-existent microscopy background and am now able to confidently discuss both theoretical and practical issues of a number of techniques. I feel prepared to make critical decisions on what is best for my own research in the future and definitely know where to search for information."
