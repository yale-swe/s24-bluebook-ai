   "comments": [
    "I had never been a good writer and after this class my writing skills have improved so so much.",
    "My writing skills developed monumentally, and I feel much more confident in my abilities to research, form a thesis, and form compelling arguments.",
    "My writing skill improved significantly. I was not a strong writer at the beginning of the semester, to say the least. However, after going through this class, I feel much more prepared to write at a high level during my time at Yale and beyond. In addition, I learned how to critically consume news and other media. I am able to pinpoint aspects such as bias and framing, and decide what is worth consuming and what isn't based on those aspects.",
    "This class was a wonderful introduction to college-level writing. I learned how to transition from high school writing to collegiate, scholarly writing. I learned how to better connect information learned in class and readings to our assignments. I learned how to workshop papers. I learned how to better organize papers. Lastly, I learned how to write effective introduction and conclusion paragraphs.",
    "Definitely learned College level writing, citations, claims, and warrants. A must-take for those entering college level english classes.",
    "I learned an endless amount of insights and it is my hope that my teacher is able to teach this course again.",
    "I learned the importance of developing a claim and a warrant in my writings and expressing it in a way that the reader can digest. I developed better writing skills and reading skills, better immersing myself with the intricacies that exist in the realm of media."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths were the group analyses of each other's papers and the one on one time that Professor Carlacio made available to us. Those two aspects together allowed for invaluable feedback on all of my papers. However, there seemed to be a lot of reading that wasn't entirely necessary for either learning how to write, learning how to critically approach media consumption, or helping to provide information for our papers.",
    "The most glaring weakness, in my opinion, of this course was the difference between the first and last two papers. It was as though the first two papers and the last two were assignments from entirely different courses. I thought the readings and class workshops were a strengths of the course.",
    "There were not many weaknesses to be honest. The course was extremely solid and led me to explore new ideas at a high level of thinking.",
    "The strengths are obvious, which is the engagement with texts and current events that help one understand the strengths and weaknesses of modern media faculties. The weakness of the course, if it has one, is the pace."

    "Definitely, it will improve your writing skills which are extremely important in your future life.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody who wishes to become a better writer.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It it certainly is a challenge, even if you are a skilled writer to begin with, but rest assured you WILL improve. You're basically forced to. Challenging, but what you learn will be invaluable whenever you have to write for the rest of your life.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially if they have weak writing backgrounds.",
    "Yes! This course helps to lay the groundwork for all classes that require academic writing, and prepares you for college-level writing, showing you what the expectations are. Also, topic is as relevant as ever, and very interesting. Professor is great!",
    "I have and will continue to recommend this course to my peers if it is offered.",
    "Yes, this course is truly excellent. I feel that I have improved a lot as a writer after taking this course. Anybody who is looking to become better at writing should consider taking this course. It allows you to be able to recognize your own strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the topics that we discuss are interesting and very relevant to the political climate around us."
