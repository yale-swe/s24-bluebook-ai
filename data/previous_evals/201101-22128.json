    "The lectures are fairly interesting and the videos shown in the class are very poweful. The readings are helpful for writing the short and longer papers. I definitely recommend this course to another student. You would be surprised how interesting this subject is.",

    "Take it! This is a great class if you're interested in primate ecology and their social behavior. Nonhuman primates are definitely more diverse than I had originally thought.",
    "Yes, great social science credit for biology majors. Work load is not demanding (no memorization required) but material is valuable."
