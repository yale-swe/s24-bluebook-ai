    "Great class and provide important foundation for environmental studies.",
    "This is a very practical course for those who want to learn linear regression methods. It is very relevant to environmental science both in the examples and in the assignments. I would definitely recommend this course to someone who wants to learn basic statistics, R, or both, even if they are not environmental scientists! There is a steep learning curve for R, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly easy and extremely useful for other purposes."
