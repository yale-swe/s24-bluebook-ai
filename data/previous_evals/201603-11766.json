   "comments": [
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights that Deb Margolin gives her students in any of her courses can't really be summed up in this little box, but I'll try a little bit. Deb gave every student in this class the knowledge that they could write a play, even if they'd never done it before or even thought about it. She taught us that we all have a voice and stories to tell and we just have to be willing to let those stories speak to us and find their way on paper or on a computer through us. I've learned so many important playwrighting tools and tricks, from the \"irrelevant remark\" to the idea that \"transformation is plot.\" Without Deb, I don't think there's a world in which I would have felt confident enough to write an entire play draft.",
    "You develop a play project over the course of the semester.",
    "I learned how to write a play! And that anyone can. And about Deb's journey as a playwright.",
    "I have considered myself a playwright since high school, but I have never had a playwriting class experience like this one. I learned how to access the parts of myself needed to create moving, impactful stories. I learned about the joy that is automatic writing: one has to write every day, otherwise the inner critic inside each of us will prevent us from doing the work that we need to do as playwrights. I learned through the class dedications the integral parts of each play, and how to use the lessons taught by other great playwrights in my own work. I learned that my life, and the lives of my friends and peers in our class (and the lives of those beyond the scope of our class!) are the basis for the stories I want to tell--all empowering discoveries to make as a writer!",
    "I learned so much about structuring a play, understanding dialogue, how to really tell the story you're trying to tell. This is the best class I've taken at Yale. TAKE IT.",
    "I gained so much insight on how plays work, and a lot of confidence in my ability to write one (no small thing)",
    "Through this class, I developed as a writer, as a reflector, and as an observer. Through Deb's emphasis on automatic writing, I moved beyond the paralysis that usually effects me when I'm at the start of a writing project. I will also carry Deb's notion that \"plot is transformation\" with me throughout all of my future writing.",
    "I learned a great deal about how to be less critical of myself and more introspective in my writing. I also learned how to write a play with different techniques than I had ever used before.",
    "I learned so freaking much. This is this best course I've taken at Yale. I wrote a play. AN ENTIRE PLAY. And more than that, I now understand how to even begin going about writing something like that. This class helped me look at the the world, literature, theater and life in a new and better way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Honestly, could not really think of ways to improve this class besides having it meet more often or have more time. Even four hours a week just never seemed like enough. I always wanted more class time to share scenes or talk about our plays or develop more inspiration for them. Strengths include the bonding that happens during class. I feel like we really get to know each other in the class which makes sharing work much more productive and comfortable and also makes every student have an investment in each other's work.",
    "Deb is a wonderful human being to study with, no matter the context. The course could have had some more regimented assignment structure, and class time could be spent less on hearing our peers expound at great length about their feelings rather than sharing each other's written work.",
    "No way to improve!",
    "I will start with the weaknesses because there is only one: two hours is not enough time. We often only had 40 minutes for class scene work, and because of that condensed presentation time, not everyone got to present every week. The strengths of the class, in contrast, are boundless. Deb starts you writing from Day 1, so that each class member can produce a workable draft of a play in 3 months. The class is structured so that you learn about yourself (and your peers) in such a way that everyone and everything becomes the basis for a character, a scene, a monologue, or a moment of dialogue--in the best way. You become so comfortable sharing stories about your own life that the work you do writing eventually becomes an act of translation.",
    "While you only get to read scenes occasionally, the group environment of this course could not have been stronger and more engaging, you really get to learn from the people around you and the class honestly ends up being a cathartic experience.",
    "I honestly have no idea how this class could be improved, unless it was just meeting more and getting to hang out with Deb more",
    "This course is perfect. Because of the way Deb structures this class, I found myself in the most supportive circle (literally a circle) of writers that I have ever been in. It may have been nice to meet with Deb more regularly individually - though she does schedule in one in person meeting at midterm, which is very helpful. Above all, Deb encourages us to write often, to read our writing in class, and to trust in our writing, and I think that is the most important thing a playwriting class can focus on.",
    "The course was great, with an excellent balance of discussion of our work and performance of our work and the syllabus plays. There was a lot of opportunity for personal reflection, which was not only important for my writing but also a great part of my week.",
    "You can't improve perfection."

   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY. Do you have a story to tell? Do you want to put words on paper? Do you want to feel so accomplished by the end of the semester that you just want to write more and more and more and never stop. Do you want to feel super connected to a group of students all going through the same process as you? TAKE THIS CLASS IT'S AMAZING.",
    "A wonderful space to develop new work under kind and generous supervision. Better suited to people with some previous taught experience of playwriting, because a lot of the general techniques are not explicitly covered as much as a beginner might want.",
    "Absolutely! You will accomplish a lot in a semester and have a lot of fun doing it",
    "Absolutely! If you're a writer who has never written a play before, if you consider yourself a playwright, if you have never put pen to paper, take this class. Deb allows you to not only write a play, but learn about yourself and the world around you in the most instructive, positive way possible. It is as much a class about life as it is about playwriting.",
    "Deb is amazing, and you learn so much. This class got me through my semester. TAKE IT.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY!! If you are at all interested in playwriting, this course is life-changing.",
    "Yes!!! If you've never written a play before, or if you've been writing plays since you were two years old, you will grow as a writer and thinker in this course simply because of how much Deb encourages you to write and think inside and outside of class. It's not a burden - the only \"collected\" assignments are \"half a play\" at midterm, and a full play at the end of the course - and you'll come away with a new community of friends\/peers, a whole lot of self-knowledge, and tools you can keep applying to your writing forever.",
    "No matter how experienced you are with playwriting, you should by all means take this course with Deb. She provides an astounding level of personal attention and encouragement to every playwright in the class, and she really understood how to coach me into becoming a better playwright.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. If you have the chance, absolutely take this class. Fair warning, you will have to write a lot. You have to write an entire play in one semester which is, \"crazy,\" as Professor Margolin says. But if you are willing to put in the work and to really open up emotionally to a classroom of strangers, this will be the most rewarding and fulfilling class you will take at Yale."
