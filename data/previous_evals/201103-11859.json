   "comments": [
    "Take this course only if you're serious about research. It is a lot of work. Really. But, it is the best of it's kind. Good luck trying to get in!",
    "This is a wonderful class for anyone wishing to go into human neuroscience. it is amazing that undergraduates are allowed to use both fMRI and EEG technology. I learned so many cool techniques this semester, and even though it was really hard, the class was very rewarding.",
    "Interested in the current neuroscientific techniques?Definitely take this class",
    "Psyc 230L is a great course, but because it teaches very specific subject material, only students very interested in the topic should take it. The course teaches you how to process and analyze imaging data from MRI, fMRI, DTI, and EEG recordings from humans, as well as the conceptual working behind each technique. The course is very detailed and very directed toward those topics, and Professor McCarthy is absolutely phenomenal - he is very knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, and is very available to help students throughout the semester. The lab reports take a great deal of time - about 8-12 hoursper week in order to write good reports, and the final project takes over your reading week, so those are things to beware of. However, I don't regret taking this class one bit because of the depth and quality of the material I learned throughout the entire semester.",
    "If a student is looking to learn about fMRI or EEG, definitely take this course. The research experience was great and unique."
