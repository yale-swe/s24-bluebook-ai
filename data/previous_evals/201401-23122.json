    "Jackson.",
    "Graduate level electromagnetic theory course - following quite closely to Jackson's ubiquitous text.For first year physics grad students, this basically is a requirement, but really not necessary for any other discipline (or for undergrads)",
    "\"Jackson Math Methods\" - painful but necessary and somewhat fulfilling to complete.",
    "I would say that the course is difficult and the textbook is very difficult. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "This course is a necessary burden for those who are mathematically inclined, but not critical for many fields of study if undergraduate courses have been mastered.",
    "You have to take it.. so take it with Appelquist!",
    "One of the must courses.",
    "To me this is one of those course that you need to take, but it can be very dull at times.",
    "Yes. It gives you a solid foundation of classical E&M.",
    "The course covers basic E&M concepts. I would definitely recommend it because it's part of a fundamental background for any physicist.",
    "E&M is essential for Physics so I would suggest others should take it.",
    "Standard EM graduate course. It was well taught."

    "This course taught me a very deep theoretical basis for electromagnetism; while this may not directly pertain to my future research, it is a goodfoundation to general physics ability in the future, as well as use in my condensed matter research",
    "This course was not particularly useful to anything I do. More specific courses or texts are generally more appropriate.",
    "Its the basics of everything.",
    "This course gave a solid foundation for my research. More importantly, I learned many mathematical techniques like the Green's function method after taking this class.",
    "This is a basic course. Certainly fundamental to understand quantum field theory, which is extremely relevant to my field of studies.",
    "We covered so much material I think when I need this for research I would need to study it more deeply."
