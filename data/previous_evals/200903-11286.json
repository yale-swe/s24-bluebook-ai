   "comments": [
    "If you like Greek, take it. It's translation pretty much every day. It can get tedious at times and requires a lot of work, but if you really like the language, it is very rewarding.",
    "This class is a lot of work - I prepared more for this class than for my other three combined - but the payoff is that it will teach you a lot of Ancient Greek. Going into the class I lacked confidence about the language, I now feel ready to take on Homer. Crito is dry, but Herodotus is fairly interesting, and the class never just seemed like we were translating Greek sentences - it was always contextualized somewhat by bigger picture assignments.",
    "If you're worried that your Greek is rusty after the summer, it probably is, but by the end of the course I certainly felt a marked growth in my ability.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for a fellow classicist. The readings were very enjoyable; being able to review the texts in their original form allowed me to see just how much can be lost in translation, and definitely motivated me to continue pursuing my Greek studies."
