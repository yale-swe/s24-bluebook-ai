    "Definitely recommend to another student. Easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Dudley is great, she kept discussion moving really well and provided tons of insights into the reading.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material is very interesting and relevant, and Professor Dudley is articulate, engaging, and knowledgeable. It has totally changed the way I think about success and work.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS COURSE. Best seminar that I've taken at Yale so far, hands down.",
    "SO GOOD. This class is fabulous and not stressful. Also, the reading is super interesting.",
    "If you are interested in the material and have time to read between 150-300pgs a week do it (the book are quite pricey though).",
    "YES! I really loved this class. It was extremely relevant to everyday life and to working conditions in America, and I know I will remember what I learned for a long time. Prof. Dudley does a great job of helping you come up with key insights into the texts during class discussions and this makes writing the papers a lot easier. My only concern was the amount of reading (a book every week) but it would not stop me from taking the course. If you read the important parts of the books you'll have enough knowledge to participate in discussions and write your papers, so it is not something to worry too much about.",
    "AMST300 offers an introduction to ethnographic studies. I would completely recommend this class to another student because by the end, you will learn so much about how \"anthropological\" ethnographies inform and apply to discussion in other disciplines. Profesor Dudley is great and one should not be intimidated if they feel they do are not as familiar with the topic and type of material being presented. The class stays true to teaching you about \"Work in American\" and by the end, you'll feel that you have learned theory\/even putting together your own ethnographic study, but likewise, you'll be happy to realize that you have contributed to class because every discussion fosters active discussion and will undoubtedly make you want to contribute your viewpoint."
