    "Yes, if you can get in, great class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes definitely, not too much work but a great seminar experience. Gil Joseph is the man",
    "This class should have been called \"The Mexican Revolution\" - all but a few weeks revolved around Mexico's revolutionary years of 1910-1920 and their aftermath. I thought it was too large of a seminar (23 people) for each person to get to contribute very much, and the format of having a few students present each week meant that we often had less than an hour for a seminar discussion. Professor Joseph was very knowledgeable but didn't seem to facilitate discussion particularly well. That said, the class will be offered as a lecture next year and should lend itself better to that format.",
    "Mexico since Independence provides a survey of Mexican history through the 19th and 20th centuries. Starting with, as the name indicates, independence, the course follows the history of the Mexican state, covering the tumult of Santa Anna, the firm hand of Porfirio D\u00c3\u00adaz, the chaotic \"fiesta of bullets\" known as the Mexican Revolution, the entrenched corruption and cronyism of the PRI hegemony, and, finally, to the modern day. I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Professor Joseph is an excellent guide through a history that will be crucial in the 21st century.",
    "If this class is offered as a lecture, shop it and see what you think because I think this class could be much better that way. But it is a fascinating subject and professor Joseph is really knowledgeable.",
    "Fantastic seminar, fascinating material, and awesome professor. One of the most interesting seminars I've taken during my four years at Yale, and a subject that everyone should know more about. I came away feeling like I actually learned and retained a lot of information, and think it will be even better in lecture format next year.",
    "The subject material is REALLY interesting the seminar format was not entirely successful. If it is a lecturer I'd highly recommend it, otherwise, maybe.",
    "HIST 358J describes in-depth the Mexican Revolution and its impact on contemporary Mexican history. There are weekly film screenings that range from documentaries to the classic, \"Viva Zapata!\" The course requirements include a take-home midterm, a class presentation, and a 15 to 20-page paper. I think it will be a great lecture next year.",
    "Good history class",
    "This is an excellent course for anyone interested in Latin American History. Taking a class with Prof. Joseph is enough reason to look into this class. It is a particularly wonderful course because it combines political and cultural history. I am not sure if the structure will remain the same once it becomes a lecture, but discussions were excellent and were supplemented by a great film series. Absolutely worth taking."
