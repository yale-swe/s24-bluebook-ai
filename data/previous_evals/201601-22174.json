    "You want to learn how to film? You cant get into another class? This is the one for you. Welcome to a crash course on the difficulties of the film world, and unprofessional nature of filmmakers. By the time you finish your film, you will learn a lot. About filming, editing, dealing with difficult people...you name it",
    "Yes! would definitely recommend it (I already did!) it's a class where you gain a hard skill, and in the same time nurture your passion for story-telling.",
    "fun, practical, creative, you are given space to explore your own interest and work at your own pace, but you are provided with fantastic resources if you make an effort to use them. it provides a new practitioners perspective on your academic work that may not be provided by reading or research courses. i would definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend it to another student for the space of creativity that it allows, but not to someone completely new to documentary film making.",
    "A year long (two semesters) class that introduces students to the genre of documentary and documentary filmmaking. Each students is expected to make his own documentary film projects within the class. I would recommend the class to anyone who want to try themselves in doc filmmaking and maybe already have an idea for a film."
