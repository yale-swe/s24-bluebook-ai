   "comments": [
    "Professor Lee-Smith is absolutely wonderful and makes the class education while fun and relaxed. Class everyday can be awful, but she makes it easy to go to class and enjoy it. The only downside is the wide range of Korean abilities of the students in the class. Some are near fluent while others can speak very little. It can be frustrating for both sides at times. If you speak very little and cannot write, I would urge you to take Elementary Korean instead of trying to push through this class.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale - Period. If you know a decent amount of Korean (i.e. understood some at home), then this class is for you. Your level of Korean will skyrocket, you will have the support of the teacher and the class, and you'll look forward to going to class everyday. Seriously. Take this class. You'll never regret it.",
    "Take it. This class caters to students at many different levels, so you may find some parts of it particularly easy or challenging.",
    "A great class for native speakers who are really bad at writing\/spelling. Even if you're not too great at speaking (like me), if you study and pay attention in class you'll manage just fine.",
    "Great class to work on spelling, reading, and writing. Definitely recommend!",
    "YES! take it if you have any desire to improve your korean. the class environment is relaxed and friendly, the professor is amazing.",
    "KREN132 is more than your basic intermediate level language course. It is a course that seeks to better your overall comprehension of Korean by immersing you in the language with its fully Korean-conducted class sessions, novel and interactive means of getting students to speak in class, and its use of vocabulary outside of the standard lexus of home Korean. I would recommend this course to any Korean\/Korean-American student who is looking to improve in Korean beyond normal conversational Korean, and to any non-native speaker who is interested in a language course that is far more interactive than most, if not all, the language courses offered at Yale.",
    "Professor Lee does a remarkable job of leading class in a way that engages all students! You come to love her, and consequently, the class, by the end of it. She keeps class interesting with creative assignments, and if you put in the effort, you will learn. The class bonds in a way unlike other Yale classes because of the professor. Take it! It will make you happy.",
    "If you are a heritage speaker who doesn't have the proficiency to place into L5,don't hesitate to take this class. It has been a pleasure to be around an instructor who makes an effort not only to improve a student's individual skills, but also to have classmates get to know and help each other with their different abilities. Mrs. Lee-Smith is incredibly kind and you can always ask for help\/ask questions during class. As the class meets every day, students bond with each other, and it's truly conducive to learning Korean. I looked forward to class every day this term, and improved enormously.",
    "Definitely take. Prof. Lee will most likely be one of your favorite professors at Yale and the people you meet in this class...they will become a 2nd family for you!",
    "The intimate classroom dynamic makes this class worth it. It's easiest to learn with fun, laughter, casual jokes by the professor, and mutual enthusiasm from friends --- KRN 132 is never without them. The tests are straight forward and the grammar and vocab very manageable. The only warning: if you aren't a native speaker (like I was) you may feel a bit left out or behind in conversational skills. Just talk with Professor Lee, she'll take good care of you."
