    "Not very much",
    "The senior thesis project course for the EVST major provided the opportunity for students to bring their independent research together with other students and present it in order to receive feedback. Instructors provided guided advice on how to initiate research, design questions, and communicate effectively with advisors. I felt much more comfortable communicating my thesis and the main data analysis after presenting my work multiple times.",
    "I was able to develop a specific and targeted argument for my thesis and began researching and presenting the material I have been finding relevant. I am excited to continue learning throughout next semester in the process of writing my thesis.",
    "I was able to get a very good head start on my thesis and I was able to work on it with peers going through a similar process",
    "Great research skills",
    "Learning about how to present on an in-progress project, how to time manage a long essay, how to be honest about my own obstacles and gaps in knowledge.",
    "This course kept me on track with my senior essay and allowed me to meet and learn from my EVST senior peers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Many of the assignments feel forced, the group meetings were unnecessary",
    "The main strength is the kind, respectful, and productive atmosphere the instructors created for us to share our analysis, and their availability to provide one-on-one feedback. If there was any improvement to the course, I would change what the weekly assignments that were due. For the first month we spent time designing our topic and collecting literature review sources, but then between October and November the assignments were more project update presentations and an annotated bibliography. I think that these update presentations could be a bit more limited, and instead it would be helpful to break-up the 20 pages of quality writing into smaller assignments that were due earlier. I think it would be a productive way to get these pages done earlier by having 2-3 pages due weekly from the end of October into November, allowing time for feedback and also so that the final assignment is not rushed.",
    "Perhaps having some sort of 'extra help' for those that do not have topics set at the beginning of the year; this could even be something done over the summer or information that can at least be distributed with time. The discussions that we had every week between students and Prof. Fotos was always very helpful so I think that is something that should absolutely continue, especially for those still developing their topic.",
    "Better and more clear organization at times, but it is very helpful",
    "Love how we get broken up into smaller groups",
    "This course is a yearlong thesis class for seniors. As a student who appreciates structure, I found it useful to have regular short assignments proving that we were making progress and thinking about our final essays. A weakness is that the class met late night Wednesdays at a time I usually could not attend. Paired with a great thesis advisor, which I am lucky to have, it was a good accountability measure.",
    "Sometimes the weekly assignments didn't align with what I was working on for my thesis, but it still provided framework to think broadly and discuss it with my peers."
