    "Basically just a foreign policy overview with a greater emphasis on culture. It's your typical US history class but with a kind of different perspective from different view points.",
    "Definitely! This class is great!",
    "van vleck is brilliant and engaging. can fill in gaps in your knowledge of u.s. foreign policy. it's a little ambitious in scope, and we spend too much on the earlier years. only spend a few weeks on cold war + post cold war.",
    "So it's May 2nd, 2013, and I just got back from the 2 PM final, and even though I'm sick and I probably didn't do so excellent on that final, I can't even be mad because I genuinely loved this course. It had really interesting breadth, kicking off back in the pre-revolutionary era and then bouncing along at a nice pace until we got to the 1990s. The course focuses on the idea of the 20th century as the \"American Century\" and whether that's a valid title. You do about 100 pages per week of primary and secondary readings of various confrontations and political ideologies, and there's a pretty interesting bit about Pan Am Airlines that I thought was pretty tight. I never felt too bored in lecture, and Van Vleck has interesting things to say, even if she does sometimes sound like she's reading from a script. She's very clear about her expectations of you from the start, so the midterm and final are exactly what you expect them to be. And neither is too difficult. The two papers you must complete for the course are pretty quick and painless. Everyone I know who took this class really dug it, and it grew exponentially in size from the last time she taught it. You'll probably like it too.",
    "I would recommend it although my situation proves the TF can mean a lot of they are really good or....really bad.",
    "This is a great course. Definitely take it as an introductory history course or if you care about U.S. diplomatic history.",
    "Absolutely take this course!!! If you have any interest in history, policy, whether American or foreign, you will gain something from this class. I came to it with a very sketchy high-school background in history, and did just fine. You will learn a lot, guaranteed.",
    "A fascinating perspective on U.S. history -- TAKE IT. I've never particularly enjoyed U.S. history, but after taking this class I LOVE U.S. history. That seriously says a lot. It's also a very reasonable amount of work: 2 short papers, a midterm and a final, and the reading is always interesting and pertinent. Professor Van Vleck is also fantastic and dynamic as a lecturer; I seriously loved going to class.",
    "Definitely take this! Van Vleck is a great lecturer and the course material is really interesting. Reading load can be a bit heavy sometimes, but it's not terrible and you don't have to do every page to do well.",
    "AWESOME CLASS. Even though American history wasn't new for most of us, the way the material was taught was really enlightening. The readings are cool ** That said, not a ton of work involved with this class. I would certainly recommend it if you're looking to gain some new perspective on American history and not do a crazy amount along the way.",
    "Great class, not a lot of work. The content is really interesting and the work is really manageable: two 5 page papers, a midterm and a final. There are a lot of readings but if you're interested in either US history or foreign relations from a historical perspective take this class.",
    "Not really. Great lecturer but unless Professor Van Vleck makes it more focused and more in-depth, you don't learn much. Except the stuff about the Indians, as not too many people learn about that.",
    "Yes, interesting, fun class about american rise to power. 50 minutes twice a week makes it not too tedious.",
    "It is a great class. You should definitely take it if you love american history. It is a fair about of reading and you have to take really good notes if you want to do well. Overall I would recommend taking it.",
    "This is a great course that is basically a survey of US history through the lens of ideology. It traces the trajectory of ideas of American exceptionalism, manifest destiny, racism, national security, anti-communism, and more. You look at both the general sequence of events and dozens of very specific case studies. Instead of reading a textbook, you read historical articles and excerpts from books that really make interpretive arguments. The papers are great \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they are 5-7 pages of primary source analysis, and you can choose whatever source you want, which means that you can pick something that really interests you. I thought this was a great course for people who need to brush up on their US history and really understand the broader themes. It helps to have familiarity with US history going in though! Do not miss lecture. That's where everything is covered.",
    "Yes, definitely recommended! The lectures alone are great! Super great one to take Cr\/D\/F if you don't want to worry about the papers\/readings but do want to get a good overview of the history of US foreign policy.",
    "I think the class was made harder than it should have been.",
    "I would definitely take this class if you are interested in American foreign relations. I learned an incredible amount of information from this class and if you put the time in to do the readings, you will get anenormous amount out of the class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "Great Class. Take it. One of the best history classes I've taken and not too much work. The material is fresh and interesting even if you've taken US history classes. The Lavender Scare was something I have never heard about outside this class. Also, the papers allow you a great of freedom and were thoroughly enjoyable to write.",
    "Great lecture on American international relations history and culture. A must take.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "Recommend",
    "A lot of readings but well organized lectures.",
    "Great outline of american foreign policy in a semester. well worth it",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Take the course. There's a lot of reading but it's manageable and the lectures are very cool.",
    "Highly recommend, even for non-history majors because the work isn't overwhelming and the topics are useful for themes of America throughout the ages.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is very interesting. There was a lot of reading though",
    "A great overview of American history from a diplomatic perspective. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a different perspective on American history.",
    "I loved this course. You may look at the syllabus and think that it just covers US history, and that you've learned about US history a lot before, but this class presents the information in a unique way. Not only will you learn a lot you never knew about the US before, but you learn about US history through the lens of our diplomatic\/foreign relations. A relatively easy history course - 2 five page papers, a midterm, and a final.",
    "Awesome.",
    "History 122 is a great class for a strong overview of all of American history. It is very reminiscent of APUSH in that regard. If you did not receive a strong American history background in high school, the class will offer you a great review of the United States's position on the world stage.",
    "This is a great course and I highly recommend it. Prof. Van Vleck is a great lecturer and she presents fascinating material. The course gives a really cool overview of US foreign relations and complicates what you think you already know about the subject. Also if you can get Mark Redmond as your TF, do! He's the best TF at Yale. Take this course!",
    "Good intro to American Foreign Policy and history. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Good class",
    "HIST 122 is a good overview of the whole of American history, with an emphasis on important primary sources and relevant secondary sources. The course is heavy with readings and light with papers, thus still a significant time commitment. Be careful when choosing this class, the class is not as straightforward as it seems.",
    "Origins of U.S. Global Power is a basic overview of U.S. history on international affairs. If you have an interest in history or IR the class will be interesting butyou won't learn that much. Van Vleck is a pretty good history lecturer, the exams are pretty easy and straight forward, the readings are interesting and manageable and the TA's are all good. Take it if you have a space in your schedule or if you have no background in IR. If you do you can take the class, just don't expect to learn too much",
    "I would recommend Origins to absolutely everyone. I would say that if you want to challenge the way you perceive America, take the class.",
    "I think that the course explains many of the imperial actions of the US from an interesting racial, ideological, and political view. It is a very eye opening course and will blow whatever you learned in AP US History out of your mind. This course will become a classic.I think Van Vleck's goal is for students to reflect upon the debates that historians engage in when they write history. This is not a \"Cram course\" where you need to memorize a ton of information-- she does an excellent job of linking stories and weaving together events so that in a broad context, the picture is crystal clear.",
    "Take this class! It's a really great overview of American history from a unique angle. You can basically coast by on your high school US history knowledge and there is barely any work, but it's also pretty interesting. A great easy class if you want to round out your schedule with a chill 5th class.",
    "Great class! JVV is the best! Not too much work. Straightforward history exams. A good overview of US foreign policy.",
    "Good history course!",
    "Interesting, but probably a repeat of much of past US history classes.",
    "Origins was a great class! It's the third American history class I've taken and like all the others, it did not disappoint. The class started with the 1800s and ended with the 21st century, so you'll get a pretty thorough exposure to the history of the US's emergence as a global power. The tests and papers were fair and the readings and films we watched were pretty interesting for the most part. If your interested at all in studying US foreign policy\/international relations, this is a great class to start with. It's definitely helped me narrow on on the things that I find interesting with US--it's a good survey class that introduced me to themes and topics that I'll definitely want to explore more in seminars or other lectures.",
    "YES YES YES",
    "American studies was a basic American history class but it looks at history through the lens of foreign policy. I would really recommend this class to a student looking for a basic overview of American history but centered around a unique perspective. The lectures and additional readings were really interesting.",
    "I think it's a solid history course - nothing astounding or groundbreaking. There are better history course here,",
    "Good overview of American history and insightful analysis of specific events. I about American history, but I also learned about how to learn about\/consider history. Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to other students.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The work wasn't that hard and it was really interesting. I wouldn't call it a gut but its definitely pretty easy. You don't really have to do all the readings and its not a big deal if you miss a few lectures. However, most of the course is enjoyable and will give you a different perspective on a history you probably have studied three times already. All the TA's were interesting and helped foster ideas for papers.",
    "Great history class to take. Interesting and covers a lot of U.S. history.",
    "I would recommend this course. I think it provides a new outlook on US foreign events and the ideology that motivates them and thus would appeal to history major and non-history majors.",
    "Take this course! Especially if you're into foreign affairs and policy, it'll be an eyeopener since you realize that American dominance has faced so much resistance and isn't as great as its cut out to be...A little cynical at times, but great nonetheless.",
    "It's a really cool History course. Itcovers a bunch of important events in America's history, from pre-revolution to today. It's not a really hard course, and the material is incredibly interesting if you're at all curious about the origins of the US as a player on the global stage. Definitely take it if you can\/are looking for another class.",
    "I recommend it, but I am not interested in politics I discovered. Even so it was a doable and interesting class.",
    "---HIGH RECOMMEND---ENGAGE WITH THE READING MATERIAL AND BE WILLING TO BRANCH OUT AND IMMERSE YOURSELF",
    "This class is a broad look at American decision making throughout its relatively short history and examines not only government but also culture's effects on these decisions both domestically and throughout the world. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, particularly if they have an interest in the way America is perceived abroad and if they have an interest in American cold war foreign policy overall (This class is not as specific as John Gaddis' Cold War class but does provide a broad overview).",
    "Excellent class -- Prof. Van Vleck is an amazing lecturer -- but make sure to get a good TF or else section will be SO boring. Good intro to U.S. history and its relations with the world, but if you are an advanced history student you may be frustrated with the survey nature of the class. Awesome class though.",
    "Definitely. I would recommend this course to students who are interested in history since it offers a clear overview of U.S. modern history. I would also recommend this course to science students since the way this class went on was very approachable for non-history majors.",
    "Excellent survey course of US foreign policy and power. By necessity, it moves very quickly to cover the ~300 year period of focus. Yet Prof. Van Vleck frequently freezes upon events, individuals, and phenomena that embody the themes of the course. I've taken 3 other courses on American history, yet came away from this class with plenty of new insights. Take it if you want a light, interesting, and often funny lecture experience.",
    "This course is a good introduction to U.S. international relations, and how they intersect and interact with domestic politics. I would recommend this course to another student."
