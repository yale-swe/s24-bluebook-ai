   "comments": [
    "The class is an overview of US border\/immigration policy from different perspectives. Don't expect a focus on the legal. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to another student interested in American immigration policy, American Studies, urban public policy or Latino\/a studies. You would be a fool to not take this course if you were lucky enough to get in. This course provides a perfect blend of American immigration policy history and normative analysis and allows the student to interact with a wide variety and diversity of scholarly works (both in print and in film). The seminar environment allows students to interact with the literature and with each other in a meaningful way, and I greatly enjoyed the weekly discussions we had as a group. The course significantly changed my perspective on public policy in relation to American border and immigration policy, and I can honestly say the seminar was a life-changing experience. Easily my favorite class of all that I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend U.S. Borders and Immigration! This is such an important topic in current political debates and you will definitely benefit from being a little more informed about how historical debates over immigration factor into present-day discussions.",
    "If you want a great introduction to the history of the U.S. border and immigration policies, take this course! Professor Barraclough is fantastic and goes out of her way to get to know students and make everyone in the seminar feel comfortable. Highly recommended!",
    "Yes! If you are conservative in terms of immigration issues, maybe not because it is a very liberal class, but it was a great way to learn about the history and the present issues",
    "Yes absolutely. This class is great and super relevant. I looked forward to class every week. The readings are also super interesting, and the workload is manageable.",
    "A GREAT COURSE! If immigration interests you at all, this is a very informative course. It talks about an issue that is at the forefront of U.S. policies today. It focuses on Mexico-U.S. Border, but the first half of the semester is spent learning about the overall immigration history of the United States. Sometimes there are a lot of readings, but very manageable."
