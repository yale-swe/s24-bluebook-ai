    "take it if you really want to learn french, don't take it if you're only fulfilling a distributional requirement",
    "If you want to learn french take it but its not the easiest first year language.",
    "Yes, you should definitely take it, it is a lot of fun and you will surprised at how fast you learn the language. You have a lot of work for it but its worth it.",
    "The French program at Yale is great. I definitely recommend that people take French. Take this class with Ngame. He is a great professor. He is both good at teaching French through conversations (in French) and exercises in class, and he is fun, interesting, and funny. The workload for the class is a lot, however, since there is class every day and homework in the workbook every day.",
    "If you want to learn French, that is, if you are very serious about wanting to learn French, this is the class for you. It's intensive, you cannot get behind, and should practice speaking French, no matter how terribly you speak it, as often as possible-it'll help you do much better. Overall, a great class.",
    "A great foundations course for french, you learn the most important vocabulary terms and grammatical rules to successfully engage in basic conveersational french. I would recommend this course."
