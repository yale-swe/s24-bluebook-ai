But be excited- getting together once every few weeks to talk about the senior essay, go over what's due soon, and get to spend time with your fellow majors is a fun, laid-back, helpful experience. And Professor Davis even brought us food all the time. Start thinking about what you want to write your thesis on, and get excited for this experience",
    "well you gotta take it if you're a RLST major, but it's definitely painless and actually helpful (prob will be more so next semester )"
