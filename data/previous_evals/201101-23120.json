    "Interesting topic, outstanding professor, and absolutely essential for anyone interested in education or public policy.",
    "This was hands-down one of the best and unconventional classes I've ever had at Yale. There is a lot of work (a casebook of 150-200 pages per week, as well as study group meetings and a weekly writing assignment) but the work is worth it. By and large, students were engaged in the material, which led to great classroom discussions. Study group meetings before class also helped to consolidate knowledge before going to class the next day. The class is structured in small group activities and discussions and it's always a surprise when class is over because we never seem to have enough time. Seriously, this is one of the best classes offered at Yale and if you're interested in education policy and willing to put in the work, it's an unreal experience.",
    "This is a fabulous course. It's not quite as good as PLSC 260, but they are damn close. John Bryan Starr is an excellent teacher and spends an exorbitant amount of time preparing for class and reviewing the weeklyresponses. He is working harder than the students which in my experience is rare. The class discussions are focused, lively, and informative. It is not unusual to leave class having had the group change your mind on something. The students for the most part are engaged and committed to improving public education both in the classroom and outside of it. It's a great way to meet great students. Definitely a phenomenal class and one of the best seminars I've ever taken.",
    "Fantastic class. Lot's of work, but fantastic class. Really, really try to get in if you can! JBS is the man!",
    "If you can get in, take it.",
    "This is always one of the most highly rated classes. Like few other highly regarded things at Yale, this view is almost always well-deserved. The case-study method is unique, the tone of the class is challenging, yet collaborative, and the instructor is a model for what Yale instruction could and should be like. Some say you shouldn't take the class unless you're interested in education policy. I disagree. I say go for it, challenge yourself, and it will give you an important perspective on the practical implications of solving serious problems (that sometimes don't really have an answer).",
    "JBS's seminars are possibly the best classes at Yale. It's that simple. As everyone else has said in the reviews of his courses for the past several years, he constructs each class session with a great deal more care than just about every other professor here, and the small group conversations in seminar each week will make you think more deeply about education than you will have thought about it or any other policy issue in your life. As somebody who wants to go into education policy, this class (and Public Schools and Politics in the fall) has allowed me to shape the ideas that I will end up using as my baseline for the rest of my life and\u0096\u0096most importantly\u0096\u0096has given me a much more nuanced view of the issues. Even though we're a bunch of liberals in the class, there are so many different opinions that you can't help but change your own mind in the face of great, persuasive ideas. This is what college classes should be about. (A note about this specific semester's class: JBS made two sections this semester because some law and business school students wanted to take it, and I think it inevitably took a toll on the professor's ability to put things together and grade things, especially the weekly reading responses. It's completely understandable given that he now has to deal with 40 students, but I think that even though having two sections allows more people to experience the seminars, only having one section would be better for JBS and the students.)",
    "PLSC 240 looks at a host of educational policy issues, from character schools to special needs provisions to homeschooling. This class is absolutely worth taking if you're willing to put the time into the readings, assignments, and group study sessions. I am a graduating senior and this is the second best class I've taken at Yale. (The first was Starr's \"Public Schools and Politics\" course offered in the fall.) Really, take this.",
    "if you're even mildly interested in education you MUST take this class. JBS is the best teacher I have ever had. The class is a ton of work but you find yourself wanting to do all of it. Literally take this class, you won't regret it.",
    "TAKE IT if you can get in. There are weekly readings (150-200 pages), a 500-word essay per week, an oral midterm, and a final paper. As long as you put some efforts into them, JBS is generous with grading (as long as you have some good thoughts - super formal writing is not needed). TAKE IT!",
    "This is without a doubt the best course at Yale (along with its companion course PLSC260 in the fall). I learned more in each class than I did in entire semesters worth or coursework in many other classes. JBS is actually amazing. The way he structures his seminars and the care with which he compiles each casebook result in the most efficient learning experience I have ever had. If you can get in, TAKE IT!",
    "If you are admitted to this course, and have even the most basic interest in the material, just take it. I promise you will have regrets if you don't.",
    "TAKE IT! Definitely the best-run seminar at Yale, and if you care at all about the subject area, a Starr class will be the best seminar experience you have. Seminar time is carefully structured into interesting activities, conversations, and debates, and discussion is very student driven, so every second of seminar feels well spent. No one uses laptops in the class--he doesn't have a rule against it, it's just that everyone is super engaged. And JBS is incredible--you won't find a professor at Yale who is a better seminar leader, who is more dedicated to his students, or who puts more time into ensuring that his class is a superb experience. The final seminar dinner is a treat.This class will force you to think about a variety of education policy issues, and you will change your mind frequently. Even if you don't want to go into education, the skills you will pick up in understanding, analyzing, and debating politically-charged policy issues will make the class worthwhile. There is a lot of reading, but it's very manageable. Also, there are weekly response papers that usually force you to propose something...you can get creative. Also, you can revise the responses (with a regrade) as many times as you want, and grading is fair, so they're low stress.",
    "This is a great overview of how education policy influences education outcomes in the United States. It ranges from addressing issues of home schooling to thinking about textbook procurement. If you are at all interested in public education in the United States, you should take this course.",
    "This course was absolutely fantastic. It is the perfect mix of work and play, reading and discussion, assignments and broad-picture integration. The design of the seminar protocols was unique and constantly interesting; Professor Starr is a brilliant professor and teacher - note the difference; the assignments and the reading were worthwhile. It takes some commitment, but is manageable and very possible to achieve excellent grades. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale (and I usually don't like seminars). Highly highly recommended to everyone. If you get in, you are a fool not to take the class."
