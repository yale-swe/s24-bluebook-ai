   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class. Not only is the class material extremely interesting, Professor Papachristos will probably be the most engaging professor you've had at Yale. The assignments are fun and not pointless like homework in some other classes and the paper is just a case study that can focus on basically any topic covered in class as it relates to whatever neighborhood in the world (literally) that you want to do. Relatively easy and really informative. Background in sociology not necessary.",
    "Neighborhoods& Crime is a great class, especially for non-sociology majors. While we learned about the theories, we spent far more time talking about how they're applied. Prof. Papachristos is the most fun professor I've ever had at Yale--we watched clips of The Wire and heard stories about the Professor's work with gang leaders and police chiefs. There was never a boring moment in class and the assignments were relevant, interesting, and straight-forward. The readings were great, but we didn't spend much time on them in class so it wasn't always necessary to do them. Overall--definitely take it if you're at all interested in the material.",
    "if you're interested in crime and the theory behind it this is a relaxing class where you will get a breadth of knowledge on the topic. the workload is very manageable, many of the readings can be skimmed as the meat of the class is in papachristos' personal anecdotes and commentary on the readings, which are great and sometimes very funny! the assignments are broken up well, and are a nice change from the usual academic paper. the final paper is an interesting opportunity to learn a lot about crime in a neighborhood of your choosing, if you choose well this can be a very interesting assignment",
    "Well, it's actually a fun class. So it depends on whether you like fun or not.",
    "A fabulous course in which you really get to know the literature on neighborhoods and on crime. Each assignment builds up to a final larger assignment in a way that holds your hand as you accomplish something actually quite impressive.Professor Papachristos is casual in his affect and yet he truly knows his material. It is an amazing combination.If you're interested in sociological methodology (interviews, observation, quantification), this is an amazing course to learn it in!",
    "I would highly recommend it (as an introductory course).",
    "Fabulous class. Throughout the class you are studying a local New Haven neighborhood and it's such a cool experience. Translating what you learn in class into real-life activity, say word. The readings are SO interesting but it is reading intensive so be mindful of that.",
    "Class is very chill.",
    "Great seminar. Take it.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. It is accessible material and the subject matter really applies to a wide variety of fields.",
    "Fun class, great assignments. You get to explore a neighborhood of New Haven and figure out what's going on in that specific context crime-wise. A bit on the easy side, but it was the professor's first semester here, I would guess that it would be a bit more difficult in the future.",
    "This class was really interesting--if you aren't that knowledgeable about crime\/sociology of crime it will be really new and engaging and you will learn a lot. If you've taken a lot of classes in the discipline it might seem repetitive, but the assignments are interesting and very different from others at Yale--they're also kind of fun. This class is a decent amount of work but definitely manageable.",
    "Neighborhoods and Crime is a great class, I would definitely recommend anyone\/everyone to talk it, particularly if you are interested in urban issues (and obviously crime), and enjoy working on a large project of your choosing. The class is structured around weekly readings on different topics followed by a weekly discussion. The main thing for the class is a large project on any neighborhood of your choosing - which you use the class readings and discussions to analyze. Overall a lot of fun! Definitely recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend anyone take a class with Professor Papachristos--he's a funny, caring, wildly entertaining lecturer who has a lot of knowledge. In addition, the structure of the course's assignments which require you to intimately get to know a neighborhood of New Haven make for an interesting and worthwhile semester-long project."
