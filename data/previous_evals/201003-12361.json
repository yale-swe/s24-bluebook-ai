    "MUSI 218 is a course that aims to teach the fundamentals of ear-training and dictation. If you want to be a music major, you have to take it, but I wouldn't recommend it as a way to figure out whether you'd like to major in the department.",
    "I came in with no ear training experience and found this class very difficult. If you aren't sure about how good you are with melodic dictations, start the class Cr\/D\/Fail because otherwise you may regret it. Matt was a cool guy though.",
    "This class felt too disjointed in its teaching methods. I feel like if the instructor had stuck to only one style of learning dictation and sight-singing, I would have improved more. Also I don't think its fair that we weren't allowed to use solfege. If you wanna be a music major, you have to take this class. We barely did any sight-singing, so if you're a singer and thats the reason you want to take this class, it won't help you. If you do take this class, definitely take it with 210. It's not a lot of work though, so it would be an easy 5th class.",
    "It is a class that allows one to become more sensitive when listening to music, sensitive as in more attentive to its structure and melodies. I would recommend this class to any of my friends who wanted to develop their aural skills in music! It is enjoyable and entertaining.",
    "This is a course in dictation, with a little bit of sight-singing (which is really just reverse dictation), and the keyboard aspect. I learned the basics of figured bass realization in the keyboard lab, but perhaps i didn't start with enough skills to make it really worthwhile, though Jonathan Guez was very chill.To get really good at the diction, you really need to practice yourself. There is no homework, so you'll have to motivate yourself to do so. Find a partner and meet a couple times a week for 20 minutes. Even if you don't try very hard though, you will learn a lot. Dictation is an invaluable skill for a musician, and the ability to focus on music will help you appreciate it more. Makes a good last course.",
    "I learned a lot in Music 218 and liked that the structure of the course was basically guided practice - a class that consists primarily of in-class sight singing and dictations definitely suits my fancy.Take it with Sarita if you can (keyboard lab with Jonathan Guez) or at least talk to people about whatever TFs are teaching sections. Definitely worth waiting for a good teacher.For a .5 credit course it is a good bit of class time (two hour-long classes each week plus a half-hour keyboard lab) but it is fun and worth it. Great to take Cr-D-F if you're unsure - you can always switch later."
