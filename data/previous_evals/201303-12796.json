   "comments": [
    "Clear introduction to topics that come up in probability courses providing a direct context\/framework for applying them in real-life problems. Highly recommended for people interested in mathematical modeling, especially though if taken in parallel with probability theory of some kind as it's almost like a practical \"second look\" at the topics being taught in a more math-intensive class, and it's useful to have the more mathematical\/theory-oriented side as well.I would recommend the course to anybody in the public health program-- PhD and MPH alike.",
    "Yes; it's a great introduction to probabilistic modeling applied to a broad set of systems and is accessible to a range of math backgrounds.",
    "I will recommend this class to incoming doctoral students in my department, just as the class before me strongly recommended it to me. Even for students not considering careers in modeling, I think it is a valuable counterpoint to the way statisticians use quantitative methods, and, as mentioned earlier, I think the course helped improve my quantitative reasoning in a way that other statistics and probability courses have not. Classes like this are few and far between and remind me what a privilege it is to study at this university.",
    "It's a class where you use mathematical and probability models to try to emulate real life examples to try to forecast anything! The number of terrorists in the country, how many people are actually homeless when you only know that some of them show up at the shelters, how long it will take for the zombie invasion to kill us all.",
    "A good class that teaches you to think about problems more quantitatively. I would recommend it to interested students.",
    "Great course for anyone interested in using statistics and basic models to inform policy from public health to national security. Good for any researchers with a policy-bent or policy makers themselves.",
    "For someone interested in policy, i would recommend the course though a heavy workload."

   "comments": [
    "I can envision applying everything we tackled in this course to some aspect of my dissertation, and the course has additionally made me feel more comfortable approaching decision and policy recommendation questions as part of the dissertation. This is everything I could have asked for in the course. Thank you.",
    "I have focused mainly on statistical approaches to answering my research questions, and I am not pursuing training to become a mathematical modeler, but this course has increased my confidence in potentially trying to apply probability models to my dissertation research, or at least to consider starting from \"first principles\" before (or in addition to) turning to standard statistical models. Coincidentally, some of the readings and class examples were relevant to my own work and I benefited greatly from learning them from Prof. Kaplan.",
    "As a public policy practitioner in global affairs, I will look to these models when there is a gap in information and also be able to distinguish which models can and should be used when I need to estimate national security matters and poverty alleviation matters!",
    "The course did not relate directly to my research. However, the thought process that you learn in the class is definitely applicable to the types of problems I face in my research."
