    "Sorry, but this course was unbelievably boring.",
    "The six-week course is a great choice for people without background in financial concepts to learn the basics of the financial language. I used what I learned from this course to develop a financial model for the final project of another course.",
    "The course covers a lot of important material in a very short time, perhaps having this split into two professional skills courses?",
    "I appreciate how low drama this course is. It was hard to sit through so muchfinanace lecturing sometimes haha, but doing in-class exercises makes it way more fun. It is also great to have assignments each week and really straightforward expectations",
    "Course spent too much time in the weeds, busy work that wasnt helpful for what many of us will do. Needto spend more time on high level concepts of analysis.",
    "There is way too much (valuable) information crammed into this PSC! I learned a lot of basic financial concepts that I've already found to be very useful\/helpful in my work, but I think it would be great to meet twice per week for this course because it is difficult to focus for two hours in the evenings.Assignments were very helpful, though I found myself searching through class slides, reading notes, and online for more information in order to complete the assignments.",
    "This course would have been more engaging if there had been projects or cases that students worked together to solve. The material itself was relatively dry, so being able to problem solve and generate real deliverables would have facilitated more active and enduring learning.",
    "Maureen is great!",
    "Maureen is an excellent teacher. The class was useful and material very helpful, esp for people with nobackground in accounting. Towards the end the class got significantly more difficult and the homework was extremely time consuming for a 1 credit class.The classes were a bit rushed and it was difficult to follow because there was so much information. However, Maureen is v good at explaining things in simple terms. Course would have been a bit more productive not at the end of the semester with finals, etc for full-credit classes.",
    "very valuable class",
