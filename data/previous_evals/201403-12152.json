    "Definitely especially if you have just come through the L1 L2 track (because you have no choice) but more importantly because you have just spent 12 months learning the basics of Latin for the purpose of translating real prose\/poetry. I preferred this course because I enjoy Latin prose more than Lain poetry. That may be a consideration for someone debating which mid-level Latin course to take."
