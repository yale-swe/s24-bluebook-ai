   "comments": [
    "I reccommend anyone who ever wants to be a leader in any capacity to take this course. or to anyone who wants to deal with groups of people generaly like a corporate lawyer or something",
    "A good class with a good mix of technical modeling as well as qualitative history and perspectives on different sociological concepts. I would definitely recommend the class as it works well for both STEM oriented students and humanities oriented students.",
    "This is a highly structured class! Workload is OK, although reading is not necessarily essential: most of the content of the class is in lecture. Professor Boorman is very good at explaining the concepts, and keeps the history parts of the class interesting with anecdotes and specific examples of the material in class.",
    "Great course that integrates models and thinking from law, engineering, economics, mathematics and computer science into social policy analysis. Don't expect to learn specific of policy but a more holistic lens with which to view it. There is a lot of assigned reading which can be treated as strictly optional. They are incredibly enriching, however, and well worth your time. When studying, focus on the big picture and practical applications.",
    "This a non-political course in analyzing social policy and theories behind social policy. Its divided into a historical compinent (up until the midterm) and a modelling component (post midterm). Modeling stuff can be tough but I found it to be way more rewarding than just historical theory. Really enjoyed this course, but certainly isnt a right fit for everyone -- it requires a certain kind of intellectual approach that is more active than passive in the sense that you need to digest what you learn in class and see how it fits with social organizations that youre involved in with everyday. I highly recommend it, but not for just anyone. Dont skip class or you wont get whats going on at all",
    "The course, while at times dry, is generally engaging and Professor Boorman is incredibly knowledgable about the material. You will be able to look at both social groups and the political landscape of the US much more analytically. That being said, know that the final is 100% of your grade.",
    "This was actually a really interesting course. Professor Boorman doesn't lecture in any particularly flashy way, but has created a really fascinating course that provides real insight into the way the world works. His course notes are excellent, and the amount of work expected is reasonable. I would really recommend this course to people already invested in sociology\/policy or just laypeople who want to know how government and organizations work."
