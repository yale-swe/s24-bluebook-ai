    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn more about music, or wants to accompany instrumental studies. While it won't help you become a better instrumentalist, necessarily, it will increase your understanding of the music you're playing, and what makes it so captivating. You will learn about things in music you didn't know had a name, or didn't know existed, and it'll open up so many ideas and realizations about music that will enhance your understanding of it.",
    "It's music theory - difficult for anyone but the experienced player, and a whole lot of work either way",
    "The class was definitely hard for me, but I felt like it was mostly because I had never taken a music theory class before. (However I have played some kind of classical music for most of my life) It'small a lot of analysis and figuring out chords, and it just feels really cool to be able to understand classical music better from a structural point of view. You definitely gain a deeper understanding of classical music after this class, despite the struggle it sometimes was."
