    "This course is specifically intended\/required for WGSS majors in their junior year. However, if you fit this criteria, it won't be a disappointment! You will need the prep for your senior essay from this course. It's very helpful and helped pushed my topic forward and I've essentially written the beginnings of my senior thesis this Spring!",
