   "comments": [
    "This class was amazing! I really enjoyed the class discussions and learning new words from a colloquial perspective. Watching Chinese movies not only helped me improve my Chinese, but it also helped me better understand Chinese culture. Although the class and work was fun and doable, the exams were very difficult. And on a final note, Kang laoshi is wonderful!",
    "This course is extremely difficult and demanding, even if your Chinese is very advanced. You will improve marginally, but only if you put in more than the already gratuitous hours just to pass. The \"Chapter Tests\" are multi-hour marathons that more closely resemble a final. However, the class is actually a lot of fun, Kang Laoshi is caring and engaging, and the movies are interesting. He provides a lot of cultural and historical context, and you learn a lot about modern Chinese history. It is STRONGLY advised to take this course Credit\/D, so that you may enjoy it, because getting a good grade is not only nearly impossible, but very stressful. Just sit back and enjoy Kang Laoshi's fun lectures.",
    "Great class if you want to improve your Chinese and watch some really great Chinese films! It's hard work, but you really learn alot.",
    "This was a decent Chinese course. One of the problems with it is that it is not very demanding, so linguistic improvement must be done independently. It is interesting to learn about Chinese culture and history in Chinese, but for someone who is also trying to improve in the language, sometimes I wished that there was more focus on language improvement. This is a bigger problem with Chinese at Yale, because there are not enough high level language courses.",
    "This class is insane.",
    "This is a good class to practice your listening skills. You will get to see a lot of interesting movies and talk about different aspects of Chinese culture. There is some speaking practice, but you will mainly practice listening and writing."
