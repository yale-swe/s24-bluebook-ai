   "comments": [
    "Learned more about writing, Shakespeare, history, psychology, etc., etc.",
    "In this seminar, I really learned how to engage with the text in a way I previously had not. I came out of it with a better understanding of how to analyze, read, and understand literature in a way that is nuanced and discerning.",
    "We learned about how to write concisely\/clearly, the concept of tragedy, and talked a lot about the elements of Shakespeare's own writing that makes his plays interesting and great.",
    "Through this course, my writing, literary analysis, and my ability to hold intellectual discussion about works of art improved immensely.",
    "Learned to think in new ways (i.e. think critically and creatively) about Shakespeare",
    "I learned a lot about the Shakespeare texts and how to read text very closely. Also about the history and culture of the time period.",
    "Understanding of the four major tragedies and different methods of Shakespearean analysis, along with some historical background surrounding the plays and their distribution.",
    "I really learned what it is to read text and interact with language in a different way, as Kastan is so intent on re-reading and re-contextualising language.",
    "The course really taught me how to think deeply about not only literature, but everything I'm presented with. Shakespeare of great of course, and we've all read at least some, but this class takes the analysis of the tragedies to a new level. Kastan also pushed my writing to the next level. Unlike most introductory writing classes, this class forced one to (at least attempt to) improve their writing skills.",
    "This class taught me how to analyze the different texts in ways that I have not done before!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked how we were given ample time to read each play; it allowed me to fully dedicate myself to the text and really engage in the language of it. The weekly reading responses were also a positive aspect to the course.",
    "Professor Kastan is a great lecturer, but he has a tendency to run seminar as a lecture as well. You'll be asked at the beginning of the semester to participate as much as possible, but then come to find there frankly isn't a ton of room for you to participate. That, however, is virtually my only complaint about the class. Professor Kastan's brilliance and his tactful ways of conveying his ideas to the class make class very interesting, and I really felt like I got a much deeper feel for Shakespearean Tragedy after the course!",
    "I don't think there are many\/any weaknesses with this course. As for strengths, I think that it does a great job teaching literary analysis and writing. The topic is also very interesting, and the amount of reading for this course is manageable.",
    "Strengths: very interesting, very engaging, workload is fair Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "The classes were usually very interesting, but I wish they were slightly more seminar-y and less of a lecture.",
    "This course was structured really well in terms of how much time we spent on each play, and the plays we chose to analyze were certainly interesting. However, I went into this class expecting it to be much more of a seminar-style format than it was; even by the end of the semester, it felt like the majority of the class was essentially a lecture, and any discussions that we were having weren't facilitated in a way such as to lead us towards any sort of real insight (it felt like the class was pushing us into thinking about these plays in a very single-minded sense, which is really a shame considering that there is 500 years worth of analysis and interpretation of those plays out there). The most it felt like we were really pushed to engage with the texts were in the weekly online forums--which would have been great except that we devoted almost no time in class to them and never received any real feedback on those posts. It was also very frustrating in that for the majority of the class we were told how subpar our writing was, and then given almost no real feedback on how to improve other than a few vague suggestions. On the whole, this course could benefit from a greater focus on facilitating and promoting student discussions, ideas, and skills.",
    "I think the course is really strong in many ways, such as the general syllabus and the knowledge of the professor. Sometimes I think we could have spent more time discussing in class.",
    "It was an enjoyable class, Kastan has a lot of great things to say about the plays and stimulates a tremendous amount of thought about them. The way in which we analyzed the plays was eye-opening and facilitated a superb learning experience.",
    "This class is truly an amazing seminar. Everyone gets a chance to speak about the four plays, the conversations are great, and Professor Kastan has so much knowledge to offer and share."

    "Professor Kastan is phenomenal and you would be doing yourself a great disservice if you did not take this course (or at least his big lecture class). He is absolutely dazzling and you will learn a lot not only about Shakespeare, but about your writing, history and life in general. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any freshman, even to those who don't think they like Shakespeare. It was overall an incredible experience and I am grateful that I got the chance to have David Kastan as my professor.",
    "YES, highly recommend this class to anyone with a remote interest in reading Shakespeare! Kastan is an amazing thinker who will not only teach you a lot about Shakespeare but also how to think critically about anything. The seminar is a little more lecture-based than a seminar discussion format, but Kastan knows so many interesting things and has so many fascinating stories that the lecture-heavy format works great. Workload can be as much (or as little) as you want since the bulk of the work is reading the 4 texts, weekly responses, and 3 papers. However, if you never want to take the time to analytically read the plays with a critical eye, you will be wasting your time in class and not get anything out of the discussions\/lectures. So, make sure to pay attention to the readings if you want to have a great class experience. Again, highly recommended for anyone willing to put the time into reading the plays and has an interest in Shakespeare. Even as a STEM major, had a great time learning about the nuances of Shakespeare and how to appreciate his works.",
    "YES! Plus, you'll get cookies every so often :)",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they enjoy reading and analyzing Shakespeare's works. Kastan is an amazing professor, and there aren't many classes where the professor pays such close attention to the analysis and work of every individual student within the seminar.",
    "YES!!!",
    "Yes, I think every freshman should try and take a freshman seminar. In particular, this one was useful because it taught a lot about writing, and it was an interesting topic.",
    "Frankly, I did not enjoy this class. Instead of being a fun, engaging seminar it was essentially a 75 minute rambling lecture with (occasional) discussion. It was especially disappointing because I had always wanted to take a Shakespeare class, but this course rarely engaged me in the plays in the way that I had hoped it would. It felt like we weren't being pushed to explore any interpretations outside of that of the professor, and class ended up being essentially a rehashing of the same four or five ideas every day. I also didn't really get any tangible improvements in my writing from this course, mostly because feedback is vague.",
    "Yes. Really wonderful plays and I learned so much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was an eye-opening experience and challenged my reading comprehension and writing abilities. Take the course if you can get in.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It was an incredible experience!"
