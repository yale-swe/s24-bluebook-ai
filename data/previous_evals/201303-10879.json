    "Awesome course with very little pressure.",
    "Best seminar (though more like small lecture because there isn't really any discussion) I've taken at Yale. Hands down. You learn about the most cutting-edge research happening in the field of autism directly from the researchers working on the projects. If you have any interest in this field, you should definitely take it.",
    "It's a great class, although I'm not sure how much I retained. There are no exams -- your entire grade is essentially based on your final research paper on a topic of your choice. Every week you listen to a lecture by a different expert on one field of autism research. There's also a practicum that you attend every week, in which you go to a home or a school for people with autism. I personally loved my practicum, but you have to be there for three hours at a time, and because none of them are that close to Yale it ends up taking about four hours total. You basically lose an entire morning\/afternoon, so keep that in mind when planning your schedule. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "Are you interested in learning about autism? Take this class. The practical side of it (a weekly placement at a nearly facility for people with autism or a related disorder) is an incredible experience. It's not really a seminar, more a series of guest lectures, but all of the lecturers are experts of some sort in the field, so don't feel too gypped. But don't come in expecting to contribute heavily - it really is all presentation-style. There isn't much work at all until you get to the final paper, but one final paper is very doable. I'm still a little confused about how I got my grade for this class, but grades aren't my biggest priority, and if you're similar then this class will work well for you.",
    "Take this course! It's not too much work, it's very interesting, and the teaching staff is a lot of fun. 1 final paper with some minor things for it due throughout the semester, a 90 minute lecture and 3 hours of volunteering a week. There's a lot of reading, but in all honesty you don't need to do it for reasons beyond your own interest.",
    "PSYC 350 is definitely the most unique class I've taken at Yale, in a really good way. You hear from a different expert in a field related to autism every week, and each speaker was really interesting and knowledgeable. The highlight of the class, however, was the practicum placement - I really enjoyed mine at Benhaven. I wish there had been more in-class discussion\/interaction, as I think it would have been really interesting to hear about the other students' experiences. The workload for the class is not too heavy, just weekly reading and an essay at the end of the semester. I found all the readings really interesting and looked forward to doing them each week.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class, especially to psych majors. I really liked the format of the class -- each week we had one guest lecture and one practicum session at a local school\/living facility for individuals with ASD. The lecturers cover a wide range of fields related to ASD, so this class offers a great introduction to autism from a variety of perspectives.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You'll have to fight to get in, but it is so different from any psychology course I have taken at Yale due to the practicum requirement. Internship field-work made the individual lectures all the more interesting in that I looked forward to utilizing the information learned in class to reflect on my personal experiences at Chapel Haven.",
    "This class was really good and interesting, I particularly liked the practicum. However, I would have definitely appreciated more feedback\/ transparency about how we were going to be graded. I honestly have no idea what my grade might be in this class, which is a little frustrating.",
    "The practicum makes this entire class worth it. Jamie's also the coolest professor. Very relaxed class, learned a lot about autism. Not much work overall. Take it for the practicum!",
    "I loved this class, if you're interested in autism definitely try to take it (though it was competitive to get in). I emailed one of the speakers who came to our class and am now working in her lab and the practicum placements offered first-hand experience with Aspergers and autism. It was such an awesome experience and opportunity, I'm so glad I took this seminar."
