   "comments": [
    "It was a great exposure to a variety of readings that will be useful in other contexts, and also to some extent an introduction to the complexity and confusion that is involved in talking about something as abstract and multiply-directed as the voice.",
    "This course surveys the various ways in which the voice has been conceived theoretically, drawing from philosophical, phenomenological, linguistic, psychoanalytic, and musicological writings.",
    "This class looks at conceptions of the voice through different theorists and how other theorists and musicologists have engaged with these ideas in their own literature. I would most certainly recommend it to another student, as it provides a great framework for thinking about all kinds of music studies. The opportunity to work through some difficult theory with someone who is really excited about it and also can explain it is a rare one, and not to be missed."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course revealed the voice as a tantalizing intersection between musicology and disciplines as disparate as phenomenology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, and philosophy, not to mention anatomy and sound studies. This was a truly interdisciplinary endeavor, one that any musical thinker ought to benefit from.",
    "This course gave me a new framework within which to think about my discipline. I have absolutely no doubt that it will contribute to my dissertation, and has already challenged the way in which I do my own research (in a very good way).",
    "Again, this course seemed at times to be less of a musicology or music theory course, and more of a philosophy course, which was just fine by me. While I'm not sure I can, at this time, point to any direct contribution of this course to my musicological research interests, it has given me both a very good introduction to Derridean and Lacanian thinking in relation to voice, as well as the thinkers who come afterwards, which has already been useful for me in some holiday-season reading projects, and will undoubtedly continue to be useful."
