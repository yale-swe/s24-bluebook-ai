    "I would recommend it to somebody who isn't looking for a fun easy art class. This was my most time consuming class and I loved what I was doing, but I don't think everyone is cut out for this class because you have to really appreciate the art that you're making, and you have to care a lot about how the final product will look",
    "First couple classes are informational, but the rest are just hours to work on your projects, it's great.",
    "I would highly recommend the course, whether or not you have a background in sculpture",
    "I thought this class was fantastic. Art 121 allowed me to think about conceptually, structurally, and critically through metal, a completely new medium to me. Brent is AWESOME. He's so helpful and understanding, while he maintains realistic expectations throughout. the only thing he expects is consistent attendance and that you challenge yourself. I should say that it requires a lot of work, but its doable and worth it. Its great to have a course that doesn't require problem sets, reading, or essay writing, but don't be fooled, its still a lot of work, just a different type of it. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Definitely; would never have learned same skills otherwise",
    "If you're interested in sculpture this is a pretty cool course to take. You get to make a couple of cool sculptures and it actually gets you to think about different aspects of sculpture and art, while at the same time helps you learn how to talk about your work, which is much harder than it seems, but is an incredibly useful exercise if you are interested in talking and thinking about your own work and\/or the work of others. Also, Brent was very helpful, which is essential in such a class, as you engage in production methods that are probably alien to you, but that are essential in order to carry through what you want with your work and get the most out of the class."
