    "You will enjoy this class if you enjoyed writing book reports in the third grade. It is a nice reward for MBB being a vaguely difficult major in that the senior essay is just about as little work as one could imagine. Just pick a topic, do a little research, write a terrible draft, get some unhelpful comments, give a short talk, make your paper a little less terrible, and then turn it in. Easy!Take this class if you're tryna graduate. Duh.",
    "Seriously? I'm evaluating this? Well ok, I mean I guess we worked kinda hard in some kinda difficult classes throughout Yale but do we really deserve this kind of gift? I literally did more than half of the work for this \"course\" between key west and miami on a spring break cruise, and it probably turned out fine. Throughout the entire semester, the only feedback I got was to add more figures, and when I asked about the quality of my proposed experiments (idk lol guess I was bored) the profs response was for me to add more figures. In fact, I am so embarrassed that this \"lit review\" (aka book report) served as a capstone project for an undergraduate subject i'm passionate about that I took my research for credit final paper this year, changed the title to say senior thesis, and sent it to my parents so they wouldn't think my major was a joke. Seriously mb&b, I know you guys think mcdb sucks in general but take a page out of their book on this one. I think the department owes me like $100 for the number of times i went to Box over the past two months since I had nothing to do for my thesis. Maybe I'll try to claim it when I get back from myrtle.",
    "A good course; you can choose to branch out and write on something unrelated to your research or stick to your guns, but either way, you learn a lot through interpretation of current literature, and its not too tough a course. Start early",
    "You have to take it, might as well pick a topic you like and have fun with it! Though most people choose their own research as the topic, some people chose other things as well.",
    "The senior essay is a literature review about pretty much any topic in biophysics\/biochem\/biology. It's very low-stress: there's a meeting at the beginning of the semester to choose a topic, a draft due before spring break, and the final essay is due during the last week of classes. There's also a short presentation at the end of the semester. There are no regular meetings throughout the semester. Think about what you want to write about before the semester starts and don't put the drafts off until the last minute. This is a fun class!",
    "If you are looking at this course, I'm guessing that you have to take it. So, my advice to you would be to write about something that you enjoy, because if you don't, spending this much time on it will not be fun. Plus, 15 pages about something that you enjoy is not bad AT ALL.",
    "You have to take it. It's not bad, especially considering other senior essays. Pick something related to your research so you don't have to do a lot of extra work.",
    "This is the senior project requirement for all MB&B majors. I would suggest take the flexibility to really learn and explore a topic you're interested in.",
    "Well, you have to do it, so there's really no point flipping through these evaluations. Rest assured, it's not difficult at all, and you'll learn a fair amount about an interesting topic of your choice.",
    "If you are a MB&B, you need to take this course. It is part of major requirement. Yet, the topic of your research is not strictly related to biochemistry or biophysics. You can choose the topic of your interest",
    "A relatively relaxed and fun way to finish up your undergraduate career.",
    "This course is so broad, like the entire major, that you can pick something that you truly want to write about, which is great because it makes it easy to stay focused. It's required, so I would recommend it to anyone who wants the degree, but it is also one of the better senior projects at Yale, which should be encouraging.",
    "Take it, you sort of need to...",
    "I think it's a good idea to have a literature review as a capstone project for the major. A lot of people think the senior project needs to be oriented around our research, but I think writing literature reviews is an extremely valuable skill that we don't necessarily get a chance to hone during our undergraduate career. However, they need to make it more of a legit project that we and they actually care about. I know there are many ways to write reviews, especially across different fields and topics, but a few example papers with standardized styles and formats would be really helpful. I remember one student who told me they asked Yorgo Modis whether the paper should be more scientific and very technical OR more accessible to a general scientific community, and he said either way works. I am still not very sure what the project is supposed to be. Hopefully this is addressed in the future. Also, an updated set of instructions and guidelines that are all organized on classes v2, or sent out at the same time, would really help the organization of the class. We often found out about new information or resources throughout the semester, rather than getting it all at once at the beginning. Also, perhaps an organizational meeting or introduction to the project might be helpful the previous semester, so we can start thinking about what we want to write about, and so we can gauge the incoming workload so we can plan our schedules accordingly.",
    "You have to take it and it's a great class for senior year.",
    "Chill... Hopefully not too harsh on grading",
    "You may find it worthwhile to seek out an additional adviser for your thesis who specializes in the area you choose to write about.",
    "The MB&B \"senior thesis\" is literally a 15 page literature review (like a book report for grown-ups). Seriously, that's it. You write one paper. You never meet with a class or with professors, except for a ~5 minute consultation at the beginning of the semester to decide on a topic. You then turn in a draft, give a 10-15 minute presentation to a professor and a handful of other MB&B seniors, turn in the final draft and call it a day\/call it a major. Very chill. Perhaps the chillest of senior \"theses\" out there? Absolutely does not feel like a culmination of the intellectual journey you've taken at Yale, but is a ridiculously chill end to the major.Did I mention that this class is chill?",
    "My advice would be to start researching\/writing early (i.e. before and during spring break). It will make your April that much better. Overall though not too stressful and pretty laid back.",
    "You have to take this course as a MBB major. While it is a great idea to review a topic of choice, this course could be taught in a much better fashion. Professor Modis, in particular, provided absolutely no feedback throughout and was not that interested in the course. Moreover, everyone seemed to get the same feedback, receiving \"great start, add some figures\" for instance. I think this capstone course for four years of hard work can be taught in a much better and more interactive manner.",
    "Professor Konigsberg was an excellent advisor. He provided feedback on the essay that I needed and put me in the direction of faculty that could help with the details of my area of study. I really enjoyed the semester."
