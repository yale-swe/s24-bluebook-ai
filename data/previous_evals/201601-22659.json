   "comments": [
    "An involved hands-on leadership course designed for leaders from all disciplines -- not only EP&E and Poli-Sci majors (though you'll see a lot of those in the course). I definitely recommend to anyone seriously interested in hands-on learning who is passionate about foreign affairs and current events but be ready to deal with a lot of egos in one room and with some very conservative opinions.",
    "Hellish, but needs to be further integrated along lines of race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, gender, and perspective, so TAKE IT PLEASE. It will change, but slowly. Regardless of whether you want to work to change it from the inside or the outside, please do SOMETHING. And know that there are students in here fighting to make it better. GS is beginning to move in a different direction. It can afford participants some absolutely incredible opportunities it's important that those opportunities\/that privilege be equally dispersed. If you are willing\/have the physical and emotional energy to fight the good fight (many of us rightfully do not), take this course for the sake of the classes beneath you. You will indeed learn throughout the semester, but you will be infuriated as well. send this ish to some POC bc most of us don't even know this class exists. There's a summer stipend y'all. don't sleep.",
    "I would absolutely recommend GS to anyone interested in public policy or leadership in general.",
    "I think this is a great class - but it needs to be way more balanced in terms of grad\/undergrad students. It's disappointing to see that there are so few graduate students and means that we are constantly listening to how smart the undergrads are which they are -- but it would be nice to have a better level of discussion.",
    "Yes, would recommend. A great history seminar with contemporary applications. You'll learn a lot from your classmates, both knowledgeable and fun to discuss with. Seminar leaders are some of Yale's best faculty members, and speakers are great."
