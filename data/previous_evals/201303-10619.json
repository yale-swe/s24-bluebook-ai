    "class moves really fast, so not easiest language credit if that's what you're looking for; spent a lot of time studying for two weekly quizzes",
    "If you take this course, take it with Michael Zimm if possible. He makes the class. If you love Latin like I do, however, and like languages in general, then you should enjoy the class regardless of the instructor. Mainly drilling of grammatical concepts to reinforce understanding.",
    "Tough class, lots of memorization, but worth it.",
    "I would recommend it. It goes at a very fast pace, but with the right instructor it can be highly enjoyable. I suggest that you have Mike teach more of it, since he honestly is the reason that it was so great.",
    "Latin 110 01 is without a doubt a challenging course. The workload might seem overwhelming at times. However, the teacher is excellent and guides us through the difficulty very well. I would recommend this class to anyone who is truly interested and motivated to learn Latin."
