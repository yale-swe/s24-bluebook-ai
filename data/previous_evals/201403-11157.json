   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you have the background, this is an outstanding introduction to quantum mechanics, particularly if it is taken with Prof. Appelquist. You begin to appreciate the importance of symmetries in quantum mechanics, and are able to use a wide variety of mathematical tools (which you are expected to develop) to analyze a wide range of physical phenomena. Awesome experience.",
    "It is a solid course on quantum mechanics, more in-depth than the undergrad course obviously, but still accessible to undergrads (I'm a senior).",
    "A course covering the basic foundation of quantum mechanics, with emphasis on time evolution and the Schroedinger equation, and angular momentum. I would recommend it just because I find the subject intriguing.",
    "I would highly recommend Physics 508 to any students interested in physics. It does a great job of presenting quantum mechanics cogently, and does good justice to the math involved. I do think that a bit of background in representation theory and Lie groups makes for a few more \"aha\" moments than you would have otherwise, but certainly neither of them is a prerequisite. One perhaps obvious comment is that this course does not cover several of the introductory examples in much depth, so it shouldn't be taken if you have never taken any quantum mechanics before. Other than that, the class is wonderful, and Professor Appelquist is a phenomenal lecturer.",
    "I would definetely recommend this course for anyone interested into a more deeper understanding of quantum mechanics.",
    "PHYS 508 with Professor Appelquist is an excellent course. Professor Appelquist offers students an intuitive and abstract perspective on quantum mechanics and makes the course engaging and clear. For undergraduates, be cautioned that tests are much more difficult than homework and require a significant amount of preparation, including of material not directly covered by lectures or homework. I highly recommend PHYS 508.",
    "The formalism I learned from 508 helped me to solidify the meaning of quantum nature. I had taken 4 QM courses before. But this time I am more comfortable applying the knowledge to problems. Dirac formalism, Path integral formalism, Rotation generators feet great to know :)",
    "Quantum mechanics with emphasis on the theoretical justification for the mathematical representations used.",
    "Too slow and easy, but goes into much details of whatever is taught. Yes, but should try to pass-out if possible.",
    "This is a wonderful course to review nonrelativistic quantum mechanics."

   "comments": [
    "PHYS508 helped me appreciate more deeply the importance of group theory in quantum mechanics (and quantum field theory), as well as establishing a solid groundwork for further research at graduate school. It took all of my knowledge from undergraduate physics and turned it into something more concrete and usable.",
    "This course gave me an entirely new perspective on the abstract setting of quantum mechanics, and its connection to other areas of physics. I found it fascinating but challenging, and my experience in the class will help inform my decision on whether to pursue more theoretical physics research.",
    "508 knowledge is the basic building blocks for many contemporary scientific research, I think.",
    "Quantum Mechanics is arguably the most \"core course\" for physics, at least conceptual-wise. So it is important to have a deep grasp of the matieral. Also techniques such as WKB can be helpful even for research.",
    "The course enhanced my understanding of fundamental quantum mechanics was was extremely helpful in refining the tools necessary for quantum research."
