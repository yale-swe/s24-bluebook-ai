   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Everything was available.",
    "Mostly yes, it would be nice if there were a coursepacket as many times it was nearly impossible to coordinate reading with the library schedule or availability of a text on the reserve shelf.",
    "Not easy to access reading especially one need to go to library every week, it will be much nicer if we can get pdf version of readings.",
    "Disappointed that you can only check library books out for one day at a time. It makes writing a paper a terrible nuisance.",
    "I thought the library contained all the resources I found necessary for the class. I wish there wasn't a one-day limit for borrowing books, but at the same time it was understandable with everyone competing for the same books.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, they were.",
    "Yes.",
    "The library hour as well as the policy is very problematic. We have really tight class schedule during the day, but the library closes at 11pm everyday and on weekends it opens quite late. Only one book is allowed to be checked out. Therefore it is always very hard to get all the research done on time.",
    "My only complaint is in our weekly readings - it was often rather hard to access the resources we needed. I understand the value of going to the library and holding the actual book, but I think that our discussions in section suffered for it, because many people were not able to make the trip to view the material. I think having more of the readings available on the class server, or having multiple copies of books we needed that could circulate around the studio would have been more realistic and effective.",
    "Although the first year fall semester is so tiring, I felt that the format of two lectures and a discussion section a week was perfect for our work capabilities. I was upset that a lot of the other students began to see his early morning lectures as optional (constantly using the words \u0093I can sleep at home, or I can sleep in lecture\u0094), but I couldn\u0092t imagine this class being more demanding than it was. The research paper was very worthwhile and its open-ended format gave it the flexibility needed for students to get the most out of it.I think that there should have been more structure to week\/week format and an included reading list would have clarified a lot of confusion. For example: Weekly PDF\u0092s with brief synopses of the lecture and discussion topics and optional reading lists included would have allowed students to look into the weeks topics before lecture and possibly find outside material to bring to discussion. Similar to Eisenman\u0092s class, it would be helpful to scan and upload brief pdf readings to theonline class folder.Access to material is paramount to students. If something is on reserve in the library it will be overlooked. If it is on the server and printable for use whenever, it will be floating around study and more students will read it. I would have loved to read a variety of articles regarding architects we covered, but because it was presented to me I didn\u0092t engage with it as I should have. Of course there are books on every topic we covered in class in the library, but students are tired and focused on other things. I would strongly recommend the collection and posting of the best short articles available on the topics covered.",
    "We need to be able to check books out from the library for more than a day.",
    "There were times that the books put on reserve were not available. This was problematic when preparing for discussion section.",
    "I would suggest scanning and emailing or posting on the classes server any required readings rather than asking students to look at books on open reserve.Also making the lecture notes available on the server was invaluable for going back and looking up anything I might have missed.",
    "The library has a great collection, but the restrictions regarding checking out books are frustrating. Only being able to check out books for a day is essentially useless, because i generally needed a handful of texts for my research, and was unable to do any real research outside of the library (which in turn restricted the hours i could work on the paper).",
    "N\/A",
    "Yes, the reserve books were easily accessed.",
    "Very adequate",
    "Great.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, the resources were very adequate.",
    "I am sure everyone has already complained about the 1 day rule of library book check-out. While I share those concerns, It is nice to have a full library of students reading books that they might otherwise take home.",
    "They didn't hold much resources from east asian countries except for Japan. I had great difficulty finding materials of South Korean architecture during the research.",
    "Limited copies of library books made assignment reading difficult when an entire book was assigned. Lack of course reader was detrimental.",
    "Often, there were not enough copies of particular books on reserve to make it possible for every student to get a look at them before discussion session. Perhaps a reading packet for discussion section could be assembled in the future.",
    "An unfortunate amount of material seems to be floating and misplaced in the library system hindering research and access to reading materials.",
    "The resources available were sufficient - the only problem was the use of the library facilities. The policy of one book, one day made writing the term paper rather difficult."
