    "I enjoyed learning about museum activism and history. Our discussions with curators from various fields were fruitful.",
    "This class encouraged me to keep thinking critically about the museum as a long-standing institution in our society. I'd engaged with museums before in many different contexts, but this was the first class I've taken dedicated to museums.",
    "This class provided a goo overview of contemporary issues within the museum field. The first hand experience brought to us by guest speakers provided helpful case studies for many of these issues",
    "Useful discussions on museum politics and programming, learned about museums outside my field ie natural history, archaeology, etc.",
    "I gained valuable insight into the Yale system and how university museums function on a practical level."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class discussions were fine. The visits to museums were wonderful opportunities to fully engage with the subject matter.",
    "The guest speakers and field trips were incredible! Sometimes I wished there was more time for discussion, like in a classic seminar, since some of our most lively classes involved conversations and debates. The class is heavily geared toward art museums, which makes sense considering the professors' affiliations, but it's definitely something to note for those interested in other types of museums.",
    "I think a major strength of the course was the readings assigned and the class discussions. I believe that more class time should be devoted to these discussions. While I valued the guest speakers, the topics discussed did not always engage with that in the readings. There were times where I still had questions from the themes of the readings that were not addressed in the classroom. I also thought the expectations of the course assignments could have been clearer. I often felt the prompts were a bit too broad which made writing more difficult.",
    "Professors graded very tough without making it clear what they were looking for in assignments. They also seemed a bit unaware of the seriousness of the course discussions. For example, after a discussion on race and museums, some classmates seemed visibly upset with where the conversation had ended up at. The professors did not seem to notice this nor did they take the time to address those concerns or appropriately steer the conversation in a better direction. One professor ended the class with well that was fun, when people were obviously upset. These conversations need to be taken more seriously as students have real stakes in these topics and situations. A strength of the class was the selection of course readings and guest speakers, although I wish there was more discussion-based classes throughout this course.",
    "This course's greatest strengths are the - campus visits and use of Yale resources (incl. curators and professsors) - breadth of topics - its multiple perspectives (love that it is co-taught) - assignments were interactive It's greatest weaknesses were - there was lots of reading that was not directly related... or even discussed in class - the requirements for each assignment did not match grading. feedback on papers featured lots of \"we wish you would have done x\" even though x was not on the assignment description",
    "not a group final project. perhaps another group project, but it should not be the final project that is worth the most."

    "I would. It was interesting and a good place to start in museum studies.",

    "I would only recommend if a student did not have prior exposure to museum work. A good overview class.",
    "Yes I think this course is VITAL to keep around, because it is also has professional development built in. Anyone considering a continued career in humanities considering public institutions or education should consider this course",
