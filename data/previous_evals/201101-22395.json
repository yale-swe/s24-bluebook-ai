    "Yes! I took it with Anna which is a little less structured in learning the basics of drawing, but exposes you to a lot more like drawing with charcoal, conte, drawing in inks, and figure drawing from live models which was awesome. I think the semester went by too fast.",
    "Anna Betbeze's section is fun and not too difficult (depending on both how experienced you are and how much you want to put into the class). Most students improved a ton, and Anna is a kind, warm, and helpful person to work with.",
    "definitely a BASIC drawing course. but a pre req for the major. If you've never drawn before don't be intimidated, you wont be alone in the class. If youve had a lot of experience maybe think about taking a different section, or a higher level. Mostly you do still lives, fabric, negative space, figure drawing, spaces.",
    "It's an exploratory class where you will be forced to draw a lot and attempt many different ways of seeing, recording, and analyzing the world around you. It's sure to prompt improved drawing skills, but even more so, improved seeing skills.",
    "Basic Drawing is not all that basic. It's a great course, but a lot the people in it are taking it because they have to as part of the Art Major, so there's some real talent in the class. That being said, there were some complete beginners that had significantly improved by the end of the class. It's a bit of adrag because it's 2 hours long and twice a week, and lugging your portfolio, drawing pad and supplies all the way to the art building is a huge pain, but I found that once I was actually in class and drawing, it was an amazing period of time in which I forgot about everything else. Most of our classes were spent doing short, successive studies of different still lifes, and later in the semester, of nude figures. We also had 4 or so classes in the Art Gallery looking at different famous drawings; those were a little boring and tiring as we were standing on our feet for 2 hours straight listening to someone talk about different pieces of artwork. We generally had one homework assignment per week, which would take around 5 or so hours to complete (if done thoroughly - there were definitely times I did my homework very last minute and got away with it). Whenever we would have homework due, we did a group critique of it together but no actual grades were ever assigned. Our only grade came at the end of the semester, when we turned in our portfolio of everything we'd done throughout the class and Anna evaluated it in terms of improvement, etc. She's a pretty easy grader, I think most people got A-'s. Anna's really relaxed and cool, you should take it with her if you're looking for a laid back class but still want to get something out of it!",
    "Definitely recommend it!",
    "One or two projects due each week in class. The work is not stressful because it feels more like exercises meant to help you improve than finished works.",
    "take basic drawing with anna!! it takes up a good amount of time (almost 4 hours of class time a week and hw usually takes about 2 hrs per week) but it never felt like work to me and i took it as a 5th class. it's worth it because it's relaxing and fun.",
    "If you are looking for a class that will allow you to express yourself artistically while not taking up all of your life, take this course WITH ANNA! She understands that you have other courses at Yale, and so she pushes you in the classroom, but gives you a little more freedom outside of the classroom-- (but you end up spending time on your homework, because you don't want to disappoint Anna, the TA, and the rest of your classmates). Definitely take this course before you graduate WITH ANNA!",
    "Yes! Take it with Professor Betbeze!",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and I felt that my drawing skills really improved. We were supposed to have about 2-3 hours of work each week, but sometimes to me it felt like a little more. At the same time, the class was manageable, Anna was GREAT, and I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the visual arts. It was a great intro to arts at Yale! We drew the figure at the end of the class, which none of the other ART114 classes do."
