    "The course works well as a stand alone course, although being comfortable with basic statistics would be necessary to enjoy it. It offers a new way to look at problems, although is probably less fundamental than some other classes the stats department offers (eg linear modelling).",

    "If he\/she wants to learn about information theory, this course is definitely recommended.",
