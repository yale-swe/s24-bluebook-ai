   "comments": [
    "Excellent. This course should really have a larger role in the curriculum-- I think that it should be one of the first courses we have to take. I am in HMP and we were required to take Health Law second year semester 1 and it would have helped immensely to understand the US's health systems. Additionally, for other international students, it really helps to understand the US health care system in this depth before taking other classes. I learned a lot of information and facts which cannot be gained in Mark Sleisinger's class, so I would recommend this class over that one.",
    "Strengths: debate was a fun way to engage in the policy reform debate, library taught us how to do legal research and the paper that accompanied was a different type of research than I am used to, I am working on the final now and I find it challenging but appreciate this challenge because I am learning a lot.Weaknesses: It would have been nice to go a bit more in depth into the fundamentals of policy-making",
    "Course material should be covered in book chapters, and less by what is discussed in class: lecture slides are sometimes unclear and difficult to follow, this material is sometimes not covered in the assigned readings or book chapters and you're just lost.",
    "This was, hands down, my favorite class since I started here this fall. I learned an incredible amount and loved going to every since class. I would take it again if I could.",
    "All Strengths..... THE BEST CLASS IN EPH. WITH OUT A DOUBT.",
    "This has been my favorite course by far. I think that it should be required for everyone in the program, very valuable information for all health professionals.",
    "have the readings be more integrated into the lecture so that people are actually motivated to do them.*********THIS CLASS SHOULD BE THE MANDATORY POLICY CLASS--IT IS MUCH MORE PRACTICAL AND LESS THEORETICAL!!!!!!****",
    "Strengths: Professional expertise is certainly obvious on the part of Dr. Forman. Lectures are too the point and informative while also providing worthwhile real world commentary and comparisons.Weaknesses: The class is a bit big for effective discussion but this is not a huge weakness as the class is not discussion based!",
    "AMAZING. Best EPH class. Where we actually LEARN something, and learn to think critically instead of the usual \"hooray, every deserves health care, poor people and minorities are mistreated\" idealistic blabla that is totally irrelevant to actually getting things done in the real world.",
    "Great instructor.I understand Health Care Delivery and Finance!!",
    "Great course, really a good overview of health delivery&financegreat time to be taking the course with the health bill passing congress; dr forman made sure to take time to address this as well answer any questionsi really enjoyed the lecture from the professor from a local college (was it wesleyan?)",
    "Very useful and practical information",
    "This was the best course I took at YSPH. I believe it gave me a great financial overview of the US healthcare system and provide us with an incredible amount of information.",
    "Great class, not only for learning some of the basic economic principles important to healthcare, but also the political and policy issues as well. Strengths include great lectures, light work level, and interesting material. Can't really think of any weaknesses.",
    "This course was very comprehensive and interesting. The assignments and exams were appropriate, and the readings were all current.",
    "The course provided a well planned summary of the US Healthcare system.",
    "Excellent!",
    "Wonderful class! I really enjoy that the class focused on lectures over reading.",
    "The course was an excellent over view of the current health policy. The material is taught in an interesting and enthusiastic manner.",
    "Outstanding course. The best course I've taken at YSPH. Of value to students in any division of study, this class serves as an extremely valuable background, especially, for those studying health care policy. In fact, I almost think this is the most valuable class for the policy students - to understand the financial structures underlying the healthcare system. Well-instructed and comprehensive. A pleasure.",
    "Excellent. Howie made the material interesting and engaging. I learned a lot and thought this course was very useful.",
    "Good. Fantastic consistency and continuity."

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0The instructor is good-hearted and passionate about what she does and is also very enthusiastic in the classroom. I feel that she might have come off as a bit inexperienced but I'm sure with more practice teaching she will refine her style. Overall, enjoyed her. Might even be good to have her teach a course that is more specific to her research, i.e. government health systems",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0My favorite professor at Yale. Extremely intelligent, knows the subject like the back of his hand, and an immensely sweet person.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is an amazing professor.

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Fantastic. Very knowledgeable, approachable, and, yes, funny. Makes lectures enjoyable to attend.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0I thought that Dr. Forman was an excellent professor who was able to really draw from his unique professional experiences in the areas of health policy, management, and medicine to illustrate a very encompassing picture of the past, current, and future states of the national healthcare economy. The course material was incredibly practical to anyone entering a career in public health, although anyone would benefit from this course. I would not change anything about the course layout or teaching methods, I thought that it was top notch as is.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie presents both facts and opinions, but he clearly makes the distinction between the two. He does not pressure students to adhere to his ways of thinking, but allows open discussion. He is very intelligent and supports his lectures with anecdotes from his work experience.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Very helpful, engaging and cordial.",

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Excellent instructor and lecturer. I really appreciated his openness to answering questions during lecture.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Dr. Forman is fantastic- presents so many differing views of the healthcare landscape.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Usually great at conveying information in front of the class (not in person), although his cockiness gets tiresome (I'm tired of hearing about how much money he makes). Also office hours should ***NOT*** be held in the ER. This is a terrible setting chalk full of interruptions from every corner."

    "Jeremy Green really knows the material, but is a very unenthusiastic lecturer.",
    "Rachael was great, she should have had a greater role. Jeremy was very helpful except he is not great at leading review sessions because he just reads the questions on the slides and does not answer them properly. Also he always says he's an economist and therefore does not know anything about medicare\/ health care \/ other stuff, but really if he is a TA he should know the stuff we are expected to know (or at least pretend to know). But overall, both were very helpful and responsive.",

    "Excellent, I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't taken it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to all students, but as a second year policy student it is pretty repetitive. However, it does a much better job of looking at system as a whole than the required policy class (510) and worked well as a capstone-type course.",

    "This is a great class that really everyone should take. I came in with no econ background whatsoever, and was initially worried that I would be lost in the material. Not the case. Dr. Forman does a great job of breaking down the essentials, while providing fascinating anecdotes and great insights into our healthcare system. The course covers everything from basic econ to policyand politics. Lectures are enjoyable and entertaining, the workload is light, and the papers and exams are not difficult. I strongly recommend taking this course!",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a broad overview of the financing of health care in the US.",
    "Great",
    "Yes! Take this course!",
    "This class is wonderful and I am so glad that I took this to fill my policy requirement as opposed to the class in the fall. Howie is a treat to listen to and I really looked forward to this class every week.",
    "Great class, outstanding. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Well taught and organized course that gives a broad overview of health care financing and delivery.",
    "Good overall. Would recommend."
