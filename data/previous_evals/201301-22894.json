    "Math& Philosophy majors should definitely take this course, as it's information that you should know. If you haven't taken set theory and a higher-level logic course, probably don't take it, as even someone with that background will have a hard time following some of the proofs. The professor is clear and will help you understand things, but he's a bit dry. It won't be the most exciting course you'll take, and it does need some restructuring, but M&P majors will want to know what's taught here.",
    "Whittle is a decent lecturer -- organized, to-the-point, and clear -- a rarity in the philosophy department. That said, discussion did tend to suffer a bit simply because the material was so dense\/technical. Workload very reasonable.",
    "Highly recommended for students with a decent background in logic who want to learn more about diverse topics in philosophy of math.",
    "A challenging and technical survey of a variety of ideas in the philosophy of maths. Even with a strong background in math& in logic (for an undergraduate, at least), I found that some of the papers went over my head. Prof. Whittle is awkward, and the class was sometimes awkward, but he is very effective at crystallizing the main points of each week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paper into understandable arguments. This means that the course is weirdly skewed towards being a lecture, and the large course size early on didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help with that. Frankly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that the lecture-y style is too bad, although it is confusing that 30% of your grade is based on participation when discussion is sort of secondary. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in the material, then you should take it\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand some of the papers, then that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a huge problem\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you should be aware that it will be challenging. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take it on a whim, and avoid it if you lack background in logic.",
    "Good course overall. Notice that the course title is \"Topics in Philosophy of Math.\" If you are looking for a comprehensive introductory course, look elsewhere.",
    "A compelling but difficult course, Philosophy of Math is only for those really interested in the subject. That said, for interested students, it's a valuable course."
