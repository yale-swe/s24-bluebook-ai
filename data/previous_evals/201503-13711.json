    "Only if you really need another class or are interested in Ancient Egypt.",
    "This course evaluates the Amarna period in Egypt's history, and it places a particular emphasis on the role that the pharaoh Akhenaton plays. The workload is reasonable (2 papers, 2 exams, and a few short quizzes), and every assignment is designed in a way to improve your understanding of the material. While nothing in this course was \"easy,\" per se, I wouldn't consider it to be a particularly difficult class either. If you have any interest in history or archaeology, this is a wonderful course to take.",
    "Rejoice in the Aton! I very much enjoyed this class. It is not much work and I really like Dr. Darnell's teaching style. The biggest problem with the class is it is at 9am but it's not terrible. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. If you have any interest whatsoever in Egypt, TAKE THIS COURSE. If you have no interest whatsoever in Egypt, TAKE THIS COURSE. The workload is light, the material fascinating, the lectures a joy. Yes, it's nine AM, but suck it up. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "PRAISE THE ATEN!!!!!! Grovel seven times in honor of his eminence, Re Horaktry, who rejoices in the horizon in the name of light, shu!! On Monday morning at 9:00 am, as you open your drapes, look toward the Eastern horizon. Have you ever wondering what magic might be contained in its ephemeral glory? Have you ever wondered how the Suns rays manifest themselves on Earth? These are the secrets of the Ancient Egyptians that you will only discover upon taking Age of Akhenaton. John Darnell, in his perfectly plaited, doubled breasted, thrift store purchased pant suit will open your eyes to a subject you thought died off with Harrison Ford's acting career! You'll walk into class and think you've entered a time machine, transported back eighty years to an era, now seemingly forgotten, when monocles and wristwatches were as important to a man as his haberdasher's birthday. Who was the mysterious figure of Semenkhare; Akhenaton's successor, his lover, his daughter, or maybe even ALL THREE? Who was Shupiliuliuma? King of Gobbledegook? Or the man who ushered humanity out of the oppressive shackles binding us to the backwards Bronze Age? Don't be a Horemhab or a Heqanefer! Take this course and you will feel like a pharaoh celebrating your 30 year jubilee. The processional roads of Akhet-Aton will open themselves up to you, and the answers to all life's greatest questions will be answered as you trudge along such a path! Some might ask \"what is The Age of Akhenaton?\" The answer is approximately 3,456, depending on whether you believe in co regency theories or not. But the answer is also that The Age of Akhenaton is probably the best course offered at this school, and only a philandering Nooooobian would pass up the opportunity of a lifetime to take it. Some might ask what happens to someone who chooses to foolishly not take this course. The answer is that the Nile will flood your home ever rainy season from now until posterity. The Apis bull will pile drive its horns through your heart and the opening of the mouth ceremony will suck your soul straight into the afterlife. You will forever be stuck in cyclical nehet time, unable to move with the forward march of progress. The Hittites will kidnap your family and sever them, limb by limb, with Naue II blades. You will lose your sovereignty, your family, and your dignity at the hands of the ravaging Abiru, like Rib-addi of Byblos! And Akhenaton himself will emerge from the primeval swamp and smite you with the crested blade of Nefertiti's royal crown, humiliatingly revealing all of your human inadequacies. Take Age of Akhenaton!",
    "The class itself is a little long, but its an absolute blast. Take it.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Ancient Egypt. There is nothign for you here if you are not, as it is an extremely niche subject (focusing on a single king's reign for most of the course!). Keep up with readings; there aren't a lot but it is just easier if you do.",
    "Oh absolutely take this course",
    "Age of Akhenaton is an excellent and unique course. It is one of my favorites to talk about. Professor Darnell is a fantastic lecturer and wants you to engage with the material. He is professional, and he makes Egyptology accessible and interesting. There is a lot of assigned reading, though much of it is unaccounted for -- still, you should try to do as much of it as possible, as Darnell handpicked much of it for good reason. Overall, the class was a great opportunity to learn about something I had never touched before.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class; through the specific foil of Akhenaten, it presents a great deal of depth about the entirety of Egyptian thought."
