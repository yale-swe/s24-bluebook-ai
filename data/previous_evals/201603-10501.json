   "comments": [
    "Getting hands-on experience via directed research credit helps to get a better handle on academic topics and be more engaged with how they can be applied.",
    "I learned a great deal about how qualitative research is conducted and",
    "Directed Research in Cognitive Science was a tremendous opportunity and I feel very grateful to have participated in it. I developed in-depth knowledge about the actual content of my research, which pertained to people's ordinary conceptions of \"normality\" and how those conceptions differ from what they believe to be statistically average. I also learned a lot about the process and methods involved in conducting research in cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology. In terms of skills, I learned very concretely how to conceive of, design, execute, and analyze a study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. On a more abstract level, I learned how to think about making progress in a field like cognitive science and the kind of contributions to discussions about research that are most helpful.",
    "I'm going to answer these generally about the program instead of my specific research. The Directed Research program adds formal structure (and course credit!) to several research projects that Cog Sci students may be interested in conducting. I used it to force myself to finish the research for my senior thesis, but it can be done for just about any research topic, given that a faculty advisor has enough interest in it. The \"course' is pretty free-form, and you have a lot of freedom in deciding, with your course advisor, what form the directed research should take--and what assignments are required. My research requirements were broken down into the following groups: (1) bi-weekly group meetings; (2) regular research checks, either through survey design, analysis, or background research; and (3) a final report and presentation at the end of the semester. If you're interested in conducting research, Directed Research is literally designed to make it easy for you. And despite the free-form nature of the \"course,\" I did end up learning more about study design, practical analytic skills, and statistics than I ever did in a formal class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is great to have the opportunity to conduct your own research into a topic that you chose personally. Of course, in this sort of class you get out what you put in, so a lot of the strengths and weaknesses are linked to your own approach\/advisor(s)\/topic\/research choices. I think that ultimately this freedom and independence is a good thing, especially if you have a good advisor. I would have benefitted from a little more guidance at the beginning of the semester about how to divide my project into concrete steps.",
    "No weaknesses at all! Strengths were ability to choose my own studies according to my interests, building a great relationship with a fabulous professor, and learning a great deal about qualitative research and studies in organizational behavior, my theme of focus for cognitive science. This course could be improved by more directly making it accessible to students through making the opportunity to connect with professors easier and more defined. Perhaps a page where every professor interested in student research assistants can post on a single webpage, integrated with every major of study at Yale?",
    "I really appreciated the flexibility that Directed Research in Cognitive Science affords its students. I had a very productive semester working in the Arnsten Lab, and I plan to continue there in the spring!",
    "The greatest strength of Directed Research in Cognitive Science was that it exposed me so deeply to the world of research and what is going on in modern cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology. I think a large part of the reason why my experience was so overwhelmingly positive was because of the particular professor and graduate student with whom I was working, both of whom became mentors and were always happy to answer my questions and teach me statistical concepts I had not yet learned.",
    "Again, I'm answering generally for other students. The main strength is the freedom: it's a Pass\/Fail course credit that gives you the structure and accountability to really get some research done. It's not meant to be challenging to accomplish. As long as you're actually interested in the research you're doing, you will learn enough to make Directed Research worth it. The weakness of it, however, might be the freedom as well. If you don't have the drive to structure a research project in a way that you can follow through with, it may end up feeling like an absolute waste of time. Make sure to talk extensively with your research advisor and Joshua Knobe before finalizing the application so you can make sure it's the right fit for you."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend Directed Research, especially within the context of the CogSci major, but be warned that a lot of the organization and direction of your semester will be up to you. Stay on top of this and you will feel happier and more productive.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend that every student takes an independent research course at least once in their time at Yale. It is perhaps one of the most academically and intellectually rewarding experiences I have had, and I have been able to connect with a faculty mentor who has guided me in new directions for my academic career.er",
    "The cog sci major gives you a ton of flexibility with these directed research courses. If you can find a good lab and a good project, then they're a lot of fun.",
    "Absolutely! As long as you have a topic you are passionate about and a professor with whom you are excited to work, this course is a fantastic choice."
