   "comments": [
    "This course is really great regardless of whether you've read a million sci fi books or none at all. The syllabus is laid out so that you can see the influences of previous works in the next work you read, so you don't need any previous knowledge of the genre. You are given a tremendous amount of freedom in your papers to explore what truly interests you about the course. Also, unlike most English junior seminars, the class attracts students from a variety of majors which adds to the quality of discussion. Finally, Professor Grimstad is passionate about the topic and obviously cares about both the subject and his students. Furthermore, you are given a tremendous amount of freedom in your papers to explore what truly interests you about the course. I would recommend it.",
    "We read some cool science fiction, but I'm not sure I enjoyed the class enough to justify the copious reading of stuff that wasn't cool science fiction. There was a lot of reading to do, and I didn't really think our class discussions focused enough on the interesting facets of the works. And when we finally caught on to something interesting, we would always have to move on to other things so we could cram all those books into the syllabus. I would take it, though, if you want an excuse to discover two or three works of pretty darn cool sci fi.",
    "A very interesting course for anyone at all interested in literature or science and the ways the human mind grapples with knowledge and information.",
    "YES. Science and Fiction: not your typical SCI-FI class, to be sure, which is why it has the (AND) in the middle of the two words. you don't read what is popularly known as Sci-Fi until the last few weeks of class, but you get a great build up. You get Frankenstein, you get Darwin, and Turing, and Fukuyama. It is really about the twisted relationship that has developed between sciences and literature.And Paul Grimstad is a really cool guy. Great professor. Will keep you engaged because it is obvious that he cares about the material and wants to get to the heart of it.",
    "Sweet class. The reading lists includes the out-there and the essential, and discussion can get pretty crazy. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who's into scifi or wants to be.",
    "Yes, if you love science fiction.",
    "This is a course on both the science fiction genre and the tensions and connections between science and fiction. I would definitely recommend this course. You get to read and talk about classic science fiction for credit. There's a fair amount of reading, but not too much other work, and the class discussions can be really interesting and fun.",
    "Science (and) Fiction is an interdisciplinary look at science, the humanities, fiction, consciousness, human nature, and knowledge in general -- a humble pursuit, to be sure. It was a large seminar this year, which made discussions less interactive than could be desired, but the reading list was outstanding and Professor Grimstad is an excitable and fun professor.",
    "Yes, I liked the course a lot. I was expecting it to be more about philosophy and less about English, but that was probably just wishful thinking on my part. The readings were (for the most part) fun and Professor Grimstad is a good seminar leader.",
    "I very much enjoyed the course, though the reading was often so heavy that I sadly could not keep up with it. The reading, however, was fascinating and Grimstad was a terrific professor for the most part. Granted, Grimstad's style of teaching isn't for everyone: he has a tendency to dominate class conversations rather than let them progress more fluidly. However, I loved this - he was always VERY excited about what we were discussing, and that enthusiasm was contagious",
    "Science (and) Fiction gave a slightly scattered but immensely enjoyable look at how science and narrative work together in society and in literature. Part intellectual history, part fan club, it's a great course for anyone interested in Sci Fi or, as I was, in considering how literary and scientific sensibilities relate to each other. Definitely consider it if it's offered again."
