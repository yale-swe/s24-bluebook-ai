    "I'd recommend for a not-too-difficult CS course that is still pretty interesting. We talked a lot about machine learning algorithms, so if you're interested in that, this is a good course.",
    "CPSC 476 is an interesting grab bag of topics associated with computer vision. Since computer vision is an ongoing area of research, there's a lot of cutting edge topics presented in the class. I found the topics a hit or miss, though, some of the lectures were really cool but others were less captivating. The class is small, with around 10-12 students, so there's potential to get to know Professor Zucker. Prof. Zucker is also great, and definitely stop in to chat about your problems in life, he'll probably have some sage advice. Keep in mind that he is very busy though! Take CPSC 476 if you found CPSC 475 really interesting, but shy away from it if you had mixed feelings about CPSC 475. Recommend highly that you take CPSC 475 first though, as there are recurring themes and I would have felt lost without it. Also the class is definitely better if you have had linear algebra and calculus experience. But if you're looking for CS electives, there are definitely better electives out there. Generally low amount of work, but the work will undoubtedly be backloaded so expect a busy end of semester. 5 hw assignments and 1 final project, but semesters vary depending on what the students want.",
    "NO NO NO, run away don't take this class. Most classes are either easy and you learn a little or hard and you learn a lot, this class is very hard and you learn nothing. Prerequisites should include complex analysis, differential equations, and differential geometry. The professor and his grad students ramble about their topics with little direction causally using, jakobians Lagrangians without explaining what they are or how they are used. Lecture oscillates between blindly obvious generalities about biological vision and ludicrously difficult mathematical examinations with conflicting notation, no examples, and no textbook to save you if you didn't understand it the first time. This is a trap class there is not work for the first month, and half of the work ( 2 psets, final project, and final exam) is assigned the last week of class. If you took the previous course this is even worse. Ever-thing I learned about the topic was from Wikipedia looking up concepts after the professors bungled lecture left me more confused than I started.",
    "I found the material utterly fascinating. I enjoyed the 'aha' moments that happened when very diverse topics came together, such as when the differential geometry and game theory came together with game theory to provide a theory of perception. Sometimes, however, the topics were somewhat scattered, so perhaps the curriculum might be a little better-ordered. I would recommend taking part 1 of the sequence first, though I did not take it and still did well. Professor Zucker was an engaged lecturer, and he was clearly passionate about the material. I enjoyed the conversations that we had before and after class. Sometimes, though, the lectures were a bit too fast and the notation could be confusing. For the most part, the workload is reasonable, until the end. At the end, having two problem sets and a final in the last two weeks was a bit of a strain. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the intersection of machine learning and neurobiology."
