   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend anthropology to any student interest in oil, energy, global politics, indigenous motivation, or just looking for exposure to a very valuable way of thinking.",
    "This course covers a huge range of topics related to oil. Discussions and readings are engaging, and you'll get a lot out of doing the work and participating in class. Very relevant to things in the news and understanding history.",
    "Culture, Power, Oil is a deep look into the role oil plays in the world today, on a social, cultural, and political level. Assuming that most students in the class begin the semester with a superficial understanding of the resource curse or of oil as 'black gold,' Rogers spends the first few weeks deconstructing these myths and then helping students recreate a much more nuanced, thorough understanding of the subject. Although it is an anthropology senior seminar, Professor Rogers does a great job ensuring that students without a background in anthropology still feel comfortable with the material and the classroom discussions. Enthusiastic and passionate about the subject, Professor Rogers makes the class challenging, but accessible and very enjoyable.",
    "Take it if you can! It's a unique and complex look at issues that are often glossed over in media and popular academia for easy, black-and-white answers, or otherwise split along political ideological lines. There's a lot of reading, as with any seminar, and some of it is quite dry, but it's overall extremely rewarding and engaging. Professor Rogers is delightful.",
    "An attempt to complicate and add texture to standard accounts of how the advent of oil drilling impacts communities, governments, economies and other aspects of life. Most of the reading is ethnography - that means a decent amount of anthropology-speak - and the class is almost exclusively discussion of the readings.",
    "Yes if you are in the major or are very interested in oil",
    "Great course, sometimes can get a little theoretical, but overall very interesting with interesting discussions and readings.",
    "ANTH 438 is a great course if you are interested in the dynamics of oil on a broader scale. Oil plays a very important part in culture and power dynamics at different levels within society, if you would like to learn more about how this resource is thought about and expanding your traditional thought process, this is a great course. Some of the readings are dense, so it is necessary to be prepared for that. You will read texts in different disciplines such as political science, economics, anthropology and sociology. This will all provide you with a toolkit through which to view oil and think about its place in societies today. Highly recommendable course.",
    "Overall a phenomenal class, mostly because of Professor Rogers, who with is challenging yet patient and kind (not to mention brilliant), and one of the best professors I've had at Yale. I came out of this class thinking differently about much of the way we order the world in our thinking. A bit of a strange class in that it's demanding and mostly seniors but includes relatively few anthropology majors, so becomes kind of an advanced introduction to anthropological theory and method. This can occasionally make it feel like there's a disconnect between the readings and what most people in the class are thinking, but Professor Rogers is so articulate and thoughtful that he usually solved this handily.",
    "If you are interested in oil, you should definitely consider this seminar. Most students in the course are not anthro majors- our class had only 2 anthro students and several grad students. There is generally a considerable amount of reading each week, a midterm paper, and a 16\/18 final page paper. But Professor Rogers is very straight forward about what you're getting yourself into. The readings are generally pretty interesting and diverse, but I did find myself getting kind of tired with the topic after a whole semester. Professor Rogers is great and super helpful in directing you with paper topics. He leads discussion well and you definitely have to come to class prepared to discuss the material. My main complaint was the high number of students - at 20 it was just too much. I think the class would be considerably improved if the max were 16 students.",
    "Take this course. The anthro theory can be a little difficult to grasp if you aren't a major, but the subject matter is fascinating and very readable, and Professor Rogers and your classmates will make the 9:25 AM start worth your time."
