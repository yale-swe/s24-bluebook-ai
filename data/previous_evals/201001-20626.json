   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this class to anyone in Computer Science or related fields. I suspect that this course is helpful in creating future robotics graduate students.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course as an additional course to extend the curriculum of any computer science student.",
    "I would recommend this course highly - it is an excellent grounding in applied AI, with some hardware background mixed in as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, it is one of the best classes offered in the CS department. The course is about design of robot control systems with topics including biology, AI, and engineering.",
    "A good class that involves good lectures on current AI.",
    "For anyone interested in learning about robotics, it is a clear must-take course.",
    "This is a great introduction to robotics. There is a lot of overlap with Professor Scassellati's \"Artificial Intelligence\" course, which may be good for your understanding but makes a few classes toward the second half of the semester repetitive. This requires a fairly substantial final project, but there are very few other assignments (two problem sets, one midterm) so the workload during the semester is fairly light. If you're interested in programming intelligent robots (as opposed to building human-controlled robotic systems) this is a good starting point for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students."

    "This course was great for me since it was my first course in Robotics and provided me with a good introduction to a very interesting field in computer science.",
    "I am using the robotic control information in my research already.",
    "It helps me understand what is currently out there for robotics.",
    "My research interests lie elsewhere, but it was still a fun course to take.",
    "I now have a much deeper and broader knowledge of robotics topics. This will directly influence my thesis work."
