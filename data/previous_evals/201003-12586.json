    "I think this course deals with a bigger range of cultures than any other history, art history, or other course at Yale. We have too little time for each of the cultures, which are all represented by usually one building\/architect. Not really sure if it's a good way to have a survey course of a bunch of case studies. Prof Sherer sounds fascinating for the first several times, and loses the novelty if you listen to more than like 3 or 4 lectures. Our TA Emma was definitely adorable and extremely nice.",
    "Lectures are insane. You have no idea what's going on half the time, but the workload is easy. Reading response once a week, and 2 papers. That's it. But if you're looking for a classic History of Architecture class, this is not it. It's theory and analysis mostly, and I felt that a lot of the professor's points were wasted on us because we were missing the context of the class.",
    "Ugh. Could not stand to sit through these lofty, flamboyant, bad-foreign-language-accent-using lectures. This class managed to make me hate a subject that I'm legitimately interested in. Take it only if you have to for the architecture major.",
    "Arch260 is a tough course, with lots of readings. However, if you like history and a little bit of architecture, and have no problems with readings, you will love this course.",
    "More toned down survey course, goes over the major buildings through history (Pantheon, Taj Mahal, etc.)",
    "DON'T TAKE IT. Unless you're required too. Which a lot of people are now. Sorry. It's really bad. Professor Sherer is arrogant andfrequently hard to understand, and the course is not a survey in the slightest. The readings are not fun and neither are lectures.",
    "This is a relatively new course with lots of issues to be worked out. Lectures don't incorporate images, Professor Sherer's speaking style is very difficult to understand, and the course is structured such that you are never held responsible for the material covered in class. If these things don't change I would recommend not looking into this class. I don't feel as though I've learned much at all.",
    "A very broad survey of architecture ancient to the baroque, using 1-2 buildings to summarize each movement.I would recommend the class to architecture and non architecture students alike. It is important information for everyone to have.",
    "Yes, of course. But I can't imagine why someone who isn't an architecture major or doesn't intend on being one would care to take this class anyway. If big old buildings aren't appealing to you, steer clear.",
    "Hopefully they will choose another person to teach the class next year.",
    "Only take it if you like the topics or have to for the major",
    "This course could be great.I like the idea of making the survey course more in-depth, but in this first incarnation of ARCH 260, specificity was attempted at the loss of true understanding.I walked away being able to talk about a few historical sites, but with little understanding of context. 10 or 15 minutes spent at the beginning of each lecture to give fundamental facts about a city, building, or architectural movement would have been helpful.There should at least be a course book that provides context. The required readings were usually very specific, and often poorly written. It was difficult to discern the writers' biases without any prior knowledge.",
    "Still a very new class. Needs better structure and more time before I recommend taking it.",
    "The lectures in this class were somewhat of a waste of time as I never really learned anything about architectural history. However, the short mid-term essay and longer final paper were extremely rewarding with regards to doing a self study on a specific topic in architectural history.",
    "No, do not take this class unless you have to. And if you have to it's because you are an architecture major. And if you are an architecture major, STOP READING THIS RIGHT NOW AND GO COMPLAIN TO BIMAL ABOUT HOW AWFUL THIS COURSE IS, STOP READING! GO NOW!",
    "I think it is an interesting course. Many people didn't like the course because they only attended half the lectures or came late to the lecture thus missing the framework of the building being discussed. If you read and look up the buildings being discussed before class the lecture is really interesting and informative!",
    "This course is very interesting and offers a unique way of studying architecture. this is not a survey course, if that is what you are expecting.",
    "This class was not what I expected - what I wanted (and I think, needed) was a survey course to give me a general understanding of early architecture. However, the course was based on a series of case studies - every lecture was about only one building. While I feel like I now have a lot of knowledge about these individual buildings, I think I still don't have a larger historical or stylistic context in which to place them. I would recommend this course if you already have general historical knowledge related to architecture or are interested in examining architecture as individual artwork. However, don't expect to be taught \"architecture history.\" I think I still need to read more in order to understand what we went over this semester.",
    "This course does provide a general survey of major themes in the history of architecture, and Professor Sherer's narrative approach is often very compelling. That said, his enthusiasm for story often got in the way of communicating straight-forward, seemingly boring facts like dates and names.If you can, definitely choose the section offered by TA Emma Bloomfield. Her enthusiasm for the subject is infectious, and she used section to provide much needed context to the week's lectures.",
    "No.please.save yourself.",
    "Do NOT take this course if Prof. Sherer is teaching it. I have not had a worse experience with a professor at Yale--an ability to render information I really wanted completely inaccessible. He used unnecessarily complex language, assumed we knew tons of things despite it being an intro survey, barely used images to teach, and lectured with no structure at all. I so discouraged after the second week that I became completely disengaged from the material and ended up learning close to nothing--and no exams meant I was never even forced to learn factual things. A really terrible experience.",
    "YES.",
    "I would not recommend it. You learn a little bit about a handful of buildings. Not appropriate for a student who wants to gain a basic understanding of architecture from antiquity to the Baroque.",
    "This was an attempt at \"glimpses of certain societies as viewed through architecture.\" If you have a strong background in all of architecture and all of history already, this class would probably be very interesting. I don't think that he was making stuff up, just that most people in the class didn't get why he brought it up, most of the time.",
    "Shop it and see if you can make sense of it. Don't expect to learn much but it's not a lot of work so that's something.",
    "Shop this course and see if it has improved, because as it was taught in Fall 2010, it was the worst class I've taken at Yale. The language is impossible to decipher, the readings are exceptionally dull (not the subject matters fault!) and you will not get a comprehensive overview of architecture history. You will become familiar with some landmarks, which is nice, and when the professor is less interested in the subject matter, the lectures are actually better because there are less tangents. It had really great potential, so I want to give it a chance to come into its own, but as I experienced it, the whole class was like some painful, long joke.",
    "This is a totally useless class. It is supposed to be a summary of architecture, but it is just a bunch of random, disjointed reflections on a handful of buildings from Asia and Europe. It's watered-down and poorly planned.",
    "Not what you expect from a survey course. Emphasizes theory over practical\/concrete examples. Long, meandering narratives and anecdotes have little value in the greater context of each lecture. Dan Sherer seems knowledgeable, but often focuses on slides of paintings and sculptures rather than the architecture itself. He'll also say a lot of things in foreign languages without making it clear what you're supposed to get from all of it. You'll leave lecture wondering what exactly you learned that day. Sometimes the lectures are interesting and the TAs are generally very good, but this class needs to be fine-tuned in order to be more valuable in the architectural curriculum.",
    "Arch. 260 is an introductory course on the history of Arch. However, this is not a course where you will be memorizing monuments. Professor Sherer bombards you with tons of information that at times is impossible to grasp. Trying to follow his lecture, while interesting, is rather difficult. However, the workload isn\u0092t too bad, and both papers are written on topics of your choice.",
    "The lectures were disorganized, and the readings were uninteresting sometimes. Take it if you have to.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it wholeheartedly. The work load is very manageable and Professor Shererworks hard to select readings that are concise and appropriate. I've been in courses where Professors assign an entire chapter of Vitruvius, for example, when they really only want to focus on a few paragraphs on theatre architecture. Professor Sherer only assigns the readings on theatre architecture.My advice would be to enjoy the ride Professor Sherer takes his students on. Sometimes it's not readily apparent why one lesson focuses on one particular topic - in the sense that it may not fit readily into an over-arching and obvious course theme - and that is okay. That is not to say that he is disorganized or unprepared. Rather, he is more concerned about exposing students to wonderful and sometimes little-known or under-studied pieces of architecture that may not fit nicely or neatly into a packaged thematic narrative than producing or forcing the construction of a thematic narrative that may not actually exist. In other words, he has carefully selected instances when what you study one week may not entirely relate to what you learned the previous week or will learn the ensuing week. Rather than invent a thematic connection, he explains the importances of these building's or works of art as they stand within their own contexts."
