    "You know if you have to take it. Go do some research.",
    "The physics senior project is pretty good. The requirements are not bad as long as you find an adviser and do some work.",
    "It's not optional, so take it.",
    "It's research for credit. I would definitely recommend it, but note that your experience will be largely dependent upon your adviser.",
    "This class is what you make of it. Personally I found it very fulfilling, but this was because I chose the project I wanted to work on and was able to find an advisor and put it into action, which was very exciting.",
    "It's research. Find a good advisor. If you don't, switch - Prof. Werner helped me do that at the beginning of last semester and was super helpful and nice with that.",
    "As an independent research course, it's really what you make of it. You're responsible for your work ethic at the lab and your final work. That being said, if you enjoy what you're doing, it's can be very exciting and a nice change of pace compared to classwork. Work for the course itself is minimal -- a proposal, a progress report, and a final presentation and paper.",
    "Physics 472 is a class where you pursue independent research with an advisor. Yes, I would recommend Physics 472 to another student - but make sure you like your advisor and the research you will be doing!",
    "If you are reading these evaluations, you probably have to take this class. But if that's the case, why are you even bothering reading evaluations? Hurry along and sign up before the physics department runs out of advisors! (Kidding!! This won't happen for, like, another two years assuming the current STEM admissions growth rate.) The only other possibility is that you don't have to take this class. But then surely you're only thinking about taking this class because you've heard from your friends how wonderful it is to pursue independent physics research in a very low-stress, high-flexibility environment. But if that's the case, you must really distrust your friends that you have to come and read MY evaluation just to convince yourself that doing research for credit is an awesome gig. If this is indeed your case, I advise that you forego research and spend the next semester focusing on developing better ties with your friends - your enhanced interpersonal skills will serve you well during your future research experiences too! Finally, I admit that there is also the possibility - vanishingly small in the physics major limit - that you don't have physics major friends, and that you have stumbled across this course in the depths of social despair. If this is your case, despair no further. Professor Werner will be your friend. And he will guide you with excellent advice as well as helpful feedback (for real!) for your report and presentation. He may even post a Yale Compliment about you to boost your spirits, but these rumors are unconfirmed and dubious at the present moment. In short, you should take this course under any circumstances UNLESS you specifically have friends but don't trust them, in which case you should still take the course merely at a later time. And that, my friends, is what we call a proof by casework. P.S. If you think this review looks uncannily like a PHYS 471 evaluation, then I have one more note to make -- this, my friends, is what we call #SWUGlife. Peace out folks.",
    "It is required for my major. Take it if you like research.",
    "It's a great opportunity to learn what it means to do research in a certain field.",
    "You have to take this class for the major. It's an easy class with few requirements but there is NO direction from the department. Also the requirements for the final write up are not clear. So, pick your advisor carefully and make sure you talk to them throughout the term.",
    "Seriously what you make of it. If you're interested in the subject you're researching in, I'd recommend it.",
    "Get started early on picking an adviser!",
    "I am writing this with the assumption that the only reason anyone would care about PHYS 472 evaluations is if they were choosing between being a physics major and doing something else. Research is challenging and difficult, and there also won't always be a clear path for you to follow. However, it is essentially always possible to do your research in an area that you're super excited about, and there is very little if any risk of a negative outcome in taking this class."
