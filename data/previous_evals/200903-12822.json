   "comments": [
    "I think so, yes. Though I think it'll be better if this class can have more interaction with the rest of school. For instance, not having all our reviews in 7th floor pit where nobody else presents.",
    "Absolutely. The post-professional studio drew my class together and really helped us get to know people, use the equipment, and generally become comfortable with YSOA before moving into the advanced studios.",
    "Yes this course occured in proper sequence and was a great start to the Yale expirience for post pros.",
    "This course was appropriate for first year of post-pro student.",
    "Timing of studio was appropriate.",
    "Yes, it is a good introductory course to get everybody thinking and producing and getting to know each other.",
    "I think that the course occurred in proper sequence.In this studio we were solving a very inclusive, relevant problem dealing with architectural issues at different scales: regional scale, site scale, and a single building scale. The opportunity to work and switch between these scales, starting with the social aspects and problems of the region, zooming in on a particular site and zooming back out on a regional scale, adjusting the solution at different stages \u0096 all this raised the design problem to the advanced level that Post Pro students should deal with.I really think that this is the perfect studio for introduction of students into Post Professional Program, because it demonstrated how different areas architectural profession (urban planning, site planning, architectural design) function separately and how they come together to work as a one extremely complex organism of social, economic, programmatic, and spacial organizations. Probably that\u0092s one of the most important and difficult tasks for any architect \u0096 making his creation function effectively at all levels. The more effective the system \u0096 the greater the architect. I do not think that the system I have proposed in this studio works perfectly, but now I have a vector for future development and thinking in the next two years. The global issues I faced this semester will stay in my mind for a long time affecting my future decisions, and, hopefully, making them more coherent and effective.Thanks to this studio that at the very start of the Post Pro program, I could feel like I had taken the next step in my profession and I\u0092m going to make important decisions and generate big ideas in the next two years in this Program.",
    "As a student who received very little focus on urban design during my undergraduate studies, I felt the placement of the first-semester Post-Pro studio was well placed and gives me the tools to make the most of the remainder of my Yale experience.",
    "Yes, it seemed to be a good transition into school and a studio where students of differing interests, skill levels, and backgrounds could be challenged.",
    "This course should not occur at other time than the beginning of the Post Pro program.",
    "This course did seem to occur in the proper sequence within the program as it provides a broad introduction to the School.",
    "Having the chance to take a studio together with the incoming class of M.ARCH II students has been a great experience. The intensity of study and research and the dedication apparent in the work produced during the semester have contributed in creating a very creative and energetic academic environment. I believe that this studio marks a great point of departure for the new advanced architecture students at Yale.",
    "The Post Professional studio is a requirement for all incoming M.Arch II students. Comprised of diverse students from various backgrounds, the studio was a great way of acclimating students who have been practicing back into academia."

   "question_text": "Comment on the body of material presented and the content of the course: sequence, syllabus, and assignments.",
   "comments": [
    "This year's post-pro studio is dedicated more to urban design than to architecture. Frankly speaking, many students' work haven't really reached architecture scale. The sequence of the course should be kept more scheduled. The syllabus and assignments haven been helpful to understand the subject that this course is addressing, very helpful indeed.",
    "I really enjoyed the material of the course. Particularly for post-pros, having a real world, large-scale project was wonderful. My only complaint was that we did not spend enough time on understanding the real world complications or implications\u0097something that then made true problem solving difficult.",
    "Starting the course with precedent studies and then moving into the diagram and design phase was all a smooth transition. Times when we were given specific assignments on a week by week basis seemed to help everyone a lot.",
    "These were clear and easy to understand.",
    "Trying to solve both urban design issues and architectural design issues was very tough to do. It was better to take just one of them. I felt the second half of architectural part was not necessary and not so successful.",
    "Great challenge and opportunity to tackle 3 scales of design (regional, masterplanning, building).Studio addressed the primary chance architects have to exert visible influence on the world outside of architectural discourse.The sites were mundane and uninspiring, but were excellent instances of urban problems and issues that exist all around the country. The solutions reached in the studio should therefore be applicable anywhereSpending time at the beginning of the semester looking at precedents may not have been best. Even though we looked at a good mix of campuses, planned communities, enclaves etc., it still tied many of the students down to a figure-ground, staedtebaulich, arrangement of boxes in a landscape which is not where the main research and interest in urbanism is today (landscape urbanism, parametric urbanism etc.) It may have been better to spend the first couple weeks with abstract geometric or material exercises, slam them down on a site, and then bring in precedents as needed",
    "A bit too much time was spent on the introductory exercises, ie urban models and examples. For the amount of time spent, more analytical drawings should be encouraged.",
    "I couldn\u0092t think of a better syllabus.Through sequence of extremely meaningful assignments in this studio I\u0092ve come a long way to create my design proposal.Our studio dealt with the problematic region in Massachusetts between New Bedford and Boston and the syllabus consisted of 5 main parts:1. Study of regional precedents. There we had an opportunity to refresh in mind or familiarize ourselves with the most prominent planning strategies for regions with different conditions.2. Study of site (larger scale) precedents. There we studied and presented some important solutions of existing sites within larger regions. We considered how the regional strategy relates to parts of the region \u0096 to the sites.3. Proposal for regional planning. At that stage we could take apart existing projects, see their essence, play with them, and try to apply some these strategies to our region, and then alter them based on the analysis of our particular region.4. Visiting sites. Very important thing to visitthe site and have a feeling of how I could envision its development.5. Proposal for planning of an individual site. At that stage, we were zooming in on an individual site, solving it\u0092s plan and working on one selected building.The profoundness of the essential problem, variety of the related assignments, and the resulting projects make me think of this studio as one of the best studios I have taken.",
    "Overall,I felt like each stage of the studio was presented in correct sequence. My only criticism would be the range of material covered in a short amount of time. While I understand the reasons for this, the requirements created an environment as much about producing as understanding. Having worked the past few years, I realize this is an important part of architectures but also look at the academy as a place to really search for a complete understanding and to take a step back for the sake of pure learning.",
    "Great studio project choice. Format of studio sessions was a bit haphazard, mostly because there were too many students in the studio for Ed and Fred-- or ANY two professors, for that matter-- to have enough time working one on one and meeting as a group.I wish we could have done the postcard assignment. We weren't ready for it when it would have come, but looking back that is the one thing I wish I'd been forced to do.",
    "The precedent research on urban utopias was excellent, as well as the time awarded for this stage. The following research component though (on Massachusetts towns) was not as necessary as it could have been some more time for midterm development. The timing for preparation towards final discourse was great.",
    "The body of material presented was new enough to be challenging but familiar enough that students seemed able to cope with the assignments.The choice of subject matter - the Boston rail network - was an excellent decision. The subject not only allowed students to explore urban planning and Boston but also attempted to address and benefit a wider audience. It was admirable of the studio professors to commit to such a project.The choice of precedents was diverse within the architectural field but homogeneous when it came to the scope of ideas and research on urban planning. Cities and their evolution have been studied and explained by many fields and I thought it was a lost opportunity that we did not research ideas about urban growth outside the field of architecture.The sequence of the syllabus - precedents, field trip, proposals - was good but there was perhaps a little too much time given to teamwork.",
    "The architecture material and problems in the Post Professional Studio have been presented following the model of analysis\/synthesis. I believe that this is a proper model of working in architecture, particularly in cases where very complex issues of urban scale are presented.The scope of the studio has covered areas of study that engage both the larger urban scale and the smaller and more articulate architectural scale, making the objective of the studio interesting and rightly challenging. Issues involving functions of network of activities, connections of regions and systems in urban and suburban contexts through public and private transportation, cultural and economic resources in the environment of american urbanity, local problems relating to public spaces and civic programs, have all been actively discussed throughout the course of the semester.The projects, therefore, resulted in the conception of ideas which directly responded to this set of problems. The introduction and constructive use of examples from modern urban models has been constantly present throughout the course of the semester and has been quite successful in initiating polemic discussions that have greatly added the overall discussion of urbanism and architecture.",
    "The studio analyzed the effect of a proposed commuter line in southern Mass and speculated on the impact on several sites along the railway. The beginning of the semester was devoted to precedent analysis and each student proposed a project which attempted to synthesize the analysis with site and socio-economic conditions.The scale of the project, which dealt with large urban themes, was challenging to us all but offered an opportunity to think on abroader regional level. Because the syllabus was very open and free of limitations, the studio produced quite a diverse set of proposals, each one dealing acutely with a series of specific questions."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "My expectation is that this course is more architectural rather than urban-design. However, it is fine to explore from a broader scale. It's just a little bit different.",
    "I knew that YSOA was a great school and felt under-qualified coming here. What this studio has done the most for me was prepare me to be competitive while here.",
    "I was expecting to produce a strong project and to grow as a designer and they were met.",
    "I expected to learn basic skill and strategy for urban design and this course encouraged to acquire these knowledge.",
    "The goal was to go through all the urban design strategies and to find a new strategy at the end. I learned a lot of the basic strategies, but I could not find a new way.",
    "The studio met my expectations, other than the pre-fabrication aspect of the project, which was abandoned as a requirement",
    "Without exaggeration - my expectation were exceeded.My anticipations for this course as for all other courses in this program is to learn new things - something I had been unfamiliar with.As I had written in the statement of purpose of my application for admission, I had 2 primary goals to achieve through this program:1.Learn new approaches to design.2.Learn cutting edge computation and fabrication techniques.All design strategies and resources I used in this studio were totally new to me. The amount of the new information in this semester was so huge, that I'll be digesting it for a while into the future and will work on individually on it, since I consider all this information extremely valuable to me.With this said, the course perfectly matched my interests.",
    "I had expected to broaden my knowledge on urban design and to develop the skills to analyze context through an intellectual thought process. Most were met, but not all.",
    "For the most part, my expectations were met. The exception would be my feeling that the students did not get the attention they deserved due to having 17 students and only one professor on most classes. While their were two profs in Koetter and Mitchell, Koetter was only in New Haven one day a week. During my undergraduate education I never had a studio of more than 14 people, so it seems absurd to have 17 in GRADUATE studies. This shortcoming also played into review days were each student was only given 15-20 minutes to present and get feedback on projects that they had spent hundreds and hudreds of hours on.",
    "I had no idea what to expect, so in that sense this question is difficult to answer. In the end, I think the studio was effective once I knew what the hell Ed and Fred were up to-- what they wanted, how they were trying to push us. If they were more straightforward I think some students who need more structure would have done better, however I think I got the most out of it as it was. I feel that at the reviews and in our end of semester meeting with Ed, we finally got to talk about architecture.",
    "Although my expectation were not so ambitious at the beginning, the competitiveness reflected on the student's work together with the push fromthe professors helped me to gain the confidence necessary to carry on with my own project.",
    "I expected the course to be both demanding and intellectually challenging.The course was certainly physically demanding as there was a very high emphasis on production. However, I believe this came at a cost - there was an over-emphasis on presentation and an under-emphasis on the ideas behind the presentations. The class seemed to spend very little time on the development of the idea and the majority of their time on the presentation. Although the time and effort expended by the class was admirable, the urban proposals lacked rigor and were conceptually under-developed. I think the underlying assumptions and ideas on which the projects were based, should have been brought into question. This would have helped the students identify which projects were worth pursuing. I believe this is an important consideration as the energy and time spent on the proposals was tremendous, and this studio has the potential to produce real research on urban planning. I believe that this could have been remedied if the underlying ideas of the students had been critiqued more rigorously and the question of whether some were worth pursuing was asked.The studio professors may have intentionally avoided criticizing the ideas of the students. However I do not believe this fosters an appropriate studio environment, and would have preferred if the course had been more intellectually-driven.",
    "Having chosen Yale School of Architecture to continue my graduate studies, I hoped to find here an environment that provides great freedom for creative expression and is, in the mean time, grounded in strong academic foundations. I am happy to note that my experience as a student in the Post Professional Studio has fully realized these expectations I had as an incoming student."

   "comments": [
    "It's been a good and valuable experience to be in this course and to work with various fellow peers. It helped me to understand how studios work in the school and what the urban situation is in New England.",
    "The greatest value of the course was almost graphic design. A visual logic was expected from our drawings that was really incredible. I learned a lot from that, and feel that I can communicate my projects much better. What was of almost no value were the ideas behind the visual logic. As in, while I appreciate the professors letting us attack the problem from a diverse range of ideologies, I wish those ideologies had been questioned a bit more. Studying out-dated and disproven urban models is no way to study urbanism. Many other disciplines have done rigorous research on what good urbanism is, but we completely ignored that in favor of studying some urban models that were bound to fail from the start (cf. Linear City, for example).",
    "This was a very exciting course for me, being from the area where the project took place, and I enjoyed every minute of it. It was also very valuable to work on an urban design project, as I have not worked on many in the past, and develop that aspect of design skill.",
    "I thought that the goal of the studio was to try to find a new type of urban design strategies, but the studio projects became too site specific. The goal of the studio shifted to solve the site issues.",
    "Course was valuable in learning how to deal with the big picture and not being intimated by designing at a masterplanning scale.",
    "Good introduction to the school.I benefited from learning the scale and scope of a regional project and its local urban implications, including the materials and documents necessary to support the project.",
    "As I described in questions 4 and 5, the course was extremely important to me.I would say that during these 3 months in the studio I have learned more than in several years of working back home.",
    "The course really gave me a strong understanding of ubrban design versus designing in urban settings. I learned about important precedents for the past and have a strong idea about where urban design is 'heading.' I also feel my vocabulary on the topic has been broadened and I have the ability to hold a conversation with a seasoned vetern.",
    "Its value, for me, lies in its encouragement to ask questions that I will continue to think about in my next three semesters at Yale. The questioning has been more helpful to me than the answers. Also, the emphasis on graphics (Fred only) was completely distracting to my classmates and to me, and resulted in being critiqued on aesthetics instead of architectural ideas or urban strategies many weeks.",
    "This course was of great importance to me, as it fulfilled all my views of what I thought becoming a student at the Yale School of Architecture would be.",
    "I am happy with the work I produced during this course and I believe that it was of value to me as a student. It is also important to note that the work produced by the studio has the potential to be of value to an audience outside the school of architecture which I think is admirable.The only criticism I have is that the course could have been more intellectually rigorous.",
    "This course for me has been a great opportunity to, with immense rigor and intensity, return to the academic environment. The level of engagement necessary to partake in the academic and professional discussions I found to be rightly inclusive and energetic. I have had the chance to significantly expand my knowledge in the areas that relate to larger regional urban thinking, through the perspective of both academic ideas and pragmatic thought. I feel these lessons to be very significant in my academic and professional future."

   "question_text": "Comment on the effectiveness of the teaching by the courses's instructor",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Mitchell and Prof. Koetter are amazing instructors. Although it'll be better if Mr. Mitchell can be more straightforward on the subject he is talking about. Sometimes the theoretical materials he's been quoting from seemed to be a little overwhelming for students.",
    "Really effective and great desk crits and pin-ups. Great discussions in class and on field trip. Really loved the course.",
    "Their critics were helpful and it was impressive they spent much time to talk with each student.",
    "Professors were available and helpful. They also allowed for a large degree of independence if desired. Frequent meetings with outside critics were stressful but helpful in the end.",
    "On desk consultations and reviews Professors Edward Mitchell and Alfred K Koetter drew my attention to the matters I had not thought about much before, which, actually, are very important.The emphasis in The School I had attended back home was placed more on the aspects of beauty and composition in architecture, rather than on analytical aspects of its programmatic and social functioning.In In contrast, Professors in this Studio drew my focus to the analytical aspects of the design, which, again, was the new vector of thinking for me.I'm grateful to my instructors for making me think in new dimensions which hopefully will contribute to greater depth of my future projects.I\u0092d also like to emphasize the devotion, with which our instructors worked with us: even on the Thanksgiving week professor Mitchell was in Studio consulting me.",
    "Most of my comments were mentioned above. My constructive criticism would be that I would like to see the professors focus more on desk crits and one-on-one student interaction as opposed to so many pinups. As mentioned earlier, I felt the class had a strong emphasis on production over learning and while a good deal of this was self\/student-imposed, I feel the professors could have done a bit more to prevent this. Sometimes a rough good idea is more valuable than a fine-tuned mediocre idea.Obviously, there was no TA but the professors did a good job of bringing in other faculty members to assist with our learning.",
    "As I have said, I think the value in this course lies in whether or not you get what Ed and Fred are trying to do and the freedom one has to explore what they're interested in, then defend it.There was one huge problem with the course which affected the teaching effectiveness-- the class was WAY too big. I would say a class of ten would be optimal, 12 maximum. 17 students means group projects and less time with the instructor, and tired instructors! Accept less students.",
    "The combination of Professor Koetter and Mitchell was outstanding, as they would always present different and compelling views towards urban design and architecture that aided to my own explorations as a young designer, which require the level of variability I appreciated in both of them.",
    "The course instructors were in general, effective in guiding the class. However, I believe that the teaching concentrated too much on the image and too little on the idea behind the image.",
    "The professors have been instrumental in creating a constructive environment for debate throughout the semester. Their extensive knowledge has greatly added to my personal involvement in the project. I believe that the ideas they have brought in the studio have been clearly presented and thoughtfully incorporated in the context of the projects across the studio. I do, however, feel that, due to the very complex nature of the problem that was given in the limited time available in one semester, the discussion relating to analytical thinking has tended to become generalized sometimes and cause the focus of the study to be slightly blurred.Despite this minor criticism, I would like to say that the Post Professional Studio has been a very good experience. Above all, it has been amazing to study under Fred Koetter and have the chance to discuss architecture with him.",
    "I viewed the studio as a necessary segue between the workplace and academia. Each student brought to the project a different set of working methods, life experiences and various levels of expertise. In my opinion, the studio was set up much like a thesis seminar with the professors allowing all the students to pursue individual interests based on a broader theme. What I enjoyed most about Fred and Ed was their interest in the next step of the process and how to push the project forward. They both were great resources for information and provided great precedent material to study."

   "question_text": "Suggestions you may have for course improvements:",
   "comments": [
    "I hope that in the future this course can be more integrated with other studios in the school that make post-pros less isolated. Probably it's just because of 7th floor.",
    "I thought the project was incredibly interesting. But my problem with the project is really related to my problem with the way architects too often think, though. We were poised to really research the situation, understand the problem, and postulate a solution with both compelling images and real world pragmatism. The combined knowledge of our studio and the clout of Yale as a university had situated us to really say\/do something about this project. Unfortunately, we spent about half an hour at each site and no real world rigor was expected of us. It\u0092s not that I don\u0092t think architecture should be compelling or aesthetic, but only that that aesthetic is grounded in our ability to truly solve problems. If we don\u0092t, we might as well become artists instead. So as for improvements, I think we should have done more meaningful research (that means documentation, citation, etc. you can\u0092t just claim facts without sources; that\u0092s call plagiarism in every field but an architectural presentation, apparently), worked in teams, and then presented our ideas in town hall meetings or something in Southern Massachusetts. That would have been truly incredible.",
    "Perhaps more desk crits in the begining stages of design.",
    "See question 4",
    "I wish that there had been more of a unifying framework for the projects to bounce ideas off of. This might have been more easily achieved had there been less sites for development.",
    "I'd like to emphasize that I enjoyed working in this studio very much. and I'm very grateful to my professors. Therefore, I do not have particular suggestions for improvement of the course as I have found it great.My only wish is rather unrealistic: to have a longer semester with an opportunity to better develop projects. In my School back home the semesters were 4.5 months long, and exams lasted at least two weeks. Such timing was more suitable because I'm not a fast working person and I need more time to think and reflect on the project to complete it.I think that my performance in this semester was not to the best of my ability, partly due to the short time allotted for many assignments, partly because I am not completely comfortable with some of software and fabrication tools.I hope to do better in future semesters.",
    "It would be more effective to have the instructors just to take a few minutes to listen rather than talk over us and stress their ideas on our projects. My notion of learning is to understand the consequences of our moves and to learn how they could be made better or changed.It could also be effective to have the instructors prepare occasional presentations on examples of criteria, be it graphics, analysis, etc.It would also be effective to arrange pin-ups in alternating large groups so we could learn from each other at the same time we are learning from the instructors. I felt that making it an individual meeting probably discouraged the students to share and exchange information and created a competitive atmosphere.",
    "Honestly, my biggest criticism deals with the final review:At first, the panel of 12-14 jurors consisted of 4 people as each of the others were late or no show. Not surprisingly, each of the four were non-architects. While the majority of the others arrived later in the day, most all were very late. While this didn't impact me personally, I think it was fairly rude. When paired with the fact that each student only got 15-20 minutes to discuss a huge intervention, the review left me with a bad taste in my mouth.Additionally, I felt like reviewer Douglas Gauthier was an embarassment to himself and to the university. After showing up after 4pm, he made several rude comments that were not constructive and followed that up later in the evening by insulting Yale, insulting people personally and insulting former employers. While I truly believe in constructive criticism, calling people 'lazy B*tches' is truly unacceptable. While he is an extremely intelligent man and, I believe, probably a valuable critic deep down, I do not believe he should be invited back as a critic in the future.",
    "Smaller class size. 10-12, not 17.",
    "I would strongly suggest the school to bring more outside consultants, since their availability was an aspect I appreciated a lot.A small fund to cover studio expenses should be available (model and fabrication materials, together with prints).Invited jurors should take their appointment more seriously and be on time. Otherwise, they should not be invited again. Being invited to a final review at a prestigious institution deserves more professionalism from them.Although the amount seen in class was fair enough, more precedent and site specific research would be a plus.",
    "I believe that the course could be improved by concentrating less on presentation and more on the ideas being presented. The strength of the studio lies in the relevant subject matter and course material.",
    "Due to the great scope of the studio, involving thorough research and discussions of very complex regional urban issues and fairly intricate architectural contexts, it would have been nicer if a few logistical issues have been thought of differently. I believe that a more focused study of sites and urban conditions, with less time and focus dedicated to analytical research, would have resulted in far more resolute architectural ideas. Also, it would have been helpful in this context if the work had been done in groups throughout the semester.",
    "Due to the large number of people in the incoming class, each student was limited to a presentation and critique of 20 minutes each. After a long semester of intense work and speculation, it seemed anti-climatic to be limited to such a short discussion of the work. If more students had worked in groups, perhaps this would alleviate the time constraint.A series of larger group discussions or perhaps several lectures by either Fred or Ed would have helped orient the studio."
