   "comments": [
    "This class is a combination of bio, anthropology, history and environmental science. It is the BEST CLASS for non-science majors. Science majors should not take this class-- you'll probably have encountered the information before and would be taking a seat from someone who would really benefit from the class. The lectures have a ton of information, but the tests aren't too long or overly difficult (you'll definitely need to study though). This is a very fair class and there are no p-sets, which is beautiful. You will really like this class. Even the paper can be interesting, but it's due the week after the second midterm, which is somewhat unfortunate timing. I would suggest doing research over spring break.",
    "Definitely recommend taking this course. The field trips were fun, Professor Puth and the TFs were great, and a great opportunity to learn more about plants",
    "Yes. It's not a difficult course, maybe as difficult as a high school biology class. But the material is interesting, which is awesome. Everything relates to plants and you can do a final project on whatever most interests you. And it's a fun way to get a science credit. I would recommend it!",
    "With lectures on beer and coffee and agriculture, there is something for everyone. Even if you don't think you like plants, you probably will after, and you'll notice their presence in everything, even beyond the obvious. The field trips offer something of interest for everyone and are a great reminder of the many resources on Yale's campus that we may often forget.",
    "If you are lucky enough to get in, TAKE IT. You will learn so much about plants, and even if you think you don't like plants, you definitely will very soon. You learn about how important plants are to people, and that will probably change your view on how you should interact with the earth. ALSO THE FIELD TRIPS ARE AMAZING. You go to really cool places around campus and do hands-on stuff while reinforcing the material you learned in class. This class was an absolute blessing and made my semester.",
    "Take it if you are looking for a nice science credit: looking at trees, eating fruit, sipping coffee.",
    "Plants and People is a broad survey course about well...the interaction of plants and people. It's successful in that, but perhaps goes too broad and becomes more of what it sounds like, a fun gut class. The regular field trips are actually the most interesting part of the class, so take advantage of those. If you know anything about environmental science and environmental history, you probably need to do VERY LITTLE to get an A in this course. A great way to balance out a busy schedule.",
    "It wasn't terrific because it seemed like the professor and TAs were learning the material as they went. The test questions could be a bit random in how they were crafted. The grading seemed arbitrary at times. Overall though a good class for nonmajors. Three classes and a section is a lot for one week though.",
    "Plants and People is a great survey course on basic plant structure, the history of agriculture, and ecology. It's not very difficult, it's engaging, and you'll walk away with a beginning knowledge base in many different fields.",
    "Of course, take this if you can!",
    "Definitely yes!",
    "I would recommend. The course is not very difficult, and it's a ton of fun. Just be advised that it does meet 3 times, plus a section. It's not much work though--reading is minimal, the paper\/project is a lot of fun and wide open, and the exams are not very hard.",
    "met 3 times a week for class with 1 section, which was pretty rough if you don't like walking up to science hill (ESC building). most but not all fridays were field trips to different places like the YUAG, peabody, tree ID outside, yale farm, greenhouse. not much day to day work, just reading, and 2 midterms, a project\/paper and a final.",
    "Awesome science credit for non science majors but if you're very sciency maybe not for you",
    "Plants & People is a fun and interesting class for students who are not very comfortable with the sciences. The field trips are super fun and interesting. Prof. Puth is fantastic and prepares you very well for the exams. And there is a research paper that allows you to probe topics that you find interesting in more depth. However, this is a survey course so if you are interested in one specific topic and exploring that one topic deeply, this is not the class for you. Even though it did frustrate me at time, this class was one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale. It's just a really fun time!"
