    "It is the best course ever~",
    "Good, but still difficult",
    "A great class, definitely take it with Minjin. She's so much fun and a great professor. The Russian program is great here and i would absolutely recommend it for someone looking to take a more unique language.",
    "At this point, you're likely committed to Russian if you want to get credit for 110. Fear not! This class is loads of fun and extremely engaging. You'll be able to communicate with others at a basic level by the end of the course. It is not a greatly stressful class and it teaches you so many valuable things about communication and culture, aside from just language itself. I highly recommend this course to anyone considering which language to choose.",
    "Harder than last semester. A whirlwind of memorizing things. It's necessary to take, but be aware, this might negatively hurt your GPA. And you might feel that you haven't learned Russian like you wanted. So get a tutor and an extra textbook as a supplement. Also make sure you actually have time to study this, because 1 hour a night does NOT cut it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Would greatly recommend this class to other students interested in foreign language."
