    "I loved the concept of the course but I think in order to really learn how to be better writers, we needed more opportunities to write and workshop our writing. Even drafting an intro scene, or an op-ed, or rewriting the opening lines of a book we read, and then sharing and getting feedback, would have been so fun and helpful. As is, the class goal is supposed to teach us how to be more creative academic writers, but just reading books (some of which we all agreed were quite badly written) wasn't particularly helpful."

    "Definitely. Prof. Shore is the best instructor at the Department of History.",

I did appreciate learning how to write book reviews for different audiences--that was probably the biggest take away for me."
