    "This is a great course simply due to the wide-ranging and important texts you'll read, guided by Shapiro's insights and context. At times class felt like a bit of a bull sesh and it's not as focused as most other seminars, but that's probably inevitable for a course that's trying to cover the history of Western political thought on concepts like \"freedom,\" \"justice,\" and \"equality.\" I hadn't taken Shapiro's Moral Foundations of Politics before the course, and thus wasn't really aware of the extent to which it's in many ways an advanced version of that course (though there are important differences). I was able to get a lot out of the course despite not having taking MoFoPo, but my quick skim of Shapiro's book for MoFoPo halfway through this course aided my understanding tremendously, and I'd suggest that anybody who hasn't taken it look at the book or online materials early on in this course.",
    "No. The class is really just Ian Shapiro reading aloud his Mofopo textbook. We spent no time engaging with the texts for exigesis, and we spent no time arguing amongst ourselves about the actual normative arguments. This class has convinced me that contemporary political theory is pretty much bs. It's utterly unrigorous, it thinks it can accomplish far too much without any actual foundation in moral philosophy, and it's basically just running around in circles trying to define some terms. Shapiro is great as a lecturer, and some of his writings are really quite brilliant, but he is a dreadful section leader, and he also refuses to exit his own dogmatic thinking to take seriously the points people make in class. I also suspect that he learned none of the undergrads' names. That said, the syllabus is fabulous, the midterm and final were easy, and I'm pretty sure the reading responses won't actually be graded (seeing as very few people wrote the 4 that were required of him). Oh, and for what it's worth, this was a total YPU hack class.",
    "The reading was quite interesting and often excellent. However, discussions were dry and usually disappointing. Professor Shapiro, while clearly smart, did not seem particularly engaged with the course or with students. He often repeated himself, seemingly forgetting which material he had covered. He gave no indication of knowing any students' names. His exam questions were often idiosyncratic. Take a different political theory course.",
    "LOTS of overlap with MoFoPo. I would probably not recommend taking this class. The readings are too long to get to in seminar, and take up lots of time - and the class hardly benefits at all from the seminar format. In fact, I think I learned less because of it. Professor Shapiro has a very unique and centralized style of running seminar that I found a little stifling, though it was done in earnest",
    "A survey of important texts for any student of political theory, though the class itself was less enjoyable than it could be. Discussions were somewhat disconnected and sometimes rather flat. While the readings were organized to give some structure that's not always reflected in the class sessions. Shapiro is a brilliant scholar and has a firm take on each author, though those interpretations sometimes get in the way of probing deeper into each argument. Also we barely opened the books during our discussions.",
    "I would cautiously recommend this class for someone looking for a seminar in political philosophy. Professor Shapiro offers sharp, if idiosyncratic, readings of the philosophy on the syllabus, and provides a pretty thorough overview of the field (PLSC 328 is designed as a survey course for PhD students taking the field exam). I would take the prerequisite (a prior course in political philosophy) seriously. It might also help to have some background in philosophy more generally (e.g. Kant). That being said, while not an intro course, it is a survey course -- the point is to cover lots of material in broad strokes, which it does pretty effectively."
