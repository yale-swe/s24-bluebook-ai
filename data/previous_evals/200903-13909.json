   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course for anybody hoping to get a background in signaling, but not to students whose lab work focuses explicitly on this area as it felt more like a survey course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students and have already done so. I believe this is an excellent survey of a growing field that would be important for a scientist in any field of biology. The knowledge gained in this course will provide an invaluable framework for future experimental design and analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course because it provides a good background in signaling, and signaling is important in any field, whether it be in pharmacology, neurobiology or immunology.",
    "signal transduction. good course, learned a lot.",
    "The course gives an overview of signal transduction in a variety of different systems and contexts. It also covers methods used to study mechanisms of signal transduction. Lectures are given by faculty members with expertise in the area being presented. I would recommend this course to other students, because it is well structured and informative.",
    "Signal Transduction is an overview of how cells create appropriate (or inappropriate in the case of disease) responses in response to external stimuli. It covers several signaling cascades important to almost all cell types.I already have recommended this course to other students.I feel I have a much better understanding of signaling and it was useful to know in my other classes and my first lab rotation, and I'm sure will also be useful in my future research."

   "comments": [
    "I have a good knowledge now of several signaling pathways that could potentially be involved in processes that I study. I will undoubtedly consider pathways that we have discussed when considering cellular and molecular phenotypes that I may see.",
    "I will most likely be in a signaling lab for my research, so having a foundation in signal transduction will prove extremely useful.",
    "Yes, it presented a lot of material, just like the course description. worth it.",
    "I am looking to focus my research on proteins involved in signal transduction, so it provided me with a solid background in the pathways I am interested in and how they may relate to other processes within nerve cells. My research has focused on cells in the nervous system - this course contributed understanding of how the processes I am studying are involved in other organs\/systems of the body. It also helped me better understand methods I may use for my research in the future.",
    "I will certainly use this in my future research, and will help me understand literature and presentations better since many pathways that are commonly mentioned were covered."
