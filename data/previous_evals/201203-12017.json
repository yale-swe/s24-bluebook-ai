    "This course covers a very broad swathe of topics in Brazilian culture ranging from Dance and Carnival to Drugs, Politics and Architecture. It is a really great introduction to things that you don't really get a great understanding of unless you go to Brazil and is an excellent course.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student that is ready to take an L5 Portuguese course. It is incredibly interesting and informative while not being as time consuming as the earlier levels of Portuguese.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to advanced Portuguese students.",
    "If you speak Portuguese and are interested in Brazil, take this class. It will brighten your week!",
    "I recommend this class to an L5 level portuguese student.",
    "Valeu a pena? Tudo vale a pena se a alma n\u00c3\u00a3o \u00c3\u00a9 pequena",
    "The best course. Not a huge amount of work other than the two papers, which aren't too bad, especially because Paulo helps you out. Paulo makes class fun. You learn about Brazil, keep up your Portuguese, and hang out with other people who love Brazil. If you've already taken L1-L4, then do it.",
    "Good class. Paulo is really great. Not too much speaking by students but Paulo is very accessible and loves meeting with you outside of class.",
    "This class is a great overview of both modern and historic affairs in Brazil. I would definitely recommend to this class to other students who are learning Portuguese. Paulo is great and the material is very interesting. We talk about everything from politics to racial identities to music to sports. Wonderful class.",
    "Class on interesting topics in Brazilian culture, fairly low workload. TAKE PORTUGUESE!"
