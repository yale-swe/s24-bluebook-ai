    "Yes definitely take it! Highly interesting class, with a fascinating syllabus and engaging lectures.",
    "Introduction to painting tradition in Islamic art, not an introduction to Islamic art in general, more focused. Very informative and eye-opening.",
    "Intro to Islamic Art History was a great class that I would recommend to other students. There are some great readings (but be warned, it would be difficult to complete all of them. luckily you dont necessarily have to) and Professor Rizvi is very knowledgeable on the subject and eager to get to know her students. You will start with the earliest Islamic Art and culminate with contemporary art in the last three lectures or so. We visited the Beinecke to look at ancient manuscripts and also got to see items not on display at the MET. Do it!",
    "It has very interesting material, though i often gauged my own interpretations for it.",
    "take it! readings are heavy though",
    "I would recommend Intro to Islamic Art as it really provides you with a solid foundation for a quite influential art form. Understanding Islamic art really helps broaden one's understanding of art in general and is quite a beautiful language to be fluent in.",
    "The course is a must for anyone interested in Islamic Art."
