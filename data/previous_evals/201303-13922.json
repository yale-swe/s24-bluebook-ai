   "comments": [
    "\"Stevens and Frost\" was a great survey of both these poets. Professor Bromwich is a thoughtful and brilliant reader, and his selections will introduce you to many poems outside the usual canon. However, this will not be a class about textual interpretation more broadly,or even one that will broaden your interpretive skillset by grappling with difficult poems. Stevens in particular is treated with an eye to his philosophical lucidity and the underlying theoretical message of many of his works. This is fine, and quite fascinating, except that Bromwich's approach removes the emphasis from the quite paradoxical and confusing elements of Stevens's works. Reading Stevens can be spiritually fulfilling and mentally incapacitating -- this class, at times, is the opposite. There is also no secondary literature assigned, and Bromwich's own voice substituted for a canon of criticism, which left readings of most poems floundering in monologic solitude."

   "comments": [
    "Any significant introduction to important poets deepens one's knowledge in a significant way. It did not, however, teach me much more than closely and attentively reading all of the poems assigned in the syllabus would have. Download the syllabus--there are many excellent poems recommended there--but don't trip over yourself to take this course if it's offered again."
