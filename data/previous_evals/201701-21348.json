   "comments": [
    "This course taught me how to write a college level paper. Going in, I didn't really know how to approach papers, and now that I've completed the class I feel as though I can plan out and write a paper for another class with relative ease. I learned how to plan papers, do research, develop claims, analyze texts, and edit critically.",
    "I gained a new perspective on traveling. I hope to become more aware in my future travels and also to be more considerate to the people of a foreign culture. As for my writing ability, I've noticed considerable improvements in my academic writing. Although there is still a lot of room for improvement, I definitely came out of the class as a better writer and a better reader\/text analyzer.",
    "Throughout this course, I gained knowledge of how to properly construct a research paper. In doing so, I learned how to get sources through Yale library and how to read and parse the sources for quotes\/evidence for my papers. In general this course not only helped me provide more clarity to my writing, but also helped me grasp reading academic papers more easily. I believe I gained general reading analysis skills and improved my essay outlining that ultimately helped improve my essay writing\/expression.",
    "How to analyze academic papers for their arguments and structure; how to use those papers as models for my own academic writing. I also look at the world around me with a more critical eye; even things that are everyday can have interesting undercurrents governing them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was overall great. It was a good mix of subject material and writing help, and improved my writing and critical reading skills. It works very well as a small course, allowing for discourse and giving us the opportunity to share claims and analysis from our papers with the entire class and professor. I don't think there are any major weaknesses of the course it was very well taught and I learned a ton! I always enjoyed going to class, and our discussions were very interesting.",
    "The strengths of this course definitely has to be the great professor and the small class size. Because of the smaller class size, each student was given more attention by the professor and was therefore able to improve their writing. The weakness of this course is the time frame in which it operates. There were definitely time where the course load was a little heavy due to the short amount of time to cover all of the course's material.",
    "Firstly, because the course was a seminar, it naturally requires a base amount of outside work and attention in class that really got me to enjoy the course. Strengths also include the amount of peer help that exists in the classroom as well as hands on work with the professor. Besides focusing on reading and understanding ideas\/points, the course is a very good way to improve fundamental writing from all levels. However, to get the most out of this course, it does require a good amount of daily work outside of class. The essay turnover rate was very quick, which did not allow a lot of time to be spent on a certain essay. Although by forcing essays the course does make you really work, which puts pressure on your writing, helping improve it.",
    "This course was good in familiarizing me with academic writing; I feel much more prepared to go into future higher level courses and write with both a better mind and hand. This section was interesting and the right fit for me; the readings and assignments were well integrated and supported the goal of the course. Weaknesses: I think the least helpful essay in terms of my writing was the fourth essay, so if there were a way to make it more academic (or just make it a small side assignment and replace it with something else), then that might help."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but only if you're really interested in the subject. There is a lot of work, even compared to the other ENGL 114 classes, which isn't terrible if you're interesting in what you're reading and writing, but would be horrible otherwise. Class discussions were interesting, and the readings were as well (for the most part). Pam is great! She's very knowledgable about travel and tourism, and makes class fun and interesting. She grades harshly, but gives good feedback and really pushes you to be a better writer.",
    "I definitely think this is a great course to take. ENGL 114 has the reputation of a heavy course load, which is justifiable. However, the benefits you get out of this class are definitely worth it in the end. Despite the heavy course load, I learned a lot more about myself in terms of what I can handle and about who I am as a writer. I'm really glad I was able to become a better writer through the close professor to student relationship in this class. I also enjoyed it because of the small class size and being able to participate more in class.",
    "Regardless of what level writing you are at, this course really provides a basic structure to academic essay writing that can only help your future writing. Not only are you writing a lot, at the same time you are required to complete class readings that encourages other skills such as reading and through classroom discussions, you will find this course very engaging. With all these factors, it will even influence how you think about arguments\/ideas outside of class, which makes this class applicable and worth the time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course for how useful it is toward every future class that involves academic writing (most of them). However, do not take it if you are not able to commit a lot of time and effort to it."
