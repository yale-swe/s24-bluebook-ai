    "It's ok...not very well taught, but u learn a little at least.",
    "Let's see...so Barrett is everything you can ask for in a professor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 understanding, lax with deadlines, clear solutions to exam questions accommodating \u00e2\u0080\u0093 except that he CANNOT teach to save the grades of anyone stuck with the great misfortune of having to take his class. I'm sure he's very capable and able as a physicist, but in the classroom, he's an absolute bumbling bozo. Sitting in his class and watching him do useless demonstrations (that sometimes don't even work...) was much like watching Mitt Romney attempting to make his way through his campaign, except the person at risk of failing in this case is you. Yeah. Avoid Barrett if you can (but check out the disclaimer below).The material, on the other hand, if you've had any type ofphysics before with a teacher who was functional and capable in his teaching capacities, then you will have no problem reading the textbook and getting through it. For those of you who haven't had any physics before...good luck, my friend. Your semester's gonna suck. Sorry 'bout that.",
    "It's rather basic. I don't think very many people ever paid attention during class except to watch the demos. Not at all bad, though.",
    "Honestly, I still don't know if I would have been better off taking 200 but in terms of 170 vs. 180 it's just a matter of how much you want straight physics (180) or biology-based physics (170). I didn't love the class because it was boring but it wasn't too difficult, if that's what people are looking for in reviews... We spent an absurd amount of time doing problem sets when you think about it in terms of overall course difficulty.",
    "Course was not very well taught. The course material is not too challenging and one can get by just reading the textbook. The workload is not too bad with weekly psets and 2 midterms. Professor Barrett spent all of class doing demos or deriving equations that we could have just memorized. Going to lecture was not helpful, but necessary to get the points required for clicker questions.",
    "Great course and take this course if you want to get a SC credit.",
    "It's a decent intro physics class. Prof. Sean is great and passionate. If you're doing this for a science credit, find some course that suits your interest more.",
    "take this class with barrett",
    "A fast-paced and not-terribly-in-depth treatment of physics. Not geared towards the completely introductory level unless you work significantly more to understand the material. Professor Barrett is kind, funny, and very intelligent, but the unfortunate nature of the class is that it does not meet enough times a week to help you figure out the quantitative aspects of classical physics. You will need to learn the material yourself for the most part, taking advantage of office hours when possible.Or, if my advice to the faculty is taken and sections are offered (I'm not insane--believe me when I say they would be very beneficial, especially given the quality of TAs), be prepared to take a revamped and much better PHYS 180, which has been improving over the past years.",
    "I would warn them about the level of self-studying involved and only encourage those who have the drive to learn physics to take this course.",
    "No",
    "You're likely considering taking this course because you're premed. If so, seriously consider 170. If you're a physics major, seriously consider 200 or 260. This course is absolutely awful. Completely disorganized, and with a professor who would rather show continuous demonstrations in class than actually teach any physics. If you have to take it, I guess it doesn't matter what I say. But by god if you have the choice, avoid this class. So bad.",
    "This is an easily manageable intro physicsclass. It is helpful to have some background in physics before taking the class, though AP level or calculus-based knowledge is not necessary. The lectures are not very helpful for learning the material, but the book is excellent, so learning the material by oneself plays a big role in this class.",
    "It's really fun! take it!",
    "This class did not contribute to my stress load in terms of work but it was often frustrating because I don't feel I gained much from it. I took AP Physics in high school and realistically probably should have taken a higher level here.",
    "It's an intro mechanics course. Pretty easy if you know any elementary physics. A lot of demos in class, psets are not long.",
    "Sean Barrett is probably the nicest physics teacher I've ever met. He always has so much energy and writes comforting notes on the midterm exams. Unfortunately, he doesn't do a whole lot of actual teaching during the class so if you haven't taken physics before it may be tough. If you have done physics, but don't want to do 260 or 200 for some reason definitely take this over 170. Barrett does the coolest demonstrations, especially the one on laminar flow, and the other class is full of premeds who push the average ridiculously high. This class also isn't hard which is always a plus.",
    "A good intro physics course. Read a chapter of the book and take a 3 question quiz online for each lecture, and then watch mostly demo applications while doing clicker questions during class. Boring at times (for those who have taken physics classes before in high school), and clickers are like attendance recorders, but it's an okay class. Professor Barrett can entertain with many of his demos.",
    "It's physics. Professor Barrett is kind of all over the place (literally and figuratively), and lectures weren't particularly engaging. PSets sometimes contained ridiculously complicated questions, but were overall pretty fair. Exams were fair (and hewed very closely to the practice exams, so make sure to study those carefully!) and there was a solid curve (about a whole grade level for both midterms). It's not a bad course, but it's certainly nothing special.",
    "Only take this if you have to. This class greatly varies depending on who is teaching it. If Barrett is teaching it, expect to learn everything from the textbook and expect that class time will more or less be a waste of time.",
    "This class involved a lot of independent learning. Lectures weren't that useful in learning the material, only for demos of the basic basic concepts.",
    "Take if you have to. Better than 170 from what I've heard, better than 200 if you haven't taken multivariable calc. Sean Barrett was a really nice guy, but didn't explain much in lecture other than how to drop balls from really tall ladders. You have to do the reading to keep up, as few concepts are covered in class. Midterms and final not bad. Really nice guy.",
    "It was fine. Kinda tedious. Not very hard. If you've taken AP Physics you can pretty much coast though it. Good for the MCAT I guess, but not a very fun course.",
    "An excellent course, but it requires work outside of class (as should be expected in a science course...).",
    "Hard, but it if you read the textbook and go to the problem sessions, its do-able.",
    "Phys 180 is a typical intro phys college level class. To be honest, the class material itself is not too hard. Probably easier than Ap Physics (not that I took it). The thing to watch out here is this; most people in 180 already took AP Phys and kill the PSets and tests without studying at all. The class isn't curved on a bell curve so this isn't really a problem for you, but it can be really frustrating. Also, I did not really like the textbook. The problems in the book are over complicated. They take too long to learn anything conceptually important or life-chanigng about the chapter topics. The midterms and final were not too bad, take practice exams and you will be okay. Barrett heavily reuses concepts\/problems from past exams. Understand energy and kinematics because they come up constantly. If I was pre-med, I would just take Phys 170.Professor Barrett is truly a nice man, a gentleman, and I can honestly say that I think he truly cares about his students. HOWEVER: Barrett spends all of class rambling about proving equations and\/or pointless demos that almost never make any sense! Professor, please please PLEASE listen when we say this: you need to cut the demos down. Class time would be most useful for us if you did the following instead:1. Simply read through the chapter summary on which class you are teaching for. I would look at each topic and just talk about each topic for 1 minute about the conceptual and mathematical things from eachtopic in the summary that students should write down and keep in mind. (Spend 20 minutes)2. Then I would do clicker questions, dealing complicated with concepts and basic formulas. (Spend 20 minutes)3. THEN: do some quick demos that are either VERY COOL or MIND-BREAKING. That's it. Not 100 demos per chapter. They are useless. (15 minutes)4. Finally, I would do 2 pre-written \"Barrett\" like questions that deal with solving variables and stuff, dealing with that chapters work. I would do one quick straightforward problem, and secondly I would do a more complicated problem that calls to questions complicated concepts that has a \"trick\" in the problem's solution. (Spend 25 minutes)",
    "Take this class if you want a broad but traditional approach to many of the topics in physics (and when I mean traditional I mean not specifically focused on, say, the biology applications like PHYS 170). The professor often does not teach in the class and does more demos than cover material, however his tests are rather fair and can be done well with proper studying.",
    "Physics 180 is a general physics course. I recommend it because Professor Barrett is entertaining, but if you really want to learn more physics, take a higher level physics class.",
    "This class really highlights the basic concepts of physics, presenting these through demos in class. Reading the book helps a lot with the homework and understanding the concepts.",
    "Physics 180 could be challenging for those who have no physics background. It's basically a review of AP Physics B (crammed into one semester). Professor Barrett's lectures mainly consist of demos, which are interesting, but doesn't really help with solving quantitative problems. The textbook will teach you how to do that. Grading is fair, and the curve is quite generous.",
    "I would take this if you have to for your major. It is helpful to have a physics background because after the first couple of weeks they move very quickly, but it is a nice compromise between 170 and 200.",
    "If you're interested in the sciences\/engineering and you want to (re)solidify your physics fundamentals, this is your lecture class. Just be sure to adapt your learning and studying strategies as soon as you figure out how the class works. Finding a good study group to go over problem set questions, and doing a ton of practice problems before each test, are essential.",
    "I would recommend this course. The demonstrations are useful for reinforcing the material by looking at it differently. However, the lectures don't always match up with what you have to read in the textbook. This can be confusing when you're discussing something in lecture that you read in the textbook a week ago.",
    "Professor Barrett is wonderful and gives lots of cool demonstrations that show applications of the material you are learning in class. He's a really chill, laid back sort of guy who wants you to succeed. The class isn't curved, and isn't that difficult either, so long as you're willing to learn some physics.",
    "A basic introductory course in physics. I would recommend it only if you had SOME prior experience in physics. If not, I would recommend taking 170 since many people who took 180 and were not exposed to physics before ended up dropping the course. Be prepared to do a lot of self learning. Concept questions in class were useful. Be careful on your p-sets! Course material is not hard and is manageable. Not a very exciting class, but it is okay in terms of workload. Gets the physics requirement out of the way. Professor Barrett is a great person though!",
    "I would recommend it if they need to get a physics requirement done, because its significantly easier than 200.",
    "Take it if you have to. I think I learned more than my friends in phys 170 and this course was less stressful than phys 170, but it is not easy. Try to keep with the material on a weekly basis and solve as many problems as you can.",
    "You probably have to take this. Just do it. I was literally one of less than five people in the class who hadn't taken AP Physics in high school. To do well, just learn his practice tests because his exams are practically identical. But don't expect to learn anything new (unless you didn't take physics before -- if that's the case, you'll be learning from the book and your peers).",
    "Do the psets with your friends. You will regret coming to class every time you go but you have to (unless you find away around the clickers *hint hint*)TESTS ARE EASY GO OVER PAST EXAMS!",
    "Yes, its definitely easier than 200. Its a lot of work, but if you like physics, you'll enjoy it.",
    "You should probably only take this class if you need to. If you have already taken AP Physics C in high school than most of the material should be familiar to you. There was some fluids and thermo stuff that I hade never gone over in high school, but everything else was new to me. The problem sets are fari and as along as you read the textbook you should be fine. The online quizes before each lecture are very easy and you can take them multiple times until you get a perfect score. If you have never encountered physics before or have a difficult time with it then maybe 170 would be better, but this class is a fair introductory physics class.",
    "Take it if you want an easy physics class - it's a huge step away from physics 200. Also Professor Barrett is awesome.",
    "If you are okay with the idea of teaching yourself all of the material through the textbook and problem sets, then this is a good course. If you want a class that is more in depth with the conceptual aspect of physics, you may want to look elsewhere.",
    "Much different than physics in HS. I came in with a 5 in Physics B and felt that this course was much more difficult than anything that I had done before. I felt that we didnt do enough (or any) example problems in class that were applicable towards the problem sets. Class mostly consisted of basic clicker-questions or unrelated demo's that didn't really help when it came time to do the HW. Definitely you need to be able to teach yourself from the book. If youve taken Physics C in HS you may be more prepared than I was. Do-able, but more complex than I expected.",
    "Take it if you have to. Wouldn't recommend to someone for fun.",
    "Barrett spends the majority of the class doing demos instead of deriving formulas, which makes for an entertaining lecture but doesn't really help for the psets or exams. I mainly relied on teaching myself from the textbook for that.",
    "Yeah I'd recommend it. I don't think the material was overly difficult, and the problem sets and exams were fair enough. Barrett's teaching style is almost entirely conceptual, and well it is not nearly enough to completely learn the material, it gives you a push in the right direction.",
    "I don't wear a helmet when riding my bike up Science Hill because I hope I die before I reach this class.On a serious note, this class was poor and I would not recommend this class. The professor doesn't teach, as much as amuse: there are demos that are supposed to elucidate concepts, but instead of elucidating, they serve to further confuse students (but I'll admit, they were fun to watch). Students who don't have a good background in physics will struggle compared to those who have already taken AP Physics B or C in high school. There are also clicker questions that are interesting, but don't help the student retain crucial concepts.There are NO notes to speak of in the class; you will mostly self-learn the material in the textbook (the textbook itself is also fairly confusing; when proving important concepts through equations, the textbook would often skip important steps, eliminating variables without giving a hint as to what the authors of the textbook did). The professor doesn't write anything on the board. There are no dedicated review sessions or sections, which may be good, but ultimately hurt you in the long run. Weekly problem sets are fine, except for the \"challenge questions\" in which people lose a lot of points on those parts. For those who already took AP Physics B or C, this class won't teach you anything new, and don't laze off: it's harder than you might expect, especially since the lectures themselves are such jokes (with demos like shattering glass, and clicker questions that ask things that are often irrelevant to things important to the exams) that it's hard to take the class seriously.",
    "I took AP Physics C my senior year of high school (I'm now a junior), using the same textbook as this course. I needed introductory physics for my major, but didn't have time to take 200 or 260, so I signed up for this class expecting it to really easy. As it turned out, it was not that easy, and I learned a lot. A fair bit of the class time was spent on entertaining demos and decent clicker questions, so class was generally engaging. The tradeoff was having to learn some things independently in order to do the problem sets, but the textbook is well-written and the physics departments hosts problem set sessions with TA's the three nights before each PSet was due, so there was also plenty of opportunity to ask questions there.Sean Barrett is really cheerful and really enthusiastic, and I think he's only going to get better as a teacher. He clearly has the qualities necessary for great teaching-- he understands the subject marvelously, has the energy and inclination to make class interesting, and cares enough to spend many hours outside of class perfecting demos, making his own derivations sheets, and creating animations to help us understand confusing material. He just needs to fine-tune his use of class time.This was a fairly good class; I would certainly recommend students to take it, especially if Sean Barrett is teaching again.",
    "Physics 180 is a rather fast-paced course that focuses on mechanical physics. As someone taking this class with a good physics background, I didn't find it too difficult, but if you don't have much\/any prior knowledge, you might be better off taking 170, especially if you have to take it with Professor Barrett.",
    "Physics 180 is a lot of work, though the first two weeks may indicate that a lot of material is review. Success relies on your willingness to go to a lot of help sessions, because the material that's graded is not necessarily the material covered in class.",
    "A good intro course. Manageable without having a large physics background, but only if one is willing to do the textbook reading and spend a decent amount of time on the problem sets.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF POSSIBLE. I've heard physics 260 is a good course, so try to take 260 instead of 180.",
    "Take it if you have to, probably don't if it's not necessary, but it won't be miserable or anything.",
    "He's just a bad intro physics instructor. His teaching methods don't clearly teach physics. He has no structure in his lectures and the material he writes on his board is so small. Sitting even in the front row is impossible to read his handwriting because it's so small. His demos don't explain things well. He repeats simple physics concepts over and over and over again and he never goes into more complicated concepts in lecture. None of his lecture helps students to solve problem sets. He teaches conceptual physics and excepts you to magically do the math behind it. He's just a terrible professor.",
    "180 is fast-paced, and you will have to teach yourself problem solving skills from the book, because the class is mostly demos and clicker questions (which are fun and interactive but won't help you that much for the exams or problem sets). If you have some physics experience from high school, or if you put in a good deal of effort to learn from the book, you can do well.",
    "Yes i would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in learning physics",
    "Professor Barrett is really nice, but lecture isn't very helpful (though you have to go for the clicker questions). The material on the problem sets is much harder than the material you learn in class, but the textbook and the sessions the TAs hold are helpful.",
    "Physics 180 is basically AP Physics Mechanics C with less explanation of the math and derivations of equations and more demonstrations of the concepts in action. The book is spectacular, very clear and easy to understand, but some of the problem sets were difficult without supplemental explanation from the professor.",
    "This class is not really enjoyable in any way, but if you are really interested in physics or if you need to take it, you can get what you need from it. You have to use the tutors. The lectures are mostly worthless, except as entertainment. I thought it wasn't a very good class, but its do-able. Don't expect to learn in the lectures, start the problem set early, find a good tutor and use that person as much as they are available. Unless you need to or really want to, I would not recommend taking this class, but, if you do need\/want to, you can handle it.",
    "Take if needed. Curve is not easy, and the class requires a fair amount of work. Try 170 instead.",
    "Take 170 if you can. Don't waste your time.",
    "Phys 180 is exactly what its description says: University Physics. The class will require to work to understand it and pass, but it is not too difficult. I would recommend it if a student is looking for a good intro science course.",
    "I would say that physics was a very difficult class, although the material was often interesting. I would only recommend the class to another student if they are required to take it for their major or if they are very good at physics and math, as it could be very difficult, time consuming, and frustrating if the material does not come easy to you.",
    "This class is a a higher level high school physics class. It was manageable and I encourage anybody interested in physics to take the class. I enjoyed it."
