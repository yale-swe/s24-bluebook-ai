The learning curve is definitely not as steep as other languages, and the instructors are extremely friendly and helpful. The workload is also much less than other languages, yet I felt like I learned just as much.However, the class is very laid-back: if you are one of those students who needs strict structure and scheduling to succeed, the set-up of the classroom probably won't be to your liking.",
