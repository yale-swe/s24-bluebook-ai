    "Yes, take it if you are interested in clinical psychology and\/or thinking about going to grad school. Only take it though if you'd like to participate in more non-traditional activities\/work",
    "A course that teaches you as much about yourself as it does about clinical psychology -- a MUST-TAKE for anyone planning on being a practicing psychologist, or anyone who wants a break from academia. I find it so refreshing to work with real people, both in my field placement and in class. The helping skills we're learning are infinitely valuable, in our interactions with our peers and in our later professional lives.Professor Lockhart is supportive and encouraging. In addition to being a teacher, she is a clinical supervisor: she advises us on how to interact with challenging individuals at our field placement. She asks us to look inside ourselves and consider our own feelings and instincts. It is nice to have a professor who values clinical practice in addition to research. I appreciate the confidence she has helped instill in me.",
    "The field placement part of this course is the most valuable time you will spend related to a course at Yale. The workload is minimal - you just have to make sure you're being proactive in your field placement. It may sound scary at first working with strangers outside of Yale but it is 100% worth it.",
    "class is what you would expect. more of a personal enterprise then an academic one, nice change from other highly theoretical psyc classes.",
    "This course is fantastic. It is one of few opportunities at Yale to catch a glimpse of the practical side of psychology, and for those interested in public practice, it's absolutely essential. The weekly readings and textbook assignments are engaging, and the ability to practice \"helping skills\" during class is challenging and fun.The observations that take place in mental health clinics and hospitals as part of this class are humbling and inspiring. The experience of working in the field first-hand is invaluable, and the opportunity to be doing it as a part of the class will profoundly affect your life, if you are considering a career in mental health.",
    "It's a great class if you're interested enough in the material, because at times the issues discussed in class are depressing and intense. This class is really all about the placement. Excellent bagels and other snacks every morning. A nice way to start the day.",
    "While the seminar portion of this class is somewhat unstructured, you get this amazing opportunity to do some amazing fieldwork and get great experience in therapeutic settings. Makes you a better person, and (other than the 3-4 hours per week in field work + 2 in seminar) small and easy workload.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you're interested in pursuing a career that serves a mentally ill population.",
    "Clinical Psych is a solid course. The class meets once a week with bagels and tea. A lot of interesting topics are covered but there is not enough integration between the skills we learn and our field placements \/ the subjects we address. The course is mostly about the field placement - that largely determines your experience. So the course is good but not as great as I had hoped.",
    "It is amazing.Whatever your major is you should definitely take it.Professor Lockhart is awesome.Working in your field placement is an amazing experience.And the workload is very manageable.It is a great experience different from any other class you'll take at Yale.",
    "This class is great if you want to volunteer. Be prepared to wake up early.",
    "I took this class because many past students had said in their evaluations that the class will help you decide whether you want to do clinical psych. This is only partly true. The field placements - where you spend a few hours every week at any of a variety of psych-related institutions, maybe doing Big Brother type mentoring with kids at a residential facility, maybe running writing classes for the homeless in the New Haven - are great. There is real bonding and real relationships to be made with the people in your placement and the other Yalies you go with. So this will give you a chance to work with a certain population you otherwise wouldn't and see if you enjoy the environment. But it will NOT give you many real skills, and the seminar component is entirely non-academic, more of a discussion support time for your field placements. Because it gets you out in the community and gives you an organized way to actually help someone and apply practical knowledge, it's great for getting a taste of the psych world and what there is to do. An internship might be better and give you more latitude and depth. But because it's not academic at all and so far hasn't touched on what the different clinical psych jobs there are out there and what paths to take to get them, it's a limited experience.",
    "This class provides amazing opportunities to work in the community and gain clinical experience - take advantage of it and of the journals! The seminar itself is also fascinating although was a little big this year. Kristi Lockhart loves what she does and has an incredible amount of knowledge about clinical psychology, and she manages to convey this in both a practical and passionate way."
