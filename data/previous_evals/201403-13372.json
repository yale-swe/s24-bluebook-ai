   "comments": [
    "I would summarize as a course about cancer and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in biology.",
    "A great class! Lots of mechanistic discussions of cancer with the class centering on pertinent papers in the field. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Topics in Cancer Biology is a great freshman seminar. The workload is very light and the information is interesting for science-minded students. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "I really enjoyed my time in the freshman seminar. The class is very geared towards biology-loving students. The papers can get quite technical and complex and students with only a casual interest and knowledge of biology will not get the most out of this class. That being said, there were a few non-bio majors in the class, so don't worry if you want to take this class but not pursue biology long-term.",
    "By far, my favorite class this semester. If you're pre-med or you're into bio research, take this class so you can get to know Sandy well and learn awesome stuff about cancer you otherwise probably wouldn't learn until med school. If you're not pre-med, take this class because it'll educate you about a disease that has way too many misconceptions in our society. You do need to have a pretty solid bio background to understand what's going on, but otherwise it's not too difficult to keep with the pace of the class.",
    "Topics in Cancer Bio is an amazing freshmen seminar. Any student interesting in cancer research should most definitely take this course. It was my favorite course of the semester, and I was sad to see it end. This class does require prior knowledge of AP biology and AP chemistry in order to get the most out of the course. The course load is pretty light, with one \"p-set\" per week and one book to read throughout the course.",
    "I highly recommend this course IF you're a super biology nerd. It's a great class and there is so much to learn in it!! If bio interests you, then this course is excellent for improving your knowledge. The workload isn't too bad, but the assignments are challenging.",
    "I think this course was the best class of my first semester at Yale. This is a truly valuable course. You will learn both the theory and the clinical knowledge of cancers. You will learn how we have advanced and will advance our research, from the ancient times to the near future. You will learn the story of research. If you are genuinely interested in cancer research, if you are ready for some truly challenging biology, and if you see reading hallmark research papers by the giants of cancer science as a promising adventure, do not hesitate to take this class.",
    "I originally signed up for this course expecting it to be shaped around \"Emperor of All Maladies,\" a popular science book about cancer, and was surprised by the first pset which disabused me of such notions. A few of my friends, panicking, dropped the course, but I am glad I didn't as it reinvigorated my interest into the basic sciences, specifically biology\/chemistry, which had waned in my senior year of HS. I now am seriously considering trying to double major in MBB and CS to, in the future, do graduate studies in bioinformatics.",
    "This class is great. I would definitely recommend taking it. Sandy is an absolutely incredible professor -- he's so lovable, approachable, and helpful. The material that we cover is a little complex at times, but Sandy does a great job of making sure that everyone understands it well, even if he does move quickly through the lectures at times. Usually, you'll have a lecture about a topic from Sandy during the first class of the week, followed by a pset about a relevant seminal cancer research paper, and then, during the next class, a small group will present on that paper. I found this structure of the class to be extremely conducive to understanding the material presented, and I felt at the end of the semester that I had gained a lot from this class, both in terms of the actual content of the class and in terms of critical scientific analytic and writing skills."
