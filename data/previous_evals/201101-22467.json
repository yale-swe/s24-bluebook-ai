   "comments": [
    "I believe that Introduction to Psychology covers a lot of material that is taught in PSYC 150 so if you are looking for a general introductory course I would recommend PSYC 110 instead. If you want to gauge your interest in Social Psychology, you can take this course. If you haven't taken an introductory psychology course you will find the material interesting. However, it is not easy to get an A in this class even if you have already taken PSYC 110. There are two paper assignmentsand the professor expects you to produce testable hypotheses for each. You may even be asked to present a proposal for a research experiment. While all of this sounds very interesting, papers aren't graded leniently! The professor was often unclear about what she expected from the students. The midterm exam consists entirely of MCQs and the phrasing of the MCQs can often be very confusing. Also, since the professor uploads all the lecture slides on classes v2, there is little motivation to go to class. If you do decide to take the course however, I would recommend attending all lectures because most of the slides only contain headings, graphs or pictures which you will not be able to understand unless you go to class. Overall, the course load is less because there is no section nor are there any weekly assignments due.",
    "Shop other psychology classes for professors who are more engaging, easy to understand, and fair. Social psychology can be a fascinating subject, which is the reason why many students fought to takethis class. However, the majority of us were disappointed by the end of the semester. Look for a class with lectures that make you feel like a competent learner and challenge you to think outside of the box.",
    "i think you learn a lot and is interesting. even though i disliked the teacher I liked the material so much that i was happy to stick with it",
    "Old material, most information is covered in Introduction to Psychology. I would not recommend it unless you have an interest in Psychology. If you are looking for a pretty easy SO credit, it's not a bad option either.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class. The class at first is really easy and low stress then after the midterm, the next paper is graded really hard, and the final is all essay, whereas the midterm was multiple. Also, be aware that there are 4 assignments (2 papers, a multiple choice test and a final) worth 25% each, and there are no re-writes or anything for papers. LaFrance will NOT help you if you're struggling so you're own your own. Please listen to these reviews. The class had horrible reviews before I took the class, and I ignored them. I regret ignoring them, because this has been the worst class of my Yale experience.",
    "I took it Cred\/D so it was ok. Didn't have to go to class. Everything is on the slides. However, I think it would be a hard class to get an A in.",
    "Great course with such interesting material.",
    "Sure, it's good. Idk, take it if you're a psych major. The readings are interesting. Two exams and two five page papers, not bad. Exams can be a little tricky though.",
    "Psych 150 can be a really interesting class, as it puts a different perspective on everyday phenomena. However, this year they added the \"culture\" facet that felt really forced to me. Also, if you want to just come to class and listen to the lectures, this class might get annoying. They try really hard to make it interactive which, in a class of 50 people, is kind of annoying. That said, the midterm and final weren't very difficult and neither were the two papers.",
    "Maybe? Actually probably not. To be honest, you don't really learn anything you wouldn't already have learned in intro psych. Despite the easy content, the professors make the essay prompts unnecessarily difficult and are pretty picky with the grades. The tests are pretty easy. Lecture is fine, but not spectacular. Definitely one of those classes you can skip and do well.",
    "Social Psychology was one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. The lectures were disjointed, poorly organized and the teachers, while enthusiastic, didn't really teach us anything. The content of the course was largely commonsense and despite promises at the beginning of the semester to prove that social psychology was not commonsense, I remain unconvinced. To add insult to injury, the way the course was assessed was absurd. With two papers on ridiculous topics (watch Fahrenheit 9\/11 and write about an assertion about human behavior; don't smile for a day and write about how that made you feel) and two exams that ignored all psychological studies about learning (one was all multiple choice and the other was all essays), I don't feel like I was even tested on the course's content. The course was capped to encourage discussion, which did occur, but the ban on laptops meant I went to study for the exam with terrible notes. I would not recommend this class to anyone. It made me seriously consider dropping the psychology major.",
    "This course provided a more comprehensive review of many of the topics introduced in Intro Psyc. The lectures focused on every detail of experimental studies--a technique that provided much insight into the social psychological principles analyzed but also made many of the lectures a little arduous to sit through. For the amount of *social* psychological principles discussed and analyzed, it would have been helpful if the lectures included videos or some other media that directly showed the principles at work with actual people. It's one thing to read about how certain concepts work, and it's another thing to actually look at the concepts in action. Social psychology is definitely an area of study that allows for the second type of study, and this class did not really take advantage of that. Professor LaFrance and Alexandra are extremely knowledgeable and explain the concepts incredibly well, but the lecture style does not highlight how good their teaching can really be. 1 MC midterm, 2 short papers, and an essay final.",
    "Sure. Very interesting material. Take the class if you're at all interested in social psych, but be aware that the grading is arbitrary at best!",
    "Fun general and broad. Love the topics, wish they got deeper.",
    "Very interesting. Nice overview of psych 101 within cultural context. Seems like common sense, and the readings are pretty good. Not too much work - 2 exams and 2 5-page papers, each worth 25%.",
    "Social psych does cover a lot of topics that might be covered in intro psych or other psych classes, but I really liked this class. Take it if you're interested in the subject!",
    "Most of the material covered in the course seems to be somewhat intuitive, even taking \"hindsight bias\" into consideration. It is basically a repetition of Intro to Psych.",
    "If you are willing to have about 5 personal meetings with the professor (which you will need in order to understand what they really want from you when you write essays, etc), then take this class. The material itself is awesome.",
    "The class had fun and engaging lectures that tended to utilize a fair amount of class involvement -- something unusual for a lecture course of its size.The class was based on 4 total grades, each weighted 25%: two exams and two papers. It was therefore important to know the rubric for how the papers were being graded, because otherwise you could lose a lot of points and your grade would be sunk.",
    "My least favorite course I've taken at Yale (and I'm a psych major, so I like this kind of thing). First of all, it isn't remotely interesting, unless you are the sort of person who will find it surprising that people are racist, or that people who are unhappy are more likely to get divorced, or that people with more self-confidence are happier (those are real \"findings\" from studies we learned about in class). Secondly, the grading is totally arbitrary and you have no idea what the assignments are looking for. One of the papers is actually about spending a day smiling at everyone and writing about how you felt. You will learn nothing, but you may well get a terrible grade because it's so hard to figure out what you're actually supposed to have learned. Strongly do not recommend.",
    "...No need to take this. It was easy, but it ultimately felt like a waste of time. The lectures were little more than parroting experiment after experiment, and half-hearted attempts at class participation were totally half-baked and silly.",
    "The material is really interesting, but it's not taught well. Lectures aren't really engaging, and you don't really start to appreciate what you're learning until you watch videos in class, do the readings, and start learning the material for exams. I don't know how I feel about the co-teaching format - neither of them were great professors. If someone else is teaching the class, definitely take it. But if Professor LaFrance is still teaching it, only take it if you think you'll like the material or if you're looking for a class that's not too much work. It's really interesting stuff but be prepared to engage yourself. The workload really isn't bad at all. The papers are short and pretty fun to do. The midterm isn't too bad but make sure you've done the readings because she tends to ask specific questions. The final was somewhat challenging, but if you studied you'll be fine.",
    "You might think this class will be really easy but the essays are INCREDIBLY arbitrarily graded and you learn nothing from writing them.",
    "Unraveling the tiniest bit of the mystery of the human brain, particularly with regards to social settings. those interested will either find the course extremely fascinating, or at the very least interesting, hence I would recommend it to anyone interested in psychology in general."
