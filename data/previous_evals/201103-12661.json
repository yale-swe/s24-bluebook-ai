    "This is a really fun class -- you basically spend a semester doing a little work and getting to know the other majors. If you've done some work on your project over the summer (or even know your topic) it isn't too stressful. The regular steps you have to take may be a pain during the semester, but they'll be hugely helpful later, and you'll be feeling better than your poli sci friends. The atmosphere in the class is great, the professors are awesome, and then there's the Adirondacks.",
    "Happy EVST senior essay writing?",
    "Helpful if you like deadlines. A good way of getting to see what your peers are doing. You're required to take this course as an EVST major anyway."
