    "This year-long sequence (125 and 126) was my favorite academic experience at Yale thus far. I can't think of a better way to begin one's time at Yale as a freshman, receiving both a rigorous introduction to poetic tradition and extensive practice in writing. Professor Manley is extremely helpful and approachable, and the course readings are always enjoyable and manageable. I would strongly encourage another student who has any interest in poetry to give this class a shot.",
    "If you are seriously interested in the English major or in English literature, then yes, take it.",
    "Solid normal class. Some days are better than others depending on the material. You get a good understanding of the development of English poetry though an increased historical perspective might have been good to connect the various themes and poets.",
    "English 126 is a perfect continuation of English 125, but it is also unnecessary to take them consecutively. Everything in this class relates to things you learn throughout the semester, and I have a greater understanding of allusion and the ties found between different works of the same poet. The papers are enlightening and the readings are fantastic. I would highly recommend this course!",
    "Manley's section is a good section in terms of which poems he assigns you to read (he also does five poets, ending with both Yeats and Eliot). Class discussion could have been livelier, though, and I sometimes felt (especially in the latter half of the course) that we spent most of our time tracking allusions or filling in biographical info without developing a particularly nuanced understanding of any one poem.",
    "This class is a great overview of several english poets. The course allows you to get to know each of them pretty well through studying their different styles. Professor Manley is great, but sometimes seems disconnected to the students a little bit and is pretty serious. The final was more work than the finals in other sections.",
    "Though I wouldn't recommend 125 for non-English majors, I would say this one is on the fence. If you're interested in reading some of the most beautiful poetry ever written in English (and also Alexander Pope), I'd say give it a shot. Despite the somewhat smaller page count compared to many english classes, the material can be quite dense. That being said, I think it's quite worth it.",
    "Engl 126 is a great course if you're interested in the authors. Definitely shop for the professor. Manley is really interesting and very available for office hours if you like his teaching style and are willing to spend a lot of time looking closely at the text."
