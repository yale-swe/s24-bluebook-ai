    "Amazing class--Jennifer Allen is one of the best at Yale.",
    "This is an amazing class and I would one hundred percent recommend it to all history majors or anyone at least slightly interested in German politics or history. Jennifer Allen is one of the greatest professors I've had at Yale, and her expertise in this topic is outstanding. You will learn so much in this class. There is a fair amount of reading, but it is all incredibly interesting and relevant. Absolutely loved this class, cannot recommend it enough.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS I LOVED IT!!!! I was driven to do all the reading because it was so interesting. I loved it. Take it. It's a fascinating discussion of a fascinating country.",
    "Great summary German history course. If you don't take the course, then you're missing out on one of the greatest courses taught at Yale",
    "Absolutely take this class. I could not recommend it more. I am History major and this is one of the top courses I have taken in the department. If you are thinking \"Who cares about German history? This is such an esoteric topic.\" Stop yourself! Not only will you learn about German history, but you will learn how to think about History from one of Yale's brightest cultural historians, Professor Allen. Every single one of her lectures is perfectly curated and planned, and she follows the most detailed and thorough notes as she lectures. There is never any rambling or tangents that confuse you! Really, listening to her lecture is like reading an awesome and super interesting Atlantic article. Besides Professor Allen herself, the course is fascinating and relevant if you are even slightly interested in the European Union and the contemporary state of Europe. You really can't understand Europe without understanding Germany, so take this class! The work wasn't too bad, and the readings were awesome. Not heavy at all, and she includes a ton of primary sources in the syllabus so you're not just reading dense and dry academic literature the whole time.",
    "Everyone should take this class. It is the best study of the history of Germany and the art of doing history itself.",
    "HIST 254 is a course I would definitely recommend. It provides a comprehensive overview of German history during the time period, but it really is interesting material and is taught by a professor who is truly passionate about it. The course is definitely tough and Professor Allen has high expectations, but she provides the resources necessary to succeed and is definitely accessible and understanding. I would totally recommend taking this course as it makes you become a better writer, a better historian, and more knowledgeable about German history.",
    "If you're interested in learning a TON about Germany, its unification, its Nazi past, its role in the Cold War, and its current status, take this class and you won't regret it. It felt risky at the beginning of the year but it's a true gem. Decent amount of work, week to week, however.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who is interested in German history, WWII history, cultural history, political history, or European history in general.",
    "This class is a fascinating overview of German history since the 19th century. The lectures were interesting and full of information. I learned a lot and enjoyed every minute of it.",
    "A decent intro lecture on German history that at times tried a bit too hard to be more than an intro lecture. The course material was a great way to learn about Germany from 19th century unification to present (although I wish more time had been spent on the 1990-present time frame). The coursework load was a bit more than most other intro lectures (4 quizzes, 3 papers, and a final). Prof. Allen's lecture material was interesting although her style at times made it hard to follow and take notes (her lectures are written much like a history book so they become long winded and lacking in engagement at times). She does do a great job integrating the primary and secondary sources as well as audio and visual materials. Grading was also a bit stringent for an intro lecture. Great material but slightly less than stellar execution. I think it'll get better over time as Prof. Allen continues to work with Yalies. Not a MUST TAKE, but definitely worth sitting in on and seeing if you can deal with Prof. Allen's style during reading week b\/c the material is actually pretty interesting. Consider starting CR\/ D",
    "This class is very broad, covering German History from unification on. I would recommend it but be warned: there is a lot of material to cover.",
    "Absolutely take it; it's a lecture that has the deep understanding of the subject that a seminar usually provides. Very interesting readings; lectures are really well-designed and constantly engaging. Professor Allen is a great professor, and this is a good intro to History courses as well as a challenging course if you're already in the major."
