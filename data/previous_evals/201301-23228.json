   "comments": [
    "Read carefully, if you don't you'll get lost in the week to week grind.",
    "I had to take this class for my major, but would be very glad that i did even if it was not required. The workload is heavy but if you are interested in the material, then it is definitely worth it.",
    "If you are an English major, you have to take this. If you're not, but you're interested in these poets, I'd still recommend it. My one caveat: make sure you check out the professor. Ross is basically the best choice out there (on the first day of class he began discussing Paradise Lost by saying \"Milton is like a milkshake...\"), but I'm sure there are other good ones too. From what I've heard, how much you enjoy both 125 and 126 is very much dependent on who is teaching it.",
    "An intense, intriguing course exploring the canon of English poetry since Milton. You won't have the spiritual awakenings of, say, English 127, but you'll read many important texts and you'll reflect deeply on them.",
    "No I wouldn't recommend this class, but it's a requirement for the English major.",
    "The second half of Major English Poets is much more enjoyable, in my opinion, than the first. The works are all really great. Ross is a fantastic professor to take it with, especially if you tend to be a more shy section person, he's so encouraging and supportive. He's also extremely helpful with paper writing and gives great feedback to help improve.",
    "Loved this course! Everyone in the class always had great things to say, and this seminar had the best, most interesting discussions I've been in at Yale.The course itself is awesome and full proof, you're reading some of the greatest poets in English literature. After reading Milton, nothing seems quite as awesome, but that's alright.Prof. Macdonald is Incredibly nice, helpful, great at leading and guiding class discussion, and managed to explain and give a comprehensive run through of poems that I could have never fully grasped on my own. He has a fantastic and pretty comedic way of explaining things (content and form, is like wine in a casket) and really lets us explore topics we choose, letting us know when we seemed to steer off the path and gone to far with our interpretations but also letting us get that far.great at time management and covering everything in the limited class time.Would meet with us anytime and anyplace to talk about anything. You can send him your thesis statements and papers and he will take the time to give you feedback, which is an incredible service on his part.I would take it whether your the english major or not. Prof. Macdonald will help you greatly improve your essays if you finish them early.",
    "I would recommend it because it gives you a great foundation for poetry and gets you into some of the longer and more difficult works.",
    "If interested in poetry or the English major, this class has a lot of great readings by fantastic poets. Not too much writing and the reading is not too cumbersome. If you enjoy poetry you will enjoy the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class: the texts are some of the best ever written, the small seminar format is welcoming, not intimidating, and having a good grasp on the history of English poetry is really useful for analyzing these author's influences in other books.",
    "Only if you are an English major or love poetry. But be aware that this is a prerequisite for the English major",
    "Pretty good class - the readings are much better than 125 (sorry, Spenser) and I'm glad that I was exposed to some amazing poets. The workload is comparable to other introductory English courses - a fair amount of reading, and several short essays and exercises evenly spaced throughout the semester. Professor James Macdonald is very kind and really cares about his students, although he can be a little unsure of himself at times. Class discussion was pretty stagnant though, and while this was overall a good course, I think I enjoyed the in-class experience the least out of the English courses that I have taken so far at Yale.",
    "The Major English Poets sequence will definitely give you a wonderful grounding in the western poetic tradition, and you'll be amazed how the knowledge you gain will be helpful in other academic contexts and in everyday life. That being said, I think the quality of experience is very dependent on which instructor you get - I was really lucky to have a wonderful teacher and a great set of classmates, and as a consequence English 126 was definitely a highlight of my semester."
