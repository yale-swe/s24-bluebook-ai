    "One of the biggest strengths of this class was the dialogue that Professor Schwarz fostered during class. Exercises that required us to speak in front of the class and critique each other and work together were extremely beneficial. The only weakness of this class I think was there were not enough recent examples used.",
    "This is a really great course, and the small class size allows for very effective class discussions and interactions. I appreciate the use of videos and several examples and in-class activities that greatly enhance learning.",
    "Strengths: The format of the class was well done. Although it was almost three hours long - it felt short and I was able to focus for the entire duration Weaknesses: None",
    "Strengths - good theoretical background and case studies\/examples used in class",
    "Did a very good job of incorporating different activities that enhanced learning throughout the course, really liked the videos where we could actively see what was right and wrong.",
    "I gained a lot from practicing my communication skills. I enjoyed the videos we watched and the professor's advice from his experience. The readings were also appropriate and the lectures were effective."
