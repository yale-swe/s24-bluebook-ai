   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I did not like the rotating classrooms nor the rotating teachers, as I feel with language learning I enjoy having a consistent group who helps each other and understands each other's growth. It felt very impersonal with strangers constantly. The course also moved very very fast in the second half, while very slow in the first, and I feel like the pacing could have been better. I also strongly dislike the textbook, and wish we had one integrated hiragana Japanese textbook, rather than a romaji textbook and hiragana course packet.",
    "Strengths: The course is engaging and makes sure that you're practicing the material through daily homework and classroom activities. Weaknesses: Some of the classroom activities were confusing. When we were doing more complicated grammar forms and saying them out loud as a class, it was hard to figure out what I was supposed to say (since the voice of the class is jumbled)",
    "The strength was that we met everyday so the previous lessons and vocabulary weren't forgotten. We also practiced speaking in class which I found to be very beneficial. The lectures were fun and easy to understand despite the fast pace of the class. The way in which assignments were to be done was a bit confusing in the beginning, but I got used to it in a few weeks. The book was a little bit difficult to understand, and I would have preferred having one professor for the semester."

    "If you want to learn Japanese, definitely!",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student who is passionate about the Japanese language and culture. This is a great introductory language class for reading writing and speaking that also delves into Japanese culture through these three aspects."
