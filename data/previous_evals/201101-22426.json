   "comments": [
    "Critical Theory is not strictly an art theory course. It talks about serious issues and schools of thought that really influenced artists.",
    "Yes, they are good things to think about. It can get dry though, bring coffee.",
    "The work load is very little though the reading load is heavy. It's worth taking if the student is interested in pursuing studies in art or art history. In this class we work through many different thinkers and each one is as complex as the next. Once you've read enough of them, It helps to think about the readings in comparison for a more complete understanding.",
    "Yes, it is a great crash course in the big ideas of art criticism.",
    "It is a survey of important theoretical texts that can be applied to art making and life in general. Take this class! Even if you're not an art major! I wasn't!",
    "It's a philosophy course directed at art students. We read theories on society and mind and we discuss them weekly. Take this class. As an art major, you sort of have to take one of these theory classes, and I don't know what the Junior Seminar is like, but this one was fantastic. It was over half grad students, although it seemed the undergrads led the discussion for the most part. It sometimes felt like it wasn't really related to art, but I think the point is that in the end of the class, this stuff will really inform your work. Even though it was on a Friday afternoon, I really looked forward to going to this class. It always opened up my mind in a fantastic way.",
    "If the subject interests you, then there is no better teacher to teach it than Jeffrey Stuker. Also it is a great opportunity to see the subject matter from the point of view of students in the Yale School of Art, as a lot of them take it every year. Highly recommended!",
    "I would highly recommend Critical Theory in the Studio. It added invaluable perspective to my own artistic process. Professor Stuker did an great job making very complex philosophical and historical texts accessible and encouraging students to take those ideas and put them in conversation across time and genre. I finished the course much more confident in my ability to offer philosophical and historical commentary on artworks, including my own, as well as eager to continue exploring critical theory outside the classroom.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in life.",
    "The class is a clear overview of a range of extremely important twentieth century thinkers, all of which can be interpreted to have a connection to works of art. The goal of the class is thus to draw out these connections and discover how theoretical ideas may be applied to or expressed by art.",
    "I would recommend the class. It covers very difficult material in a way that is rewarding and comprehensible. The readings and relevant and I found them personally interesting.",
    "Take this class! Should be required for all studio art and art history students. Amazing critical theory survey!"
