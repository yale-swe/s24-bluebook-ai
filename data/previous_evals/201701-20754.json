   "comments": [
    "I learned how to identify literary techniques in older and more contemporary texts, and then to apply those techniques creatively with particular reference to expressions of selfhood. The models of selfhood we examined were wide-ranging. I learned to discuss identities other than my own in a respectful way\/without being purely an academic tourist in those experiences. Our discussions were thoughtful.",
    "A really interesting look into how ideas about the self (and different elements of identities that make up the self) have evolved across time and space. Never thought I'd be reading Augustine and the Kama Sutra in one course, but I'm so happy I got to.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I have nothing but good things to say about it. The syllabus is ambitious but with these professors you can't lose.",
    "This course was really cool, and I feel I learned how to talk about texts in both more philosophical and personal contexts (rather than purely analytical ones).",
    "I gained a much deeper knowledge of the relationship between the philosophy and culture of different parts of the world across different time zones. I also improved my ability to use formal elements of philosophical texts in analysis. Finally, this class prompted a lot of reflection about aspects of my own selfhood, which has been a really wonderful element of the course.",
    "First of all, I just want to say that this class was wonderful, so thank you both so so much. after this semester, I'm much more conscious of the ways in which I present myself, and the ways I perceive other selves in return. And of how both of those shape my perception of myself, of that makes any sense at all. I loves reading and watching so many different things, and I loved the connections we were able to draw across time and space.",
    "historical, truly global perspectives on the self",
    "This was likely the best literature class I have take at Yale. In fact, labelling it simply a literature course probably limits the breadth of material the class encompasses. We thought about selfies, virtual reality, and conceptions of selfhood throughout history. I was really pushed to think and I'm so grateful for it. Take the class!",
    "I really gained a lot in this class -- thinking about the self, thinking about how we can express and write about the self, and thinking about the limits in literature or other media in self expression. We read different and interesting texts, watched movies that I have never seen before, and had really great discussions such that I really was able to engage in a lot of things I hadn't before -- this class really broadened my thinking, and I loved every minute of it!"

   "comments": [
    "The class was brilliant, with creative applications of our learning as a particular highlight which put our knowledge into context. The guest lectures and use of various media (film, television, writing, 3D printing, etc) really enriched the course. The two professors teaching this course complemented each other very well in terms of knowledge, relationships to the texts, personality, etc. and we're able to maintain a strong level of discussion and a constructive and positive environment. The discussions were exceptionally well led and focused. The assignments were all thoughtful, i.e. not just reading responses but rather critical and creative engagement with our learning. Office hours with the professors were hugely beneficial as they engaged enthusiastically with each student's work. The professors could have been more organized and many deadlines were rescheduled. However flexibility around assignments was definitely helpful for producing more thoughtful work.",
    "I wasn't sure what to expect of the class because it is the Modernitiea course, but I was overjoyed to find that it wasn't like a repeat of DS (which i thought it would be)!",
    "The breadth of the syllabus (across authors, historical periods, genres, etc.) is at once what makes this class incredible and what makes it feel a bit cursory at times. It's good to think of the class as an EXCELLENT survey course.",
    "I wish it were longer! In seriousness, I think this class may have been better as a once-a-week two hour seminar. It would take a little while for the discussions to get going, but once they did, it always felt like they were being cut off too early.",
    "I loved the design of the class - the wide-ranging material, the three \"mini-units,\" the instructors' ability to bring intersectional perspectives to all kinds of material from so many different time periods and traditions, and the insightful discussions we had. I would say that just giving more clarity on assignments and instructions for projects would be the only improvement.",
    "This class was awesome! It's strength is definitely in the ways in which the professors were able to connect such diverse material in such a cool way. I only wish we talked more about the creative project, and perhaps even expanded it to take up the whole semester? Only because I had a great time doing it, and plan to continue working on it, and I only wish I had had more time to allow it to evolve as the semester progressed",
    "not much really, great course",
    "I wish I could have gotten more feedback on how to improve my writing and thinking.",
    "The strengths was the interesting variety of things that we read and looked at in considering the self, and the high level of energy that everyone in the room brought to the table, including classmates and professors. There is not much about this course that I think could be improved -- only that we had read really interesting things that I wanted to be able to talk more about but there was not enough time."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this course. The creative assignments really engage students with their learning from a curriculum of authors that is wonderfully diverse in a considered way. I entered this course with limited skills of literary analysis but the contextualisation of what we learned made me very excited to engage in our class discussions and acquire those skills.",
    "Absolutely! Loved what we learned and loved the atmosphere of the classprof. Ramachandra and Figlerowicz are amazing. Marta is SO COOL- great at facilitating discussion and always found a way to validate student comments\/link them more strongly into the main discussion. Ayesha does a wonderful job initiating discussions and making students go deeper and think more critically. I hope to take a class with both again!",
    "Take this class! Take this class!",
    "I would heartily recommend this course to another student. I think it's a great and approachable humanities course, even for non-humanities people, and I think it is one of a rare few courses that encourages you to make the material personal. Making the readings and discussions personal makes for a highly engaging and special class experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The syllabus seems crazy and ambitious, but it's so well thought through. The wide range of time periods and cultures it covers is wonderful, and all the assignments build on each other. Our discussions were wonderful and thought-provoking. Professors Figlerowicz and Ramachandran are wonderful, brilliant people who have put together an exceptional class. Also, the guest speakers were incredible and really added to the class. The workload is totally manageable and enjoyable. This is a wonderful class to take!",
    "yes! It's so fun, and the professors are great. You'll bond with both of them, and the rest of the class, while learning a ton about three world and yourself. In that way, it's like a much better and more interesting version of Life Worth Living, I suppose.",
    "yeah! its a great course, and if you're a humanities major you kinda gotta take it",
    "I would definitely, 100% recommend this course -- it was super fun, interesting, I learned so much, and I loved the people in it. It is one of my favorite classes that I have ever taken in my life, and definitely at Yale so far!!"
