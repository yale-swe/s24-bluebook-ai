    "yes, this is an excellent lab. do four labs and write four pretty long reports. but dr. parr gives clear expectations and feedback.",
    "Chemistry 251L was my favorite class of the semester. I learned a lot, the compounds are all fun colors, and the last lab of the semester (we made solar cells, soaked them in anything from grape soda to kiwi to mouthwash, and ran around with them measuring voltages) was a great wrap-up. The lab had no practical, no final lab report, and was fun.",
    "It's probably not the worst chemistry lab out there but it's not exactly great either. This is probably another \"take it only if you have to\" course.",
    "Covers an interesting variety of experiments in the field of inorganic chemistry. More independence expected from the students, which was a good thing.",
    "I would definitely take this class again. Although you don't have to take this class to be a chem major, the techniques are very useful even if you're not going into inorganic chemistry. I work in an organic lab and most of the techniques I learned in this lab were more helpful to me than what I learned in organic lab. In addition, this lab a lot more chill. It's a small lab group, not overrun by crazy premeds, and unlike other labs I've taken, the experiments are actually tailored to work so you talk more about the chemistry than why you fail as an experimenter.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this lab to other students.",
    "This course is probably the best one that you can take for an advanced lab credit. The reports take a long time, but I always felt like I was learning something while writing them. Also, the section sizes, at least when I took it, were very small and I got to spend a lot of time talking chemistry with the TA and Doctor Parr.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Part of it was Dr. Parr. I definitely recommend taking a class with Dr. Parr, even if it isn't this one. One of my favorite teachers here at Yale, hands down. I really enjoyed the experiments themselves, and thought it gave a nice, broad overview of what experimental inorganic chemistry means. A very worthwhile course to take.",
    "Recommended to supplement Inorganic lecture course.",
    "lol what?",
    "If you need a lab and have some interest in inorganic chemistry this is a good class to take."
