    "learnt R from scratch in this class",

    "- R coding - applied basic statistical methods - interpreting linear regression - interpreting logistic regression",
    "R skills.",
    "I learned how to use R for data analysis.",

    "Good training and practice in R",
    "Data management, data analysis",
    "statistical skills",
    "I learned how to program in R (enough that I feel like I have the foundations to write whatever code I need to in the future - I will just need to look up specific syntax), how to manipulate a large data set, and good understanding of a select number of statistical tests.",
    "I gained the ability to think about analyzing data in code and string together arguments that would often work on the first try, rather than troubleshooting for hours. I also developed the ability to make graphs with a much better understanding of the specifics in both base R and ggplot."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good lecture preparation, homework tie closely to the in-class content and help cement our knowledge of R.",
    "Good chance to know R language but the class is limited to teach you to be a master",
    "Some weeks felt really repetitive, and we wasted a lot of time cleaning data throughout the semester. At the same time, repetition is important for learning a new programming language. Students will leave the course with strong foundations that will help them find internships and jobs. Lastly, the TAs went rogue, which I fault the instructors for. A rubric should have been made available to everyone involved with the course.",
    "Sometimes, the speed is too fast.",
    "a LOT of code work, that's so nice!",
    "Great!",
    "Susan Wang should teach the entirety of this course--she is very clear in her lectures and her explanations of techniques. I would have liked to see more math behind the models, and would have also liked to better integrate coding into the stats, not vice versa.",
    "Great class that properly teachers you R. So many office hours to choose from. That's amazing. There is always help available.",
    "Very good course overall. A class teaching you the basics of any language\/ application is never going to be super hilarious and engaging. Given this constraint I think the course was as engaging, pleasant and interesting as it could be without becoming silly. Really good interplay between Joe and Susan in the lectures, helping each other out catching each others mistakes and adding small additional footnotes and points of interest along the way.",
    "The topics were relevant and useful. However, often lectures were problematic in that if you had one issue with your code it was difficult to recover and still be able to get what you needed to learn out of the lecture.",
    "I really liked how enthusiastic both Susan and John were. I especially appreciated Susan's lecture style, which included adding code progressively throughout the lecture. I found it harder to follow John's lectures because all the code was already in the class Rmd files in large chunks, so it was difficult to know exactly what each step accomplished. Strengths: - progressively advanced R coding - included supportive resources - homework tested knowledge, very helpful - final project very helpful - lots of support Weaknesses: - could have slightly more explanation in lecture notes",
    "The course layout was great, and the professors utilized the course website really well to make everything convenient for learning.",
    "This was an extremely well-done class. I had previously taken a different statistics course at Yale to learn R, but I barely learned anything in that class. This class was so much better and left me feeling quite confident using R. The lectures were clear and helpful and enjoyable, the homework really helped me learn without being too difficult, and I really liked that we could ask questions and get help from the instructors and other students in the class via an online forum. The instructors really seemed to care about us and our success with R.",
    "I learned the most when we went step by step through the code and typed it simultaneously.",
    "strengths: pretty good and suitable for beginner!",
    "Prof Xiaofei (Susan) Wang was fantastic. Prof. Joe Chang often seemed unprepared, meandering, and hard to follow. The class would have benefitted if Prof. Chang had done additional preparation before class. Grading occasionally seemed capricious.",
    "Very good lecturer",
    "the course is not really an \"introductory\" course",
    "I liked that the entire course was taught directly in R with the students following along, without any powerpoint lectures, etc. I think they did a good job of teaching us statistical methods by example, although I think a little more theory\/background behind the tests would have been helpful.",
    "There are almost all strengths to this course; it is one of my three favorite courses between undergraduate and graduate school. Strengths include: (1) homeworks are problem-based and follow lectures perfectly, (2) all lectures are done completely in the coding window, (3) all students (and professors) are working in R studio, (4) course website was constantly updated and lectures were available before and after class, (5) everything was done in an Rmd - which I thought was VERY valuable. The only critical comment I have is that the code organization between both instructors was different and took a bit to follow when changing between instructors.",
    "Great course, very engaging and applicable material."

    "Yes! Very good course for beginners in R.",
    "yes if you want to learn R the hard way",

    "Yes. A very interesting class, a lot to learn and the methods are very cool and applicable!"
