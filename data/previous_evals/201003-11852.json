   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in literature with a working knowledge of german",
    "If you're taking this class it's probably because it's in the 170's and it's required. It's okay but there are better classes in the department.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It seems intimidating at first because of the amount of reading and the level of comprehension and discussion, but it's actually appropriate for advanced students of many different levels.",
    "Definitely! Make sure you have a look at the reading list though. The German department is usually pretty flexible and I would highly recommend the list that Ansgar chose this semester as a reference point.",
    "This course offered consistently good discussion based on close reading of key texts. It was a very well run and well designed class. How much you get out of it, though, probably depends largely on your skill and speed at reading German. I found several of the texts too long or difficult to get through in the allotted time period."
