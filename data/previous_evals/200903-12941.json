    "Try to get Ganssle! He's the man.",
    "this is a great course for getting an introduction to philosophy, probably the easiest of the DS classes and the lectures are generally the best.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS philosophy, because we covered some of the great philosophical works that have shaped our culture, and were able to see them as a progression of thought that has led to the beliefs and ideas that shape everything from our religious views to our governments.",
    "I would recommend DS to anyone who loves to read and is actually interested in this stuff. It's much more fun if you do the reading, and you can only convince yourself to do the reading if it's something you want to read. It isn't for the faint of heart, so make sure you're committed.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Dr. Ganssle is a great section leader and a fair grader. You will learn critical thinking and analytical writing skills. A very good intro philosophy class.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would definitely take this course with Professor Ganssle if possible.",
    "DS Philosophy with Professor Ganssle was a great class. The course consists of a month of Plato, a month of Aristotle, Epicureans, Skeptics, and medieval Christian philosophers. The readings were challenging at first (especially if you've never had any exposure to philosophy), but eventually you get used to them and develop a greater appreciation. Philosophy really challenged me to think about why I believe what I believe; it was really interesting to be exposed to all these other viewpoints. And Professor Ganssle was a wonderful section leader; he's super nice, and is genuinely interested in what you have to say. He provided lots of guidance with the first paper and helped me develop as a writer after that. Get his section if you can.",
    "I would summarize the course as a general survey of philosophy from Plato to Aquinas, with focus on Plato and Aristotle, and intended to be followed by the more modern works covered in DS 004. I would recommend it, because the texts studied and class discussions provided a strong basis for the subject and helped me understand how philosophy works in general.",
    "DS Philosophy involves a survey of some of the major works and ideas of the ancient world, beginning with Plato and moving to the Christian philosophers Anselm and Aquinas. It's the least reading of the three classes, but often takes up the most time because comprehending this material is not easy, especially during the four weeks spent on Aristotle. I would absolutely recommend DS, but be warned that Philosophy is very hit-or-miss. I was very lucky and had Ganssle as a professor (if you can, switch into his section. He's a super nice guy who is basically the Zach Galifianakis of philosophy). I've gained a fairly solid understanding of ancient philosophy through this class. DS Phil is a great intro course for prospective philosophy majors as well as people (like me) who never plan to take philosophy again. So to wrap up: do DS, try to get Ganssle, know that you may not find philosophy as interesting as your other sections.",
    "Often the easiest and most fun of the three DS classes. Enjoy annoying your friends by inserting Aristotle into discussions about just about anything. And Ganssle's section is a highly coveted commodity.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was very illuminating as far as learning about the world and really made me think a lot, as well as question my own ideas. It was a great class.",
    "I would highly recommend Directed Studies to all students, and feel these courses should be required of all students as the foundation of any education as well as the greatest experience to be had Freshman Year.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Western philosophy. This course encourages students to explore the connections among major philosophical works, and it teaches students to carefully analyze major philosophical arguments."
