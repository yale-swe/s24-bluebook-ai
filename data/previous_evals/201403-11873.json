    "Public speaking has been the most enjoyable and most useful class I have taken this far at Yale. If you get the opportunity to take it, TAKE IT. It does not matter if you are a theater studies major (most weren't in our class), hate public speaking (all of us did at the beginning) or love it (all of us did by the end), the class is transformative for every single person. It's not only a fantastic chance to work on your communication skills on stage and off, it's also a special chance to get to know your classmates and become invested in their progress over the course of the semester as well. Overall I cannot speak more highly about the class and think it should be mandatory for every student at Yale. It is four hours out of your week where you get to dance, shout, speak, and listen to your fellow classmates talk about everything from pumpkin seeds to Taylor Swift to micro-nations. Along the way your public speaking skills will improve immensely and you'll learn the value of communicating well and helping others do the same.",
    "Definitely recommend! It's a challenging class, but it got me out of my shell. I wanted to try something new and I'm so glad I did it.",
    "Absolutely fantastic, take it without blinking. You will become a better speaker and love the process. Lots of speaking, lots of watching classmates speak, lots of revision and comments. And the class was simply fun most days. I appreciated how the course asked different things of me than me other classes. Much more in-class practice, less reading, more speeches than papers. Professor Morrison is a fantastic teacher. Take it.",
    "Every student should take this class, the skills involved are incredibly important, and the lessons are very effective.",
    "This class will help you realize the true implications of Professor Morrison's statement, \"All speaking is public speaking.\" If you put forth effort in this course you will make gains you can be proud of. You will learn about articulation, tone of voice, gestures, structures, posture, visual aids, gender\/racial\/national\/social norms, public relations, advertising, your classmates, and yourself. If you take a spot in this class, don't waste it, because you can be sure many other people wanted that spot. And don't take this class unless you are serious about examining yourself and your habits--this is a really valuable opportunity.",
    "Take it no matter what you are majoring in!",
    "An incredible class to help a student become a better speaker and a better listener. With an incredible instructor, students learn to work to their individual needs with the help of their fellow classmates. Give speeches, give feedback, and learn about the art of public speaking in ways that will change the way you listen and speak for the rest of your life. I would absolutely recommend this course to every single student at Yale. The skills you learn in this class are skills every single person, regardless of your career path, with need.",
    "This class will teach you to improve your public speaking ability. Your confidence in your abilities will undoubtedly increase. Honestly one of the most practical classes you can take. Especially as a humanities major, but this would obviously be useful to anybody. Yes, definitely recommended.",
    "In this course, you will practice and improve your public speaking skills by presenting four speeches throughout the course of the semester: a speech of introduction, a speech to teach, a speech to initiate action, and a speech to change an attitude. The speeches range length from 2 minutes to 10. Your speeches and outlines are graded, and there are a few other short writing assignments as well. There aren't too many readings, so the workload is manageable.",
    "Public Speaking is a crash course in exactly that; how to speak publicly. But know, this course is so much less about your voice (though that is essential) than it is about your self-awareness when speaking in front of an audience. It is about developing your ability to connect with them in proven and methodological ways. It is about removing the umms or uuhhs the plague our everyday speech."
