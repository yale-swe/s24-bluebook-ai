    "Solid L2 Persian class. Not too much of a time commitment for a language class.",
    "Mahshad isn't teaching next year and you've presumably already taken a semester of Persian, so I don't know what I can tell you. I'll just recommend you make your own wordlist and flash cards and update them regularly.",
    "With this professor, I'd definitely recommend this class! There's a different professor for 2012-2013 though, so I don't really know.",
    "This class was a fun way of learning Persian. I absolutely loved it.",
    "This class was extremely disorganized. Although I took it for a full year, I can say that I learned very little, if anything, by the end. Homework was a waste of time as was attending lecture. In class you go around the room translating a text with the instructor chiming in after every second word to give you the definition of a term that you were supposed to know, but never learned because you're explicitly told to not memorize anything, but somehow magically know it when it is convenient to. Oh and you never speak in this class. It's taught like a dead-language and you are just lectured at for the entire hour. You have no idea what you'll be studying at any point because while the textbook is loosely followed, there is still no structure. This course has neither a schedule nor outline-- or a syllabus for that matter. You're never once told how you are going to be evaluated. You often go to class feeling that there's nothing you can really do to prepare because you're never once told what will be discussed the following day. The way this class is \"taught\" you might as welljust sit around at home with the textbook, an audio cd, and a dictionary.",
    "Persian is a wonderful language that is not too difficult to begin. I absolutely love it! Many many students from my class are moving on to higher levels next year as they are all dedicated to continuing the study of this language!"
