   "comments": [
    "The course was great, and I feel my French really did improve after L4. There is a variety of short stories, novels, and films that expose you to various French-speaking countries. I liked this course more than L3.",
    "I only took this class to fufill a language requirement but if you are interested in learning french it is a good way to do it.",
    "A lot of French in a very short time. Expect to put in the hours, otherwise you won't get as much out of it as you should.",
    "Similar to French 130 but at a faster pace with a more daily homework committment.",
    "I would not recommend this course to any of my fellow classmates. I do not feel that my French has improved to a level that is commensurate with the amount of effort that I have put into this course. All in all, I believe that this course was a wasted semester, and a continuous source of frustration, which actually took away from my other courses. By no means would I suggest to any of my peers that they should take French at Yale.This is by far the worst language department that I have encountered in my academic career (I have now taken four languages in three different universities\u0097Spanish, German, Russian, and French). I have taken two semesters of Intensive Russian at Yale, and language courses in the German Department at Yale as well, and in comparison, the French Department at Yale is lacking. Thus, I wish that I had taken a different language to fulfill my department\u0092s credit requirementPlease see my response to Question 1 to understand why I am responding in this manner.",
    "French 140 is great. It's a solid course with good grammar, vocab, and listening materials. Most of the readings are good, with the exception of La Symphonie Pastorale. I hope they replace that in the future.",
    "Yes. The class teaches you French very quickly and effectively."
