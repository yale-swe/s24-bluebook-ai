    "Yes - I can't imagine claiming to be an OB scholar without some of the discussions we had in this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "I would highly recommend it since it is a well-structured course that provides a fantastic overview of the numerous topics inside organizations.",
    "I think this course is a \"must-take\" for anyone interested in organizational behavior theories.I was not able to submit my response to Question 2. Please see comments below:Amy: Amy is fantastic!She is great at facilitating discussion, encouraging us to think deeply about a subject, and challenging us to consider other perspectives. I appreciated her willingness to meet outside of class. She is so knowledgeable in this area, and it was wonderful opportunity to learn from her. The back and forth with Jim was a real highlight of the course.Jim: It was such a privilege to take a course taught by Jim. His way of thinking challenged me to see issues in unexpected ways. I love the hypotheticals and examples he would bring up in class. I always appreciated his comments on the reflection papers; they made me think more critically about the subject matter. I enjoyed the banter between him and Amy!",
    "I would recommend this course to a PhD in psychology, sociology, or economics.",
    "The course covers a variety of topics relevant studying to phenomena \"inside organizations\". While the goal is to introduce participants to the workthat has been done, it also provides the opportunity to critique some of this work. Most notably, it also helps students identify big gaps in our understanding that remain and think about how these gaps might be addressed. The course is also unique in that it considers questions that cross levels of analysis, rather than taking a specifically micro or macro perspective.Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. As discussed above, it provides a good overview while also helping one identify avenues for research."

   "comments": [
    "Extremely helpful in providing exposure to key theoretical concepts - direct benefit to dissertation\/research.",
    "Provided a rich overview of the themes addressed by this interdisciplinary field, and provided both depth and breadth that will be useful through the remainder of my career.",
    "This course exposed me to some concepts that I had not encountered before in the discipline, but overall I am not sure whether it has contributed much to my dissertation\/research.",
    "The course provided extensive background in organizational behavior, which I will apply to both my dissertation and future research endeavors.",
    "This helped me get a handle on the major concepts in both the micro, meso, and macro space of OB. It also helped me develop skills that link disparate concepts together.",
    "As discussed above, this course provided a good overview of work on questions \"inside the organization\" topics. This is a major domain within the field, so developing such an understanding is invaluable. It will also help with my dissertation research by helping me position my research within this broader canon."
