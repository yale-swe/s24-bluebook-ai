   "comments": [
    "Great for anybody that wants to gain a grasp of advanced economics papers.",
    "You'll learn all about human capital (education, health, migration, infrastructure, poverty, etc.) policies and programs in Latin America and how to read an empirical paper and how to distinguish quality papers from substandard ones will prove to be really useful in the future. Plus you'll learn numerous new and cutting-edge empirical methods and familiarize yourself with the process of writing a research proposal which is very useful, specially if ur planning on writing an econ senior essay or on going to grad school or on being a research assistant of some kind.YES. Definitely.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course if you're interested in learning how to interpret data and come up with creative solutions facing Latin America.",
    "The class is heavy in econometric and relies on economic papers, so if you are comfortable with econometrics I would definitely recommend the class because McKee is a great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any econ major. Especially if you are a junior who is considering doing a senior project. The final paper really helps you learn tools for how to do research and methods to use in a research paper.",
    "Great econ seminar to take.",
    "Definitely take this course. It is useful material, interesting material, and the professor is really helpful and extremely adept at teaching. Win, win, win. You can't go wrong.",
    "If you are a junior economics major interested in writing a senior essay and find yourself poorly prepared by the other economics classes in the department, take this class! McKee covers all the important econometrics approaches in depth and prepares you to implement and interpret them. however, this class does not use stata, the major assignment is a research proposal rather than a research paper; it will give you the skills to set up a research paper: creating a model, designing an empirical approach, and anticipating results. if you are interested in carrying out the research, however, McKee is more willing than any professor i know to spend time with you after class going over your work and offering advice. you won't be sorry you took this class.",
    "yes!!! sweet class",
    "Yes! Take it if you're interested in development and applied econometrics.I think the value of this course is that it focuses a lot on the econometrics and methods of studies. We applied stuff we learned in econometrics and used it to read the assigned papers. We learned how to interpret graphs, tables, etc. And we learned about all the different methods economists use in their research and how to construct economic models.It is finally a course in which you actually do apply what you learn in other courses. You come out of it with the skills necessary to read, analyze, and critique an economics paper.",
    "Very interesting subjects covered, and you will definitely learn A LOT. For example, by the end you will be able to write your own model and know what type of empirical approach will fit it\/the data.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Good class, good professor, solid way to learn about how to read economics papers.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is a good broad look at different aspects of human capital, it helps students learn to read an economics paper, and the professor is very helpful.",
    "Of course. You're unlikely to find someone else in the Econ department who loves teaching as much as Doug does - it shows, and makes all the difference throughout the semester."
