    "Helped me to think about people and life a little differently. We get so wrapped up in our own lives that we forget the importance of recognizing the stories and experiences of those around us.",

    "Learnt how to read anthropological texts and theory well and efficiently; how to engage in seminar; rudimentary ethnographic methods and analysis; academic group work;",

   "comments": [
    "This class benefitted from the fact that it was a small seminar of only six students as it allowed for really nice discussions. However, I would have liked more guidance from the professor himself. We received a lot of feed back from out teaching fellow, who was really quite wonderful. Class was often the six of us discussing the week's reading, the majority of the time fumbling around, trying to figure out what we had read, while the professor would listen to us struggle, once or twice making a point. It would have been nice to have more facilitated and focused conversation. That being said, it's a great course and Yale should have more sophomore seminars.",
    "This course was great! There were great readings, the lectures were engaging and exciting to go to, and the students in the class made it all the better. The only improvements I have would be changing one of the readings (which the professor is contemplating doing anyways).",
    "Really enjoyed the material and the methods portion. Felt class discussion could be more strongly directed and guided by the professor. Could have been pushed more to consider the essential issues (validity of methods, ethics) of anthropology",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this seminar! The group project was definitely the most memorable final project I have done throughout my time at Yale. The work load was fair and the way assignments are structured helped us stay on track to get the final paper completed on time."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to other students if they were looking for a small seminar where they could engage with the professor and their classmates. Do not take this class if you're not willing to do the readings (which don't take long) and put the effort into developing original thoughts. Don't be afraid to ask questions.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course to everyone at Yale! As an economics major, I learned so much from taking an anthropology course and encourage people who have not done so to take this class with Professor Rogers. Though readings are great and the seminars are engaging and interesting. Please, please take it!",
    "Great introduction to expose oneself to anthropological methods and thinking. Rogers did a great job of facilitating class interaction and explaining class material. Group project really helps you trial ethnography and experience its difficulties and strengths firsthand.",
    "As the only sophomore seminar, this class is perfectly suited for sophomores interested in anthropology or capitalism. The readings were challenging but the amount of reading balanced this out. There are no reading responses required but you must come prepared to participate in class. The midterm and final assignments are fair and give a lot of freedom for students to pick any topic that interests them to pursue."
