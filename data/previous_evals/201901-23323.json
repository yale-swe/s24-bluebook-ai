    "Almost nothing. Qingshi (our TA) helped teach us the LCA program \"OpenLCA\" that our professor didn't even know how to use, even though we were responsible for producing a final project with it. The professor just read from one giant PPT for the entire class, and readings (optional) didn't help our class understanding."

   "comments": [
    "No. I spend a lot of time trying to understand the contend but the theoretical classes didn't help. Chris always answered my e-mails quickly and that helped me, but wasn't enough.",
    "very well",
    "This class fell far below my expectations.",
    "Very poor, I did not actually learn the material until the last few weeks when working on my final project.",
    "I did not expect to face so much difficulty finding data for my project. The actual model building and analysis in life cycle assessment were relatively easy in comparison to the challenges of a) choosing a realistic project, given b) the difficulty in finding data on manufacturing processes.",
    "Poorly - I had great expectations, wishing I would leave the class knowing how to effectively conceptualize an LCA, and was dissapointed left and right.",
    "the lecture wasnt as helpful as it could have been. i wish the software lab session aligned with what we learned in lecture"

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "professor has a lot of experience and expertise",
    "If one were already an expert in life cycle assessment, this class may have been a useful exploration of some finer points in the method. Geared as it was for beginners in the technique, the lack of organization, disconnection between the conceptual and technical aspects of the class, arbitrary nature of some of the assignments, and inscrutable evaluation criteria frustrated any efforts to make this an effective introduction to LCA techniques. Frankly, I finished this class crestfallen. I have a strong desire to learn LCA techniques and, if another instructor comes on in the future, may elect to take the course again.",
    "It's a difficult topic to teach, however it would be helpful if the software we use is known by the instructor so that project expectations align with software feasibility.",
    "The lectures and software tutorials are completely disjointed. It seems that there was little effort to harmonize the two components, and for me the lectures ended up not being very useful. Although the content of the lectures was informative and on the cutting edge of life cycle assessment studies, we were not able to translate this knowledge into our projects, because of the data limitations I previously espoused on in the previous question.",
    "Strengths - the professor is a nice guy. He also gives good feedback on homework assignments, for about 50% of them. Weaknesses: -Homework assignments had nothing to do with LCA work half the time, were outlined poorly, graded unforgivingly, and were essentially busy work. -The teaching style the professor employed was literally reading from a PPT. Unforgivably poor pedagogy. -The final project had to be instructed by the TA 100% outside of the classroom. -The final project dataset was delivered 4 weeks before the due date. -The criteria for the final project was delivered the week before the due date. Seriously? -Check canvas - the average HW grades dipped below 59% at times, and the professor blamed the students. -The professor moved classes to facilitate his personal schedule over student preferences. -This class warrants a tuition refund.",
    "i wish koffler shared a rubric for grading the homework assignments because it was unclear what he expected of us for the weekly assignments."

   "comments": [
    "LCA is a huge skill for the Industrial Ecology track, but I would discourage any student that was considering taking this class unless the whole course changed.",
    "A student might be better served reading a textbook on life cycle assessment and, consulting with the wonderful people up at CIE, undertaking an independent project to learn and utilize the skills.",
    "Be prepared to learn the software as it can be challenging and requires a lot of trial and error.",
    "Always go for the software training office hours if you can to get a headstart on your project.",
    "Don't take this class from this professor. Waste of time, frustrating, and will leave you embarrassed to put LCA on your resume.",
    "if you just need an overview of lca content and what questions to ask, dont take this. it was such a painful course! the final project was so confusing and difficult to execute. koffler was available for questions, but honestly not a very effective teacher in the classroom"
