    "This course offers an introduction to the Langlands program through the lens of derived algebraic geometry. The initial lectures (e.g. those on categorical harmonic analysis) are quite easy to follow, so that anyone with basic undergraduate training can understand the ideas. Over time, the course does get much more difficult as it begins to introduce material from more advanced category theory, topology, and algebraic geometry, but there is always a variety of material in each lecture so that you will never be completely lost."

    "It's tricky because this particular class probably won't be taught again. It has interesting content and got to survey a lot of different areas. Unlike most math classes, it has an idiosyncratic philosophy.",
    "My only complaint is that I wish we did more concrete examples with derived algebraic geometry, but given the time constraints its understandable that we didn't."
