   "comments": [
    "You research in the lab.",
    "It's obviously going to be a completely different experience for each student based on the lab where they work to complete the course. I love my lab. In general, 20 hours a week is less than what it sounds like though and is not impossible to accomplish. You also actually have time to get something done.",
    "Take it if you like research.",
    "If you can take a light course load and schedule those classes conveniently, this is a great way to do the senior requirement. It's enough time to actually accomplish something meaningful for your lab (although probably less than you anticipate). Take some initiative to make it really worthwhile.",
    "If you have the time for it, absolutely yes! I didn't think I could produce meaningful results with only 10 hours\/week of research, so I chose to do 495 (which worked out for the best since I was able to dive deeply into my project and complete the intensive major). Your experience with this course largely depends on your schedule and the lab you work in. I really enjoyed the people in my lab and the work I was doing, so I had a great overall experience. I was able to balance my schedule so that I only went into lab 3 full days a week,which worked well for when I was interviewing for medical schools. Doing this much research would suck if you hated research or the lab you were in, so I would definitely recommend having past experience with your lab before committing to the course. The end of semester assignments aren't hard to complete.",
    "Absolutely choose this option instead of the 485-486 sequence! There is no way you'll be able to spend only 10 hours per week in lab. You will most definitely end up spending close to 20 hours per week. You might as well get 2 credits for it. Most of the other requirements between the two courses are the same.",
    "The experience of this thesis requirement varies from person to person depending on what lab they work in. Expect all your days to revolve around your experiments!",
    "This is a good opportunity to do research for your senior thesis. It's a lot of lab work, and the requirements in terms of papers and presentations are a little high, but overall it was a great experience.",
    "Lots and lots of research. Required for intensive track. If you made the mistake of being an MCDB major then yes I recommend getting a B.S. Doing 20 hours was a good choice for me since I had not done any research at Yale before. I wanted to commit myself to a lab and a project for that last year. And I actually ended up doing more hours than 20 per week and working harder than I ever had.",
    "Pick a lab that you are interested in and get along with people."
