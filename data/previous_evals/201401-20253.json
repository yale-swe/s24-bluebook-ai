    "Make sure you review your materials before every class starts. The topics can go by pretty fast, so make sure you're always tuned in and you should be fine.",
    "I would recommend math 120 to anyone who is interested in higher level calculus and may need it for further studies (sciences and social sciences). It does require some work, especially if you are not very familiar or comfortable with mathematics, but if you do it right, it can even be enjoyable.",
    "I didn't do well, but I would still recommend this class to another student. If you never studied multivariable calculus before, then you're going to have to put in a lot of time to it, but I think it's worth it. The subjects are somewhat abstract, but if you like to think you'll enjoy this course.",
    "I honestly wouldn't recommend this class. It isn't taught in such a way that the concepts mean anything. They just seem like random calculations, and it's frustrating to learn things that have no meaning.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless one has already taken a form of this course in high school."
