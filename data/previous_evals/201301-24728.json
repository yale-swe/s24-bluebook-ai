    "Don't bother trying to get in this class if you are not a senior or junior film studies major.",
    "Great survey.",
    "Take it! Professor Trachtenberg is wonderful and knows a lot about film. He's at his best when you watch clips of the films and listen to him analyze them as they run \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he has such thoughtful and interesting observations. And all of the movies are terrific, so it's all very fun.",
    "Pretty chill- material is really cool. I mean, you can't really beat watching a gritty gangster movie every week.",
    "I loved the course. You get to watch amazing movies and then talk about them. Professor Trachtenberg is a really nice man and you would enjoy his seminar a lot. And I learned so much too! So I definitely recommend it.",
    "A fantastic course in a very interesting subject. The movies and books are all legitimately enjoyable, and you will be glad to have watched them. The seminar runs well, and the professor is great. I would recommend this highly.",
    "An introduction to the film noir genre - films of the 40s and 50s - from Double Indemnity to Touch of Evil. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. The films are great, you learn about what America was like during the film noir era, and the class is overall enjoyable. The workload is very manageable as well."
