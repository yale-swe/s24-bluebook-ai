   "comments": [
    "This is a great course. As it's a survey course, it is pretty broad and gives you insight into various Latin American countries. Professor Echeverri is amazing. She is always willing to meet and cares deeply about her students. She creates a great classroom atmosphere too.",
    "This is a good class if you are interested in the subject matter. The readings are interesting, but class discussion can be a little dull sometimes. It's also a good writing credit if you aren't a fantastic writer because Professor Echeverri is a pretty easy grader on the big essays, and the weakly responses aren't graded individually. They are just factored in to your effort and participation.",
    "I recommend this class to people who may or may not have studied Latin American history before, provides a great introduction!",
    "If you are interested in learning more about the history of Latin America this is a great starting point. The small size allows for students to get to know each other and engage in interesting discussions but also lends itself to many moments of slightly awkward silence which Professor Echeverri ends up filling with her own historical analysis. The readings are all for the most part interesting and manageable which is good because there are weekly reading responses to prepare for class. Overall this is a good class and I ended up really enjoying it.",
    "Very good introduction to Latin American history. I would highly recommend this course. The readings are engaging for the most part and the workload is easy to keep up with.",
    "This course offers an interesting over view of Latin American history with a focus on the 19th Century to the present. I began the course with very little knowledge about Latin American historians by the end was able to place current issues in a historical context. The readings are a balance of primary and secondary sources. I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn more about the topic or try out a history class.",
    "This is a good class to take as something that exposes you to a subject you may not have much background on. Your experience (and research paper) may be more fulfilling if you speak and read Spanish. I did not and wished I did, even though the whole class is English-based."
