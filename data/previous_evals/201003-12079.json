   "comments": [
    "A good introduction to Game Theory, but not terribly exciting. Also, it would be nice if they gave solutions to the problem sets.",
    "Good class. Take it. It's interesting stuff and you'll learn something. Do it for furthering your education and not always with intent of maximiazing your gpa. This class teaches some good life lessons.",
    "This class is awesome. Take it and do the problem sets so you know the information. Then go to office hours each week (not section) and they will give you the answers (before it is due). Do the problem set ahead of time so you understand everything. The material is super interesting and it's presented in the best way possible. Professor Polak is a gift to this university. Take the class and have a wonderful time listening to his jokes and British accent and appreciate the fact that he takes time to come up with interesting games to play with a very large lecture class.",
    "Very interesting course.",
    "Take it if you are thinking about it -- the course is by no means easy, but if you put in some work, you'll find it rewarding.",
    "Take it, 100%. It will be hard at times but overall, amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in expanding their understanding of interactional behavior and strategic thinking. It is definitely a fun course, but does require more math than I had expected before going in. The level of math involved is very reasonable, but at times there is just a lot of equations and calculations needed tosolve problems, which was not something I expected going into it.",
    "Game theory is by far the best class I've ever taken at Yale",
    "Yes, whatever your major is.",
    "A great course full of really interesting problems and practical applications of the theory we learn. I would recommend this course to anybody with a little economics background (I had very little and did just fine) and an interest in logic, probability, strategy, quantitative reasoning, and problem solving. A really fantastic course!",
    "Take it. Professor Polak is a boss and a great lecturer.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Pretty different from typical micro\/macro econ, so some kids sort of struggle and some pick it up more easily. Worth it mostly bc of Polak.",
    "Yes! Take it. It is not hard, if you think you will struggle, take it CreditD.You learn an incredible amount on games motives and just the entire world really.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is NOT easy by any means, but it is FUN. You pretty much learn by playing games in class. It's very enjoyable. Go to lecture and you will be fine.",
    "Polak is a treat. The problem sets can be tricky.",
    "The class was pretty interesting and Ben Polak is a great teacher. The problem sets are pretty difficult though.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend taking it. It's a fun class, but it can be deceptively challenging at times. The problem sets are hit or miss. They might take an hour and a half one week and then 4 hours the next. But YES take it.",
    "great",
    "Really interesting, and teaches you to think in ways you normally don't.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in econ.",
    "I took this class Credit D, which was a great choice if you don't need it to count towards a major. Prof. Polak is amazing. The lectures are really engaging. It's a really cool class that will make you think about things differently. I would definitely recommend taking it. The problem sets can be a little long, and a little challenging.",
    "Very exciting class! Take it! But take it Cr\/D\/Fail because it can be very challenging.",
    "Game Theory is an awesome subject. That said, I'd recommend simply watching Polak's lectures on Open Yale Courses and not spend a credit on the class. The problem sets are identical to those on OYC and the TA's grade them pretty arbitrarily. The tests are fair ,but, that said, the curve is pretty tight. If you were planning on taking it Credit\/D, I recommend it wholeheartedly.",
    "very interesting material. awesome lectures. hard problem sets and random midterms and finals.",
    "Basically a course on brainteasers.It starts out pretty easy, but gets MUCH more difficult by the end. A lot of people Cr\/D\/F, which helps.It's a really enjoyable class, and though lectures drag at times, Polak is great.Be prepared for some tough problem sets, especially at the end. Also, it seems like there are two types of people: those good at game theory, and those bad at it. Try and figure out which one you are before committing to taking this for a grade.",
    "Definitely take this class. It is challenging at times, but still totally worth it. One of the most interesting and fulfilling classes at Yale.",
    "Best class at Yale--better take it w\/ Polak if you can!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's one of the best classes I've ever taken. Polak is a wonderful professor with a great sense of humor and a great accent. If you're worried about it being scary, take it Credit\/D\/Fail. I know a lot of people who did and they're glad they took it. Psets can be a lot of work but you can always go to office hours and get help. It's definitely worth the work to take this class.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in the material. It can be mind-boggling too if you don't follow up.",
    "159 taught me just about everything I was hoping to know about game theory. The applications are generally related to economics (naturally), but Professor Polak also mixed in enough political science to keep me happy. Polak is a great lecturer, although he moves a bit slowly for my tastes. The problem sets were not too hard--they generally provide leading questions to walk you through the difficult problems. Same goes for the exams. The class is curved; according to Polak, top 20% A, next 20% A-, next 40% B, bottom 20% C or below.",
    "Great class but trickier than you'd expect. If you take it Credit\/D its very hard to get a D or fail. polak is one of the best. problem sets are tough though.",
    "very interesting material, but NOT a gut. To do well on the problem sets you must go to office hours each week or have an old copy of them.",
    "It's fun and challenging. I actually sorta enjoyed the problem sets and was very satisfied when I completed them. If you like things like puzzles and things that just make you sit there and think for a while, you should like this class.",
    "Do not take this class. The reviews and first few classes are misleading...you will do a lot of busy work to learn absolutely nothing. If you want to learn something, take another class; if you want to do no work, take another class. Whatever you want out of this, take another class.",
    "Probably THE BEST CLASS I've taken at Yale. Material was fun, professor was AWESOME (and taught RIDICULOUSLY WELL), and design of the course itself was very efficient.TAKE IT. It's not very difficult to get a good grade in this class if you just put the effort into it.",
    "Very interesting. Mostly during finals when you finally learn everything he taught in class and have a vaguely cathartic moment. Psets take a pretty long time, though this is ameliorated by going to the TA office hours where they walk you through the problems. Polak is a great lecturer.",
    "I would recommend the class because it is fun and challenging at the same time.",
    "This class is worth it. Your grade is 100% at the mercy of the curve, but only take it Credit\/D if you have to -- there is a lot to be learned from doing the problem sets, which go way, way, way beyond the lectures. Though the lectures are truly a pleasure to attend, doing the actual problems is the fun part. Find the right TA and it's definitely more fun than frustration.Not an easy class, though. Lots of econ majors.",
    "The quality of the professor is overrated (he is too disorganized), but the course is worth taking anyway because a huge variety of useful and interesting topics are covered. Also, there is basically no busywork at all.",
    "As Polak said on the first day of lecture, this class is hard but fun. I would put more of an emphasis on hard than fun. That being said, Polak was a great lecturer and the class was entertaining.",
    "Definitely my best econ class here at Yale. The class material is very interesting and Ben Polak does a great job with keeping the students engaged in lectures. Don't buy the textbook if you take the class.",
    "yeah, take the class it teaches you a lot of perspectives in analysis and will get you a job at a consulting firm for sure",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in analyzing strategic thought. Useful in many fields.",
    "I feel every student at Yale owes it to themselves to take this course. Game theory permeates all our lives in so many ways, and having a basic understanding of it is essential. More importantly however, Professor Polak sets the standard for how a lecture course should be taught.",
    "Great class, challenging but not impossible. Different way of thinking and an interesting application of logic.",
    "Good interesting class that is not overly demanding. P-sets can be completed in 2-4 hours in one night usually. I would recommend this class and I am glad I took it. Definitely learned some ways of thinking about \"games\" that I am glad I now know.",
    "This class consists of learning how to play a variety of thought \"games\" that test logic, as well as some math. The professor makes an effort to find practical applications for all the material and to make the lectures interactive.",
    "Yes, take it! You will have had a fun time in class and become a more strategic thinker when you are done.",
    "Yes, absolutely.Strengths: Fantastically entertaining lectures, and it's also amusing how British he is (adds some extra fun to the class) and how he brings his family into our problem sets and tests. Problem sets that really provoked me to think, but were very well scaffolded such that I was rarely ever stumped.However, do NOT be fooled. While this is not a gotcha-type class, the problem sets are HARD - they take 3-4 hours to complete. They do not involve difficult math (basic algebra, and on 3-4 occasions, incredibly simple derivatives). For a social sciences person, this is the only serious problem set class I've taken in my time at Yale, but it was LOGIC, not math. Which I loved.Also, there are the usual problem with any math lecture course - pacing. By the end, we were going slowly enough that I generally tuned out entire lectures. But this is totally inevitable with any math lecture course, so it's not that big of a drawback.Take the class. It'll give you an extra perspective\/lens you can use to look at the world.",
    "Yes, this is one of the reasons you chose Yale.",
    "This course can be quite challenging. You will learn a new language and a new way to analyze economic problems. The material seems to be intuitive, so either you get it or you don't. Problem sets are hard, but since the teaching fellows hold office hours before they are due, you don't really have to worry about them. The best part of \"Game Theory\" is Professor Polak, who delivers dynamic, interactive lectures. If you want to understand what it means to think strategically in the competitive business world, you should take this course.",
    "Yes. This was the first and (most likely only\" Econ class I ever took, and I enjoyed it a lot. It's a large class with absurdly high problemset averages, so you need to be a good at taking exams to do well in the class.",
    "Sure, take it if you plan on attending class. I attended class, but started sleeping, which made learning about SPEs more difficult.So if you're planning to take this class:1. attend class2. don't sleep3. go to TA office hours to get the homework questions right4. no need to buy the book",
    "The subject material is easy and fun, and does introduce one to interesting ideas and subjects. This said, you get little more than a glance at game theory: A good intro nonetheless.",
    "Take it. No question.",
    "Unless you're an econ major, I'd take the class credit\/D\/fail. The class is reasonably tough, not so much because the concepts are hard to master, but because the tests and problem sets are challenging. It's fun to learn the material, though, and Professor Polak's lectures are really engaging. I took the class without any previous econ experience, and it was fine. It was well worth the class, as I learned a new lens through which to interpret interpersonal relationships.",
    "Materials are interesting(Games). Problem sets are moderately challenging and require a little math and patience. Exams are not particularly hard. However, the curve seems to be not very nice. I feel that how well you do on your final is pretty random because there isn't(at least I didn't find)a general way to solve something(for example, Nash Equilibrium) in this course. Each problem(especially those in the final) requires a new approach to solve for equilibrium or etc. Therefore if your brain happens to think that way at that particular moment, you'll find the problems easy but otherwise you'll just stuck. It's a little bit like brain teasers: it makes a huge difference whether you think in that particular\/right way. Many people take this course C\/D\/Fail to avoid the risk.",
    "My favorite class at yale ever. Amazing instruction. Games incredibly fun and quantitatively delightful. A gem. Take it!",
    "A combination of down-to-earth economics with real-life applications, excellent TA's and of course Ben Polak's British humo(u)r makes this class a must-take at Yale. You absolutely CANNOT graduate Yale without having taken this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to majors and non-majors. It's not too difficult and it's incredibly interesting.",
    "Great, class...Polak is an interesting guy...a must take at Yale...lecture is a little dull and some of the material doesn't have much practical application...all lectures were on open course yale so could watch these intsead of going to class.",
    "I would recommend the course, just know its not a standard econ course. Can be a lot of work. Its different material, so can be difficult to wrap you mind around. Incredible professor, brilliant guy, pretty funny. Grading can be kinda tough",
    "I took it with no background in econ, credit\/d. It wasn't bad. It wasn't quite as fun as i thought it would be, but taking it credit\/d also eliminates some of the drive to learn (and also was a veeery good decision given that most people get the answers from TAs and get perfect scores on problem sets).",
    "one of the must-take classes at yale. be warned though: it's a lot of work understanding all the concepts. take it c\/d\/fail if you can.",
    "Hard, but interesting. Grade distribution is VERY fair. I definitely recommend this class. It was described as a Yale-must course and it certainly lived up to the hype.",
    "YES. great class. take it.",
    "Great class. Very interesting. This is a tough class though so maybe take it for Credit if you do take it.",
    "Best class ever. Pollack seriously has the coolest accent ever, and I can't think of a single down point of the entire class. You literally play games in class, Pollack is pretty witty and very good at lecturing, and you learn a lot and have a good time. I could not think of how this class could possibly be better. Problem sets were pretty standard, and the tests were fair. Take it, you won't regret it.",
    "Game Theory is econ applied to real life situations, including business, revolution, war, and relationships. This is definitely a very fun class, more applicable than theoretical.",
    "Yes, definitely, regardless of whether you're an econ major. Gives you a great set of tools for thinking about making decisions and about how the world works. You won't regret it and you'll be much smarter and informed for taking it. Polak is wonderful and this is the type of class you came to Yale to take. Also, not that hard to do well in.The only warning is that the problem sets are a bit challenging and sometimes harshly graded, so go to TA office hours to see how they work out the problems (and make sure your TA does the problems on the HW the same way that the TA who's grading it does the problems). But don't let that scare you away from the course--take it!",
    "fun, insightful, eye-opening, challenging.",
    "Definitely recommended. Very interesting and not too much work. Harsh grading though, you need to be excellent to get an A.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 159 to a student in any major at Yale. In this class, not only do you learn about Game Theory itself, but also to think more strategically about the world, and to act more rationally in everyday decision making. The class is not too math-intensive either.",
    "It's a thinking class. There's no required knowledge in anything of any subject.",
    "Lectures are a smash. Homework is manageable. Chris Hines is awesome.",
    "YES. Take it. Please do. Game Theory affects the way you think about almost everything you ever do. Final is killer though.",
    "Definitely take it. The material is interesting, it's well taught and the TAs are really helpful.",
    "Game theory is awesome! Definitely take it. You play games in class and in section, while you get a general overview of many topics that are relevant to real life. It was one of my favorite classes so far. The problem sets are tough, but definitely take advantage of office hours with the TAs. They are so helpful. Professor Polak is really engaging and funny, so you won't be bored!",
    "I regret taking this class. I thought that game theory sounded cool but did not know much about it going in. The classes were so boring and the problem sets were way harder than the examples Polak does in class. If you take it, you will need to take it credit\/d, unless you are just really naturally good at game theory.",
    "It was a good course, but not all that it was cracked up to be. If you take it, go to section. Things will creep up on you.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in strategy. It's interesting, engaging, challenging but not overwhelming, and Polak is an entertaining lecturer. Highly recommended.",
    "ECON 159 is a great course overall. Great instructor, helpful TAs, and very interesting material. The problem sets reinforced the concepts quite well but didn't take nightmarishly long to complete. Take the class if you are interested in learning strategic analysis of games without too much emphasis on formal proofs. You don't have to be great at math, but you should be comfortable with combining numbers and logic. The concepts build on each other and increase in difficulty, but Ben Polak explains it all very well, and is funny to boot. The problem sets and exams can be challenging. I found section useless; go to office hours instead and learn how to attack the problem sets before they're due, not after you turn them in, which is the essence of section. This was one of the better classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "AMAZING. Polak is a fabulous teacher and makes it really enjoyable. He makes Sarah Palin jokes, disses Jersey Shore and plays tons of games in class. Whether you are an econ major or not, this is something you should take. It is worth noting though that the course gets significantly tougher towards the end. But still, definitely worth it!",
    "Game Theory is a fantastic course. The material is interesting, but never complicated enough that it's a struggle to understand it. The lectures are very entertaining, but if you miss a class or two you can always watch the lectures later on Open Yale, since Prof. Polak's syllabus hasn't really changed. The problem sets were a little bit tedious sometimes, but they definitely aided in understanding the material. The tests were moderately difficult, but always fair.",
    "I would highly recommend the course for any student, regardless of their major. Themes from the course are highly applicable to many different ideas and problems.",
    "You should definitely audit this class. Or watch it online (which is a great resource in itself if you choose to take the class for a grade). Game Theory is incredibly interesting, well-taught, and rewarding--Professor Polak is fantastic and keeps lecture lively and engaging, and the material itself is so cool and applicable in everyday life. But it's a lot of work: although it's just a weekly problem set, the questions are difficult. Rather than just ask for the basic theory you learn in class over again, they take a simple concept from class (a two-candidate election) and make it more complex\/realistic (a x-candidate election, a two-candidate election involving attack ads, etc...) There are tons of TAs who can help you, but even with their assistance, I was up very late the night before the p-sets were due every week trying to finish it up.Game Theory teaches you new ways of seeing and approaching problems. It's an immensely useful (if not just intriguing) topic that everyone should have some experience with. I, myself, have no regrets, but this class came to define my semester. Be prepared for a lot of work, but a lot of fun, too.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's an amazing course, and I highly recommend it. I would say, however, if you have a strong econ or mathematics background that it may move too slowly. Take the time to shop ECON 351. I wish I did.",
    "very interesting class. polak does a great job taking it. id recommend it",
    "Yes, take Game Theory. It can be deceptively manageable\u0097for more average students like myself, you really have to work your butt off to stay on top of the material, especially towards the end of second semester. (On the other hand, if you are more gifted in the ways of logic\/math\/problem-solving, you may find this course quite easy.) That said, it introduces some fundamental concepts about strategies and human interactions that will stay with you long after the course. And Polak is a real gem of a lecturer.",
    "Professor Polak is the man! Truly one of the best lecturers at Yale (watch the lectures online on Open Courses if you don't believe me). He makes every lecture fun to sit through and applicable to the real world. This is also the perfect class to take Cr \/ D since the tests \/ psets can be quite challenging.Definitely recommend it!",
    "It lives up the every bit of the hype. There is a reason Yale showcases Professor Polak on the open courseware site.Game Theory is everywhere and can change the way you see the world.",
    "Game Theory is a fun class. I would take it. Professor Polak is fantastic. It is not too much work.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. Everyone should take it! It is put together really well, and I learned so much about game theory. I ended up thinking about strategic decision making in a whole new way. However, the final is very very difficult.",
    "Typical Econ lecture course with weekly problem sets, midterm, and final. Professor Polak is the best lecturer I've encountered in the department, and the course material is interesting. Great choice for an elective for majors or non majors.",
    "TAKE GAME THEORY! It is the best economics lecture offered at Yale, and it will teach you a new way of thinking. Prof. Polak is an amazing teacher.",
    "Great class. Starts off pretty easy, but gets hard later on in the semester. Not much work; only one problem set a week, and the professor's a pretty cool guy.",
    "The course is a great survey of game theory. You go through different games each lecture and sometimes play them yourself. Professor Polak is a very engaging lecture and makes everything seem very easy. However, don't let that fool you. The problem sets are very time-consuming and at times very tedious and tricky. The first half of the course was very straightforward and very easy to follow. After the midterm, the different games and concepts were a bit rushed. The escalation of difficulty after the midterm was not quite expected. Nevertheless, this course was extremely interesting. Take it even if you're not an Economics major.",
    "Game Theory is one of those classes at Yale that you must take. You will be surprised by the power of the tools that you learn in this class. The discussions are engaging and cover all the contemporary topics in our world today. Ben Polak is on of the best professors at Yale and you need to take this class to understand why.",
    "Take Game Theory. It will help you think in a new way and will definitely make you better at strategic problem solving. It isn't the easiest class, but it is in many ways the most rewarding.",
    "Exactly what one would expect--weekly problem set, midterm and final. Polak is a great professor and keeps things as interesting as one can for an econ lecture. The problem sets are more difficult than what we do in class but the tests are very reasonable. I took it credit\/d because I don't like being subject to curves. That said, it was not that hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend Game theory to anyone",
    "It is one of the best econ classes at yale.",
    "Absolutely. This class was really fun and interesting.",
    "Definitely- especially if you are an econ major this is the only fun course you get to take.",
    "Really fun and entertaining. Problem sets are a nice break from other kinds of work. Recommend.",
    "Game Theory is a great class, Professor Polak is definitely one of the best lecture Econ professors at Yale, take this if you are an Econ major, a lot of non-majors actually take it too. It's tough, but not incredibly hard, just weekly psets a midterm and final, definitely worth it as an Econ major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Problem sets are challenging but interesting. You learn a lot of really practical and interesting stuff. The class teaches you to think in a strategic way.",
    "Even as a Credit\/D class, you'll have to work hard on the problems sets and study extensively for the exams, but it's worth it.",
    "class is a lot harder and a lot more work than people initially expect. take it credit\/d if you dont need it for an econ grade.",
    "It's a great class if you want to learn how to think better.",
    "yes",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "It's a cool class, not extremely technical, great professor, interesting material, fun problem sets. If you're an econ major, for sure, if not, still interesting and worth a look.",
    "Yes! Take this class. There nothing else really to say. It's a fantastic course taught by an amazing lecturer.",
    "Econ 159 is an introduction to Game Theory, which looks at such topics as basic Nash equilibrium, mixed strategy equilibrium, and backwards induction. I would recommend this class if you are interested in game theory as it provides a good introduction to the topic. While I believe the course requirements include Intro Micro, the course does not use any concepts that are difficult to learn in more than a twenty minutes. I really enjoyed this class and found the lectures of all the classes available at Yale Open courses to be particularly helpful.",
    "A great hard class for anyone interested in anything in life.Seriously. Take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. If you want to take a course in game theory, take this one, because it is the right balance of difficulty and rigor.",
    "Take this class! Even if you don't want to be an Econ major. However, it is definitely helpful to have at least intro Micro. Professor Polak was amazing, definitely the best professor I've had at Yale thus far. The lectures are fascinating and he uses great examples. The problem sets are tough so definitely go to office hours - they are a life saver. The tests were kind of hard to study for but they were fair. I definitely recommend this class.",
    "absolutely",
    "Game Theory is the art of problem solving. You will learn a lot of useful concepts. It is challenging, but I found that this course is much easier than you might think. I highly recommend this class for all Yale students, regardless of interest or major.",
    "Well organized class and glad that I took it. You're not going to learn this material anywhere else, and since all of life is a game, you should take game theory. Also glad that I took it CR\/D\/F because as a non-major I found the psets and tests to be challenging, even with studying.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! For anyone considering an economics major, I would say its definitely worth taking. Even for those who aren't econ majors, this course gives you an interesting new way to evaluate problems. If you have a chance, definitely take it with Professor Polak, he is fantastic.",
    "Definitely would recommend to anyone.",
    "i would highly recommend this class for econ majors or other students who think fairly logically and mathematically as it is a very interesting econ credit",
    "Yes! It's challenging but one of the most interesting econ courses I've ever taken.",
    "do it do it do it!",
    "It's a very fun class to be in... but it is a very difficult class for the non-econ minded. I do think it's a class everyone at Yale should take though! It teaches you to think in ways you'd never before. However, if you're not econ minded, please start it credit D and see how you do on the midterm. Then change or don't change it accordingly.",
    "Yes. Take this even if you aren't an econ major and even if you don't think you'll get an A. If you plan on going to class, the lecture is worth it and Polak will teach you a way to think through problems that will stay with you after.",
    "Covers all the topics in game theory. Gives you the basic tools and then expects you to be able to figure out how to use them on some pretty hard problems, which is annoying at times. But still a fantastic class and a must-take at Yale.",
    "Learn some really cool non-intuitive tricks for solving game-type situations. I really enjoyed doing most of the problem sets, if you have a quantitative\/logical brain, you probably will, too.",
    "Recommended with reservations.I went into this class expecting a lot, but I found that the ideas were almost identical to those presented in intermediate microeconomics, with perhaps a larger focus on example games. I was expecting more new and exciting ideas, and I was disappointed in that regard.Professor Polak lectures with a lot of energy, and it's clear that this course has been designed well in advance. The class participation aspect was really good as well, and I'm glad that Professor Polak chose to address some of the differences between the results of game theory and those in real work experiments. However, the lectures are available on Online Yale Courses, which is both good and bad -- his lectures are virtually identical (down to the joke) from year to year, which gives little incentive to attend class when you can just learn the entire lecture from the blackboard notes in under 20 minutes.If you're mathematically inclined, you'll be frustrated with the focus on examples and the lack of connection to math. If I could go back and do it again, I'd switch to the mathematical game theory class. If you're not so into calc and analysis but are interested in game theory, then take this class.",
    "Yes.",
    "Really fun, easy ideas to understand, really hard p-sets and exams, so be prepared. I loved class, I was really caught off guard by how hard the tests were.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, economics major or not. It deals with some fascinating topics that are surprisingly applicable to daily life and gives you a new skill set to use when handling ordinary problems. Also, Professor Polak is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. He makes the topics really applicable to life while still explaining the material concisely and clearly. He's also a hilarious guy. Take the class, if only Credit\/D - you won't regret it.",
    "Great class, whether or not you're an economics major, this class covers concepts that you should be familiar with. At times you'll feel that the material gets boring and repetitive, but the class overall does cover a lot of the major concepts in game theory. You don't need a strong math background at all, and there's a review session on basic calculus at the beginning of the year. Best of all, if you miss a few lectures, you can always find it on Open Yale.",
    "I highly recommend this course to all students, whether you are social science major or engineering. An intriguing topic with one of the best instructors and very helpful teaching assistants, this course has a lot to offer.",
    "it's a great course, difficult but rewarding and I definitely recommend it even if you are not an econ major",
    "It's the best class ever!! You should definitely take this! It will change the way you view the world! The class is beyond excellent!! Seriously!",
    "This is a great class, probably one of the best you will take at Yale, but the tests are incredibly hard.",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale. I really learned a lot and Polak uses a lot of interesting examples to help teach the subject. I would definitely recommend this course",
    "If you like logic puzzles, this course can be a lot of fun. There is some hard math, but don't let that turn you away.",
    "This is a really fun survey course. It has a really low workload but is deceptively tough. You have to want a good challenge and have to be up to have fun while being absolutely baffle by a single game for an hour or more. If that sounds like you, definitely take this course.",
    "Take this class! A Yale classic, and for good reason. Polak is a superb teacher, and the course is a great introduction to game theory. I left the class looking at the world in a new way. Quite manageable for those who have not taken Intro Micro.",
    "Yes, the world will make more sense to you after this class.",
    "Definitely. A great course, and very fun.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend the class regardless of the individuals major. Really fun class.",
    "I find that of the best courses don't come easy, and game theory is definitely one of those. Of course, this is coming from an English major, so if you're math\/econ\/something more related, game theory probably won't be much of a struggle for you, but surely you'll still enjoy professor Polak's lectures, including class games, fun pokes at the TAs, and general Britishness. Section is not required, and pretty much pointless unless you want all the answers to the problem set you just turned in. Problem sets challenge you to take what you learned in lecture and move beyond it. Challenging, but in a fun way unless it's three int eh morning and you just want to go to bed. This is a good class to Credit-D just for a good time, but the curve was pretty generous, so if you're willing to work, it's doable for credit also.Also, if Chris Hines TAs again, definitely go to his office hours. He's the best.",
    "Game Theory is an excellent course. The teaching is excellent, the lectures and material are interesting, the problem sets are well written, and both tests were very fair - in short, it's an ideal lecture class. as long as you are decently competent at math and general logical thought, you won't find the material difficult or frustrating. Moreover, learning game theory not only teaches you the basic concepts of the academic discipline, but also alters the way you think about interactions between people. You'll find yourself subconsciously applying concepts learned in the course to seemingly ordinary, considering them analytically. I, personally, found the resultant insight satisfying, both for validating my time in the course, and because I felt I did have a better understanding of the psychology underlying human endeavors. If you are an economics major, take the class, since it is undoubtedly the best lecture the department offers. If you are not, I honestly think this is as enlightening as introductory micro, while being substantially more engaging. Take it, whether Cr\/D or not, and you shouldn't be disappointed."
