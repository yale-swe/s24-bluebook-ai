   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. It was easier than I thought it would be for a philosophy course, and it is manageable. Two papers and two exams. The papers are minimal. It was not too difficult at all, and I would recommend it as fourth class to anyone looking for one.",
    "This course is decent as a required course for the major. You will have to take it, but it won't be brutal. That being said, look forward to much better philosophy seminars following it.",
    "Take it. These philosophers are responsible for a huge chunk of western culture, and it's worth knowing what they're all about.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Philosophy 126 is well-balanced between being a survey and studying works in sufficient depth to capture a good portion of their value. We completed four major sections: Descartes, Leibniz, Berkeley, and Hume (with a couple essays from Locke for extra background coming into Berkeley). Zoltan proved an energetic and engaging professor, and I feel this is a strong intro to philosophy for any interested student, as well as for continuing majors who have little background in these four philosophers, or the development and decline of skepticism from Descartes to Hume. The readings are very interesting on the whole(and frankly, if the semester becomes a bit crunched, not doing all of the reading won't hurt you that much! You absolutely should do it all if you can, though; I'm actually going back and finishing what I'd skipped just because it's really interesting.) It's also one of the few courses where I actually valued section. Occasionally lecture can get sidetracked (maybe two or three lectures throughout the semester revolved around something kind of off-topic, though interesting), but frankly it was always interesting and it never impacted what students were expected to learn and study. Also, no real essays; instead, a \"problem set\" sort of write-up, and an in-class midterm and final, for which you receive the questions beforehand and answer particular selections he designates at the test. Overall, I loved this course; thoroughly recommended!",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in an introduction to modern philosophy, as understanding any subsequent philosophy without understanding these thinkers is something of a farce. I would also recommend that people take this class AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, because it provides a ground for later study and, as a requirement of the philosophy major, seems somewhat pointless if you have already studied the relevant philosophers before.",
    "This course was very engaging. The material was very stimulating--as much as it is interesting to know Descartes's philosophies, it's even more exciting to work through his logical process and evaluate the steps that go into the formation of each philosopher's worldview.",
    "Good class, boring lectures. Great TAs!",
    "After taking the first (but not the second) semester of DS and various other philosophy courses, I was pretty disappointed with this class. I'm a sophomore philosophy major that was looking to get more exposure to the fundamental modern philosophical texts, which I did, and the readings themselves were pretty great, but lecture was all over the place. Professor Szab\u00f3 is smart and clearly knows the subject well but he is not very focused, and lets the obnoxious kids who think they know everything about philosophy commandeer the conversation too much, often discussing different questions from what was really relevant and sometimes speculating beyond what was in the text.It was a pretty frustrating class for me, but it gave me the exposure I wanted. The short assignments were really easy for a philosophy major that actually read and paid attention, and he gives you all potential exam questions ahead of time. While this was not a hard class for me, it wasn't all that enjoyable either.",
    "Good class, would take it if you want a review of the ideas of four big western philosophers.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who is at all interested in the more abstract side of philosophy. This course won't tell you how to live your life, but I believe that the fields of metaphysics and epistemology are rewarding in their own way.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I was really just looking for a wide overview of modern philosophy and found that it was over my head. It's also graded really roughly. For people looking for an overview, I would suggest MoFoPo instead.",
    "Great course. Modest work load. Terrific Readings. Professor Szabo is fantastic. Sections complement the course very well. Great basic introduction to a period in the history of philosophy, intro to some topics in metaphysics, AND topics in epistemology. Virtually no ethics involved - FYI. Instructors and TFs very helpful.",
    "Take PHIL 126 if you like metaphysics and epistemology, or if you want to figure out if you like them, or philosophy in general. (And, of course, you have to take it if you want to be a philosophy major!) It's a survey course, so you won't go into as much depth as other, more focused philosophy courses, but Professor Szabo really helps you understand the philosophers as thoroughly as possible given the nature of the course. The workload is pretty light, and while this might be changed, I was able to keep up with the readings with no problem. Moreover, Professor Szabo's lectures are really interesting and engaging (assuming, of course, that you like philosophy and philosophical problems), and they really augment the material well. All in all, a really good class.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in getting a wonderful introduction to philosophy. Perfect amount of reading and really engaging lectures.",
    "A good but not great course.",
    "In the course title, \u0093Modern\u0094 means \u0093early modern:\u0094 the 17th and 18th centuries (in Europe).PHIL 126 is a good introduction to argument-based philosophy. If you have not taken a course in argument-based philosophy before, you will likely become a clearer thinker by taking this course.The course takes a historical approach to questions about metaphysics and epistemology. Metaphysics asks \u0093Fundamentally, what kinds of things exist and what is their nature?\u0094 Epistemology asks \u0093How can we know what we know?\u0094 Although students found Epistemology to be relevant and important to thinking about the world, it was less obvious to students why they should care about metaphysics - nor did the course make any attempt to convince students of its significance.\u00a0As a history of philosophy course, PHIL 126 focuses on what particular philosophers said about certain topics in philosophy, rather than presenting the full wisdom of contemporary philosophy on those topics or encouraging the students to grapple with the philosophical questions themselves. Some students will find this focus frustrating, and it certainly limits the pedagogical usefulness of the course. Nevertheless, there\u0092s something to be said for actually understanding difficult views that one might otherwise dismiss too lightly.In addition, the particular dead philosophers studied often endorse views and employ arguments towards which a contemporary reader may be wholly unsympathetic. Some students find they are able to enjoy the philosophical process anyway.If you do not like to explore logical systems for their own sake, you will likely be frustrated in this class.Professor Szabo is articulate and humorous. His lectures cover most of what you need to know to succeed in the course, and are much clearer than the primary texts. As a result, if you take good notes in class you can get by without doing much of the reading in advance, particularly because assignments ask specific questions and the possible exam questions were released in advance \u0096 at least this year.",
    "Take it if you're interested in or like philosophy! Very rigorous, teaches you a way of thinking.",
    "The course is an interesting look at four writers: Descartes, Leibniz, Berkeley and Hume. The course examines their metaphysical writings. Beware that the course is heavy in metaphysics, and does not touch on ethics. Otherwise, not toomuch work with the papers, readings and tests.",
    "This course is a survey of 4 important early modern philosophers - (1) Descartes, (2) Leibniz, (3) Berkeley (with one essay by Locke), and (4) Hume. As far as course content goes, I LOVED all the readings (except Locke, whose dense archaic prose drives me insane) \u0096 these are explorations of really fascinating things like freedom, causation, and the existence of a god (not the Abrahamic god per se, although almost all of these philosophers were Christian). Some of them were actually, much to my surprise, kind of fun to read. I personally often find doing philosophy, thinking about things for myself, more fun than reading philosophy, which tends to be so bone dry that it is unpleasant. Prof. Szabo is a fantastic lecturer - I feel like he doesn't get enough recognition for it, which is too bad. Lectures were always engaging, and he's a very dynamic lecturer - in my opinion, second only to Shelly Kagan for dynamic-ness. He does a very good job of breaking down arguments in class, tomake them more readily understood (it's hard to tell what some of the readings are getting at sometimes). I thought lecture was pretty invaluable. So I've said some good things about the content of the course and the professor - but there are things I did not like about the structure of the course. The grading is needlessly harsh. I say needlessly because you seem to get 0 credit for valid arguments - if your argument is not sound, or you did not mention some conclusion, then BOOM - no credit for that part. This wouldn't be so bad if assignments had a lot of parts, so that any mistake in one place could be made up somewhere else. Nope. Not a thing. There were 2 writing assignments, and each one had about 3 parts, which would be docked severely with little feedback. I know that the Philosophy department is generally known for harsh grading, and I'm okay with that so long as the grading is transparent, and they break it down for you with long, detailed feedback that can help you improve. I feel like that wasn't done here. As for sections, they pretty much consisted of, it seemed like, a series of experiments to see which would be most effective in getting us to engage with the material - some worked better than others. In sum though, I thought the course content and teaching were awesome, but I think the structure of the course needs some work. I'd definitely take it with Prof. Szabo though, if you can!",
    "Philosophy 126 is a great course whether you're a philosophy major or just want to get a taste of philosophy. Prof. Szabo's lectures are fantastic, and they were very helpful for me to understand Descartes, Leibnitz, Berkeley, and Hume, whom we read.",
    "A good introduction to philosophy in general (let alone early modern philosophy) with a reasonable workload."
