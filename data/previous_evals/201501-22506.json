   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course but only if the student could be taking other Arabic courses at the same time.",
    "If you have the Arabic skills to take this class, it is a must! A world-class professor with fascinating literary material which provides an altogether new perspective on the Middle East that you cannot get from any other class.",
    "This is a fun class that you should definitely take. The professor is really fun and it is nothing like the MSA classes that are offered here. This class is much more laid back in that you are not focussing on every little grammatical rule; you just talk amongst yourselves and debate different aspects of the books. There is also a lot of openness in the class and we accept everyone's opinion so you shouldn't feel embarrassed about your ideas or speaking abilities. The professor really helped me express myself even though I was not the best speaker in class.",
    "I would recommend Arabic 164 to any student of Arabic who is looking for a setting in which to work through literature and have discussions on its content. This is not a course in which you will review grammar, but you will pick up an immense amount of grammar and vocabulary by doing the readings closely.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a lot of work to do all of the reading if you're not a native speaker, but it's definitely worth doing."
