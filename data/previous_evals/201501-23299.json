    "Really fun, insightful class that lays down a conceptual framework and context for the evolution of the immune system.",
    "A very engaging class about evolution of the immune system. Requires a fair amount of reading as the concepts are not classical immunology but a rewarding mental exercise nonetheless. Presentations can be daunting because of the breadth of topics covered and the lack of imposed format.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It helps to develop a new perspective that is broadly applicable and very helpful in the lab.",

    "The evolutionary perspective is not something everyone thinks about and I think this class did a nice job in helping develop that view."
