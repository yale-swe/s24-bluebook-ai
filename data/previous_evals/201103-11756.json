   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a great class and you really learn a lot of French in a short period of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. While it's a lot of work, you learn a lot and have an excellent basis in French in only one semester. What an accomplishment!",
    "Take it with Skorupa!!",
    "TAKE THIS. TAKE IT WITH MADAME SKORUPA. Do it, do it, do it.",
    "An absolutely wonderful course. I'm blown away by how much French I've learned in just one semester. This is due in part to the fact that there is homework every night and a weekly test and composition - so you're constantly reading, writing and speaking the language - but mainly because Madame Skorupa is an incredible professor. She's kind, accommodating, and just good at teaching. Take French 110 with her if you can - she's the best.",
    "Take it!!! The professors are all amazing, especially Mme Skorupa! I took it with her and it became the class I would have most fun in. Extremely engaging! French in Action has its own charm especially with all the bizarre moments. Take it! You learn a lot!",
    "This is a great introduction to French. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Absolutely fantastic course. The French in Action textbook and video course is the perfect way to learn French. Madame Skorupa is one of the best professors I've had at Yale so far--highly recommended.It's a lot of work, but French 110 was my favorite class this semester."
