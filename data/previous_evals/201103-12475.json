    "Yes do it. But this is NOT an \"easy\" A in the sense that you DO have to study even if this is \"basic calc.\" For example, you may know how to integrate stuff but in this course, we have to use the DEFINITION of the integral to integrate something in addition to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II method. So basically, take it if you want to\/need to, but don't you dare think that you don't have to do any work or study for this course.",
    "Taking Math 112 with Amanda Folsom will increase your cool factor. She is such a hipster.",
    "I would say: it's calculus.",
    "Great intro to math, I would recommend it",
    "Math 112 is the same as first semester of AB Calculus, but less short-cuts and more proofs. After shopping most of the 112 sections, I found Amanda was by far the most organized and prepared. I thought about taking 115 instead, but I did not regret this semester. I learned most of this in AB, but learned more about \"why\" it is that I can take this short-cut.You will notice most people say this but: for a teacher pick Amanda or anyone who is fluent in English if you want to take 112. It will save you so much pain later.Amanda is really nice: she holds private review sessions and gives you the answers and solutions to the midterms (Afterwards of course) so you can prepare for the final.Most importantly, English is her native langage, though if you want she can speak German and French with you.P.S. \"Colored Chalk\"- you will know what this means when you take her section.",
    "Math 112 felt a bit like the AP Calculus AB I took my senior year of high school, just at an accelerated pace and with less attention to the basics. My only major frustration with the course was how little homework was worth relative to the exams, but I suppose that's pretty typical of QRs at Yale. The curve was usually generous, though, so don't let the fact that most of your grade will come from your scores on the mid-terms and final dissuade you from taking the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has to fulfill a math requirement as a prerequisite for a specific major, but not for anyone who just wants to get a QR out of the way. It is incredibly rigorous.",
    "Take it if you need to. If you're just looking for a QR credit, don't do it to yourself.",
    "If you have not had any calculus experience from high school, beware. Try to postpone taking this class until you've learned the material on your own - otherwise you will be struggling to keep pace with students who've taken calculus before and want to take the easier class. The course material is not difficult, but the exam questions and final were very tricky and challenge beyond the material covered in problem sets and lecture examples.",
    "Math 112 is a good intro to Calculus class. I took AB Calc my junior year and this was a solid review of that material (there's almost nothing new). I would recommend it if you want a good base in calculus before going on to higher levels of math. I would highly recommend Amanda Folsom, she is a great teacher, fair, really nice, and is obviously very intent on making sure students understand mathematical concepts. The exams are more difficult than the homework, but they're doable if you study (which you should do even if the material is review for you) and the curves are really helpful. All in all, what you'd expect from a basic level Calc class. If you're not comfortable with math, don't take it.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to! If you do have to, shop around EVERY professor.",
    "It is a great course if you've never taken calculus in high school. For those intending to go into science majors, this would be a good class to learn calculus.",
    "With Amanda Folsom, absolutely. She's a fun and clear teacher. I can't speak for the other section teachers though.",
    "Fast, in-depth review of Calculus AB. Recommended for those with previous exposure. Not recommended unless needed as a pre-requisite.",
    "Professor Folsom is an excellent teacher. I would definitely recommend her. Her lecturers are very good.",
    "Yes. If you're at all uncertain about your calculus skills\/its been a while since high school calculus, its better to have a solid intro calc background before moving on to other math."
