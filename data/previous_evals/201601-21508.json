    "A direct continuation of L1 following the same format (learn a unit then test on it) but with some new additions (like reading a short story, doing a presentation at the art gallery, and oral exams) towards the end of the semester.",
    "It is a fairly slow paced and low key class, in which you learn more about complex Italian grammar. I would recommend it especially with Michael Farina, as it can be a fun class that never gets monotonous.",
    "DOPE CLASS",
    "Solid class. The fact that it meets everyday isn't a problem. It's fun and engaging, very conversational.",
    "A continuation of ITAL 110, this course offers further study in the Italian language. I would recommend Michael's section to anyone who is looking for a bit more of a challenge but would enjoy learning with an enthusiastic and passionate instructor.",
    "Take it with Michael Farina if you can! He is hilarious and always made class fun."
