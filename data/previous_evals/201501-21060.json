   "comments": [
    "If you are lucky enough to get in to this class, 100% take it. You will learn so much about yourself through the process of learning about other leaders and those around you. This is not an ordinary \"take a class with a famous person\" seminar. This is a once in a lifetime experience to learn from the walking embodiment of leadership.",
    "I would highly recommend applying to it - a once-in-a-lifetime chance to engage with a truly important subject matter in the midst of many incredible people with real experiences to share.",
    "Absolutely. The class teaches people pathways to building teams. Every graduate in the 21st century needs to improve this skill set.",
    "This is a course that teaches the centrality of personal relationships to effective leadership. It also imparts an appreciation for the difficulty of leading: the vast complexity and uncertainty inherent in decision making, as well as the serious moral\/ethical challenges a leader is almost certain to encounter. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. Easily one of the best experiences I have had at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course",
    "I would describe the course as an exploration of leadership through the examination of case studies. Students will get the most out of the course if they use the reading material to reflect on how they deal with similar challenges and use the lessons of the course to build self-awareness to improve their leadership abilities. Additionally, this is a course in which students learn a great deal from each other both in the classroom and at associated social events. I would whole-heartedly recommend the course to others.",
    "I would describe it as a theoretical examination of the qualities that are necessary to be a good leader, with a strong focus on relationship-building. I would definitely recommend this class to a peer."
