    "Students would benefit from a schedule at the beginning of the semester (like was done in the fall) in order to plan our week accordingly.",
    "better than last semester first three lectures were very interesting",
    "This second semester was MUCH better in terms of speakers than the fall semester. I'm excited to see what they bring us next year.",
    "It would have been nice to have a fixed schedule at the beginning of the semester. Some weeks, it felt like we were told very much last-minute whether or not we would be having a seminar. There were also times when it was unclear whether a seminar was required, and for whom (i.e. CDE or SBS). The quality of guest lecturers was excellent.",
    "Seminar is great for students to learn about different faculty research projects.",
    "Many of the speakers this semester did not feel very relevant to Chronic Disease Epidemiology or were extremely dry. I would have liked to see more interesting presentations. Additionally, it was quite frustrating to not know whether or not we would be having a seminar until a few days before. I hope that in future years the scheduling is done much further in advance.",
    "Seminar was pretty inconsistant this semester and I wasn't always sure when we actually had it. I did find the topic enjoyable. The room we were in made it difficult for everyone to fit in the room and eat lunch.",
    "I love that it is mandatory for us to attend these seminars. I am not sure where else I would be exposed to the research or information some of these presenters provide us with. One thing I would ask is that enough food is ordered for everyone. It seems like sometimes we were short on food which is unfortunate and does not seem very professional. Perhaps asking people to register before attending the lectures would be great as it would provide an estimate of how many people are going aside from the students who are required to be there.",
    "I think that the SBS speakers were interesting but it was not very organized this semester...with a lot of last minute announcements. Also, I would like to politely suggest providing more vegetarian food options. I think the food is always good and they did well providing healthy options, but there were a significant number of vegetarians in our group this year, so we sometimes ran out (even though there would still be meat options left).",
    "Interesting speakers...",
    "NA",
    "I thought the seminars for first semester were better and much more diverse. A couple of seminars were too clinically-focused, and didn't really expand to the public health relevance of the topic. Fall semester also seemed a lot more organized, and there was a schedule given at the beginning of the semester that was followed, whereas this semester we would get an email sometimes a week before or sometimes a couple days before the seminar letting us know if we were required to come or not.",
    "I thought the SBS\/CDE seminars were great this semester! I would love to see more talks being available so that we can be exposed to more academics and their work. While some individuals' work were not relevant to my own interests, I was excited to learn nonetheless. Please keep these going and with more available as optional talks for first- and second-years.",
    "Lunches were disjointed and irrelevant. This course does not teach me about SBS.",
    "This semester was not as organized as the Fall semester. It was frustrating not to know when seminars would take place until the week before, especially as they happened sporadically and we did not receive a schedule at the beginning of the semester.",
    "The only problem was that the schedule was often unclear, and occasionally it wasn't possible to find the sign-in sheet. Also, I have a dietary restriction and there was rarely food that I could eat. It would be nice if the coordinator would check in about dietary issues at the beginning of the year. And the 2nd floor room was really too small... That said, I really enjoyed all of the speakers, and felt the talks were totally worth my time.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, free lunch!, sometimes engaging speakers Weakness: sometimes not very engaging",
    "I was a bit disappointed with the organization of the seminar this semester. The speakers themselves were great. However, I would have appreciated having a schedule of the talks well in advance. I understand that this wasn't finalized at the beginning of the semester though.",
    "This semester was quite disappointing and it was quite disheartening to see that some SBS professors were absent from all the discussions."
