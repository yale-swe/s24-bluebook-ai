    "Take the class if you can.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Although it is a fairly large time commitment, the intellectual benefits are immense.",
    "If admitted to the class, you should definitely take the opportunity. The professors are amazing, and allow the students to contribute to the discussion. The guest speakers are great, and the dinners and events are always exciting.",
    "I would recommend it wholeheartedly. If you can get in, you must take it.",
    "This course teaches some really wonderful material and helps you draw parallels to today. You will think about today's dilemmas differently because of the knowledge you will have from reading texts like Sun Tzu and Thucydides. That said, sometimes you will feel like you are being asked to write exactly what you think they want to read as opposed to form your own opinions. I did not feel that I had the freedom that I wish I had and thought I would.",
    "Great overview of the 'cannon' of political and modern European historian literature. Take it, if you can; but do be prepared to find it frustrating for some of the seminars, in which you may find yourself a silent participant.HOWEVER, since your instructors are so inspiring, your silence is probably a good thing. Just try to soak up some of the collective wisdom from the room, and you'll be ok. And do the reading...",
    "If you are interested in diplomatic history and international relations, you will love this course. The first-semester syllabus covers many of the classic works of statecraft, and you'll walk away with a better understanding of Clausewitz, Metternich, Bismarck, etc. Few, if any, other course at Yale offer such a curriculum. Don't expect it to have a genuine 'seminar' feel, because there will be a lot of of professors and students in the room, but this is probably for the better as the week-to-week reading is so extensive that few students can finish it all. It goes without saying that the opportunity to study under the likes of Adam Tooze, John Gaddis, Walter Mead, Paul Kennedy, and Charles Hill for an entire year is amazing. If your interests line up well with the syllabus, definitely take this course.",
    "Political Science 715 is an introduction to classical literature and the basic tenets of grand strategy. I would highly recommend the course to other students because it is a unique opportunity to both meet students from diverse backgrounds and interact with professors who have very different opinions. In many ways, Grand Strategy is more than just a class because it teaches you new frameworks to understand the world around you. I would highly recommend the course.",
    "I would. It can be a bit to pretentious and self-referential, but it is worth taking.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided a breadth and depth of understanding on leadership that I could not have received elsewhere. In this sense, I feel more prepared to begin my career and have a keener sense of how my actions relate to the larger picture.",
    "It did deepen my knowledge of history and study of strategy. It will not contribute to my senior essay.",
    "Education.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge greatly; and the guest speakers - particularly Professor Aires - were always huge inspiration. Will never forget their talks; and will always have benefitted from the readings that we were given to do.",
    "Yes, I wish we had more time to go more extensively into the books.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of the discipline by introducing a field of study that is central to social life but rarely studied, i.e. strategy. It has helped me shape my dissertation and to think at a deeper and more sophisticated level.",
    "The course helped me put my profession and academic interests in historical perspective."
