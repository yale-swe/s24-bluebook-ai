    "A fairly comprehensive intro to Music Theory. The class was well taught and organized.Anybody interested in Music Theory could take this course. As with many Yale intro courses, it does move quickly, so make sure you learn the fundamentals at the beginning of the course well.I would recommend another student take this course. It is enjoyable, not much more work than other courses, and you feel pretty accomplished at the end of it. If you have already taken AP Music Theory, 210 would probably be a better choice.",
    "Music 205 is slightly more challenging than a high school AP music theory class; it's great to take if you're still learning the fundamentals of theory or want to brush up on what you've learned in high school. The assignments are fairly straightforward in their content; the curriculum is perfectly paced. This class is a great review of the basics of music theory and is perfect if you're not sure whether or not a music major is right for you.",
    "It's a class on classical theory - primarily a lot of writing for four voices. If that's your thing, I would definitely recommend it. If you aren't studying classical music, however, it's not really relevant to music theory in any other styles.",
    "Yes definitely. If you want to learn the theory basics and are willing to do a lot of daily work then go for it.",
    "This was a great class! I had only taken a semester of music theory in high school and I did some singing on the side, so I didn't know how prepared I would be for this class. I thought that 210 would be too hard and that 110 would be too easy. This is a great class for someone who plays an instrument or sings and doesnt really know much about music theory.",
    "The material can be dry at times, but it's very useful if music theory is a part of your life in any capacity. It gives you an enhanced perspective on how music works\/can work.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wishes to learn more about theory who have been exposed to music in the past.",
    "I would recommend this class, even though it seems to be a self selecting class anyways. It's a great contrast to a lecture class, since everyone meets around a table twice a week and there's a sense of camaraderie and collaboration. Like most classes at Yale, it's easy to do well in this class if you pay attention, ask questions, and do the work in a timely fashion.",
    "Music Theory 205 is a great introduction course to upper level theory and the prerequisite background in theory is not all that high. Elizabeth Medina-Gray does a great job at teaching the course and is just a wonderful person to learn from in general. As long as you keep up with the daily assignments (only two per week as the class only meets twice a week), you should be fine. The course moves at a smooth enough pace that you never feel like you're scrambling to get things done. I will admit that near the end of the course, things do start to pick up in difficulty, but that really only translates to a bit more of your time.",
    "Though I would recommend Music 205 as a class, I would ask around about other sections, if possible, in hopes of getting a professor with more of a knack for explaining the context of the individual lessons. However, this class was definitely a fun challenge (homework ramps up in difficulty halfway through the semester), and I was always happy to be there."
