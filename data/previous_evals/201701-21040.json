    "The whole topic was new to me, so each seminar was a great intro to a fascinating field of literature.",
    "I gained an understanding of social cognition, visual perception, the intersection of the two, and most importantly, a new approach to the scientific method. This class, more than any other, has taught me how to detect shoddy work in even the most reputable journals and papers. Additionally, with this ability came the propensity to avoid such mistakes in my own work, making my writing, experimental design, and statistical analysis much clearer and more accurate than before.",
    "I gained a general understanding of the social information that is processed in our low-level mechanisms of perception. In addition, I learned to navigate a brand new body of scientific literature at the interesting intersection of social psychology and vision science and was able to fine-tune my ability to critique studies and discern good and shady elements of research."

   "comments": [
    "The professor and the topic--so essentially the entire course--are the strengths of this class. The only thing I might suggest is a bit more feedback on the reading responses.",
    "This course is practically perfect, except for a lack of grade knowledge until the final paper, and an almost lecture-like seminar structure, with discussion directly led by the professor. The workload is fair and interesting, and seminar was always fascinating.",
    "The course had a lot of very interesting content and the discussion were very engaging.",
    "The material itself was very interesting, and I appreciated being able to have a say in the topics for the last several classes. Something that might be worth exploring is using the final paper as an opportunity for collaboration between the graduate and undergraduate students. As an undergrad, the paper felt like a pretty big undertaking, and it would have been really helpful to have a more experienced \"partner\" to bounce ideas off of and help operationalize tasks and such. I am not sure what such a collaboration would look like in reality, and I think it is still beneficial to have individual write-ups, rather than one paper per pair. But having a group may improve the level of detail and thought that goes into future projects and result in a great learning opportunity. A little more feedback throughout the course (quick responses to the reading responses, for instance) would also be appreciated, as it's difficult to go through a course without any sense of where you are succeeding and where progress still needs to be made."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent course -- would strongly recommend. Roughly 5 papers to read each week, and 2 short reading response questions on them (approx. 550 words in total), plus a final paper. You start the semester with a list of proposed discussion topics, but those can change according to student interest, which means you effectively decide the content of the seminar. Brian is perhaps the best teacher in the psych department. You'll learn not only some cool findings within the field of social perception, but also how to critically evaluate a paper and look for interesting connections between them.",
    "Scholl is an engaging seminar leader willing to challenge students so they may arrive at valid conclusions. Readings were interesting and varied. Your BS radar will be much improved.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. No matter your familiarity with the field, this seminar was fascinating each week and the papers assigned gave a good intro to the science as a whole. Scholl was great, and the workload never seemed onerous.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in social cognition and\/or visual perception. The professor is amazing, the readings and discussion are fascinating, and the weekly workload until the final paper is very reasonable. You will learn to constructively criticize scientific work in a way that you most likely have never done, and generate better scientific arguments yourself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course; the content is interesting, Scholl is a very engaging professor and the workload is very reasonable.",
    "I had mixed feelings about the course. The material can be very interesting (though it really depends on the week), and the combination grad\/undergrad class format is nice, as you get a range of opinions and areas of expertise in the classroom. I don't think Professor Scholl's teaching style worked for me particularly, especially since I was not super familiar with the material. He is pretty hands-off most of the time, and you get no feedback during the course on any of the reading responses you turn in, so it's almost impossible to gauge whether you are making progress or how you might be doing in the class. But if the material interests you, and those things do not bother you, definitely shop the class! You do learn some really cool stuff, and you also have a say in some of the topics you ultimately cover, which is great."
