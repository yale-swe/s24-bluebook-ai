    "I would certainly recommend PHYS201 to another student. I took Physics C E&M in high school and loved it. PHYS201 goes over the same concepts in greater depth as well as a few others. The class is also a great challenge. While the problem sets took time and were certainly hard work, I really enjoyed them. A note to the avid Woads goer: remember that the physics review session is from 7-10 on Wednesdays, sometimes pushing into the wee hours of the morning. This class may preclude you from Woadsing!",
    "Don't take this class. If you want a painless experience, take PHYS 181. If you want a challenging experience with more bang for your buck, take PHYS 261.",
    "If you're looking for a decent introduction to physics with a couple of extra topics thrown in, this class is a decent way to do that (especially considering that, from what I've heard, 261 and 181 are a mess). The problem sets are fine and I think the flipped classroom model worked quite well.",
    "I'd recommend it as a physics class for people who aren't physics majors but are interested in physics nonetheless, although it can get extremely confusing at times.",
    "In this class you will go through all of E and M physics, but you will go through it much further than what you might have done in AP physics C or B. It is a fun course if you want to learn more physics and can apply yourself. It you just want a science credit...I don't know why you'd take this course. It is difficult, and the exams (which count for a lot) are never easy (but the curve is nice when necessary).",
    "What can I say? This class has not changed from semester to semester; the professors acknowledge the poor feedback they are receiving, but they don't implement real change into the course. The flipped classroom is both ill-conceived and poorly executed. While you'll probably learn the most physics in 201\/200, it's certainly improvable. Having two tests being the majority of the grade seems counterintuitive in a class based on experiential problem solving. There is an obvious discord between Helen and Frank, the two teachers, and the TA's rarely are familiar with the problems that are supposed to be solved in class. Students begin the class at vastly different levels and, unfortunately, leave at vastly different levels of proficiency. Disappointing intro to Physics at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for an introductory physics sequence that is a bit of a challenge but overall not that much work. In order to do well in this class, you do have to be willing to put in the time to watch\/figure out the lectures.",
    "Phys 201is a challenging math-based physics course. However, the instruction is great and the workload is manageable. I very much enjoyed the discussion sections, as we were allowed to work on the difficult problem sets together. In addition, if a student wishes to pursue a physics field, this course is an essential, as it will teach important foundational knowledge. However, at the same time, it is a very enjoyable course for all STEM majors, because it definitely strengthens ones problem-solving skills. I would definitely recommend this course to another student due to its usefulness and excellent teaching style.",
    "You learn about E&M. I personally like the flipped classroom (watch lecture videos on your own time, solve problems in class in a round table + whiteboard setting). The Professors are very helpful (if you ask for help) and Shankar is a great lecturer.",
    "Great course for everyone who took PHYS 200, though it's probably a bit harder and more math-intensive. With Frank and Helen teaching, there's plenty of variety between the online lectures and the class sections, so you end up learning the material at one point or another. Midterm and final are fair, and it's not too much work in general. If you're going to take intro physics, this isn't a bad option.",
    "No take Phys 181 unless you want to be a physics major.",
    "Physics 201 is a solid introduction on the topics of E&M, light, and quantum. Seemingly distinct topics, Shankar (the online lecturer) creates a beautiful narrative proving how each next step is the logical consequence either a. of what we already know, or b. what an experiment (which he summarizes for you), necessitated. In this sense, he teaches you to think like a physicist. I really enjoyed Shankar's lectures. I found them very clear, although because the material is so dense, I often found myself pausing the lecture. If you give the 1:15 lectures the ~2 hours of focus they deserve, you might fall behind. Of course, there are other ways to learn the material, such as reading the text book, attending the study hall, and\/or attending all the in class sessions (I did none of these and did fine in the course). I did go to some in class sessions, which were very hit-or-miss in terms of usefulness. Overall, a good intro physics course. More practical than phys 261; all-around better than physics 181. Don't get behind on the online lectures.",
    "I would not recommend for a friend.",
    "I would definitely not recommend PHYS 201. I think coming out of high school, you should either take physics 180\/181 if you're uncertain of your base of knowledge, or take 260\/261 which explores physics more rigorously and interestingly than 200\/201.",
    "This is a strong introductory course, definitely the best option for a student looking to go into applications of physics.",
    "I would recommend this as an intro physics course for someone who needs it for their major or is interested in physics, but it is a very tough choice for someone who just needs a science credit.",
    "Interesting class, which is well taught. Professor Caines and Professor Frank were very helpful. Also, Prof. Shankar's lectures are great. Definitely recommend the class.",
    "If you have the qualifications to take PHYS261, I would recommend that course. If you don't, and still want to take a higher level physics course, PHYS201 is essentially the only option, though not one I would feel comfortable recommending. The flipped-classroom style is inefficient. It puts those who have never seen the material at a much greater disadvantage than would be the case with a normal lecture course. While Professors Caines and Robinson are good professors, it can be somewhat of a struggle to learn the material and learn what is expected of you.",
    "This is a great course to take if you have intermediate skills in physics. However, if you are very well prepared, the course may underwhelm you a little.",
    "Far more interesting and fun than mechanics.",
    "This is a very tough intro physics course. Very interesting and you will learn a lot but requires a lot of discipline. Only take it if you are sure you can learn well with the flipped classroom style. Also, this class is doable if you take it concurrently with Math 120, but very difficult because you will have to teach yourself some math.",
    "The flipped classroom style of this course (lecture videos at home, problems in class) requires a lot of motivation from each student. The material is probably somewhat harder than lower level intro physics courses.",
    "Very fast-paced, a lot of material, and difficult concepts. I would recommend another sequence that does not use reverse classroom.",
    "The course is a flipped classroom which, honestly, doesn't work that well. When the professors explain things in the class, everything makes at least some sense, but the book and lectures online make less sense. I also found the course a bit too theoretical for my taste, although this has more to do with course material than anything else (although too much emphasis is put on teaching the derivations in my point of view). Would not recommend if you only want to fulfill the physics requirement and aren't a huge fan of multivariable calculus.",
    "Only recommended to students with a strong enough background in physics that they have seen all concepts covered at least once before.",
    "Tough physics class- gives you a strong physics base- many Shankar videos",
    "PHYS 201 is very much a continuation of PHYS 200. I felt it got harder, but that might just be because I was less familiar with the material than in 200. I haven't heard great things about 261, so I think 201 isn't a bad option in terms of finishing the intro physics sequence.",
    "PHYS 201 is a flipped introductory physics class that teaches electricity and magnetism, optics (geometric and physical), and the beginnings of quantum mechanics. It gives an inordinate amount of work, but I felt it was worth it. The flipped class means you will probably have to do more work than you would have if it weren't flipped, and to really understand the material at a deep level, you need to watch the lectures diligently (pausing and rewinding when necessary) or carefully read the textbook. It probably is not necessary, but it definitely helps if you (like me) have not taken E\/M, optics, or quantum in any form in high school. You will know the material inside and out by the end and be amazed at how much you learned and how much the material builds on itself. The homework is more difficult and took much longer than it did in PHYS 200, maybe because the subjects were more difficult, but I found it was more than enough preparation for the tests, which were graded fairly. Take it if you can with Prof. Caines and Prof. Robinson, because they are great.",
    "The flipped classroom style is very effective if you do the homework. This is a math-heavy course, and though it is doable without having taken Math 120, I found that helpful math topics were introduced in Math 120 just a week or so after they would have been helpful in Phys 201.",
    "PHYS 201 is an excellent intro course for students who want to apply multivariable calc skills to their physics studies and want a challenging, yet accessible problem-solving-heavy course. There are plenty of resources available to students in the course, and the problem-solving focus (really, you will never run out of practice problems) keeps you engaged!"
