    "This class is excellent and one of the best I have taken here at Yale",
    "The course was very informative. I would have liked to learn about different cultures and how their rates of chronic disease in relation to nutrition differ from ours.Weakness -- Having the homework assigned on tuesday and due on thursday is difficult. I was not able to spend adequate time on the assignment and so I rushed through and did not learn as much as I could have.",
    "very practical information whether or not nutrition is your specialty. we all eat a lot of food, and it is interesting to know the current research that is out there, as well as its short comings.",
    "The course is excellent.The only suggestion would be to increase the length of time that students have to work on homework assignments. A brief turnaround (less than 2 days) is extremely difficult with other time constraints.",
    "The organization of the class by disease was great. The lecture\/discussion division was also a great way to review material, and the debates and such in section were very helpful. Sometimes the slides were hard to print since they were not black and white, but the course was otherwise great!",
    "Overall, the class was GREAT! It's great to learn about the truth about nutrition stuff! It can be such a complicated topic. I wouldn't change the class!",
    "The only issue I had with the curriculum was the huge emphasis on cancer...",
    "I found the course very beneficial and informative. I liked the ways in which the course was presented in power point format with notes for the students. I also liked the way the discussion session was set up. I found the homework to be useful, and I liked the midterm and final review guides as I feel like they provided a good overview of what material to study for the exams.",
    "Excellent course. Dr. Mayne is amazing. The pacing of the course in perfect and the tests are fair.",
    "I loved this class!!! I really did -- and I've been running around spewing nutrition information and bitching about how bad trans fats are since I've been home. I went into the class knowing a good deal about personal nutrition, and I'd had some experience working with issues related to nutrition and public policy, but nearly everything that was presented in the class was new to me. It was incredibly interesting, so well organized, and very well-presented. Even though lecture was at 9 in the morning, I didn't mind going. And yes, I did spend a huge amount of time studying for the exams, but because I liked the material, it could have been a lot worse.When I saw the syllabus, I thought that it was a bit strange that we were going to spend three lectures discussing cancer, when there are so many other nutritional issues (especially obesity! the obesity epidemic!), but now that the class is over, I can see why we did, and I think it really made sense. Obesity is obviously an issue, but it's one specific issueand there is only so much you can say unless you turn it into a discussion about our culture, whereas cancer is really more of an umbrella term for a huge number of diseases, all with varied causes, treatments, and prognoses. I kind of wished we'd had one more lecture on the public policy side -- the supplement lecture was SO interesting, and I'd imagine that there are probably some other nutritional issues that are handled in some insane way by the government. The only negative was that I didn't really like the guest speaker on osteoperosis -- she wasn't particularly organized and clear (which is one of Dr. Mayne's strengths), so I didn't really think that having an outside expert was necessary.There really was only one part of the class that bothered me, and it's actually a very small thing, but I would like to mention it, as I'd imagine that this issue wasn't unique to me. I was pretty anxious when I heard that we had to do the nutritional assessment. I completely understand why we did it, and I think it is a great way to really convey just how difficult it is to conduct nutrition research. However, I have struggled with eating issues for ten years, and knowing this assignment was coming just hung over my head. I really did not want to make an issue out of it unless I really felt I needed to, so I logged on and entered a day's worth of information, and printed out what I needed. That was alright, as finding out what the emotions would look like having to do with actual nutritional intake wasn't my concern. But then, at the end of the three days, I went to print out the last sheet, and when I saw the calorie counts, I really flipped out. I hadn't expected to see that, and it was exactly what I was worried about seeing. I fought hard to stop counting calories, and now it is really awful for me to see numbers. Of course at that point, I was mad at myself for not saying something, but it was too late. So, that said. I think that it's important that the information we will see in the output be explained in class when we start the assignment, and if Dr. Mayne were to say that if this was going to be a problem for anyone, to let her know, that would be really great. If I'd known what that last page was going to show me, I never would have printed it out...but I was completely fine actually doing the day-to-day analysis. I think that i'd be great if there was a way to avoid having to print that last page for anyone who knew it was going to be a triggering problem for them.Ironically however....a class (or even half of a class) discussing eating disorders and their lasting health effects would be interesting and important. It's such a huge issue in our society, and even though people know the symptoms of the disorders, their lasting impacts are never discussed.",
    "great course",
    "A fantastic course and very detailed information on a whole spectrum of nutrition topics and how they influence chronic disease in the United States.",
    "I learned so much this semester in the course. I thought the course was interesting and up to date.",
    "This is an excellent course with an amazing professor. It is a very well organized course and there are many different topics covered. I learned a great deal of information this semester and feel very comfortable with nutrition, the policy, and how the guidelines and recommendations are set. The course prepares you to critique studies and find meaningful associations. Not only do you learn about nutrition but how nutrition is rooted in chronic disease and how it can be used for prevention.",
    "The course was extremely well structured and presented. The material was up-to-date and interesting and applicable to the course.",
    "Lectures were amazing. Guest lecture was OK. Discussion sections were helpful.",
    "Strengths:- Prof Mayne - excellent lecture style, very interested in the topic herself and that made class that much more interesting.- Stephanie, the TA was wonderful as well - dedicated to teaching, always available, very interested in the subject matter herself.- Overall, an excellent review of nutrition literature in relation to chronic diseases.- Well chosen lecture topics and well prepared lectures.- Focus on prevention.- Great review of study design.Weaknesses:- Only 36 hours (in the middle of the week) to do homework assignments which were not insignificant.",
    "This is a terrific class - very interesting subject, great professor, a particularly well run course. Because of the wealth of material you cover a lot of ground, but Dr. Mayne leads you through the literature in a clear and objective way.",
    "This was a great course for anyone who is interested in nutrition and wellness. You learn a great deal about many studies that have been conducted in this field. The lectures were also very interesting and kept student's attention. You would be surprised to learn many of the details about the effect of one's diet and lifestyle decisions on their overall health.",
    "The course was great; provided a really comprehensive overview of both the scientific and legislative\/policy aspects of nutrition. By the end of the semester, I felt much more comfortable about my ability to critique nutritional epidemiology studies and the connection between observational studies and randomized clinical trials. Also inspired me to pursue policy specifically relating to nutrition.",
    "This is a great comprehensive course on nutrition and chronic diseases. The professor does an amazing job going through the literature, past and current, and ties it all together at the end with policy and communication of health information."

This was great because students have varying interests and this way they were getting a sense of everything, even if they would not pursue that given disease or related studies. The powerpoints were organized and full of information.One request would be to post readings\/assignments sooner.",

    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is great.....and SO SO SO scary smart!!! She is incredibly knowledgeable, and knows the answer to nearly every question, and if she wasn't sure, she would say that she wasn't an expert in that specific area, which is such a great thing to do! There are a lot of people out there (not just professors!) who won't say if they're not sure about something, and when someone actually does say that, it's not only a great trait, but it also means that when there is an answer, you know for sure that it's right. The lectures were so well organized, the class flow in terms of subjects worked very well, and I really appreciated that she always showed us both sides of an issue.In addition, I think it was so great that she came to our discussion groups -- I haven't had a professor who has done that before, and it just showed her commitment to the course and that she was interested in what we had to say.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0very good lecturer, very organized, approachable",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is one of the best professors I've had. She has an impeccable command of the information and epidemiology of disease and nutrition, a fantastic lecturer, and passionate investigator. I have an immense amount of respect for her.",

    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Susan Mayne is the best professor I have had at Yale. I am not in the CDE concentration, but she is such a powerful and brilliant professor that it makes me wish I could have the chance to take more courses with her. She has direct experience and provides clear examples and has devisedthe course to have challenging assignments and exams. She has made this course my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne was an excellent instructor. All of her lectures were well organized, designed and presented. She had a knack for adding anecdotes to make the topics interesting and also presented striking evidence to support many of the topics.",

    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0- Prof Mayne has a wonderful, fluid lecture style. She is very interested in the topic herself and that made class fascinating for all ofus! She is very approachable, sensitive to different students points of view, and answered all of the questions asked in class and outside of class. She created a comprehensive lectures series throughout the semester and provided us with a wonderful review of the literature. I would highly recommend this course to others and would very much enjoy taking another class with Dr. Mayne myself. Overall, an outstanding professor!",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Excellent - extremely knowledgeable, clear, a pleasure to listen to.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne is the perfect instructor for this course. She is an expert in the field and is on many boards that are involved in creating the newest dietary guidelines. She can give you first hand information from ground zero and does so in a manner that everyone can comprehend. Not only does she engage all of her students, she strives to help them as much as possible outside the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Dr. Mayne's lectures are a pleasure to listen to; she is an extremely engaging and fluid lecturer. Her slides are also extremely helpful, particularly the slides on nutrition labeling and policy.Dr. Mayne is also very good at explaining concepts and emphasizing important big picture perspectives.The course was really fantastic. Perhaps the only way it could be improved is to have the exam review sheets be more detailed to help prepare for exams. Also, during the policy lecture, would be helpful to have some discussion about the media interprets nutrition research, and what public health professionals can do to dispel media misinformation and promote awareness of nutrition.",
    "Instructor: Susan Mayne \u00a0Professor Mayne is a great instructor and is so knowledgeable in the field of nutrition. She's very responsive to students and really takes the time to answer questions during lectures to make sure the material is well-understood."

    "I feel like this course is an excellent course for students who are interested in nutrition, chronic disease, or both. Through this couse, students get a basic overview of nutrition, how it interracts with the body and influences chronic disease, and some policy changes that can be made as a result.",
    "Take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. The course is about different nutrients and how they effect risk of chronic diseases, and it's not limited to one disease type. I wouldn't consider it an overview class, but it's a bit of an overview of the ideas about nutrients and their role in diseases and disease prevention. Exams were fair (knock on wood! I haven't gotten my final grade yet!). But seriously, the questions were reasonable. Nothing out of left-field, nothing that we barely touched upon, etc. Dr. Mayne is a great professor and I learned so much information. It was definitely a positive experience for me :)",
    "very interesting course, extremely useful information for health professions and personal life",
    "An in depth look at nutrition and chronic disease in the US, including the biology all the way to policy. A combination of fantastic lectures, interesting topics, and relevance to epidemiology today makes this a must-take course. Dr. Mayne is a fantastic professor, but also has high expectations of her students. I have learned so much and was very motivated to study hard for this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It was my favorite this semester and I learned so much during lectures.",
    "The course is excellent as is the professor. The material is interesting and you will learn a lot. This will easily become one of the best courses to take but also one of the more challenging courses to take. The mixture of both makes this class very successful.",
    "This was a great course that discussed all of the main topics in nutrition related to chronic disease. It was a useful course that I feel I got a lot out of. I would definitely recommend it to students who are interested in chronic disease, but also to any student as I feel a lot of these topic are important to learn about for general health of the population as well.",
    "This is an amazing course for students in any concentration. I would highly recommend students to take this class -- for both personal and professional purposes. I never knew that I could learn so much about nutrition and chronic disease. I would like to take another extension of this course.",
    "This course is a comprehensive review of the current literature in nutrition as it relates to chronic disease. I would highly recommend this class to another student. It was a fascinating, very well taught course on an intriguing subject matter.",
    "Highly recommended to anyone with interest.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in nutrition and the public health aspects of implementing a healthier environment for the world. This class would also be great for people to open their eyes to their own diets as well. Many people might be in denial about how poor their diet actually might be, but this course would inspire them to take action to change their lifestyle and those around them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, particularly students who do not have an extensive background in nutrition. Really provides a detailed overview of both the science behind nutrition, as well as how it relates to policy and legislation pertaining to nutrition.Would also tell students who are interested in pursuing clinical careers that this class provides a great background for someone who will be seeing patients and potentially giving patients advice pertaining to nutrition.",
    "If you are interested in nutrition and how foods affect a person's health, I would highly recommendthis course!"
