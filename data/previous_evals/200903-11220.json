    "PL800 is a necessary supplement to the American Politics sequence for graduate students, focusing (but not exclusively) on the historical development of institutions. I strongly recommend this course.",

    "It's an overview of recent work on major topics in American politics. Definitely take it!",
    "An excellent sampling of recent research in political science."

    "Beyond the benefits conferred simply through a well-curated reading list, the course also allowed insight into Mayhew's distinct methodological style. My future research will definitely borrow from his techniques: coding of concepts, bringing a comparative perspective, and, of course, reading, reading, reading!",
    "Deepened my knowledge extensively in the subfield of American Politics.",
    "It's a terrific introduction to both a variety of topics and a variety of approaches in American politics, and I feel very well-prepared to continue with American politics.",
    "This course gave me an introduction to research topics and methods in American Politics."
