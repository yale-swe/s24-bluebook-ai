   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about various different world cities, and I also became much more aware of authorship in the works we read (implicit bias, what choices were made, format, narrative, etc.).",
    "This course takes a unique approach to studying the city; by taking a critical view of writing and film about cities around the world, it becomes a meta-study of the city in which we learn to understand authorial perspectives and how they influence both the form and content of the writing. The material covered touches on the anthropological, policy, interpersonal\/psychological, and even biological aspects of diverse cities.",
    "I think my critical analysis improved from taking this class because we spent so much time analyzing viewpoints and narrative styles and the effects of those things. I definitely think about cities in a more nuanced and holistic way which is cool.",
    "Having never taken a writing seminar at Yale before, I honed many skills in this course: I learned how to read not only content but author critically, examine a suite of written resources with the same set of themes in mind and subsequently refine and deepen my understanding of these themes.",
    "My writing improved, I learned about how to better critically think about narratives, and I was taught about how cities are conceived of culturally.",
    "This course helped me gain a more critical eye in reading written works on urban regions. Breaking down the tools, techniques, and arguments made by writers covering various \"cities\" around the world was both fascinating and helpful in allowing me to find my own writing voice for the final paper.",
    "This course presented me with a wide-ranging look at how one writes about a city. I learned how to conceive of something as nebulous and subjective as the identity of a city, along with how to describe and shape that identity with words.",
    "This changed my understanding of the city. It is a beautifully designed course, where you really get to discuss different aspects of urban life and delve deep. Very interesting and insightful."

   "comments": [
    "One thing many students appreciated about the course was it's focus on cities and cultures that are generally underrepresented in this type of work (e.g. Middle Eastern cities), as well as Professor Reisz's genuine interest and attention to each individual student's backgrounds and perspectives. Toward the beginning, class discussion occasionally felt repetitive or unproductive as many students felt unsure of what the particular nature of discussion should be (as mentioned above, it's a very unique take on the subject matter) -- but this soon gave way to exciting and creative conversations. The main project of the class was successful in the creative freedom it afforded students!",
    "All of the readings were very interesting and the final project was a cool idea that gave us a lot of freedom to explore what we were interested in, but the discussions sometimes felt a little bit aimless.",
    "The course incorporates MUCH writing on non-Western cities, which I really valued given that the majority of my previous exposure to urban studies courses has concentrated on US\/Western European cities. The pace of the course was even and steady, and the weekly reading load was very manageable. I think that the format of class discussion could be shifted more frequently to maintain high engagement levels, but, generally, each seminar session was very engaging and interesting with wide student participation.",
    "I enjoyed the vast majority of the course and learned a lot from it. I especially loved the course paper\/city reader and writing the paper was structured (although it could be even more spaced out-have a time for handing in a first draft, for example). However, I thought some of the critiques got a bit old over time (yes, everything is problematic) and did not like all of the readings (the movie, junk space).",
    "I enjoyed the range of written material and sources we covered throughout the semester, and felt the discussions were particularly engaging",
    "No real weaknesses, except that the T.F.s could maybe be more involved, although Todd was fantastic."

    "This is a really interesting class that lets you read a variety of different writing styles about a variety of different cities. Todd Reisz is a wonderful professor and discussion leader, and is eager to help students in whatever way he can.",
    "This course is a fascinating take on the topic of urbanism -- what you're really training is your ability to critically interpret texts and get an overview of how people make sense of cities in their various disciplines (urban design, policy, anthropology, journalism, etc.). You'll be amazed at the diverse expertise of your classmates and how much they are able to enrich discussion thanks to Prof. Reisz's genuine interest in each individual's background. Finally, the cities we focus on are largely un(der)represented in traditional courses on these topics.",
    "I thought this class was quite fun. The readings are very interesting and cover a lot of different subjects and styles. Professor Reisz is very kind and engaged and accessible. A pretty \"Yale\" seminar as far as these things go, but I enjoyed going to class and the workload was quite reasonable for a writing credit (weekly response, city reader anthology project, and 12-15 page final paper).",
    "This class is not an urban theory course- it helped me to explore how the act of writing about a city is a means of imparting an identity to that city (or adding to the multiplicity of a single place's identity). It's an excellent course, and you have the opportunity to dig into a variety of sources- written by economists, journalists, anthropologists, social scientists. If you like to ponder questions like- Who owns the city? Who has a right to city?- it's an awesome class that gives you the preliminary toolkit to examine these questions.",
    "I would absolutely take this course again! It was very interesting and I learned a lot, specifically about cities and their space in the human imagination. The conversations were intellectually stimulating and enlightening, especially for someone who has not taken many seminars.",
    "Absolutely recommend to anyone interested in reading and analyzing writing on cities around the world. The readings were interesting (albeit plentiful some weeks), and I enjoyed picking apart the different works with a critical eye",
    "If writing about cities might be in your future, definitely take this course. I loved the books we read (Behind the Beautiful Forevers, Death and Life of Great American Cities, and so, so many more), the classmates I had (people with a genuine interest in and many things to say about the narrative identity of a city), and the cities we studied (Beirut, Mumbai, Dadaab, and a bunch of others that haven't often come up in the other urban studies courses I've taken). Plus, Professor Reisz did a great job of facilitating actual discussions and critically engaging our ideas. It's also the only course where I've gotten to develop an anthology that brings together diverse written perspectives on a single city, which was, well, awesome.",
    "Take this class and change your perspective. Almost an intro to Architecture Class, but presumes no prior knowledge. Fantastic teaching, fantastic materials. No regrets regarding this course."
