   "comments": [
    "Take it. Reasonable workload if you start thinking about the big papers early. Enjoyable films and discussion. If you've ever wanted to take a film class for the first time, this is a wonderful place to start.",
    "Prof MacKay is great. He is excited about the content, understands it well. It is a great joy to be able to listen to someone talk about something they are very passionate about.The films are awesome. There are some really brilliant pieces in there, films that are good not just because they are unusual or \u00e2\u0080\u0098foreign\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but because they are simply good pieces in and of themselves.To be honest, I did none of the readings in this class. Despite this, I gained a lot from the class by watching the films, watching Prof MacKay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lectures and the engaging in the discussion section.",
    "Yes! you will learn about film and how the world shapes them, and will watch movies in a completely different way.",
    "Only take this class if you want to be a film major and love all types of cinema while having a previous background to digest all of the content that this course has to offer. It can be a very rewarding class if you are willing to put forth the effort.",
    "This is a good introductory course for people interested in film history and the spread of cinema. it is less interesting for people more interested in film theory or technique.",
    "Necessarily broad and a little shallow, since Yale attempts to cram a survey of all world cinema into a semester (and includes European film in this definition). However, the screening list was diverse and compelling, and Prof. MacKay is great. I would take it again and would definitely recommend it to others.",
    "Take it! A great class if you're interested in film, maybe after taking Intro Film. Professor MacKay is amazing, take it just to take a class with him if for no other reason. I'm not a film major so I took it CR\/D, which is definitely recommended as the papers are quite long which is difficult is film is out of your comfort zone.",
    "This is definitely an interesting class. It allows us to see film as much more than a source of entertainment.",
    "An enjoyable lecture class that takes a roving, idiosyncratic approach to the study of \"world cinema\": the material covers an impressive (though not exhaustive) range of historical and geographical contexts, looking at cultural, political, and aesthetic influences on the development of different national cinemas, in the context of broader intellectual questions about film as an international cultural medium and art form. John MacKay is very likable and a thorough, energetic lecturer, and the workload is relatively light (with the exception of two longer-than-average writing assignments - note that the course is a WR credit).",
    "Take it! Really superb films, and interesting lectures.",
    "Take it--important cinema course. But take 150 first or close analysis.",
    "Take it!!",
    "YES! This is an awesome class, I learned a lot about many different movements, styles and auteurs in World Cinema and I think it was really worth it. I am not a Film Studies major, but I think because of that the material might have been even more fascinating for me. This was my first film class and I really enjoyed it. The papers were challenging because I did not know how to write a film paper, but if you meet with the TAs and make sure to write them with enough anticipation, I think the papers are also really rewarding.",
    "Do not expect the class to be easy. The end of term papers are fairly long and require a good amount of outside research for a good final product. Class is very interesting, especially if you have an interest in film. Learning new film terminology while watching films I never would have considered was definitely very cool.",
    "Yes! A great class and a great way to sample film studies.",
    "If you would like to be exposed to a wide variety of cultural cinemas that are off the beaten path of the mainstream, then I would highly recommend this class. However, keep in mind that some background in film analysis is very helpful. Having taken a couple of film courses here, I felt prepared to dive into the papers, but I know that this was not necessarily the case for others who were unfamiliar with writing about film. John MacKay is an excellent professor and you will look forward to attending lecture."
