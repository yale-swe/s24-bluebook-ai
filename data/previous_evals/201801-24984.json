    "I learned so much about all the amazing civilizations that have existed and currently exist today. We learned so much about the history of mankind and all of the different things that human evolution has led to, through an anthropological standpoint rather than too scientific. We also learned about what happens at archaeological sites and how an archaeologist or anthropologist would think.",
    "I developed a lot of insight into the world of archaeology. I thought it was incredibly interesting because we learned how archaeologists excavate, analyze, and come up with different conclusions for a certain culture.",
    "I developed a global understanding for ancient history - this course did such a wonderful job zooming out and giving students (familiar or unfamiliar with the material) a wide-scope view!"

   "comments": [
    "This course was such a hidden gem because it covered so many interesting topics and civilizations. A strength, besides the content, was our very hands-on labs, which allowed us to interact with artifacts as archaeologists would. The only improvement I would recommend is to make this more seminar-style, or at least in a smaller room, because there are many instances in which you'd want to ask a question and could get into a conversation about it but the large lecture style made this awkward.",
    "I really liked the class because it really focused on hands-on learning because the labs were a really big part of the class. This was incredible because I really felt like I was putting to good use what I learned in class. I also loved the professor because he was so passionate about what he does."

    "Yes! If you have any remote interest in how humans developed, what they can do, or even things like the pyramids or Stonehenge, take this class. You'll learn a lot about different types of societies and how they developed and were able to create such structures.",
    "Yes, great class, get to do some hands on work with artifacts and otherwise it is very laid back.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it's a laid-back class, but you learn a lot. The hands-on labs were the best part because you got to use your knowledge in a cool situation. The professor was also great.",
    "YES!"
