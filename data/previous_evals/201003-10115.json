    "Travel Writing was a great seminar, I would really recommend it. Chesa creates a very relaxed atmosphere that makes it exciting to learn about travel writing. This class was always something I looked forward to every week.",
    "Great course! Writing my own stories was harder than I expected, but I learned so much from the critiques and reading other people's stories. The books were also great. I loved coming to class. Take it if you can!",
    "I would definitely recommend Travel Writing if they ever offer it again. The readings are interesting, and the workshop style of the seminar is extremely helpful.",
    "Take it if you're looking to improve your creative writing skills. You read a lot of peer work, which can be fun at times, but can also be frustrating. If you're looking to discuss books and other examples of travel writing, this class is not for you. It's much more focused on honing a craft than discussing the readings.",
    "Travel Writing was an excellent creative writing course. The genre is vague and students chose to write memoirs, cultural criticism, and other narrative type pieces. I enjoyed the workshop format and the reading was valuable, for the most part.",
    "This is a workshop writing class. Every week, some student's papers are sent out, and you read them and critique them as a class. It's a very effective way to work on your writing style, and can become a lot of fun as you get to know each other. We also read some published works of Travel Writing, and discuss those. I would absolutely recommend this class to someone else, especially if they like to travel.",
    "This class was great. The work was very manageable, and the group was a really good dynamic for interesting, but not intimidating, discussion and workshops. Chesa was funny, entertaining, and helpful. The reading was well-chosen, but it often felt a little pointless to read so much to discuss for only 20 minutes or less. Otherwise, good class. I would take this for a fairly easy writing class--the workload is as hard as you want to make it.",
    "Great class. Take it if you can get in and if it's offered, which I don't think it will be. A valuable introduction to travel writing.",
    "I absolutely would. It was so great.",
    "I highly recommend taking this class. It's different from other classes you'll take here, but in a refreshing and enjoyable way that still has you thinking and improving tremendously.",
    "This course was an excellent environment to experiment in the form of travel and memoir writing. I found the in class discussion to be often very stimulating, and I definitely learned a lot about story structure and what makes a good travel essay. At the end of the day, it's a great excuse to buckle down and write about those great travel experiences you've had."
