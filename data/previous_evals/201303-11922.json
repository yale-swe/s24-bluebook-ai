    "I would recommend Arabic 110 to another student, but caution them that it goes very fast and that the grammar can be very confusing.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It is a lot of work but you learn a great deal.",
    "Would recommend to a student who has a vested interest in learning Arabic and using it. I wouldn't do it just for kicks. The class won't prepare you to converse casually if you go on vacation to, say, Morocco, so I don't think it would be useful to someone who wasn't planning on spending a fair amount of time learning the language and culture of the Middle East.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, with the caveat that one needs to be committed to learning arabic and completing the program.",
    "People have said in the past that the Arabic department was extremely lacking at Yale. People cautioned me not to take it. Fortunately, I really enjoyed the course and have a great fondness for the language and a decent basic understanding. Be prepared in the first weeks of the class. At this point, I was with Sarab, but I believe this is consistent for all classes. They ask to memorize massive amounts of vocab, while learning the alphabet. This is impossible and ridiculous. On the last day of learning the ALPHABET we had a vocab quiz drawing from 180 words. Crazy.I have debated long and hard how to write this review. Let me start with the good. Aziz wants his students to learn. This is very clear in the classes. Unlike many teachers Aziz has a real interest in his students becoming proficient in the language. He is a teacher who really wants his students to succeed. But Aziz sometimes has trouble doing this. Sometimes in class he tries to use an immersion tactic, using vocab we don't understand. The powerpoints he brings to class are very good, but sometimes he gets a little distracted. I believe all of their Arabic classes have some strength and weaknesses, and Aziz is no exception."
