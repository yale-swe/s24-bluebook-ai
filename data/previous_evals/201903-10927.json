   "comments": [
    "There were 3 units: creative short story, poetry, drama. Fair amount of reading, but very manageable. Learned how to workshop others' pieces.",
    "This class was good for building a writing practice and working on different creative forms. We read a lot of different authors and came together for a lecture from an expert in each form about 4 times a semester.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of creative writing in the genres of fiction, poetry, and drama by reading the works of published authors, completing writing exercises, workshopping my work and the work of my classmates, and listening to the occasional lecture from an established writer in each of the three genres.",
    "This is a class where you will get out however much you put into it. Our readings and class discussions were informative if you put thought and effort into them, and the consistent writing exercises were definitely helpful in practicing and refining my writing abilities. You can make huge strides if you invest yourself in the work. Prof. Skillings was extremely knowledgable and helpful but I could see someone getting through this class easily without utilizing the available resources.",
    "I learned a lot about how to craft well written works of poetry, fiction, and drama. I went in wanting to work on fiction most, but ended up enjoying poetry the most of all the sections.",
    "I was able to write poetry and dramatic dialogue\/monologue for the first time, and read a lot of great literature in those areas.",
    "This course made me not only into a better writer, but a better reader as well. I walked away from the semester having consumed a wide array of creative writing in various genres that I was able to use to strengthen my own voice in fiction, drama, and poetry.",
    "This class taught me a great deal about writing (so it's a bit awkward to write a review of it. Don't judge whether this class was successful based on this!), and about the balance between how we write, and think, and behave. It covered this through an exploration into short story writing, poetry, and drama. All of the units were taught through both reading and writing exercises, which expanded the understood possibility of what each could be.",
    "This was a great survey class to explore fiction, poetry and dramatic writing. I read some great writing and hear inciteful lectures that helped to shake how I think about writing overall.",
    "I learned so much about creative writing from this course, in fiction, poetry, and drama. I learned how to draw inspiration from other writers and to take a general prompt and create a piece that I enjoyed writing. The feedback improved both my writing and my thinking, and I learned how a workshop works as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is so much variety in this course, ranging from the fiction, drama, and poetry unit to the lectures that are held with other sections in place of seminars. The flexibility and freedom with assignments speaks true to creative writing,",
    "I liked the small setting because we really got the chance to have conversations. We also got to know our professor pretty well because of the small class setting. I don't know how this could be improved, but I did notice the same couple of people participating all the time. It also seemed to be a self-propagating cycle. The more that they spoke, the more they had to say and the more discouraged the shyer people seemed to be from piping up. I also don't know if this is necessarily problematic, in case people are speaking the exact amount they are comfortable with, but I thought I would put it in here.",
    "Strengths: Teaches students to workshop and be workshopped, allows them to experiment with a lot of different forms. Weaknesses: No huge weaknesses.",
    "I thought the course was very well balanced in the time it dedicated to each of the genres as well as the time split between reading for craft and doing our own writing.",
    "Strengths - This course afforded me great freedom to write anything that I could think up. The variety of three different units (poetry\/drama\/fiction) allowed me to explore different genres and styles, which I greatly appreciated. We had a fun class with some camaraderie, which Professor Skillings capitalized on to make everyday fun and exciting. All in all, it was very chill and you will get out of it whatever you put in. I don't have any real critiques I enjoyed this class so much!",
    "I think the course is structured very well. The seminar style with large lectures mixed in works really well. I think the Drama portion could have been a bit longer, but it was otherwise a great course!",
    "I felt that writing only one short story during the creative writing portion was very limited.",
    "This course has no major weaknesses that I can think of. I think it was well-served by its diversity I never felt I was writing or reading too much of the same thing. I also appreciated the larger lectures that opened each new unit and the insight they provided.",
    "This course is taught very interestingly, in that it is mostly a seminar but also has larger lectures where multiple seminar classes meet together. I liked this format because it enabled a tighter knit classroom group whose work we were able to workshop and with whom we were able to grow, while also feeling like part of an even larger unit learning in slightly different ways. I thought that some of the lectures were particularly helpful in imagining how to write a short story or poem, or to consider what fiction itself entailed.",
    "There was never enough time to discuss readings.",
    "Strengths: Lots of engaging, diverse readings for each genre, interesting class discussions every day, excellent small class work and workshops, interesting and informative lectures every once in a while, clear, honest, and helpful feedback for every writing assignment, a good number and variety of writing assignments. Weaknesses: We didn't do a lot of free writing in class. We spent a lot of time discussing the readings we did for homework, which was good, but I would have liked some more free writing or writing activities during class."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class. It provides a different perspective on writing, and pushes you past your comfort zones to make you explore what you thought you could not write,",
    "Yes, it was fun taking this class and learning about different styles of writing. I also got the chance to meet people outside of my usual friend circles.",
    "Yes. Introduction to Creative Writing, especially with Emily Skillings, was a course based on creating a place for everyone to feel comfortable trying new things and evaluating our peers. Emily was incredibly accommodating and made everyone feel welcome.",
    "Definitely! Anyone interested in learning more about creative writing will enjoy this course.",
    "Yes! I recommend this course to any student, even if you're a STEM person who doesn't fancy themselves a writer. This course was incredibly fun and interesting without being overly stressful or difficult. Such a wonderful class to explore your writing in a low-pressure environment.",
    "Yes if you want a low-stress environment to work on your writing! It is a great opportunity to write with a reasonable workload and great feedback.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to discover creative writing for the first time or looking to improve or further solidify their already-existing creative voice.",
    "Yes! Take this class if you want to write, even if you never have!",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for an introduction to different creative writing forms and styles. It is split up into sections so if you hate poetry you dont actually have to do it for very long. There are some really great guest lecturers that visit the class as well and the workload is totally manageable.",
    "Yes! For anyone who wants to improve their writing or those who are either interested in creative writing or want to know if creative writing is for them, I encourage you to try out this course."
