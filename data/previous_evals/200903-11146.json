   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course to undergraduate students interested in an academic approach to popular culture and to graduate students seeking to sharpen their methodological tools for work on contemporary cultural topics.",
    "I would recommend it - it's a good introduction to cultural studies as well as a wide variety of pop cultural phenomena and their scholarship.",
    "Religion and Popular Culture examines the co-constitution of religion, popular, and culture in ways that highlight their porosity. Taking up cultural objects such as movies, music, television, cooking, and celebrity this course foregrounds conversations currently taking place in Religious and Cultural Studies. Professor Lofton adds an element of excitement usually not encountered in graduate level courses.I recommend this course wholeheartedly. Its content is truly interesting and stimulating and its dissemination, controlled by professor Lofton, is an exciting and challenging experience.",
    "I'd recommend this course to a student interested in writing a research paper on this topic and\/or in working with Professor Lofton, as the final paper was the most useful part from a graduate perspective. If the course is mixed grad\/undergrad in the future, I might caution graduate students to think about the class dynamic before enrolling. This particular class (and Prof Lofton made this clear from the beginning) was more focused on the undergrads than the grad students.",
    "First, the class is fun and fast-paced. As a graduate student, there were many times when it felt like maybe I wasn't getting as much out of class discussions as in other classes, but it was worth it just to listen to Professor Lofton speak and for the opportunity to work on a longer research project and get her feedback. If she hadn't been so willing to meet outside of class and recommend books, etc., this class would have been less helpful at the graduate level."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided a wealth of information about scholarly approaches to popular culture that I will certainly draw upon in my dissertation and in my research. The syllabus also provides a useful reading list to revisit in later research projects. And the research and writing work I did for my final paper, as well as for the other papers in the course, offered great exercises in the kind of work I plan to do in graduate school and beyond.",
    "I understand cultural studies better and feel more comfortable evaluating popular culture. This course has been very important in formulating the kind of future research I'd like to do.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the study of religion, culture, and the popular. The readings were extremely helpful and challenging. Professor Lofton's teaching was also very transparent allowing grad students to peer into her preparation and thought process behind class organization. The course utilized primarily a cultural studies idiom in discussing religion which was a very helpful change from a Religious Studies language. The course adds to my future research on religion in America in its more contemporary forms and cultures.",
    "Professor Lofton was very helpful in terms of framing the final research papers as potential journal submissions - she had graduate students' professional development in mind. The course topic will also be relevant, at least peripherally, to my future research."
