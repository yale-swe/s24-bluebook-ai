   "comments": [
    "Class consists of Prof. Harries reading his notes almost verbatim for two hours. That said, he has brilliant things to say. He also posts his notes (basically a transcript of lecture) on the classesv2 server after each class.",
    "If you like to listen and not to talk, take this class.",
    "Don't take this class. The way it is in shopping period is exactly how it will be. It is a seminar in name only; Harries lectures the whole time and listening to the lectures is like listening to someone read a dissertation in a different language. If you do take it, look up Siegfried and Thales first, as they're referenced every 15 seconds.",
    "Great course. Nietzsche is one of the most entertaining philosophers to read and Harries very knowledgeable and accessible. The work load is very manageable and yet I took a great deal away from the course. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Philosphy. Professor Harries says he will teach this class as a lecture next fall and I highly recommend it for other students to take it.",
    "Any philosophy or humanities major should take this. Harries makes Nietzsche so clear you come to new insights on modernism and postmodernism all by yourself.",
    "Sure, if you want to spend some time with Nietzsche texts in a relaxed manner.",
    "Yes, yes, three times yes! I would actually suggest this course even for non-philosophy majors and those new to Nietzsche. Professor Harries engages with the material on a very deep level, referencing many works to convey very insightful but thematically focused interpretations. This makes the class both easy to follow and open to further exploration. This course was many things most classes are not: meaningful, unforgettable, and inspiring. However, for it to be such one needs more than an academic interest in Nietzsche as a big name in philosophy. One should be sincerely enthusiastic and strive to engage the material thoroughly.",
    "YES. And anything else Prof. Harries teaches. Actually, scratch that, don't - that way I can get in.",
    "Karsten Harries is a philosophy god. If this is a seminar, don't expect to talk. Go to office hours and have your life changed.",
    "If you are interested in Nietzsche, there is no better.",
    "I think it's a wonderful course to take for someone interested especially in the early Nietzsche or in reading Zarathustra.",
    "I'm a senior, and this could very well be the best course I've taken. Don't be fooled by the seminar format: it's pretty much a lecture course. This is great, though, because Harries is a genius and I wouldn't have wanted to listen to anyone else. The course is a single, sustained argument that complicates the straightforward reading of Also Sprach Zarathustra that you're probably used to. To do it, he needs to tie together Nietzsche's views on truth, logic, language, art, values, and the point of philosophy in general. The amount of background Harries brings is stunning - he will quote as much from Schopenhauer, Kant, Goethe, etc. as from Nietzsche - and, as an analytically inclined philosophy major, I was satisfied by the careful attention to the detail of arguments and skepticism towards certain premise. I have entirely changed my conception of Nietzsche, and it might even be fair to say that this course changed my life.Harries has said he's planning on teaching pretty much the same themes in an actual lecture course next year. You owe it to yourself to take it."
