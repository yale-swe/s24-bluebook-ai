   "comments": [
    "Great class, learned a lot and would definitely recommend it to another student",
    "I would most definitely recommend it!",
    "Great class! Take it but don't wait until the last minute to study for the exams because they cover A LOT of material.",
    "I would recommend it if you are an art history student or if (like me)you enjoy history. However, fair warning: it can be challenging to memorize all the pieces of art (with their corresponding names and dates) even when you give yourself plenty of time to study. Also, the tests are HARD, because you basically have to write as quickly as you possibly can and there's very little wiggle room in terms of the time limit. I actually never finished the essay section for either the midterm or the final because I ran out of time. With that said, it's an interesting course, and Kleiner is a good lecturer. Shop it for a couple of days and then make the call about whether you think it's a good option for you.",
    "Great experience if you want to take something that's different, interesting.",
    "If you are already fascinated in the material, then a great class to take. Interesting because Professor Kleiner has first-hand experience with the material. Lectures can be a little boring and hard to stay awake during.",
    "Definitely. If you have any interest in Rome or art history take this course. It's really straight forward and you learn so much.",
    "I would definitely recommend Roman Art. It is a great introduction to the field. You learn a great deal from the lectures and the layout of the course is incredibly straightforward and fair.",
    "This class, for me, was a great introduction to an art history-style approach to material and analysis of works. It thus really helped to round out my knowledge of how to look at artifacts and artwork, in addition to providing a lot of interesting information about Roman history in the process. Professor Kleiner is a great lecturer and the stories associated with the emperors and artifacts are colorful enough to keep even a night owl like me awake in a darkened lecture hall at 9am!",
    "I thought the class was interesting, but the lack of section with a virtual one in it's place was disorienting. There is not really anybactually looking at physical pieces of art in any of the class. It is very look at the projector and regurgitate based. Only take it if you are independently and personally eager to learn about roman art with little support.",
    "100% This is the best class you will ever take!",
    "This is a challenging, but very rewarding class covering Roman art and the political and social context behind it. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, even one who has never taken a class in art history or classics. Professor Kleiner iswonderful; she is an incredibly gifted lecturer and really brings what seems like a dull subject to life. She is also truly an expert; she wrote the book herself. The work for the class is definitely concentrated around the two exams (one at midterm, one at the end of the term...both non-cumulative, and no final!) and the midterm paper. Studying for those exams isn't easy, especially if you've never taken art history, and memorizing the names and dates and significance of 200 marble sculptures at a time isn't exactly fun. But don't let that deter you from taking this gem of a class.",
    "This is an overview of Roman art until Constantine. Professor Kleiner is very energetic and enthusiastic. The virtual section is hard to get used to, but important. There is a LOT of information to absorb for the two exams, so START EARLY and work regularly. Overall, it's worth it if you are interested in the material.",
    "This class was a comprehensive look at Roman sculpture, with detailed analysis from an historical viewpoint. Lots of memorizing dates and names though.",
    "Roman Art is interesting and hugely informative, and the lectures are never boring. Its a really rewarding class because it works so well chronologically, but Kleiner's thematic structure also highlights really well the connections across lectures. The art is beautiful!"
