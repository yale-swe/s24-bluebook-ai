    "yes I would recommend this class because it gives people a solid introduction to business ethics in all aspects",
    "I would not recommend this class. The class has great reading, but the sessions do not have any discussion. There is so much potential for this class, but it doesn't meet expectations.",
    "Good class. Easy - only biweekly responses on the blog and a final paper.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class.Good introduction into business ethics and multinationals. The class is very well structured so it flows nicely from week to week. Manageable workload.",
    "Take it if you are interested in ethics in corporations.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is thought-provoking and interesting and all students. The strength of the class very much so depends on the students in it so I suggest seeing what the students are like before you decide to take it. Professor Rose-Ackerman is great and leads a wonderful dialogue. She's accessible and easy to talk to so much sure you make an effort to get to know her! If there's one weakness though, it's that you have no idea where you're at in the class until the end. The majority of the grade comes from the final paper so you don't know where your grade stands throughout the semester. The 25 page paper is a lot and it's supposed to be semester-long. My recommendation: start it before reading week. It's hard during the semester, but it is so worth doing earlier and getting Professor SRA's help earlier and when you can. There are also reading responses every other week, which are no pressure."
