    "Take this course. Just take it. You will learn things that are fascinating, and relevant, and sometimes mind-blowing. It is so interesting and so rewarding. One of the best courses I have taken at Yale (although be warned, there is a lot of reading and work).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but be warned that it is very easy to get behind on the readings and video lectures! Your entire grade rests upon two (relatively easy) exams and one (fun) paper.Take notes by hand to stay engaged in the course, and always watch the video lectures before class.I've rated the workload \"less\" but that's just because you don't really have to do all the reading (and there's a lot of reading). Of course, the more reading you do, the more you'll get out of the class.",
    "Take it! Super interesting",
    "This class was great, but the work was somewhat tedious because with each lecture came an accompanying 50 minute online lecture, of which the exams were based off of.",
    "Great. It's the Bible. You have to read it at some point; why not now?",
    "I think this course is definitely beneficial for anyone in any field of study, because it teaches you SO MUCH about one of the most important books in the history of humankind. Although it is A LOT of work, if you stick with it, you will literally see allusions to the text everywhere you look. Looking back on the class, it is one of the most satisfying experiences I have had yet at Yale.",
    "Great Class! Lots of reading as well as online lectures that should be done if you want to enjoy the class to the fullest extent.",
    "This was a great course, and Hayes is a phenomenal lecturer. It puts the Bible in its historical context, explaining the crises and situations to which its books were originally responding, and it discusses interpretation only a little. IT IS NOT A COURSE ON THEOLOGY OR LITERATURE, but on comprehending what the Bible means in its historical setting. Regardless of your background coming into the course, it will question your assumptions and equip you will really a valuable understanding of the books that came to comprise the Bible and a larger idea of how to approach the Biblical text as a whole.The course requires a TON of work - 2.5 hours of class, another 1.5ish of watching online lectures, and 4+ hours of reading (starting with more secondary sources in the beginning, and more of the text in the second half of the course) each week. The exams are only based on the online lectures though, so you really don't have to learn all that you are asked to learn, but you shouldn't take the class unless you're interested... and if you're interested, you'll want to do all the work, and you'll value what you learn.",
    "I walked into this class on a whim and never walked out. It is *fascinating*, especially to someone like me who was raised atheist and never studied the Bible. When I tried to do so on my own, I found it completely obscure and bizarre. This class put the Bible into its historical and anthropological context, so that all the incredibly weird things actually made sense. It's just an incredibly fun and interesting course.",
    "TAKE IT. SO GREAT. SHE'S SO GREAT. THE CLASS IS SO GREAT. DO NOT FALL BEHIND ON ONLINE LECTURES!",
    "YES! Take this class! It was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Prof. Hayes is simple incredible. She is engaging and you will learn something valuable in every lecture. She also does a good job of articulating the key themes of the class, and her exams are not that difficult (the review sheets pretty much tell you what will be on the exam).Note: This class has a lot of work. You have to watch the Open Yale lectures before every class in addition to your assigned reading. I would say that the Open Yale lectures are most important, followed by the Biblical readings and then the secondary sources. Don't slack off or fall behind! You will regret it.Also, Prof. Hayes wins the award for most interesting style.",
    "Great course. Everyone at Yale should take this. Doesn't matter what religion you subscribe to or if you are not religious at all (I'm an atheist myself). The Bible is so integral to our society, and The Old Testament is vital to understanding our culture.",
    "You want to know about the Bible? Take this class, and you will learn how to read it and discuss it. Well.Be prepared to work hard for a good grade, but you can still get a TON out of the class credit\/d. I knew nothing about the Old Testament walking in, and now I can tell you something about each book of it. (I didn't even know there were different books...I was telling the truth a few sentences ago when I said I knew nothing about the Old Testament). I had learned things afterwards I didn't know before, and that to me is the sign of a good class.",
    "Great class to analyze human history's most important book. Christine Hayes is one of those human beings you would in another life like to get to know. She learned everyone's name in the class, and actively tried to engage us. Her online lectures are extremely well-prepared. The Bible is really a literature class with a historical perspective, and you soon find out that there are so many intricacies in this formative anthropological work--the way it's constructed, the subtle biases it has, the common misconceptions modern religion has taken from it. It's not too much work either; the lectures are pretty quickly gone through and are the only testable material (note: not the actual biblical text itself). I actually went to Slifka and had an intelligent conversation about the philosophical underpinnings of the Book of Job with a Jew after I took this class.And she has such an impressive vocabulary!!! Also, she's not Jewish.",
    "If you know relatively little about the Bible and are interesting in learning more, take this class. It can be a little work heavy at times, but the most important thing is to watch the online lectures, so the work load is relatively manageable. If you've taken several religious studies and\/or bible courses, however, I would reconsider. Look over the syllabus and think about the idea that this is indeed an intro to the bible course. You'll enjoy the time you spend in the course and will learn much even if you have taken other courses, but there will definitely be times where much of it will be information you have already learned.",
    "The Bible is not a theology course. Rather, it is a full reading of the Old Testament alongside study of ancient Near Eastern historical trends and the consideration of modern biblical scholarship. The course is absolutely incredible in the way that it embraces the ambiguities and complexities of the Bible as an anthology of ancient Near Eastern literature that came to serve as a people's national history. Drop any assumptions you have about the Old Testament, take this course, and be prepared to have an entirely new, deeper understanding of the rise of Judaism. Professor Hayes will make every class a complete joy with her incredible knowledge and encouragement of student discussion.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in understanding the Bible. There's simply no better way to learn about it. The class is a lot of work, but it is always fun and interesting.",
    "Yes-- if you want to really get to know the Hebrew Bible, this is the class for you. Prof Hayes is great, you wont regret taking this class!",
    "It's a survey of the Hebrew Bible. Take it if that interests you, because that's what you read! Also, don't take it Credit\/D even if you want to, because you'll end up not reading anything. Even if you don't take it, sit in on a lecture - Professor Hayes is incredible.",
    "This class is a survey of the Bible and also includes an overview of the different fields that make up modern biblical scholarship. Take it if you have any interest in the bible (whether you have learned any bible or not in the past), because Professor Hayes is one of the best professors you will encounter at Yale. She cares so much about her students and is an expert in the field. Lectures are interesting and the workload is heavy but doable.",
    "Take this class, regardless of your major, religious identity, previous interest in the Bible. You will not regret it, I promise. Be ready to put in a fair amount of work (though you can certainly slack off and get away with it, it's worth it to keep up the effort). Christine Hayes is a really one-of-a-kind experience. It's a great class for Religious Studies majors, English majors, freshmen, seniors, really anybody.",
    "Take this class.",
    "LOVED THIS CLASS. highly recommend. the bible is highly engrained in Western culture, so knowing it well means knowing the foundation for a lot of other things. lot of work because you have to watch the lectures beforehand and there's a lot of reading, but totally worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course -- it will give you a look at one of the inescapable facts of life in the Western world (religion) in an intelligent, probing, fascinating light.",
    "TAKETHISCLASSTAKETHISCLASSTAKETHISCLASSTHIS CLASS IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! Professor Hayes is absolutely unbelievable--she's insanely smart, and she's really engaging. It was nice watching the lectures beforehand--I've never been in a lecture with so much participation. Take this class---or just shop the first one :)",
    "The material covered in this course is really fascinating. Know that it will be spending a lot more time on Biblical scholarship (source theory, comparisons to similar ANE traditions, etc.) and Biblical history than doing close, literary readings of text (although there is some of that too). Honestly, the online lectures were great but you can read them on your own time outside of a class and the lectures in-person often felt like a waste of time, just recapitulating what you were already supposed to have read. Doing the lecture readings, the Bible readings, the supplementary readings, and going to class is a huge time commitment.",
    "Absolutely. A fascinating course, and great to take even if religious\/judaic studies isn't your major. A lot of work, but you'll want to do it for Professor Hayes. The paper involves close reading of biblical texts and outside sources and is pretty fun to write. Great class--definitely go to the first lecture and see if it's for you.",
    "I recommend for those who have some background in the Bible or none at all. Hayes shows how to read the bible through many many different lenses. Even religious Jews and Christians got something out of this class, I believe. Just make sure to watch her lectures online (required) or better yet read the transcripts. She is a truly admirable teacher that is clearly enthusiastic about the subject she teaches and the students under her tutelage. The secondary readings I thought were fascinating but it can be hard to find time to do them! I highly recommend.",
    "wow, what a high-quality course. You'll find fewer classes better conceived and executed than this one, and few professors as intelligent and friendly as Christine Hayes.You should be aware that this is a historical-critical study of the Hebrew Bible: so you don't consider the Bible in relation to Judaism or Christianity, but ask how Israelite religion operated during the Biblical period. I found this frustrating at times because you discover that parts of the Bible - especially the prophets, covered extensively in the 2nd half of the course - are not especially interesting on their own terms. The \"Bible\" as we think of it was mostly conceived by later interpretative work and isn't found anywhere in the actual text. NONETHELESS, I realize in retrospect that a course like this one is essential to understanding later interpretative work - unless you understand the Bible on its own terms, you can't appreciate the creativity and the theological agenda of later interpreters.anyways, wonderful class.",
    "Take it!",
    "Great class. Professor Hayes is amazing and knowledgeable and incredibly, will know your name before the midterm even if you never participate. I only wish there hadn't been so much reading (there really is a lot, although not as much as assigned for some seminars or Total War) or that I had been able to keep up with it better--I learned some truly interesting things, but all the way at the end of the semester, when it was too late to ask questions in class. Professor Hayes also grades pretty hard, so I would recommend either taking this Cr\/D or making sure you have time to devote to it. If you do the latter, it'll really be worth it.",
    "This is a great course, tons of work though and the paper really slams you at the end so be forewarned.",
    "I came into this class having never opened a Bible and found the material to be, at times, challenging, but also enlightening and important. I am thrilled that I took it.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student if they enjoy a lot of reading. The class is interesting for those who love biblical literature. I personally did not like the class."
