    "Awesome intro photo class, especially with Rebecca! I learned a lot from the critiques and lectures and my pictures improved hugely over the course of the semester. Both Rebecca and Lucas (TA) were super helpful and knowledgeable. The experience also depends on the other people in the class too, and I was lucky because we had a really fun group. I recommend taking it, and shopping it for sure.",
    "Very good introduction to digital photography - take it.",
    "It's an ideal intro photography class. You learn a lot and at the end you can explore a topic of your choice.",
    "YES FOREVER TAKE THIS CLASS"
