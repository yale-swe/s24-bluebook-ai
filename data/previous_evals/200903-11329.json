    "One must write a poem a week, along with a response to a book of poetry. The class will improve you as a person: you learn to speak eloquently, read incisively, and more importantly, you develop a voice and perspective.",
    "Professor Gluck is as generous as she is sharp-- a tremendous instructor. You will write one poem and read one book of poetry of your choosing each week. Add to that reading everyone else's poems, talking about 3 of them in depth, and getting extremely attentive notes from Prof Gluck-- I can't imagine a better formula for improving your writing.",
    "The course is wonderful, and Gluck is brilliant, but she can be quite harsh....",
    "Of course, if you want to write. There is nobody like Louise Gluck; her engagement with student work is heartfelt and her comments are keen, sensitive, and meaningful. Take it.",
    "Yes. Writing classes tend to slip in the face of other, more rigid academic expectations. Take as few other courses as you can to devote as much time to it as you can."
