    "I learned how to take lots of different integrals.",
    "Pretty standard first course in complex analysis - we began with the basics of complex numbers (polar representation; geometry of complex numbers; manipulating common expressions) and worked our way through complex differentiation\/Cauchy-Riemann equations, complex line integrals and integration in general, complex power series and Laurent series, calculus of residues, and topics relating to the logarithmic integral (counting zeroes, winding numbers, Rouch's Theorem, etc.). My proof writing didn't improve nearly as much as it did in real analysis, since there is a decent amount of computation in this course (and complex analysis has generally nicer proofs than real analysis). There are some absolutely beautiful and satisfying results in this course, which alone make it worth it.",
    "A really comprehensive understanding of the basics of complex analysis, including integration techniques that are insaaanely useful for integrals in the real numbers. The class went really far, and it was both challenging and rewarding.",
    "We covered the basics of complex analysis: analytic functions, various theorems attributed to Cauchy and Riemann about integrals, Taylor and Laurent series, winding numbers, and perhaps most importantly, the calculus of residues. We covered the first 8 chapters of T. Gamelin's \"Complex Analysis.\" This class covers what most people consider some of the most beautiful results in mathematics.",
    "I learned all about properties of analytic functions, Laurent series, and evaluating contour integrals. Complex analysis is a beautiful field of mathematics because of the strength of holomorphic functions, and it is deeply useful as well. Through taking this course, I also learned that you can't rely solely on lectures to understand the material. Reading the textbook (Gamelin) is essential for this class.",
    "All about complex analysis: Cauchy integral formula, residue calculus, contour integrals, power series, Laurent series, etc.",
    "The basics of complex analysis - chapters 1-8 of the Gamelin Complex Analysis textbook (2001).",
    "A knowledge of key results in complex analysis.",
    "Complex analysis.",
    "Introductory complex analysis.",
    "This course covers a staggering amount of content. The syllabus lists the topics \"power series, line integrals, Cauchy theorem, Residue calculus, various applications.\" This is the understatement of the century. We covered pretty much everything from chapters 1 through 8 of Gamelin, along with a selection of topics from chapters 9 and 11. A more accurate list of topics would be: line integrals, harmonic functions, holomorphic functions, Cauchy integral theorem, power series (and related topics, including Liouville's theorem, Morera's theorem, and Goursat's theorem), Laurent series, isolated singularities, a taste of harmonic analysis, calculus of residues, even more calculus of residues, so much calculus of residues that you want to cry yourself to sleep, the argument principle (and related topics, including Rouche's theorem, Hurwitz's theorem, open mapping theorem, and winding numbers), Schwarz Lemma, and then like I dunno something related to the Riemannian mapping theorem? Honestly things were getting pretty hazy by the end of the semester, I really had no idea what was going on.",
    "I learned a LOT about complex analysis. The course is very fast-paced, and teaches both the fundamentals of complex analysis and the nitty-gritty of taking difficult integrals. A good portion of the class is focused on examples of integrals which are impossible to evaluate with only the real numbers.",
    "I took this class to learn calculus of residues, and in addition to the many other topics covered during the semester, it's safe to say that I now know calculus of residues.",
    "The first half of this course focuses on holomorphic functions (and is fairly theoretical), and then the second half is mostly residue calculus (which is a bit more applied).",
    "We covered Gamelin Chapters 1-9: complex functions & branching, holomorphic functions, line integrals, power series & Laurent series, residue theorem, logarithmic integrals, Schwarz lemma. Overall it was a huge amount of material, and I felt like we rushed through most of it (especially the end of the course).",
    "We learned the basic curriculum of Complex Analysis, up to meromorphic functions and calculus of Residues.",
    "An overview of complex functions, especially the properties of holomorphic functions along with the Cauchy-Reimann equations. Then we covered several topics centered around Cauchy's Theorem and Cauchy's Integral Theorem, before moving to techniques in Residue Calculus and finishing with Winding Numbers and the definition of a Simply Connected Domain.",
    "The basics of complex analysis: Cauchy-Riemann equations, holomorphic and harmonic functions, Cauchy's Theorem, series of complex functions, isolated singularities, and some other stuff I've forgotten already.",
    "I learned the foundations of complex analysis.",
    "The dark arts of complex analysis (how to bend the complex plane to your will), as covered by first 10 chapters of Gamelin and a bit of Stein & Shakarchi at the end.",
    "In this course you practice writing proofs and gain intuition and understanding of the complex plane."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: The peer tutor, Harish Vemuri, was a total icon. Weakness: This course would probably be better if people came to class.",
    "I thought this course was pretty decent, as far as the Yale Math Department goes. Expectations were clear, exams were fair, and the homework assignments were pretty reasonable beyond a question or two. The course moved far too quickly at the beginning - we covered something like three chapters in the first two weeks - but the pace improved dramatically as the course went on. Be warned that the curve is terrible, since the class is loaded with math superstars and the Stefan mentality of grading strictly has permeated throughout the department. All in all, probably a solid option for CR\/D\/F to take some stress off. The results are super cool, and I don't regret taking the class at all.",
    "Strengths: beautiful material, manageable workload, interesting results, good exams, with a caring professor who was always pretty available. Office hours were very helpful, and the tests were difficult, but fair. Weaknesses: sticks pretty closely to the textbook (although it's a really good textbook), and the lectures could be pretty dry, especially towards the beginning of the class. The p-set problems should also have been chosen betterone problem could require only a literal restatement of a result from class, while another required 4+ pages of complicated computations with tons of difficult logical leaps, and they'd be worth exactly the same.",
    "This class is fantastic because of its continuation in MATH 315. So the professor can cover whatever they feel comfortable doing in a semester, at a leisurely pace, and then wrap it up the next semester. Of all the math classes I've taken, this class is the strongest.",
    "Franco goes too quickly, especially at the beginning of the semester. His lectures are uninspiring, and the homework is tedious. He explains the material thoroughly, explaining nuances well, but the class feels more like carrying a big bag of theorems rather than connecting broad ideas in a rich field of mathematics. This class could be improved by having more interesting and insightful homework exercises. Also, more review materials for tests would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: beautiful material taught excellently by Franco. Cons: it's difficult, particularly exams. But Franco incentivizes doing the psets diligently, so if you put time into those, it'll help with studying for exams later on. Not sure how he could improve the course overall--it was really a fun class.",
    "The class is very well structured, and follows the textbook pretty well. The professor is really great, explains concepts well, makes sure he is teaching at an appropriate speed. Although Prof. Vargas Pallete was really great about accommodating for students who couldn't make the office hours but needed help, it would be helpful if there were more peer tutors and office hours times.",
    "I think the course would be better if more applications were mentioned",
    "The problem sets are very poorly picked -- questions vary in difficulty from trivial to impossible given what is taught (so much so that the professor sometimes cannot solve them in reasonable time), and are often repetitive. The exams are similarly poorly designed -- while substantial challenge is appropriate in an exam, that challenge should be original. These exams consist substantially of homework problems to be redone, or very similar problems.",
    "The difficultly level and amount of material covered are both reasonable. The problem sets were sometimes too long, and I wish Franco had done the problems before assigning them, because some were absurdly long or difficult, to the point where it took him nearly two hours to solve during his OH.",
    "The primary strength of this course is that cover a lot of content. The primary weakness of this course is that you cover a lot of content. Professor Franco is very efficient and clear in his explanations, but there still were many points in this course where I felt I was drowning under all the content we were learning. Complex analysis is a beautiful field and while this course does expose you to a lot of beautiful math, it would have been nice to stop and smell the flowers every once in a while. There were a couple topics (off the top of my head I can think of Mobius transformations and applications to harmonic analysis) I would have liked to explore in more depth, instead of racing to cram even more content into the tail end of the course that I ended up not understanding anyway.",
    "The course was very fast-paced, but not unreasonably so. The first week and the last couple weeks felt extremely rough, so I do think that the overall pacing could be handled better. The homework was very difficult and time-consuming, and was also inconsistent week to week. The class is definitely a time-sink.",
    "It would've been nice if either exam had been doable in the time we were given. It also would've been nice if the calculation-based problems that Professor Vargas Pallete chose to put on the final exam weren't some of the most time-intensive calculation-based problems we'd seen all semester.",
    "Lectures were hard to follow at times, due to the professor following the textbook fairly strictly and not stopping to emphasize points \/ explain things further. Homework assignments were a reasonable difficulty level, often taking problems directly from the textbook (which helped in figuring out which theorems should be applied). It would have been nice if we had been given homework problems similar to the exam questions, though, or if we had been given practice exam questions. Homework assignments didn't seem to be graded thoroughly, and often answers that I knew were either wrong or poorly explained were given full marks.",
    "Complex analysis is fascinating material, but this class was poorly taught and organized. Franco's lectures were dry and unengaging, as he essentially would just copy the theorems from the textbook onto the board. As a result, I didn't understand the connections between the disparate topics until very late in the course. There were some topics that he glossed over but ultimately became very crucial to understand, such as branching. The problem sets were absurdly long and computationally heavy, and we wouldn't get any feedback from the graders, but the problems would appear on the midterm and final. It also would have been helpful to have practice problems for the exams (instead of having to just rely on homework problems we already did).",
    "It was good. Exams were hard, but psets and lectures were good.",
    "The psets were fair and incredibly useful and relevant, whereas the grading was pretty lax. The peer tutor was key for me to learn, as the lectures were not always engaging.",
    "The course posed very interesting material, and the problem sets explored this material but at times it could feel disorienting. Often we would have no context for new theorems or results presented in class, and it was clear that Professor Vargas-Pallete was taking his notes straight from the textbook. (At times, it was more helpful to read the textbook.) Still he did sometimes present different proofs than the textbook, or remarked on what he did and did not like from the book, but these were more the exceptions than the rule. Because of this, you had to do a lot of reading on your own, and take results on the blind faith that they would become useful later on, but still it made for an interesting class.",
    "I think the problem sets and exams were fair, and we covered a good amount of material. The lectures were decent, although sometimes Prof. Vargas would get off-track or get hung up on a proof for too long.",
    "It was a solid course overall, although I felt like it was very rushed at times.",
    "A little too much focus on computing integrals",
    "Strengths: The course follows the textbook closely, which makes it easy to review material before\/after class. Franco occasionally provides good intuitions for lemmas and theorems. Weaknesses: The final was way too hard given that Franco says he will not curve the class. It was significantly harder than the midterm and there was barely enough time to write all the proofs, much less think of them. Homework is much more tedious than it is worth in terms of pedagogical value. Complex analysis is one of the most beautiful branches of mathematics and the course would benefit from a more careful selection of problems, instead of assigning work for work's sake.",
    "Most proofs in the course were very algebraic. It may be nice to get more geometric intuition for the different concepts. The grading on the homeworks was also very loose, so I often felt that I wasn't sure if I was understanding the material correctly. Because of this, I also didn't fully trust the student solutions that were posted for each problem set, so it would have been nice to have had official staff solutions to compare my work.",
    "This course was a ton of work, very poorly structured, awfully balanced and taught by a novice professor who was not familiar with the subject matter. It should have been less work and a lot note focus on the theory, as the tests were basically regurgitating the homework and lecture proofs, which were irrelevant to the actual mathematics.",
    "The textbook for the course is great, and the problem sets very well reflect the ideas from the book. There is not much support for the class, and the problem sets are still very difficult."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning some powerful and satisfying results in mathematics. Complex analysis is particularly elegant, since you don't have to worry about nearly as many pathological functions as you do in real analysis (for reasons you'll learn in the course)! This is a great class to audit or CR\/D\/F if you're worried about grades, but still want to enjoy the awesome field that is complex analysis. There were many times in class that we'd do an example or write a proof that just left me smiling at the end (like Liouville's Theorem), which has never happened for me in another math course.",
    "I'd recommend this to any math major, but not many people outside of that. The material is absolutely beautiful and incredibly useful, but neither the p-sets nor the lectures are particularly inspiring. The class sticks pretty closely to the Gamelin textbook, and the tests, although very difficult, are nothing out of the ordinary, with most problems similar to the homework and the results shown in class. There were a couple of problems with the class this semester, but I'd imagine it was mostly because the professor was inexperienced and will get better by next year. The syllabus listed 5 textbooks, even though 4 of them were never even mentioned, while the last book (Gamelin) was the basis of most of the lectures as well as the source of almost all the homework and exam problems. The first couple of lectures were incredibly confusing and hard to follow, but after some feedback the style changed tremendously and became pretty good and far clearer. Take this class because it's incredibly useful and the material is beautiful, but don't expect your life to be changed, and be ready for a serious challenge with the p-sets and exams.",
    "If you're a non-math major who is interested in learning some very applicable -- and cool! -- results, then definitely take this class. I took it as a physics major and wasn't destroyed by it, so the class is accessible to people who come from different math backgrounds. If you're a math major, you have to take this class so... enjoy the fun results! It's not a whole lot of work and the exams are fair (and fairly graded).",
    "I would, with caution. The material is incredibly interesting, and holomorphic functions do lots of amazing things. If you take it, though, be prepared for long nights working on psets with nuances that are tedious rather than insightful. The lectures are rather boring. Read the textbook.",
    "Yes! It definitely helps to come in with a background in real analysis, but the course material is elegant, challenging, and compelling. If you can take it with Franco, even better--I've shopped the class for a few years in a row, and he's by far the best teacher I've seen in this position. Expect difficult problem sets (but very manageable, especially with help from the peer tutor) and difficult exams (that rely in part on knowledge from the problem sets).",
    "Yes! Would highly recommend. Course is very well taught and material is very interesting. It is a good balance between being proof based and solving integrals.",
    "Complex analysis is a very cool subject with lots of interesting connections of other areas of math like number theory and topology. You learn that integration in the complex plane has lots of weird properties and allows you to compute integrals by analyzing how badly a function goes to infinity. However, the teaching was ok but not the best. Professor Pallete was good about answering questions but sometimes didn't seem to know what he was talking about and got himself confused. He would then read over the textbook for a little bit and try to do the proof from the textbook so it may have been better just to read the textbook. Some very useful\/important results were not covered such as the maximum modulus principle and infinite series by residues and the professor didn't do a super good job doing practice with residue calculus. That saying, the lectures were generally clear (and gave insights beyond the textbook) and the homework\/exams mostly fair.",
    "Definitely - if Franco is teaching it then it will be solid. The material is great, so it all depends on who is teaching it",
    "I cannot in good conscience recommend this course. It was sufficiently poorly taught that any interested student would be better of teaching themself the material.",
    "Overall my feelings about this course are moderately positive. I would recommend it to a fellow math major, albeit with many reservations. (Physics majors often take this course due to the applications of complex analysis to physics, but I can't really speak to that.) Complex analysis is a beautiful field but the breakneck pace of the course definitely had a negative impact on my understanding on the material. I would have liked to see more time spent building up intuition and motivation for the concepts we did learn rather than covering more content. Also, the difficulty of problem set questions oscillated wildly and the exams were frustratingly long given the allotted time. Despite this complaints I am glad I took this course, partly because its satisfies a requirement for the intensive math major, but also because I walked away with a fairly deep understanding of a handful of important topics in complex analysis.",
    "If you have the time and are interested in complex analysis, then definitely take this course. Otherwise, there are probably better uses of your time.",
    "Residue calculus made this course interesting for me. Without that content, I would not recommend this course to anyone that doesn't have to take it - lectures weren't great (the professor often just copied from the textbook), and the content is difficult and the exams were hard. But, for the mathematically inclined student interested in calculus, residue calculus is essential, in my opinion. This course was more applied than Real Analysis (mostly due to the several weeks spent just solving residue calculus integrals), which I enjoyed. Keep in mind that exams were disproportionately hard.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student, at least not with Franco teaching it. This class was unnecessarily difficult for an intro complex analysis course, and Franco did not do a good job of explaining the material conceptually or drawing connections between different topics. The exams and psets were both pretty brutal. Even if you are a math major, I'd recommend taking a different core class or waiting until another professor teaches this class.",
    "Yeah, just make sure you study for the exams.",
    "Totally! Complex Analysis is such a gem of mathematics, with plenty of applications into Geometry and Number Theory. It's God's gift for us mere mortals that we get to see this 2 dimensional goodness in all its beauty and charm.",
    "It's a good course and gives a good foundation in Complex Analysis. If you can keep up with the material early on in the semester, and stay engaged during the techniques for Residue Calculus, it's a good course. Just be prepared to do lots of reading on your own, because you may find these more helpful than lectures, which became really just Professor Vargas-Pallete reading from the textbook.",
    "I think it's important to know at least some complex analysis if you want to study math or physics, so if you're in one of those disciplines I would suggest taking this course.",
    "I would. Complex analysis is a very cool subject and this course did a good job of presenting it, although the course was pretty demanding.",
    "Yes for math and\/or physics majors.",
    "No. Wait until someone else is teaching it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. There is very little support, lectures are not particularly helpful, and combined with very difficult problem sets, the course is not great."
