    "A language course for those who don't like languages. The workload is minimal and the class is fun. The teacher is informal and arranges the time of the class for your convenience. There are also surprise \"pesta\" throughout the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Numerous presentations and tests allow you to practice both written and oral language. Participation in this class is encouraged andmade easyby the instructor. I look forward to attending this class everyday.",
    "Awesome! What a great class, and Indonesian is a very cool language. Indriyo is definitely my favorite teacher at Yale, and I always looked forward to going to class. The out-of-class activities are also really cool, and it's been great getting to know the Indonesian community in Connecticut.",
    "Indonesian is a great language and I'm glad I chose it. Pak Indriyo is great and the class is fun and pretty easy.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to intermediate level Indonesian learners.",
    "INDN 130 is just as awesome as L1 and L2 were! The Keren textbook that you use in L3 is much better than the BITSI textbook from L1\/L2, and you get to undertake a larger-scale final project throughout the semester based on a topic or area of study of interest to you. If you enjoyed L1\/L2, you should definitely take L3."
