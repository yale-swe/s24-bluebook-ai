    "Average",
    "Absolutely recommend it. Interesting mix of social theory, economics, really interesting readings.",
    "Really interesting class and a great instructor. It should be really interesting for both philosophy and non-philosophy majors. Discussion and readings are really interesting.",
    "Excellent course. The readings are fascinating and are generally easy to follow. Note that this is a philosophy course, so one should not expect to be covering questions of policy-making. That said, many of the theories have implications for policy decisions.",
    "A bit more of a focus on Rawls than I would have liked (although he did write the seminal work, so that shouldn't be surprising), but overall a good course. Classroom discussion was weak this year, but that is probably due to the particular students rather than the class. Generally interesting concepts and discussion, but for someone coming from a strong philosophy background I felt a bit hampered by being forced to constrain my discussions to those of social justice rather than ethics generally.",
    "This class is political philosophy. If you might not light that you might not like this course. I was more interested in the social justice part of it and less in the theories, but it turns out it's theory heavyyy. How the class goes will depend a lot on who the other kids in it are. Markus was great though. Check it out.",
    "Take this class as a higher level Phil class that will introduce you to modern ideas of moral philosophy and distributive justice.",
    "This is a class on the major strains of thought on the topic of distributive justice. Readings included Rawls, Nozick, Singer, Kymlicka, Cohen, Nussbaum etc.. I would highly recommend it to any student with a decent background in philosophy, and count it as one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Markus is a talented instructor who really cares for his students. Additionally, the seminar format allowed for spirited conversation, and the assessment was never a burden.",
    "A wonderful course, a broad subject of philosophical theories of social justice, particularly distributive justice. Markus is a truly excellent teacher, and you should definitely shop this course--or anything else he teaches!"
