   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class, especially for those who like literature and history. The structure of the class helps you relate those two subjects in an interesting way.",
    "YES.",
    "Of course I recommend it! Great lecturer, excellent materials, great section!",
    "Take this class! Professor Magaziner is SO interesting, and it is a wonderful way to look at the history of Africa in a more social\/artistic way.",
    "I think that the course was a good introduction to African history, but had several failings.First, the lectures were good and contained interesting stories and information. However, I felt that Professor Magaziner often had difficulty moving beyond the basic conclusion he was trying to reach\u0097the lectures all had a thesis, but it was repeated again and again without moving beyond to really ask what it meant or why it was important. I often found lectures unsatisfying in that way.Second, I think that the novels, though most were good or interesting, were not all very good and not all very interesting. I think that though maybe four or five novels at most would've made sense, the should be much more history readings. Particularly I think that exploring our assumptions about Africa and readings that contextualized what we learned in lecture or the novels about particular countries in the context of broader themes of what was going on in Africa.That brings me to the third, and I think most important point. That's that the class often did a great job looking at an anecdote or story, but, for all of what I felt was Professor Magaziner's suggestion that these stories were telling for much or most of Africa, I don't feel like we learned about the broader context to those stories. I know anecdotes, but I don't know trends. The class didn't help teach me those trends, and in fact, it made me more reluctant to make broader claims about Africa based on any one story. But all we ever got were single stories.The last thing I want to say is that I thought the final was a really great exam. I feel like I learned a lot and really benefitted from taking it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to any student interested in a course on African history that does not simply focus on the dark, negative aspects we are all so familiar with.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! take it if youre a history major, take it if you're amstud and need that \"other part of the world\" requirement, take it if you're interested in africa at all, dont be scared that its listed as history",
    "I would absolutely, absolutely recommend this class. As a history major, it is one of the favorite classes I've taken here at Yale. I would recommend this to someone even if they weren't looking for another ROW credit. Professor Magaziner is such an eloquent lecturer-- every lecture is so thoughtful and fluent. The readings are mostly historical novels, which meant I enjoyed all of the readings (and actually did all of them). Discussions during section were really rich. I looked forward to both lectures and discussions every week.",
    "This is a fantastic class. Professor Magaziner is amazing, and I would highly recommend taking any class with him. I also really liked how the primary readings for the class were novels.",
    "Take it for the lectures for sure.",
    "African Encounters with Colonialisms is a fantastic rest of the world lecture course for anyone remotely interested in Africa, colonialism, imperialism, and the formation of the modern world. Prof. Magaziner is an extremely engaging lecturer who uses both audio and visual well, and the readings mostly consist of a novel each week that the class then asks you to use as a historical source. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "History 332 is a history of Africa presented through a succinct lecture and a series of novels. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if you have any interest in learning about the history of Africa.",
    "Pretty good class, but definitely hard. You read a novel per week, plus supplementary readings, and the take-home final was one of the longest and most painful I've ever taken. Definitely came out of it with a better understanding of African history, especially in the context of encounters with the West.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It's far and away one of the best history classes, let alone ROWs. Magaziner is one of the best professors at Yale. In a few years, if he isn't filling up large lecture halls it would only be because he doesn't want to teach lecture courses. He does a tremendous job introducing people to an area of history many have little background in and he doesn't make it feel daunting. The novels you read are a great way to get a sense for the history of the place, filling in the blanks of lecture, it's a tool I wish more professors used. Magaziner is a tremendous lecturer, well-organized, and, often, moving. If you can get his section, do it!! He's a great section\/seminar leader.",
    "a must take. Magaziner perfectly assembles a curriculum of literature, history, sociology, intellectual history. the concept of the encounter is fascinating, and he portrays it well. great discussions in section with him as well.",
    "YES! If you have any interest in Africa -- or even if you don't think you do -- take this course! Magaziner's lectures are phenomenal -- he is easily among the most engaging lecturers I've ever had at Yale. Magaziner is also extremely approachable and down to earth, and will truly make you think. His comments on papers are extremely helpful. He is a superb scholar who also cares deeply about teaching, and has a gift for doing it -- that should be enough reason to take this course.",
    "Highly recommended. The class is well-taught and compelling, Magaziner is fantastic, and it is overall a great experience, not to mention an interesting topic to explore.",
    "This class is an attempt to give a picture of colonialism in Africa. It does this through case studies and examinations of individual countries, while often getting a broader outlook from novels written by African authors.",
    "It is an overview of the African continent that sums up its history since the late colonial period. It spans the continent and focuses on different areas, which provides a strong understanding of the entire continent and its interaction with other peoples and nations."
