   "comments": [
    "I learned introductory methods of observing and understanding phonology, morphology and syntactic properties in the various dialects of American English. I learned of the dangers of linguistic prejudice and how to combat it as well as there being no \"true\" way to speak a language and that everything is dialects.",
    "I learned about specific phenomenon in different dialects such as a-prefixing (I went a-fishin'), multiple modals (I might could do that), negative concord (I've never heard nothing like that before) and many more. More importantly though, I learned about how all of these things contribute to different dialects and how all dialects are rule governed and structured. I learned about why we have certain linguistic prejudices and how there truly isn't anything wrong with people who don't speak in Standard English. I learned about phonology and vowel shifts, syntactical and lexical differences, and many other cool things.",
    "I learned about linguistic prejudice and the process of researching linguistic phenomena. This has helped me in all of my other classes and in my lifein general--i feel like a more attentive and observant human. My linguistic paper writing has also improved under Raffaella's tutelage.",
    "I learned more than I think I ever have in a class in my entire life. Not only did I learn the nitty gritty of grammar and phonology, but I learned that all dialect variations are valuable and none is substandard in comparison to another. This course gave me confidence in my Southern accent and allowed me to be more comfortable in my speech."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: material is interesting and at times personal; the two major assignments are completed incrementally throughout the semester, great for those who are still learning to tackle large assignments step-by-step; the Professor is super knowledgeable about linguistics and is a great resource for those who want to study the subject; you get to know your peers; you actually learn stuff. Cons: moves a little slowly at times, spending too long on one topic",
    "I think the assignments are really interesting and offer a bunch of different avenues for learning about topics in linguistics. I liked how many guests were brought in to give their own perspectives on their work and studies. I think it felt a little like we were jumping from topic to topic, but I think we ended up discussing a lot of really important things over the whole semester.",
    "Strengths: THIS IS THE GREATEST COURSE EVER!!! Raffaella is the GREATEST!!! She taught the content so well and she taught us about the value in each dialect. It was so comforting and i think every single student at Yale should be informed about the value of dialect variation Weaknesses: The journal and the final project were a little vague, and the professor is a stickler for you using the textbook and all the technical terms, so be sure to know what you're talking about!!"

   "comments": [
    "If the student has no experience in linguistics or has taken some classes and wants to focus on American English then this is the course for them. As someone who only has a cursory interest in linguistics, this course was completely manageable, there were also many linguistics majors in the course who were able to enjoy the class.",
    "Yes, it's a good a introduction to linguistics through an interesting and relevant lens; the Professor is really a top-tier instructor, like really really excellent; good survey of many linguistic subjects, made interactive through personalized journals; you get to learn about accents and language variations and what grammar truly is and why understanding these concepts can help us to reduce prejudice; warm environment.",
    "This is the best class I have ever taken at Yale. You have so much intuition about dialectal variation and what is\/is not acceptable in certain dialects and it is so cool to see the rules formally written out and to study it in this way. Also this course has taught me to think so much more critically about my linguistic prejudices and question why I think people who speak a certain way are not as intelligent or successful or whatever. Also there are only two main projects, and you get to choose the topics for both so you can really learn about anything that is interesting to you. And every class is partially lecture, but also partially just a discussion of if we would say certain things, and it is really fun to see what linguistic variations you have. This course deconstructs so many ideas about the importance of standard English, and I truly think every person at Yale should take this class.",
    "Yes absolutely!! I think it's a great course to take at some point during Yale because it will change the way you think about language and therefore every interaction you have with people.",
    "YES YES YES YES I WOULD RECOMMEND!! Professor Raffaella makes language so interesting and amazing, and you get to learn the most technical terms for different people having accents and speaking the way they do. You also learn that each dialect is its own unique expression of ideas and that no dialect is substandard to another. African American Vernacular English and Southern United States English are NOT BAD ENGLISH, THEY ARE JUST DIFFERENT!! Please take this class before you graduate!!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Highly. This class was an excellent introduction to linguistics in general as well as touching on a variety of social issues. I think any student would greatly benefit from and enjoy this class, regardless of year or major."
