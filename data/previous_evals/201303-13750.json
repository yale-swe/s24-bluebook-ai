   "comments": [
    "Abundant contents for each class, but sometimes too much to understand.",
    "Strengths: Provides a clear overview of U.S. health policyWeaknesses: The course is not well structured and could use more cases to analyze a policy impact.",
    "The biggest weakness is the structure of the course. Having someone lecture for 3 hours with maybe 3 students asking questions throughout is a terrible design. The class should be structured to be more interactive, or at least provide a space for students to discuss the reading they did in a formal setting or with the TAs.",
    "CLASS WAS VERY BORING. THERE WERE NO SLIDES TO REVIEW AND THE READINGS DID NOT COMPLIMENT THE LECTURES.",
    "Strengths - only meets once a weekWeaknesses - do not know what I learned all semester, difficult to pay attention for 3 hours, lecture is just tangents of random information that is not useful for the paper or the final.Improvements - teaching a more structure content, what do you want me to learn? Rambling on about random topics and opinions about things I've never heard of is not helpful",
    "lectures were not progressive; when reviewing my notes they have key bullet points but are not extensive; difficult to pick out what was important; the progressive paper assignment was a good idea though not a lot guidance was provided",
    "I think the content covered was interesting and essential for all students to know, but it was not presented in a way that one could easily grasp. There could have been more basics and then build up, more terms and definitions rather than just anecdotes and opinions. I also do not think a 3 hour block was very conducive to being alert and attentive, especially in a dark room.",
    "Strength is that the instructor is very knowledgable.Weakness is that the topic is so broad it's hard to get in depth on any one topic.",
    "This was one of the courses I had high expectations for and wished to learn something about health care policy as it is very relevant to our degree.However, I came out knowing just as little as I did walking in.The seminar is too long and the professor is too long-winded.It is difficult to pay attention and participate in the class or even feel the need to show up to class.",
    "The format of this class does not set it up for success. No one can sit in Winslow in the dark for 3 hours and actually pay attention the whole time. The class did not refer to current topics very often and never veered from the planned topics, even with the government shutdown going on - topics that I actually wanted to learn about in my only health policy course for my MPH. We never received much guidance on our papers, and I learned nothing new about health policy when writing mine - it was completely disconnected to the course and given little feedback on drafts. The corresponding textbook was also poorly written and offered no supplemental value to the course. This class could benefit a lot from being broken into a couple shorter sessions, as well as having more discussion incorporated into the class and more fleshed-out slides. I can't say I learned much about health policy in this class beyond my prior knowledge, despite its title.",
    "Very interesting course that covers a lot of ground in policy. Gusmano is hilarious and very engaging, but the class is way too long. It would be more beneficial if we had two class meetings, but I understand that may not be possible since he commutes from NY. Learned a lot from writing the papers. A lot of self-teaching because I did not have a background in anything policy related. Could use some additional feedback on papers.",
    "Professor knows what he's talking about but uses class as a soap box to just talk. It wasn't interactive and it was very hard to pay attention and sit down for 3 hours doing nothing.",
    "The lecture was 2 hours of non stop talking and it was not a very fun and engaging way to learn about policy. Please have the class entirely restructured and not let it be lecture style. The lecturer is a very well knowledged man but having him just talking and letting everyone else listen passively makes the class very dull and disinteresting. I hope we can find another Professor like Elizabeth Bradley who is inspiring.",
    "This class is poorly organized. As an introduction to policy, there should be objective components helping us build a foundation of knowledge (upon which we may have subjective components). Instead, each class consists of the professor talking about various policy topics.The first lecture was great -- it had an easy-to-follow PowerPoint, the professor had lots of interesting asides, and there was a short break during class. After that, it became more and more aimless. Overall, I feel like I wasted my time attending lecture each week.",
    "The material was very relevant, and I enjoyed the main paper. It was nice being given the freedom to choose our own paper topics.",
    "Weakness: A 3 hour class is ridiculous. Especially when the entire time, the instructor is speaking incessantly.",
    "Professor Gusmano is incredibly knowledgeable and a great person to teach this course. I wish there were more interactive group discussions though, and perhaps greater use of power points, since it was difficult to follow consecutive hours of lecturing.",
    "The lectures are too long but soooo interesting if you can stay.",
    "What is discussed during the class doesn't quite match with reading material.",
    "no strengths. weaknesses: no didactic teaching, professor acts as if he is an adjunct lecturer at yale with no responsibility to ensure that students retain the information being presented. lectures being posted after class are completely useless. NO ONE PAYS ATTENTION IF SLIDES ARE NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE ALL THIS GUY DOES IS GO OFF ON TANGENTS. I tried takign notes initially since he did not post slides and it was up to me to just stay on track with him, however if he rambles on and on and on and on and on, so i stopped taking notes. failure of a course",
    "I think that the course was really useful for an introduction to various health policy concepts. I think that it would probably be more useful for a wider audience if the class was shorter. I know that I always felt engaged, but a lot of people had a hard time concentrating during such a long span of time. I also think that there should have been more feedback given on the papers. I really liked the idea of the paper assignment as it was marketed: a way to receive feedback and improve. However, I never did receive feedback on my papers which made the exercise less useful.",
    "I really enjoyed the class with respect to pacing and content. The class contained some great information and Policy Paradox is one of my favorite texts. The one way I would improve the class would be to provide more of an organizational structure for each lecture. I think a three hour lecture can be a little overwhelming and having maybe a guide to the topics covered in each lecture would have been nice. But again overall, I really liked the class.",
    "this is a good class if you want to learn something about the health policy in US and how to evaluate a health policy.",
    "An interesting course that exposed students to various aspects of health policy and management. It really helped to frame some of the larger pictures in health care, and provided a framework on which to evaluate issues.",
    "Good coverage of topics in health policy. Would be better if the slides are more organized and the talk in class should be more related to slides. Hard to understand if the material is not organized.",
    "I did not really attend class often, so I do not feel that I can give an adequate assessment. In all honesty, the class is way too long and there is no required attendance, so many students won't go. I do not find policy intriguing and the class was super long, so I had no incentive to go. The few times I attended class I found the subject material extremely boring. During class many people would check their e-mails and work on other projects. The only people that would listen were those who are interested in policy or the legitimately good, diligent students. I was glad that we at least were able to choose any policy we liked for the project. You can honestly do ok in the class without ever going or doing any of the assignments...I like it that way considering the other very stressful work we have.",
    "The paper writing was interesting and gave an opporuntiy to really delve into a particular policy",
    "The take home exam was extremely informational and I learned a lot from doing it. The powerpoint slides for lectures were also very good. However, the slides did not correlate to the lecture content, and I wish more of the readings were discussed in class or that the lectures made more connection to the readings.",
    "Class is consist of oral presentation by the professor. a bit more difficult for ones who do not understand the context of US health care and foreigners.",
    "The topic is interesting, but it is literally impossible to keep a lecture hall of students engaged for 3 hours.",
    "While I found the lecture material to be interesting, the length (3 hrs) of the weekly lecture was one weakness of the class that I believe impacted attendance. I enjoyed writing the paper, as I liked having the freedom to explore a policy of my choosing that was important to me.",
    "Very interesting and engaging presentation of the health policy and systems landscape. Lectures are a very long 2.5 hours, which can really drag on you halfway through, but Professor Gusmano is an incredibly knowledgeable guy with a good sense of humor and a nuanced grasp of the issues. Readings aren't really addressed in lecture most of the time, and the varying under- and over-reliance on his powerpoint slides was sometimes difficult to follow. Note-taking was also difficult because of the density and pace of the material being presented, but if you show up awake and pay attention you can learn how to handle yourself in just about any random conversation in which you are expected to know how American health care works -- and doesn't.",
    "enjoyed discussing thought-provoking questions considered in health policy, but class assumed that we already knew a lot of policy terms, so some concepts were hard to understand for someone like me who does not have any policy background; felt like sometimes lectures needed to be more clear and organized",
    "Strengths - it's once a week, instructor is energeticWeaknesses - the lectures need more structure. as an introductory course, it should be structured as such and not jump into a discussion about topics half the class doesn't know about",
    "I thought the spread of information was quite good and very informative and useful for my future career. The readings were usually excellent as well and the structure of the paper was great. Because it was broken up and allowed for revision, I was able to produce something I was very proud of.",
    "Very interesting content, especially with the Affordable Care Act being implemented. Lecture can be hard to follow if you don't do the readings or have some prior knowledge of policy.",
    "Went through good concepts but lecture was difficult given time and format (needs more discussion)",
    "Would have liked more time spent on the ACA.",
    "The only weakness is that it's impossible to stay alert and awake for those 3 hours.",
    "Excellent course",
    "This class is great! but there is room for improvement: first of all, the class size is too big, therefore limited discussion. also, this class is too long (3 hours), nobody can stay focus for 3 hours long and no discussion.",
    "Strengths- interesting\/engaging, manageable work load, well taught, good selection of readings, comprehensiveWeaknesses- some lectures were a bit too long, powerpoints not posted the day after class for studying\/review",
    "I was very disappointed on the exclusive focus on health CARE policy. Although we were allowed to write our papers on any type of health policy, the lecture only dealt with health care. For a three hour lecture, I was amazed by how little information was transmitted. Gusmano is prone to getting lost in tangents, and takes a very long time to express simple points. On the take-home exam, many of the IDs were nowhere to be found on the powerpoint slides, which is a reflection of how poorly the class taught pretty basic and essential topics related to health care (eg moral hazard, pay for performance). Gusmano vowed that, if nothing else, we would walk away from the class with solid understanding of Medicare and Medicaid. Well, his lecture and slides delved deep into the nuts and bolts of the programs, particularly they're financing, but didn't really reflect on the virtues of their design, which he required us to do on the exam.In conclusion, I think Gusmano needs to take a step back, consider what he wants the takeaways of this class to be, and be more focused in his lectures to achieve those ends.",
    "Lectures were long. Liked the 3 part paper",
    "Being from a non-policy background and interested in learning about it, I was a bit disappointed. I wish he was more helpful in teaching us how to look at policies and how best to go about them. The course itself was easy, but I didn't see myself learning a whole lot.",
    "This class would benefit greatly if it had a discussion section and if the class met two times a week versus once a week for almost three hours. All of the topics covered in the course are critical to our education as public health professionals; for that reason we should have a course that has more student participation. Also, the papers were well organized and it really allowed us to understand and analyze health policy.",
    "This course needs to be desperately improved. A 3-hour once-a-week course that is lecture based is simply a bad way to learn about health policy. Many of us doze off during that time or lose track of what Professor Gusmano is saying because he doesn't always follow the slides.",
    "I appreciated the overview that this course gave of the important topics in health policy. It was especially exciting to study this field in a time of such change in American health policy. At the same time, the schedule was really bad. I understand that Prof. Gusmano isn't always on campus, but a 2.5-3 hour class is really too long - even on days when we were talking about topics that were very interesting to me, I felt my attention wandering after about an hour and a half. If there's any way to do two 1-1.5 hour classes per week instead of one 2.5-3 hour class, it would really improve the course.",
    "learn a lot about the healthcare system and how to approach it in an economist\/policy perspective3 hours may be a bit much to sit through; 2 hours is ideal",
    "Very informative. I thought the paper process was extremely helpful in learning how to write a policy argument.",
    "It was an interesting course, however I feel like it would have been more valuable to split the lecture to two sessions, and to have a more organized lecture presentation, with slides corresponding more closely with themes in lecture. it was difficult to take notes. However the readings were interesting, and the assignments were valuable.",
    "Although didactic classes are not often appreciated, I thought that this class needed a lot more structure as opposed to the instructor delivering lectures as though he were a guest lecturer. I did not learn about health policy very much at all, because the material was all over the place. The book also is not the most helpful text; it is, I believe, catered to more experienced policy students. I come from a background with absolutely no policy, so I would really benefited from a \"101\" approach like in Epi I.However, the focus of one paper through out the system was probably a lot easier to handle than say, 3 papers over the course of the semester, and perhaps a better approach for those who are new to policy.",
    "I think this course had all the elements to be a good introductory course to health policy, the delivery was just not suited for my learning style. It was not a structured setting and I was not able to follow and retain the material I wanted and needed from this class, especially as a student new to this field. It would have been helpful to have more organized and structured lectures and class notes, for me to refer back to if I needed to.",
    "The course was very interesting. It was usually taught in a lecture type of format. Class felt like watching CNN. Very informative to listen to, but I had no clue what information was going to be important to know for the exam. Also, there is no reason that the class should be scheduled for 3 hours. Most attention spans top off at 2 hours.",
    "The assignments do not pertain to the lectures. If the assignments were more tied to lecture, I think more students would come. It did not seem necessary to do the readings.",
    "This course has some interesting material, however, it should not be one three hour class once a week. It would be much easier for the students to focus and learn the material if it was broken down into multiple sessions a week with a discussion section.",
    "Course can be improved in terms of structure. Course was designed to be more of an intermediate or advanced level course on health policy, rather than a beginners level. In addition, the coursework was very open-ended and inadequate feedback was available. Class timing could be better.",
    "It was a great intro to policy, although there was absolutely no need to attend the lectures, although I did.",
    "I loved this course. I learned a ton from it, and really gained perspectives from the assignments included.",
    "Interesting but was was not structured or very informative.",
    "Strength: course covers many important topics",
    "a good course taught by a knowledgeable instructor.",
    "Excellent course that explained the machinations of healthcare in the US. However, the classes did not appear to have any clear outline, so ended up being like seminars or TED talks.It would be better if before each class, there were goals e.g. Students shuould leave the class knowing certain key facts.The class is also almost 3 hours long, and being in the late afternoon, it can be abit tedious.",
    "Excellent course to understand conflicts and balances regarding healthcare in general and specifically in the US. How policy can impact individuals and how policies are formulated. Very helpful relating to core values and the history of the major healthcare systems that exist today. Also comparative examples to other healthcare systems was illustrative.",
    "It brings out some of the abstract concepts and issues involved in the world of policy making. The text-book was a wonderful resource. The three hour lecture made it hard to concentrate.",
    "It is such an interesting topic to learn about but a more clear breakdown of the material would been helpful.",
    "Very good foundation course for intro to health systems.m",
    "This course was more interesting than I expected it to be. I learned a lot about the US health care system and how health systems are evaluated. Having a three-hour block at the end of the day was rough, and I know many people decided not to attend some classes because of the way the class was scheduled. The three-stage paper was a great assignment, but I never received much feedback on the stages.",
    "I enjoyed the instructor for this course, but not the course itself. I thought it needed to be broken into smaller lectures, which would have made the material much more manageable.",
    "The one day a week, three hour lecture format was not helpful.",
    "Breaking it down, not having a 3 hour lecture",
    "The lectures were quite boring. I stopped going, because I did not learn a lot from the lecture I did attend. The instructor talks for 2.5-3 hours straight. And, he walks in front of the PowerPoint, which is very distracting.",
    "This course is fantastic. Dr. Gusmano is an entertaining and knowledgable professor in the relevant topics of health policy and systems. The real value in his class is following his lectures, though some of my fellow students are so inexperienced and\/or have not focused on these topics that they have trouble following him. I can imagine in particular it is difficult for the international students to do so, given that the course is so particularly to American health policy and systems over the last century or so. Given this, I would move the lectures on Medicaid, Medicare and PPACA up in the schedule and then tackle some of the broader health policy topics later in the semester with that basis. The slides were not particularly helpful but the Policy Paradox by Stone is such a useful read that it might be good to somehow ensure students are indeed doing those readings. The paper assignment this semester was brilliant and very applicable to real world issues and future jobs for MPH's out of Yale. Finally, if the class could be twice a week that would be much less tiring- This is not a reflection on the prof or the material, its simply that any class that is 3 hours gets long."

He would stay on one slide for over an hour, which is not conducive to keeping students' attention for three hours straight. Slides also contained entire paragraphs of information and were unreadable. I was never quite sure what he was trying to teach us or what the take-aways were from day to day. Even objective slides for the beginning of the lecture and take-away slides for the end of the lecture would be extremely helpful. The class was also rarely interactive, when I feel that there could be a lot of benefit in discussion of health policy, apart from just being another tool to keep students' involved in the lecture and paying attention.",

I also really admire his stamina; I don't know of many people who could stand up in front of an auditorium and talk for about two hours straight without taking a breath. At the time, I felt that the sides used went well with the discussion, but in retrospect I think that the slides could have includeda little more information.",

I often felt bad because you can tell that people don't care, especially when nobody hardly answers his open-ended questions. I think that he does the best he can, but that isn't enough to generate interest in the class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Instructor has a lot to lecture about and does not read from slides. He was interesting to listen to.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano answered questions via email very promptly and was helpful. His lecture slides were good. However, he digressed a lot during lectures and I felt that his digressions during each lecture were all essentially the same and we weren't able to get through most of the slides every week due to the digressions. I did enjoy the assigned readings, however. Next time, I think it would be nice to have more interactions and discussions.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Good and flexible.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He is knowledgeable and interesting.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is a fantastic lecturer. Unclear how it is possible to speak without relying on a powerpoint for 3 hours, but he does it flawlessly.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Prof. Gusmano was a good lecturer, and he seemed to value responding to student feedback.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Nice guy, very engaging, good sense of humor. Lectures could sometimes feel like a process of attrition, and it was often difficult to stay focused all the way through. Insightful and helpful feedback on paper writing, mostly interesting and perspective-broadening reading assignments, but the lectures could have really benefited from a more formal structure\/agenda\/roadmap... Also a break in the middle would have been very nice!Otherwise, on the whole we really enjoyed the class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0very knowledgeable about subject matter, but sometimes assumed that we knew policy terms, which made some topics hard to understand",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Michael is obviously an expert in his field and knows what he's talking about. He's gifted with public speaking and can talk about health policy for hours without cues\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..but the class doesn't necessarily know about every little thing, plus he talks fast.As an intro class,at least the first half of the class should be a BASIC intro to health policy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6assuming the class knows NOTHING",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is a very entertaining lecturer. I found him engaging and appreciated his responses to all of my questions. Lecture would have benefitted from a more detailed powerpoint. He often talks in tangents and at times it was hard for me to follow. If there was a clear outline of the information on the slides, it would have been easier for me to keep track of where we were.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is very intelligent, an expert in his field. He was very engaging and interesting to listen to.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Did a good job getting through material but 3-hour lecture was hard for students to stay engaged at times",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very good.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is great but again a break or a shorter class would be preferable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Great professor and speaker!",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Michael is very knowledgable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Good guy- knows his stuff",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very nice and easy to talk to. But I don't think I learned a lot from his lectures. He was a bit hard to follow and I mostly sat in class confused. But maybe that's because I don't have a policy background?",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0M. Gusmano's lectures could be improved by having lectures slides that mirror what he is presenting\/speaking on. At times it was a little difficult to follow but overall his ability to speak on the course content was great. He took difficult topics and presented them in a manner that was comprehensive yet easy to understand.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I am not sure how Professor Gusmano can lecture for 3 hours but he manages to do so. He has slides but does not follow them because his slides are mostly graphs or images. For 3 hours, students have to rely on his lecture alone and we often lost track of what he was saying because he went on many tangents. I'm not sure how much I learned from sitting in his lectures. He also likes to joke about how much we are wasting our time earning an MPH at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Prof. Gusmano is obviously very well versed in the field of health policy and I appreciated his perspective on the issues we discussed. His lectures sometimes felt a little disorganized, but he hit all of the important points and I definitely came out of this class knowing more on this topic than I did before taking it.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0great lecturer, very knowledgeable and provides great insight on how policy changes work",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He took the time to make sure his students learned the material as opposed to just getting good grades.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He brought up interesting points, and was knowledgeable, however it could be more helpful if he better focused the lectures, so students could more easily follow.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0While Michael really knows his material and can speak about it at great length, I felt that his teaching methods were more like a guest lecturer. He did not really follow the slides, and also did not post the slides during some weeks. The slides naturally did not match what ever he spoke about, which I found quite difficult to follow. He needs to be a lot more focused on the basics of health policy as opposed to talking about concepts that people with more economics\/policy-focused background would know of.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is a great lecturer with such vast knowledge on health policy and systems. It was great to get to hear his thoughts and lectures on US policy. The 3 hour class was difficult to sit through as an entire bloc though. I would have preferred the class to have meet twice a week.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is a fountain of information, but I was simply not capable of following his lecture without more structure, especially in a three hour class. Not having any sort of policy background made it very difficult for me to follow his stream of consciousness style of lecture. While I appreciated that this may be a great way to think about policy concepts without putting unnecessary focus on details, I also found it hard to understand what the takeaway is and digest the days information without some sort of framework to the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor was very knowledgeable. You have to really know what you are talking about to be able to lecture for an entire 3 hours. I think that his power points have be filled with more useful information outside of the many pictures that he has embedded within them. It also would great if he had more office hour time other than the time that he has before and after lecture. Sometimes a student wants to meet with their professor outside of only being able to communicate through email.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very smart individual. I think the curriculum and assignments need to be developed further for this course to make it worthwhile.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano was a great professor and he tried to make the material interesting. However the structure of the class made it difficult to learn very much.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Good. However, it gets difficult to concentrate for 2.5 hours at a stretch.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Awesome Prof, knows so much about Health Policy. One of my fav classes at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Really nice, approachable guy who clearly knows his stuff.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano comes from a research background and comes with some real work experience that I really liked. The classwork was not really sufficient, but the lectures were always interesting.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He was incredibly knowledgeable but very tangential and lacked organization in his lectures but was always available for a phone call for office hours even though he was rarely in New Haven.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very kind and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0very knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Obviously knows his stuff. He discusses his material pretty much without pause for almost 3 stright hours. I doff my hat!",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very good. Excellent ability to bring diverse material into focus with coherent themes, emphasizing balances of diverse opinions in formulating policies and how this impacts on public health.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is a brilliant speaker. Sometimes, it gets repetitive.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very knowledgeable in his field of study. Wish he used more powerpoints or other visual assistance instead of just lecturing.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Approachable, made himself available. Knowledgeable and interesting.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very insightful and engaging, made the lecturers conversational. Three hours is just too long though, and it was hard paying attention after a while.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano was always fun to watch in class. He was very dynamic and engaging on content, even if the content itself wasn't my favorite area. He made course content and explanations clear, but his lectures tended to wander a bit. This didn't really detract from the content, however, and sometimes the digressions made important additions to my understanding.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I really enjoyed the instructor for this course. However, one thing that I think could of been improved was him sticking to the topic at hand. He had a tendency to go off topic very easily, and once he did it was very hard to follow what he was saying.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He really rambled a lot.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very good",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Passionate, enthusiastic",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is a dynamic lecturer that uses just the right blend of historical references and rhetorical questioning to engage students- even for a 3 hour class. He is the kind of person you want teaching this material."

This is unfair and leads to lack of accountability. I once received a grade that was a HP, but did not indicate that there was anything wrong with my paper that prevented it from getting a Honors. If the TA left their name, then I could have at least been able to ask what the reasoning was behind the grade. The TA's for this course are very behind the scenes. I think this is bad and leads to a huge lack of accountability."

    "I think it is very useful for students who want to have a full understanding of US healthcare system.",
    "Probably wouldn't recommend it, because only a few people would have what it takes to get the most out of this class. It's far too easy to skip class, not do the reading, not pay attention in class, etc., and if that happens, the class truly does feel like a waste of time. It's not a waste of time, though, if you make it worth your time.",
    "I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS.",
    "No need to go to class, just write apaper and do the take home. Wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course---but not in the form it was given",
    "Yes, public health policy is relevant to our degree.",
    "Unfortunately this is a required course.",
    "Would definitely recommend to another student, but would suggest making sure you go into it with some basic knowledge of policy to get the most out of the class.",
    "Great!",
    "i don't like policy and since it wasn't interactive it was really hard to get motivated to even go to class.",
    "This class is a professor's ramblings about policy topics that are interesting to him and a few other policy students. You write a paper and a take-home final exam -- neither of which you need lecture material for, so go at your own risk. I usually left the class frustrated.",
    "Yes. We learned a lot about the important issues of health care policy in the United States and abroad. We also gained experience in policy analysis and evaluation.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course.",
    "The amount that you take away from this class heavily depends on how much effort you put in. I thought the idea for the three stages of the paper was a great idea, and appreciated complete flexibility on choosing the topic.",
    "Lectures about health policy and a giant paper. Great course.",
    "i hate that this was a required course for me. i wasted my money.",
    "I would say that this course is really helpful as an introduction to health policy and health systems. I would say that it is structured as more of an educational experience in thoughtfulness rather than an actual concrete lecture of topics, though. I really really enjoyed the lecture, but at the end of the day, I would like some more concrete facts and figures about things laid out in a more organized fashion.",
    "this is a relatively easy class to satisfy the requirement of your devision. I'll recommend you to come and have fun every week. Besides, we are told that the grading is starting with HF.",
    "This class explores the overarching factors that influence health policy and politics in the U.S. It attempts to provide students with an intellectual framework through which to evaluate healthcare issues.",
    "There are a lot of readings but I don't feel that they are related to the topics and they are hard to understand for someone not from Health Policy. Would be better if include some basic concepts in health policy.",
    "It's a required course and you will either love it or not care for it. It's not too stressful because there is no required attendance or weekly homework. Class time is great for learning about policy or catching up on e-mail or other homework.",
    "Great into to health policy",
    "Other policy courses may be better as an introductory class.",
    "Need much preparation for full understanding of the course lecture.",
    "Health policy is not my field of interest, but I liked that this class allowed me to explore a policy that was relevant to my interests through writing the three-stage paper. I would recommend it, as I think it appeals to both those who are primarily interested in health policy and those who are looking for a more cursory overview.",
    "More like a random lecture you sat in on than a regular class, but still a good experience. Learned a lot, but lectures can feel interminable if you're having a busy day. Bring coffee, try not to work on other stuff, don't worry about taking a ton of notes, but pay attention. Engaging if you pay attention, you get out of it what you put in.",
    "had some thought-provoking discussions in this class, but wish that I had come out of this class with a better understanding of health policy than I did",
    "It needs work as an intro course - it doesn't really cover the basics, it just jumps in",
    "Great course to take to hear an expert talk about important topics.",
    "Required course overview of health policy in US and other countries. Overview of Medicare and Medicaid.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone like myself who really has no interest or background in policy.",
    "Yes. Lots of learning opportunity",
    "Health Policy and Health Systems is a great introduction into the US health care system and trains you in thinking through different frameworks from which health policy is made and critiqued. Iwould highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about the inner workings (and to an extent politics) of the health care system in the US. It is important to realize that this course primarily focuses on the US health care system though some comparative information is integrated. Nevertheless, the final paper is a great way to apply the theoretical knowledge of this course to analyzing the health policy of other (non-US) countries.",
    "Decent",
    "Take it if you know anything about policy. If you don't, probably will be very confused. Professor is very nice though. Although I felt (as did many other students), I got little feedback on my assignments and I wasn't exactly sure what he wanted.",
    "The course is a basic overview of the US health system. I would recommend the course if the student doesn't already have this basic understanding; otherwise, it might be better to take a more advanced course.",
    "This course needs to be drastically improved. The course should not be 3 hours long and Professor Gusmano needs to have slides that outline his lectures. He also needs to not just talk at us the entire time. I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Interesting course covering important topics in US health policy. The schedule makes it a bit of a difficult class to fully appreciate, but I would recommend it to students interested in the topic.",
    "if you attend lecture, you'll walk away with great insight you haven't bear before and understand why the healthcare system is the way it is.",
    "I would, the course material is relevant and the assignments could be valuable to most MPH students.",
    "The class was haphazard and disorganised. The context of American policy within American politics - albeit not new to me - would seem like a mystery to me at times especially when the lecturer name dropped many people. I took this class specifically because it was not aimed at American health policy, but towards the end I felt like a lot of it had to do with the American health care system although the instructor evidently did try to incorporate bits and pieces of international policy into the course. I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "Interesting course, but needs better organization. The final looked like it had almost nothing to do with what we were taught in class. During class, the instructor should do better job of identifying what is important and what is not important\/relevant. This course helps you analyze a policy, but felt like more of a debate paper. More instruction should be given, even if only one class, on how the instructor would go about analyzing policy. Despite this, I would still tell another student to take this course.",
    "I went to class, but it didn't seem necessary to do so.",
    "I thought this was an easy course that can potentially be very interesting; however it is a long chunk of a Thursday with no chance for discussion, making it very difficult to stay focused and learn the material.",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone who is fresh to US Health Policy. However, good course to take if you have that background.",
    "Good intro to American political system and health policy.",
    "No, i could recommend taking the other policy course for the requirment.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Excellent course to understand the basics of formulating healthcare policy based on prevailing and frequently conflicting incentives of politics, public interest, and individual self-interest. The course provides solid foundation to understanding the US healthcare system, in light of its history, conflicting forces, and current legislation. It provides and essential aspect of education in public health.",
    "Very interesting course of you can pay attention for three hours at a stretch.",
    "This course was a good way to fulfill the health policy requirement. Professor Gusmano made the content interesting and taught concepts in a way that made sense. The paper was a very good assignment, and I learned a lot from completing it. The long class time can be discouraging, but the course is good overall.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I really liked the instructor for this course. My only real problem with it was the length. It needed to be broken up into shorter lectures because the instructor's teaching style was not ideal for that long of a lecture.",
    "I would not recommend it.",
    "interesting professor, relevance of the class could be improved for those not in policy or management",
    "The course is required and not difficult, but a huge drag. Hoping YSPH intervenes to make the class more useful to the students.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student and recommend that they do all of the reading in order to ensure a full understanding of how our health care system today came to be and how it may change in the future."
