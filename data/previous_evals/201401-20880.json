    "Challenging material, but definitely worth it.",
    "This was a really fascinating course. I'm very glad I took it, and I would highly recommend it. Just be warned that the second half of the course is much faster than the first half.",
    "Information Theory is an amazing subject in its simplicity and power. It is incredibly important to the functioning of modern society and only will become more so. Professor Barron is a good teacher of the material. He is also an expert in the field, having made seminal contributions. If you have a chance to take this course with him, you should.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you're looking for a fascinating new way to look at the world. Information Theory is a lot more important than most people give it credit. My recommendation is to read the textbook well in advance."
