   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. I liked it much more than I expected. Reading Middle English is not nearly as hard as I thought it would be and I really enjoyed the change of pace.",
    "If you are an English major, you will take this class. I think English classes in general are some of the strongest at Yale. You will learn how to read, write, and think. This class is a chance to read what you would probably not read on your own, which is cool, but if you're looking for a random english class, there are probably others that would be a little more exciting. Even 126.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class - it's a great introduction to classic poetry and will get your feet wet for exploration on your own later in life. The amount of writing is more than manageable and the curriculum is well constructed. Take it if you can!",
    "If you have to take Major English Poets, Ross is a good teacher. The course feels very introductory at times, and especially if you're an upperclassman, it does not feel particularly rigorous or challenging. Ross often treats the text like a mystery that has a hidden \"truth\" if you look closely enough; in this way of reading, a \"rose\" in a poem directly represents love. BUT again, if you have to take the course, I'd recommend Ross. He's dedicated and always available to talk more. He obviously cares.",
    "Definitely recommend it! Such a fun course! Major English Poets didn't sound that enticing to me, UNTIL I stepped into the first day of class. The reading isn't always easy, but it's not that hard either. The class and the reading are both a lot of fun. This isn't one of the types of classes that you dread going to or doing the reading for. The work is really manageable. If you want to do well, you will need to put effort in, but it really is worth it, for what you get out of it.Of course, it depends on the instructor. But if you can take it with Ross (Professor Macdonald), definitely do! He's helpful and open and makes everyone feel comfortable talking in class and respects our ideas a lot.",
    "It is a great look into the poetry of four of the best poets one can study. I would recommend this class if you are looking to be an English major or REALLY enjoy reading poetry, otherwise though it is an enjoyable class, a non-english major might think it to be dreadful.",
    "Take 125 with Ross if you can! He's a really caring, sincere, and understanding professor. He makes the 125 texts very accessible and keeps the discussion focused with insightful questions and points. I'd also recommend Ross' seminar especially for underclassmen who are nervous about being in a seminar - he's very welcoming about all points that are made, and makes everyone feel comfortable about sharing their ideas, so it's a pretty laidback environment. Not to say that he's an easy instructor - he's actually a fairly strict grader, because he has high standards for written work, but that also means that you get really detailed, constructive feedback on everything you turn in.",
    "If you're contemplating about being an English major, it's good to take this course because it's a pre-requisite for the major itself.",
    "i mean don't take if you don't have to but you probably do if you're even shopping it. prof macdonald is a safe choice, he's RIDICULOUSLY NICE but a surprisingly hard grader and really obsessed with citation and nitpicky stuff like that. it felt a lot like a high school english class",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 125, especially with Ross because he made the daunting reading material seem approachable. I think it's important to study these poets who are the foundation of English literature and this class provides a really good opportunity to study them.",
    "Take it only if you're looking at the English major.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class if you want a better understanding of the poets offered. Of course, if you're an English major, it's a requirement but I would definitely recommend taking the class with Ross."
