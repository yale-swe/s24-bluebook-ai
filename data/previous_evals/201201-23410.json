    "Question 3 - - I found the assignments quite unhelpful. All of the assignments with the exception of the midterm were group work and on topics determined by the professor. While we could choose within those topics what to focus on, there was really no room to allow our own interests or areas of research in to the class. While I would not want every assignment to be of my own devising and independent, it was hard to sustain real interest and commitment when the assignments were not related to my own interests. I think at least one or two of the assignments should be much more open-ended, to involve applying the concepts learned in class to topics of our choosing. Also, all of the group work, though interesting, adds extra work to any assignment, and I felt that the coordination needed every time detracted from how much I could learn from and dive into each assignment.Question 7 - - I really thought I would've given Cashore a much better over all grade than this. When he's on and prepared, he's fantastic. For this class, however, he was absent, absent-minded, distracted, and did not seem to have a sort of long-range view for the class to carry us through. He was gone for presentations, guest speakers, our in class mock negotiations (two days), for a week in February, and for various other classes. The semester thus felt disjointed and without the expert guidance that he could have offered.",
    "This course could have been fantastic but there were two key problems: (1) the professor missed way too many classes and (2) the assignments felt very disjointed from the lecture material.",
    "I would suggest to try to improve coordination between the TA and the instructor, some times there was a feeling of them having not discussed the assignments, class logistics, grading or even work between both TA's.",
    "Question 1: Readings were well done.Question 2: Professor generally gave good lectures but was always asking for reminders on the time. If you are at this level of teaching, you should be able to plan a lecture such that you don't have to interrupt it multiple times to solicit the hour.Question 3: I've never encountered a collection of class assignments that better represented \"busy work.\" There was absolutely no learning value-add for me in completing these assignments. At a graduate level, we should not have to have our time filled with meaningless assignments of the sort tacked on to this class. THey also took a lot of time to do and do well. None of us had a sufficient background to come up with a panacea solution for the environmental problems randomly assigned (fisheries, extractive industries, etc.). I would have rather listened to the instructor discussing this than my classmates. Again, no learning value and shifting the burden of teaching onto others.It seems there was also a disconnect between many of the assignments having to do with Rio but then Rio was not really addressed in the class. Further, we received a list at the beginning of the term detailing all of the assignments. One assignment - a two day simulation - was never listed on this document. Shortly before the exercise, we receive a set of assignments related to it including needing to write a position paper, opening speech, etc. This came just before finals and it was inconvenient for many who were already working on assignments that had been made known in advance. Not considerate of our time and demonstrated the fact that the TAs and instructor were not communicating or invested in planning this class.Question 4: Yes, heavier because the assignments just took so long to complete.Question 7: My \"poor\" rating is based first and foremost on the fact that at least six classes were canceled over the course of the semester. For a week and a half class did not even meet because the professor was attending conferences. I understand that there are many research demands outside of the classroom, however, I am not paying full tuition for this kind of absent teaching style. At one point, I heard that Sebastien (the TA) justified this as being a midterm recess because the class was cross-listed. Every student in that class - save two undergrads - were in FES. That logic, therefore, makes no sense to me.After this lack of continuity, which really disrupted my ability to keep the class material fresh in my mind, he was then virtually absent in that half of the rest of the classes were student-led, and then the two days of simulation he did not even show up to. I understand that these were meant to be led by the TA's, but given his , I found this quite insulting.Further, the professor was totally disconnected from the management of the class in terms of assignment planning. He wasunwilling to really compromise when it was pointed out that one assignment came totally out of the blue during the week before finals. Clearly, the TAs were not communicating on planning their respective assignments, and this was a time when he should have stepped in and made sure that everything matched the syllabus, as it was related to students at the beginning of the term.",
    "The structure of the class is good but I think the readings are a bit too much. Class twice per week with 3-5 readings for every class is a lot.Although the assignments were all very interesting and fun they were also a bit too many - I am talking about the addition of the negotiation at the end.",
    "7. Cashore was great, very entertaining and illustrated complex points with helpful anicdotes. Each lecture covered a lot of ground, but there was not much discussion.1. The readings were rarely refrenced and not super helpful creating a disincentive to read them at all.3, 7.b. and 9 - The TAs were disinterested, did not seem to read our work, and treated the class like children; this was a problem because they were primarily the ones giving assignments, grading and structuring class activities.The class would be so much better if Cashore was more activly running class or had better TAs.",
    "Although the class was excellent, the professor was not present during whole weeks. These classes would then be made up by extra hours but many times would interfere with other classes.Assignments for this class and their rubrics should be clearly stated from the start."

    "The best thing about this course was the simulation of the Rio+20 special meeting. This exercise allowed us to have practice on the course material. Another highlight was the student policy proposal presentation. Furthermore the attendance to the Rio+20 conference will be a highlight for the class, because we worked long ways in other related events and the actual debates we had in class were about this conference.",

   "comments": [
    "As mentioned above, the assignments could really use some revision. In addition, the readings were often not referred to in lecture, making the connections harder for a first time policy student to make. This was introduced as an overview course, but a lot of prior knowledge was assumed.In particular, the mock negotiation was poorly run. It was frustrating for this to be the case, given the amount of work (and last minute, too) that we had to put in to prepare.",
    "It is important that there be more coordination between the assignments and the course theme. All of the assigments were focused on Rio+20 but it seemed like we hardly talked about it in class. It would have been helpful to have more formal instruction on the upcoming conference to prepare us for the assingments. Also there were too many assignments at the very end. I would like to see the assingments allow for more independent research and creativity. It would be great for example to be able to write a short research paper on a topic of your choice rather than have to analyze the zero draft. Also, there was generally a lack of clarity in terms of expectations for assignments. Finally, I would completely eliminate the group presentations from the course. As students listening to the presentations we did not get anything from it. It would be MUCH better for the professor to lecture than to have students present on topics they know nothing about. We did not have enough preparation to prepare policy solutions of any interest. If you are still going to incorporate presentations into the class they should be consolidated during one week so as to avoid taking the space of so many possible lectures.",
    "The coordination between readings, the classes V2 resources folder, the syllabus, the assignments and the actual deliverance of the instructor.",
    "The lecture slides could have been a little more clarified and clear-cut.",
    "Getting grades on time to the students.",
    "The class got disconnected in the middle of the semester with several cancelled classes. There were too many small assignments to keep track of, without emphasis of which ones were really important. The Rio+20 stuff was kind of thrown in there and distracted from the overall coherence of the class. Fewer assignments that are more targeted would have been better.",
    "The assignments need to be worthwhile and tied to the readings and lectures in a substantive way.The teaching focused heavily on markets-based solutions. Need a broader perspective.",
    "Balancing the number of readings per class. Balancing the number of assignments.",
    "The assignments need improvement.The policy memo was an ok assignment, but pretty disconnected from the class.The paper prompt was very dull. It felt like an early undergrad or highschool assignment.The exam format was fun, but a lot of other students stressed out and pre-wrote their answers since they were given the questions ahead of time; I guess this works.",
    "Presence of the professor and clear statements on how to right papers.",
    "Sometimes the course was disjointed so ensuring cohesiveness would add a lot to the course. More incorporation of the reading in to the class would also be beneficial. As well, thinking about the time constraints of the class might prove fruitful as we were often scrambling to fit all the material in during a given class."

I've never seen such a small class require two TAs, and certainly would not have expected it to take this long to grade a midterm. In my mind, this is totally unacceptable.",

Although a few of the office hours were cancelled Ben rescheduled them and even extended them.Sebastien and Angel were always available and very responsive. Thank you guys.",
