   "comments": [
    "Would definitely recommend, it is a great course about the EU",
    "An extremely in-depth look at the European Union. This is most assuredly a discussion seminar. Professor Cameron is extremely knowledgable and accessible.",
    "The course provided a very good background to understanding the politics of the European Union and many of the major issues that have shaped it historically and which continue to shape its development at present. Lectures are focused on discussion of the weeks readings and of current events pertaining to the EU. Weekly responses to the assigned reading provide a useful opportunity to engage with the material covered and to bring in knowledge from other courses and personal experience.",
    "If one is interested in the inner-workings of the EU and its wider implications, this class is can't-miss. It is a class based in information, not necessarily philosophical analysis. The focus was on building a picture of complex issues, with less emphasis on political theory."

   "comments": [
    "The course gave a comprehensive picture of the EU, its problems, political workings, monetary system, democratic deficit, and other issues. Topics covered in the course are very useful in the field of European studies. Course readings may be useful in my master's thesis; particularly Hix and Hoyland which I found to be an interesting read.",
    "I am focused on the EU ETS and this gave me an opportunity to get to know the subject.",
    "I plan on continuing to study the EU so it was helpful in that respect - I had a chance to look at some different issues to ones I'd studied before, and to look at others from different perspectives.",
    "The course provided me with the base I was hoping to develop so that I can think critically about the European Union going forward. It also familiarized me with some of the basic models and theories of political science, which was new information for me."
