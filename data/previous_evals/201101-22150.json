    "Architecture 345 is an excellent urban design course, providing a dynamic survey of the history of the discipline. It explored the development of various urban types and models over time and continues into modern urban design itopics like globalization and sustainability. I would highly recommend the course, especially if you're interested in intersections of design and the sciences. I took this course as a freshman, and it made me sure that I want to take the prerequisites for the architecture major next year. I think it's also a good course to take simultaneously with art and art history courses, and that they really have the capacity to enrich each other.",
    "Lecture with grad students--you are only in section with undergrads. Reading is interesting but not tested on, nor is the lecture--so just take it if you are interested in the topic.",
    "Yes. But it will also be similar to other urban studies courses you've taken",
    "Great class! It was very interesting. I really enjoyed the lectures. I got a background of urban and landscape design while at the same time being exposed to projects being constructed today and all the problem architects and urban planners face in the contemporary world. Alan Plattus is a great lecturer. The sections were also great. W had very interesting discussions on the readings and compared what was shown in the lectures to projects or cities we knew.",
    "This course is insanely easy.",
    "Overview of urban design from Roman cities to current projects. For undergrads, most material through lectures, which, an hour and a half long, can be kind of rough at 9.30 in the morning especially if you have other work due that day."
