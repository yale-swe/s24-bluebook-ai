    "Yes I'd recommend it. It's so interesting; it's really engaging, and it has some of the greatest discussions. The readings are especially captivating, and the incorporation of film often times made the class that much better.",
    "An awesome course that truly allows you to explore what history really means -- primary materials from a wide range of fields to truly grasp a specific, complex topic in evolution. The workload is significant, but not too much, especially if you have any interest in Japan or oceanic studies. Take this course if you can!",
    "A comprehensive overview of the environmental history of Japan.",
    "Yes, would recommend - pretty unique course offered at Yale - more creative than other history courses, have a good chance to look at historiography.",
    "I would recommend Japan and the Ocean to other students. As the course encompasses history, East Asian studies, environmental studies, and many other academic realms, it is readily accessible and interesting. If I were to describe the class, I would say it is an overview of Japan's relationship with the ocean and surrounding world on a variety of bases and in a variety of eras."
