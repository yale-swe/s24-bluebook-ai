    "Basic Category theory and homological algebra.",
    "I learned the basic language of how algebra is done today (so very much basic skills set, not much of a problem-solving class). That included the Theory of Modules and Rings, Category Theory (which is so beautiful and hard), as well as Homological Algebra (which is at the heart of Algebraic Topology!).",
    "Commutative algebra: basically the material covered in chapters 1-3 and 6-8 of Atiyah Macdonald (although we didnt really reference that book very much), plus some additional topics such as the tensor and symmetric algebras of a module Basics of category theory: categories and functors, natural transformations, adjoints, representable functors, and the Yoneda Lemma Brief introduction to homological algebra: chain complexes, free\/projective resolutions, (co)homology, and the Ext and Tor functors Categorical constructions are emphasized throughout, and as a result 380 is taught at a higher level of abstraction than your average commutative algebra class (and the presentation is certainly more abstract than Atiyah Macdonald, which avoids category theory like the plague). The conceptual leap over something like Math 350 or 370 can be a bit jarring at first, but youll come out with a much better grasp of how to think about algebra at a high level."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor, problem sets, and office hours are definite strengths of this course. Course material is very abstract, however not impossible once you take the time to talk with the professor and classmates about the material and ground yourself in examples. Like with most math classes, the motivation for the direction we took the class was not very clear. However I don't think there is much to be improved except finding ways to keep students engaged with the material every class and every week instead of every time the problem sets were due.",
    "Smaller class allowed for direct contact with the instructor, which is invaluable, especially if you will be looking for recommendations for Grad School or just want to know what the life of a Maths professor looks like. I also felt like the biweekly problem sets were very good in teaching the concepts in class. The Professor also left some of the lectures' lemmas as exercise. DO THEM. They make your life so much easier and assures you know what's going on.",
    "Strengths: The psets were generally fair and the problems were interesting. Grading was extremely lenient, although that may change in the future if\/when the grader changes. I think Losev did an excellent job in selecting the topics to cover: the content covered in class forms the technical foundation of numerous branches of math: fields like algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, and algebraic topology all make heavy use material covered in 380. Weaknesses: I personally found Losevs lectures dry and uninspiring. Theorems and definitions were often presented with minimal motivation, and he rarely supplied intuition for the often head-spinningly abstract proofs. Sitting in class, I sometimes wondered whether my time would be better spent just reading the textbook and going to office hours as needed. This isnt to say that Losev doesnt care about teaching; he clearly cares about his students and takes teaching seriously. Lectures flowed logically and he rarely stumbled during a proof; it was clear that he spent considerable time preparing beforehand. To be fair, to some degree this is just the nature of an introductory modern algebra class: without reference to other fields like algebraic geometry or algebraic number theory which historically motivated the development of commutative algebra, its possible that some concepts just cannot be properly contextualized. Nevertheless, there were definitely times when an explanation I found online or in a book made a concept click for me in a way that Losevs lectures didnt. Emilys Riehls category theory book in particular has lots of great examples and explanations, and Ive also heard good things about the first chapter of Ravi Vakils algebraic geometry book, which is basically a crash course on category theory. As usual, Math Stack Exchange is your friend."

   "comments": [
    "If you have taken Abstract and Galois and enjoyed both of them and have some time to do something new and think about a problem for an hour and get nowhere then yes! After the class I realized I really enjoyed these types of problems - they mirrored solving puzzles and really enjoyed doing them and learning about new tools that you have. It is a graduate level course that moves like one, so beware of this.",
    "I would recommend it if and only if the student plans to learn more math that requires knowledge of commutative algebra. It is essential to know for certain topics like algebraic geometry, but it can feel a bit dry on its own.",
    "Absolutely, for those who want to take it as their main class of the semester. It's very demanding, but it's also so rewarding and beautiful. Once you understand the concept of natural transformation in category theory and its examples, or the meaning of the Ext functor with regards to measuring the \"exactness\" of a chain sequence, YOUR MIND WILL BE BLOWN. But again, be ready to spend like 20 hours a week on this, including lectures and office hours. It's also quite abstract, to be honest, so I'm not sure it's the right class for Applied Math people.",
    "Yes, particularly if taught by Prof. Loseu.",
    "Yes...for the right type of student. 380 is an investment. The material is dry and youll have to work hard to figure out whats going on, but youll come out well-equipped to tackle future coursework in algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, representation theory, and other fields which are eminently more exciting than commutative algebra. If you dont intend to pursue higher math beyond 380, then dont take the classthe math department offers plenty of classes that are more interesting content-wise. But if you plan to take any higher-level courses in algebra, 380 is a must-take. Side note: if youre thinking of taking 380, consider taking 544 concurrently (contrary to popular belief, 380 is NOT a prereq for 544). Its a lot of math for one semester and you may have to contort the rest of your schedule to accommodate two high-workload math classes (especially if Apisa is teaching 544), but youll thank yourself once you start the homological algebra unit. Historically, the motivation for developing homological algebra (at least, the homological algebra covered in 380) came almost exclusively from algebraic topology. So while 544 strictly speaking isnt a prerequisite for 380 (youll still be able to follow the proofs and do the psets), some exposure to algebraic topology goes a long way in motivating constructions in homological algebra that would otherwise seem absolute bizarre."
