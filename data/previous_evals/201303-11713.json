   "comments": [
    "Economics 110 is a pretty introductory economics class, so the material can be a bit drab. If you're looking for the grade, take the lecture course where the curve is much easier. If you're looking for a great in-class experience where you will probably learn a lot more, take the seminar if you can.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it was for a requirement",
    "Talking to all my friends in the lecture, I am very happy that I got placed into the seminar. I learned a ton and now feel like I have a comparative advantage over the lecture students.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 110 to another student. I'd advise the student to follow up closely with what is done in class by reading the textbook BEFORE lectures, as this will make the class very manageable and engaging.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. A seminar allows you to grasp with the material, but make sure you are willing to work, and more specifically, read.",
    "If you're confident in the subject of economics, go for it. The small class size gives the professor the opportunity to learn your name, but the pace of the course is also very fast.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend it. It's a great intro to Econ.",
    "Take this class whether or not you are an econ major, it really will change your perspective on how the world works. It has a decent workload, nothing to worry about. My biggest piece of advice is to read the chapter before lectures. It will get you so much more out of the course.",
    "I would highly recommend the seminar over the lecture. Although the curve is tougher in the seminar, being in a small classroom makes the material much easier to learn. That being said, make sure you're actually interested in economics before taking this course. It is tough, but if you work on the problem sets, do the readings, and attend class it is manageable. But never get comfortable in the class as the curve often serves to hurt you.",
    "Econ 110 is a great, practical class to take. I would recommend it to anyone who has the slightest interest in learning about economics. The information is relevant and helpful, and Tolga is an awesome professor who knows about everything and will teach you more than just the econ curriculum.",
    "Standard Microeconomics course. Tolga goes a little fast and is bit difficult to understand at times, but his extra tips\/stories about life make it worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Introductory micro lecture in a seminar setting, exactly what it sounds like. I would certainly recommend."
