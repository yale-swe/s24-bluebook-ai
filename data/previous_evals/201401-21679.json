    "Great econ course, just don't go in expecting an easy A",
    "Tests are impossibly difficult. Schott is very cool. As always though, I find that the vast majority of what we learn cannot be applied to the real world. Econ always sucks, why do people study it? Oh yes, to obtain fancy consulting and finance jobs.",
    "I 100 percent recommend this class, I loved it, it was so interesting and cool and different from other ECON classes I've taken and Schott rocks. Worth the 9am wakeup for sure.",
    "You should take it if you want to know more about international trade. It will give you an insight on how trade works and why it is beneficial for the world.",
    "Yes. One of the best ECON electives out there. Definitely not easy, but Prof. Schott was awesome.",
    "Not really",
    "Excellent introduction to one of the more interesting areas within economics. The professor makes the material very approachable by providing just the right of math for an intro course: enough to make the material tangible but not so much that it makes it irrelevant for most of us. The consistent incorporation of real-world applications is great; this as close to a b-school class as you're gonna get as a freshman or sophomore. Caution: the posted solutions to problem sets and midterms are often lazily limited to \"this is obvious; look at the PPF.\" The staff needs to realize that students actually learn and review from these materials, and that they should be as thorough and clear as possible. Pay attention to lecture because these will be of no help.",
    "The midterm was disproportionately hard, and you will lose a bunch of random points on your psets but the material is very interesting.",
    "Take it if interested!",
    "Yes, it'll be an interesting class with lots of real-world applications, but be warned that the exams are challenging and that this is actually not one of the easier econ classes (contrary to popular belief).",
    "This class is great. Peter is an awesome lecturer! He's really cool and attractive too. Lectures were interesting and well explained. Definitely go to lecture. However, this class is harder than it seems. The problems sets and exams were really tricky. Plus, if you worked with a partner, you had to turn in one problem set! So you had to agree upon answers and then get the same grade, which was a total pain. I think the course has a really strong curve though so it all works out in the end.",
    "A YES, take it! As an Econ major, this has been one of my favorite Econ classes at Yale. I've learned a lot from this class and it is not too much work (there are psets only every two weeks or so). International Econ is not an easy class, but if you don't like math too much and like models and graphs it's perfect for you. Also, Professor Schott also connects the material in the class to real-world examples, which makes the class even more interesting and enjoyable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wasn't sure about taking it but wanted to try it!",
    "A highly graphical, intuition-based introduction to international trade. The vast number of agents involved in international trade means that mathematical modeling is difficult, meaning that, at the introductory level, you need to think graphically and verbally. Prof. Schott has high expectations, so be prepared to put in a good amount of time for a good grade.",
    "Your basic \"trade\" class. An essential course for anyone interested in commerce, welfare, and international relations. I would recommend this to every economics major at Yale, but be prepared to work hard. The exams can be difficult to navigate.",
    "This is a really great class. I've never had a class where the material was so thoroughly taught. Peter Schott makes great lecture slides that are incredibly detailed and really takes his time in explaining concepts. The result is that you learn a ton. The class also doesn't really stress the quantitative stuff too much, which is nice \u2013 you're mostly expected to understand concepts, with the material relying heavily on understanding graphs and how they change under different circumstances. There are eight problem sets with one drop...none of them are a piece of cake, but they're not overly difficult. The midterm was absolutely brutal, mostly because of the time constraint. I only got through about 75% of the test, which consists of very difficult true\/false\/uncertain questions. The final was more reasonable and the class has a generous curve. Overall, a very rewarding class with a great professor \u2013\u00a0not easy, but maybe the most rewarding and interesting Econ credit available.",
    "Majors should take this class. Applies to any area of econ, incorporates interesting elements from other fields.",
    "Probably the best econ class I've taken at Yale.",
    "It is a really interesting econ course, especially compared to something like intermediate micro, but it's also by far the toughest economics class I've taken at Yale. You really have to know your stuff to get a good grade in this class, and the problem sets can often be time-consuming and tough to get good grades on even if you work together with friends. I would recommend the class as an interesting education on international trade policies but I probably wouldn't take it during a 5-class semester cause it will be much more enjoyable\/manageable if you can devote a good portion of time and focus to it.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Great class! Not too hard, not too easy. The material isn't too complicated (and barely any math!). There are also only 7 psets, so you get nice breaks in between each one, and each pset isn't that long (one night is enough). Some people here will complain about how hard the tests are; yes, this is true, but they're uniformly hard for everyone, so the curve is wonderful. (80\/120 was an A on the midterm) Few people studied hard for the final.",
    "Excellent course! You learn all the trade models you need to know. You apply the theory to real world issues. Workload: a midterm and a final (intensely application based), and 8 problem sets. Professor Schott is excellent. The grading is a bit subjective, so be careful.",
    "Yes. The class is very interesting and combined trade models closely with real life. After taking this course, you can read articles about trade and globalization more critically and use economics to evaluate the validity of different arguments.",
    "Very nice and always prepared",
    "ECON 184 is a great class. The problem sets are not too hard and the office hours are extremely useful. The tests are challenging, so make sure you understand the concepts.",
    "Absolutely! It's SUCH a thorough overview of the theory of one of the most important aspects of globalization. It incorporates models, empirical examples, and real world applications, and the course is always really interesting, even if it is a bit slow sometimes.",
    "It's a very all-encompassing take on international trade, with lots of real world applications. Professor Schott is the best professor in the department; you should absolutely take this class, the exams are difficult but everything is very fair and clear.",
    "One of those classes that really changes the way you view the world--critical for anyone who wants to work in policy, international or domestic. Challenging, but okay if you go to class and keep up with the material.",
    "TAKE IT! Regardless of your major, the class will give you a sound basis in trade economics - we go through a variety of different models used to explain different facets of trade and gains from trade. The class is pretty qualitative with the aim being to be able to utilise the model to answer real world questions\/read closer into the types of articles in the Wall Street Journal. Definitely feel like I can read an article in there now and be able to interpret it using the models to glean insight into firm\/country motivations etc. Class is not easy by any means, but not ridiculously hard either - it is a very fair workload (7 psets, one of which can be dropped), a midterm and a final - my only criticism is that the midterm and final were both too long which sometimes meant that I felt as though I was being tested on how fast I can write rather than my understanding of the material. Other than that, great class!!",
    "Good overview of trade models. By far the best Econ lecture I've taken at Yale",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn international economics. Yes, it is based in models, but Professor Schott does a great job of connecting them to the real world and showing their merit. The world load is reasonable. I would say take it if you're interested in economics.",
    "International Trade is seriously an awesome class. It's not easy at all, but I've never learnt more from any econ class at Yale; Prof. Schott is also one of the most systematic, methodical and effective professors I've ever had.",
    "Take it. It's difficult and it's challenging, but so worth it at the end. The assessments are super super annoying, I hate the true\/false\/uncertain format and how we really don't know what the graders are looking for, but I still feel like I learnt a lot in this class. Peter Schott is one of the leaders in the field of Economics and it is an absolute honor and privilege to be able to learn from someone as amazing as him.",
    "Although the tests could be challenging and long, the topic was really interesting. Professor Schott's powerpoints were amazing and better than any textbook.",
    "Extremely interesting class. Professor Schott is an engaging lecturer, and the workload is generally reasonable. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this to all Econ majors and poli-sci majors as well because the policy implications of trade were presented well. Very interesting material and I learned a lot about the economic relationship between US and China.",
    "Not too hard, albeit you might need to input a reasonable amount of time to actually learn sth. A good course: those you are interested in trading, (or any issues that stem from trades among international entities), it's a must-take",
    "Yes."
