    "I think the speakers could have been more diversified. I think it would have been helpful to hear from people who weren't just conducting research, but were also in public health practice, such as people from public health departments.",
    "This is just the EMD seminar, so there's not a lot to say. I thought some speakers were really interesting and some were very repetitive with others. I would've loved some more variety in the food options!",
    "As far as seminar courses go, this course was pretty informative and interesting. It would be nice to have a greater variety in the type of presentation given, rather than having so many people presenting their research results after studying disease vectors.",
    "Too many lectures on flies and mosquitos... Would have liked more on vaccines or human-human transmitted diseases",
    "This semester, there was an extreme number of seminars about vectors. More variety would have been nice.",
    "Too many mosquito related topics. Also room was way too small.",
    "Great seminar with lots of interesting speakers. I personally appreciate that they are every week so we are exposed to much more areas of research. One suggestion would be to bring in people who are doing public health practice since not all students are interested in becoming PhDs or MDs Also please no more Abate pizza.",
    "Maybe not always pizza... I don't like the food in this series of seminars.",
    "Would be beneficial if students had more opportunity to engage with the speakers",
    "I think this class offers a great opportunity for students to see what being an epidemiologist in academia is like, I'd like to see more talks about those who work outside of academia.",
    "I liked the seminars but I would have liked it if the seminars varied more. Majority of them were about vector borne diseases which is interesting but not necessarily topics that I am particularly passionate about. I wish that there were more seminars on infectious diseases and chronic diseases or infectious diseases and nutrition or infectious diseases and climate change. I thought a lot of them were biology dense which was nice but I would have liked the seminars more if they connected to social and environmental issues more. I also would have liked them more if every week was not mandatory. There were other seminars in CDE and SBS that I would have liked to attend but could not because of the EMD seminar. I also would have liked the seminars if it could include professors from other departments and have EMD and another discipline interlink between the two (for example, EHS and EMD or SBS and EMD).",
    "There are too many vector-centered seminars.",
    "I think the EMD seminars need to be broader in scope. all lectures seem to be to molecular or too parasitology-like."

    "This course is mandatory for EMD first year students so regardless you have to take it.",
    "Great way to spend a Thursday afternoon.",
    "I would recommend students not taking the course if they don't need to, and instead going only to the sessions that interest them."
