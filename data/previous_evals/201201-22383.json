    "Laid-back class that improves your dictation and sight-singing skills in an informal setting. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in improving their dictation and sight-singing skills or general musicianship skills. People who have a lot of background in music theory or musicianship training may find this class boring and easy.",
    "fairly natural continuation of 218 - if you're not really confident of the skills you were supposed to acquire in 218, I'd recommend taking it Cr\/D if you don't want it to stress you out, but generally fun and a cool skill to develop",
    "Take it! It improves your dictation and keyboard skills and allows you to listen to an hour of great music twice a week.",
    "Great. Damian is the best.",
    "If you're a music major, you'll definitely take Music 219. If you're not, but you're otherwise musical, it might be a good idea to take this course anyway. You'll develop the \"hearing eye\" and \"seeing ear\" that makes good musicians infinitely better, and you'll listen to some excellent pieces besides.",
    "This course is a fun way to get 1\/2 a credit -- it improves your dictation skills and also focuses on sight-singing and other listening activities. For me, the best result was the improvement in my figured bass and open-score reading skills, but that depends on the amount of time you put into it. Overall a fun course."
