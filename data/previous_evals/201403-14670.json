   "comments": [
    "I heartily recommend the class. Its biggest strength is its organization of themes, thinkers, and works. It covers a lot of material, but it's all quite manageable. Professor Nakhimovsky is brilliant and really makes intellectual history an attractive field. In addition to the readings, the papers and exam are all quite reasonable and manageable as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend HIST 241 to another student, so long as they are willing and prepared to do the readings. If you do, you will surely get a lot out of the class.",
    "A fascinating overview of some of the most important and interesting political philosophy of the past centuries. Taught by a great professor and really a must take for those interested in political thought without previous study.",
    "Its a good course where you read lots of important texts pertaining to political thought in Europe. I think its a good introduction to lots of critical areas in philosophy and political thought."
