    "Class got off to a rocky start but Ken was excellent and made up for shortcomings of the class. HWs were applied and practical and clearly explained.",
    "This course was fantastic for those who had extensive background in genetics and desire to learn about the tools used in the analysis of genes. It is not practical for those that do not intend to use or interact with the tools used in the field of genetics. The course was interesting and informative. The availability of the teaching fellow was essential for the cultivation of an depth understanding of discussed course material beyond the presented information."

The time and effort he spent enriching the information provided in lectures during the TA sections was very much appreciated."

    "If my fellow student wants to learn about a variety of statistical tests used in the analysis of data produced by those in genetics then I would recommend this course. If my fellow student is not then I would not recommend it."
