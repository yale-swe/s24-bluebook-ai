   "comments": [
    "I at least understand the language of our healthcare system.",
    "This class is straightforward. You learn about the major programs and legislation that make up the broken US healthcare system. I mainly took this course so I could get a good survey on the healthcare system, and this class did a great job at covering what I wanted to learn.",
    "I learned a decent amount about the U.S. healthcare system.",
    "This class gave me much better grounding in health economics, and I've come away with a much better understanding of the history of US health care and the economic underpinnings with its complexities.",
    "Good question. I feel like the professor just barfed 1,000 facts throughout this semester and expected us to turn his vomit into something meaningful\/insightful. Okay, that's an exaggeration. I did come away from this class more critical of the United States health care industry. I learned that the system is broken, allowing doctors to charge whatever they want, recommend unnecessary patient visits, etc. But that's it. Forman taught me to distrust the system, and did not articulate or explain very well how the system operates.",
    "An in depth look at health economics and public policy in America. I think everybody should take a course like this: it's amazing how little people (including me) now about Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance in general when we are all consumers of healthcare. Fantastic course, and I personally loved Howard Forman's lecture style. He has a dry sense of humor that I appreciate, and isn't afraid to get political and call out bad policy on either side of the political spectrum. I also appreciate his bluntness, which i'm sure throws some people off but I personally love.",
    "An understanding of the US healthcare system, and the economics behind it.",
    "I learned a LOT that I did not know about the US healthcare system--and realized how little I knew before even though I thought myself relatively well-informed in this respect. If you're interested in working in healthcare or just being a functional adult, or learning how privileged you are to not have to deal with a lot of the issues in the US healthcare system, this is a good class for you to take.",
    "This class really allows you to learn so much about the health care system, the economics of it, and the policy decisions that are going to change it. You learn all about Obamacare, drug pricing, Medicare, why health care reform is so hard and why the market is unique.",
    "I learned a LOT about the healthcare system. It included not just the structure of the system, but a lot about how treatment is delivered in the United States through multiple different vehicles.",
    "I learned so much about the US healthcare system, how health insurance works, the pharmaceutical industry, and the Affordable Care Act. I now feel like I have the ability to think critically about healthcare legislation and its potential impacts on the economy.",
    "I did not develop any insights.",
    "I learned a TON that I would never have known about the way that we legislate in the healthcare system. I also thought critically about the problems facing our healthcare system and the many pricing inefficiencies that exist at basically every level.",
    "I learned about the economics of health markets. It was interesting!",
    "Deep understanding of the US healthcare system and its flaws and current direction.",
    "I'd say i started the semester knowing absolutely nothing about HealthCare in the US and now i can sit at a dinner party and pretend thats the only I've ever really been interested about. Unreal class. More people should take it",
    "Learned a lot about the U.S. healthcare system - the structure, economics, politics, etc. involve in it.",
    "I gained an enormous amount of insight into the healthcare system, which is enormously helpful as a pre-med. I had not taken microeconomics before, but I was easily able to learn the few econ terms as I went, which was very helpful. I also learned to critically evaluate government interventions and market failures.",
    "Was an enlightening introduction into the basics of healthcare in America, and an essential primer that allowed us to do further research into the field",
    "Loved the course and learned a ton - tough, but I'm glad I took it.",
    "I learned a lot about how the US healthcare system works. How money flows between the government, people and different healthcare facilities and also how the government has attempted to reform healthcare so that financial incentives for hospitals and doctors line up with High quality health care and keeping costs low\/eliminating waste. We discussed Medicare, Medicaid, diff models of health insurance plans and much more.",
    "I think this class was a great introduction to how the healthcare industry works. It's one of the biggest industries in the US and I knew almost nothing about it before this class. I now feel like I can have intelligent discussions about health policy.",
    "I've learned so much about the healthcare industry, especially how unique our healthcare system is.",
    "I learned a good general sketch of the US healthcare system and its public policy regulations as it stands today, plus a little about the history that got it that way.",
    "Amazing class where you learn a significant amount about federal healthcare (Medicare\/Medicaid)and how private businesses operate. This class mainly offers qualitative descriptions of health economics in the US, so there's very little math work. You really do learn a lot, and I could understand the terminology in most academic papers while doing my research paper. You immediately see the benefit of what you're learning which is the most satisfying part of the class.",
    "Learned significantly more about the ACA and the US healthcare system",
    "Great overview of the health care industry. Useful for econ and premed students.",
    "Overall great survey course to learn about Medicare, Medicaid, the drug industry, and doctor\/hospital practices.",
    "Learned a solid amount.",
    "Healthcare policy and economics, lots of legislation relating to healthcare.",
    "I've learned a lot about how our health system works. I now better understand healthcare policy and its impact. I can have a discussion about things like medicare and the ACA. I could not before this course. The healthcare system is complicated and there's still a lot for me to learn, but I've gained a great foundation in this class.",
    "I was able to develop an understanding of the healthcare system in the united states and around the world. however, it was a very narrow point of view given that the professor and TA's expected all understanding to be based solely off their opinion.",
    "This class gave me a basic understanding of healthcare economics.",
    "Understanding the history and current issues of the US' health care system and related policies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think if the class was in a smaller auditorium it would be easier to stay engaged.",
    "Strengths - very interesting topic, the final paper allows us to explore any area of the US healthcare system Weaknesses - lectures were often mundane (the topics were interesting and Howie's a funny guy, but I found myself either watching the clock or skipping the class)",
    "Lots of numbers are thrown at you; some of which really aren't relevant and only serve to be very confusing. Forman is a fantastic, engaging lecturer and I really enjoyed his teaching style and the way he sought to do more than read off of slides.",
    "Strengths: Forman is pretty biased and opinionated, but he did bring in a lot of guest lecturers to balance his perspective, which was really nice. Weaknesses: Forman treats the class like a 75 minute episode of Beat the Clock. He races through lecture slides, which already are abstruse because he doesn't explain what half of the acronyms are, trying to fit in as many as he possibly can at the expense of our conceptual understanding of the systems he discusses. On a broader level, this course was advertised as an economics course (it's ECON 170), which seems a little disingenuous. This really is mostly a policy course, with some economic principles sprinkled in here and there. Finally, the grading is very nit-picky. In most of my classes at Yale, I have been instructed to absorb, analyze, and innovate new contexts\/interpretations for big themes. This is not one of those classes. You are expected to remember minute details from his lectures. You are not tested on key takeaways, but puny details mentioned in passing during his lectures. How to Improve: Forman shouldn't race through his slides. He shouldn't assume every student has a strong foundation of health policy in the United States. He should define common terms early on in the course, and build on these as he incorporates new themes and ideas. Maybe it shouldn't be listed as an ECON course?",
    "Decent course. I think Forman gets too trapped in the details though. Would love to hear more about policy that could help the overall healthcare system instead of what level above the poverty line you can be to still qualify for various Medicare benefits.",
    "Honestly, it's a pretty strong course. Covers all the basics, goes pretty in depth when appropriate, and has HW that is appropriate and adds to what we've already learned in class.",
    "Great course. Loved it. Professor Forman is an incredible lecturer, the guest speakers were really interesting and always highlighted a different side to what had been presented in lecture, which was fun. I wish there were more practice problems of any form available before the midterm and the final, there wasn't really enough guidance in that regard.",
    "I think the course should have sections to be honest. The lectures are just very traditional style -- lots of facts being thrown at you, and Prof Forman moves very quickly. Some other, more interest ways of engaging with the material would greatly improve the course.",
    "This class has a ton of really great material, that is delivered in a compelling way by Professor Forman. I thought the guest lectures were super cool because they were super important people in healthcare and it was interesting to hear all of their perspectives. I think that students would be more engaged with this course if there was more homework or two midterms instead of one. It can go to the back burner sometimes but its really great info and a rewarding class.",
    "Great class really engaging and enjoyable to attend lecture. Forman is a rockstar.",
    "This class was fascinating, well-organized, and a pleasure to attend. I liked how the expectations and deadlines for every assignment were clearly laid out on the very first day of class and we had all semester to prepare our final paper. I also appreciated the final paper topic check-in, which got us thinking about our papers by the middle of the semester.",
    "Important content to know, and Forman explains it well. I only wish there was a bit more emphasis on general themes, thought the nature of the material lends itself towards heavy memorization. I wish there had been a more clear grading system\/expectations in grading. I ended up getting a grade in the class I thought I deserved, but each assignment was really a toss-up (the homework grading seemed overly harsh and inexplicable, the exams were average, and the paper was super forgivingly graded. There could also be a lot more guidance on the paper; I felt like I was going in blind, and was definitely not qualified to write about my topic.",
    "Lectures were boring.",
    "The main strength of the course is also its greatest weakness -- there's just SO much content. It's great because you get a really exhaustive look at the subject, but it can be really intimidating. I wish that the course was just a little bit smaller in scope. But overall I do think that it's really useful.",
    "Strengths--you learn a LOT. Weaknesses--you find yourself hard to be engaged by the semi-dry but nonetheless informative Lecture slides.",
    "Lectures are fascinating but often move too quickly to follow while taking notes. This would not be a problem except the lecture slides are not an adequate replacement for notes taken in class. One major area for improvement would be to spend more time devoted to comparative healthcare systems as a means to inform solutions to the failures of the American system. We only peripherally considered single payer models or other systems of similarly wealthy countries during the course. This contextualization would be very helpful to understand the potential futures for America.",
    "Interesting material, expert professor. there is an amazing opportunity to learn real world stuff",
    "Lectures feel really long and Professor Forman gets off topic a lot but he is clearly one of the leaders in the healthcare economic field and knows the answer to virtually any question you could ask him. Although lectures were boring, the class overall teaches really cool and interesting stuff.",
    "The strength of this course was that it gave a very thorough view of the U.S. healthcare system. The professor, Howard Forman, knew a lot about what he was talking about. Could be improved by having a midterm with a shorter length or having more time to complete it -- very long test.",
    "This class is strong in the amount of material you will learn, however, it's weakness is that lectures tend to feel kind of disjointed and meandering and you come away unsure of exactly what you were supposed to learn. A lot of information was there, its just hard to be sure what was important.",
    "I was really interested in the material, which was fascinating. Howie is a great mentor, a decent lecturer, and really makes sure that everyone understands each slide before he moves on. Make sure to ask questions in lecture. The guest lecturers are at the top of their fields, which is awesome. Howie grounds everything he says in his own experience as both a doctor and a patient. I think the course could be improved with a bit more engagement; perhaps weekly quizzes instead of a midterm, or small, for-credit homeworks, or even maybe 50 min lectures with a mandatory section. As is, three spread-out homeworks, a rigorous midterm, and a paper with almost no guidance at all made for a varied and inconsistently busy semester (the midterm should be studied for in detail).",
    "The course was very well-organized and the guest lecturers were all fascinating.",
    "You learn a ton but sometimes it might be hard to catch up.",
    "The strength of the course is the subject material and the final paper, which I felt was extremely useful as the first real econ paper I've had to write in nine econ classes. The way the class was taught needs serious improvement though, as the lectures were incredibly dull and the focus was more on unnecessary details than general themes, and allowed little if any room for critical thinking. Additionally, the grading was done poorly, focusing on obscure details instead of comprehension.",
    "Strengths: Knowledge of the professor, organization of course, interesting material Weaknesses: Test and lecture material didn't match up as closely as I thoughttests were more like an econ class, lectures more like polisci.",
    "The topics in the class are conveyed well in power point slides, and are repeated frequently enough to refresh your memory. Prof. Forman explains very well and it's very apparent he knows what he's talking about. Some concepts are unintuitive and require you to ask questions to fully understand, but Prof. F strongly encourages this and makes it fun. It can be somewhat difficult to know what information is going to be tested, but nothing is too obscure to cause anxiety. Overall, the class is structured very well.",
    "Strengths: interesting guest lectures from insurance, pharma, industry, etc. Weaknesses: low volume of professor Forman's voice",
    "Class teaches a lot about health economics... but the material is fairly bland and the hour 15 minute lectures are oftentimes painful to sit through. Would be far better as a fifty minute class. Homework was minimal.",
    "I was frustrated a lot with this class in general, but the student TA was super helpful. 1. I felt the class was really disorganized. Maybe it had something to do with the fact there was no textbook? Forman taught at a fast pace each lecture and I know a lot of kids were lost during each lecture because he used foreign terminology or just explained some concepts badly (and he doesn't realize when he explained something well and didn't, but he should because kids in the lecture are too confused or reluctant to ask Forman to explain the concept again). The slides aren't entirely self explanatory, and I feel like Forman could write some clarifying notes at the bottom of the ppt slides with important information (in the notes section of each slide). 2. I found the TAs to be terrible teachers, unenthusiastic when helping students, and overall incompetent. The TAs never went out of their way to ensure students were falling behind. Sure they held review sessions once every two weeks, but they weren't really helpful, because I went to a few and kids just asked their own questions, but what would've been more helpful is just a review of some lectures. The majority of students would prefer this because 1) you learn something better when learning about it a second time and 2) more often than not students don't even know what they don't know, which doesn't make the type of sessions the TAs were running very useful; the TAs should've realized this, and I feel like they were kind of lazy and just wanted to sit around and answer any questions that arose instead of taking the initiative to ensure students didn't misunderstand any concepts; also I was surprised there weren't weekly review sections like normal lecture classes 3. A LOT of kids in class are frats\/sports kids who have TONS of resources from past years. They had past tests and study guides and HWs to look at theought the semester. I didn't really have anything and felt that there was no support system in place. It was frustrating. I talked to one friend who took it last year and he said the TAs were great and really helpful in explaining things.",
    "This class was organized very well. Professor Forman was a great lecturer and presented the information in a very accessible way. I don't have any recommendations for how it could be improved. It's a great class!",
    "The professors and TAs need to be more clear about their grading format. On exams, the grading was very subjective.",
    "The material in this class is interesting, but it's not organized in an intuitive manner. The topics we covered (medicare, medicaid, physician reimbursement, healthcare basics) didn't always flow well. It often seemed like lectures had no relation to each-other, which made studying and reviewing material difficult at times. A strength was definitely how relevant the material is at this time. We learned a lot about healthcare reforms, and specifically Obamacare, and I'm definitely glad I know more about the specific reforms in the AAC now.",
    "THIS WAS AN AMAZING CLASS WHERE I LEARNED SO MUCH",
    "The course is highly focused on contemporary policies and issues and covers almost all aspects of our health care system. This is exactly what I was looking for when enrolling in the class. However, the pace of the class is a bit too fast and I hope we could have more case studies instead of quickly going through all the concepts."

   "comments": [
    "Eh, no. If you want to learn about the US healthcare system, sure you can take this course, or you can read \"Introduction to US Health Policy\" by Daniel Barr. It covers more or less the same topics and you'll learn it in half the time. What you can't get from the book are the guest lecturers who share the insight they've obtained while working in the healthcare field. However, the guest lecturers were often hit-or-miss or late or annoyingly arrogant. If you want a great mentor in the healthcare field, definitely consider Howie, but you don't have to take his course. tl;dr: If you're looking for an easy QR with a light workload, then sure take this course. Otherwise, you're better off elsewhere.",
    "Take it Credit\/D if you can. It's very difficult to tell what your grade is until it comes out because Forman's curve doesn't make a ton of sense. TF's are very critical on assignments.",
    "No.",
    "Professor Forman is incredible, I would strongly recommend this course to another student",
    "T R A S H. This class is trash. You may be enticed by the low workload, but it's a trap. You only got a midterm, a final paper (6-8pgs), and a final exam, but the course instruction is *horrendous*. Professor Forman treats the class like a 75 minute long episode of Beat the Clock. I mean this guy is literally racing through every lecture. He will finish one of his Powerpoints 3 minutes before class ends, and tries to knock out 15 slides of the next one. And it'd be one thing if he were good at explaining the systems he was covering. But he's not. In fact, he assumes you already came in with a significant background in health policy. So if you don't know already know that many of the 500 different health policy acronyms (like HDHP, SCHIPP, FFS, P4P, etc.), you're out of luck (cuz he doesn't really explain any of them) \\_()_\/. Final notes: the grading is really nit-picky, it's more of a policy course than an Econ course, the class has a lot of premeds, and it's uncurved (-__-). Take this for what its worth, but this has honestly been the worst choice of my past 5 semesters.",
    "Solid econ elective. Important material to know and not too difficult of a class.",
    "Take this course. Great overview of health economics and public policy in America. I personally love Forman's lecture style: He's appropriately blunt at times, not afraid to call out poor policy from either side of the political spectrum, and has a dry sense of humor that I appreciate (although i'm sure some others didn't). Show up to lecture, and you'll be fine. He posts slides online, but the meat of what you learn is from class. Great class, take it!",
    "Yeah, absolutely, it's a great fourth\/fifth class depending on your workload for the semester. The workload isn't intense during the semester, but the class covers a ton of material, and you wanna study really hard for the midterm and the final.",
    "It's a fine class -- nothing mind-blowing, dry lectures, you'll have to memorize a lot of facts for the exams -- but not a ton of work. A good econ credit, especially if you're trying to avoid quant.",
    "Yes! I love the healthcare industry and I am premed so I may be a bit biased but this is really a super rewarding class that doesn't ask a ton of you but gives you a lot in return. Professor Forman is a really great teacher that knows so much and is a really important person in healthcare and his lectures are super worthwhile. You learn so much useful information about healthcare and the industry that is very important in this day and age.",
    "Yes. Incredible course with a great professor and great material. If you have interest in this topic then definitely take the class. It's more of a history class than an econ class, but for the history component it's really a great class. I leave feeling like a far more knowledgeable citizen. I can actually comment on the American Healthcare system and know that i'm speaking with some actual facts behind me, which is really nice.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in understanding how the healthcare system works. Sure, you might be able to learn a lot of the same information from reading the news or browsing the Medicare website, but Professor Forman is such a knowledgeable lecturer and a cool professor, it's worth it to take this class and learn from him. The workload is not burdensome at all (just a couple of small assignments, a final paper, midterm, and final exam) and you will gain so much practical knowledge in the process.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student, given that you have an interest in healthcare and the American health system. The class can get a bit dry at times, but the material is interesting and definitely things that every American citizen should know. Workload is very light: 2 short homework assignments with some reading (but no reading besides that), midterm, 6-8pg paper, and a final. All the slides are posted online, but you still need to go to class because what Forman says is way more important (and interesting!) than what is on the slides. I definitely felt like I was going into most of the assignments blind, not knowing really what they expected us to know for the exams, and not knowing what they wanted out of the paper. However, at the end of the day nothing was too difficult and the end grading was fine.",
    "ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You will learn nothing about health care or health care system. The problem sets were stupid and graded harshly. Professor Forman is very nice but can work on his lecturing style a lot more. I dreaded going to lecture every class because of his monotonous voice. I have nothing good to say about the class. Do not waste your credit or credit D on a class like this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, though I would recommend taking it credit\/D and just to absorb the material without worrying about the grade. I took it for a grade and ended up pretty stressed about getting all the many pieces of policy minutiae down, but I did really enjoy learning all of the material.",
    "I would only if you are a premed wanting to understand how Medicare and Medicaid and ACA (repeal? Gulp.) will affect your practice, or if you're an Econ major in needn't of a fun elective!",
    "Fascinating course on healthcare in America. Should be required for all interested in working in or with medicine. Lots of material is covered with little guidance on expectations, but if you don't treat it as a gut then it is a straightforward class to succeed in. If you are totally uninterested in policy or economics this will not be a fun class for you. Don't just take it for a gut or you will be disappointed, take it if you are interested in the subject want an engaging but manageable 5th class.",
    "yes. even non econ majors-- there is a lot of interesting stuff",
    "Yes, definitely! As long as you can sit through the lectures. There's really no work outside of listening and taking good notes in lecture.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in learning about health economics from an expert in US healthcare without heavy econ or math concepts. This course is really well taught, but make sure that you are really interested in the topic before taking it, otherwise the level of detail and factual information could perhaps feel a bit dry to you in some lectures. The guest lecturers are also really interesting. The grading is fair - a midterm, a few short straightforward assignments, a free topic final paper and a final exam.",
    "Take this course if you want an economics course that is very interesting. Most interesting and engaging Econ elective I have taken. Very good professor and you learn A LOT about the U.S. healthcare system. Not an incredibly hard workload, but also not a gut -- there is a lot of information to know for the exams, although the exams are not extremely difficult.",
    "No, I don't think I would. Professor Forman is great, but lectures are still pretty dry and boring. The material is not exactly gripping and I feel like most of it I could have learned by reading a book or two. The guest lecturers are interesting but ultimately not sure I would recommend the course. It's not a bad choice, just not that great.",
    "Definitely take it if you're pre-med--the understanding that this relatively low-work class will give you is IMPERATIVE for future doctors. We're in the middle of a big transition nationally, and we all need to know where we're coming from as a nation. I was really interested in the material, especially the way public policy intersects with healthcare delivery. Howie is a great mentor, a decent lecturer, and really makes sure that everyone understands each slide before he moves on. Make sure to ask questions in lecture. The guest lecturers are at the top of their fields, which is awesome. Howie grounds everything he says in his own experience as both a doctor and a patient.",
    "This course is great for those who seek an introduction into the basics of the healthcare market.",
    "Honestly, the class is pretty tough but you learn a ton. Im glad I took the course even though it may hurt my GPA. Professor Forman is great as well",
    "I learned a lot about how the US healthcare system works. How money flows between the government, people and different healthcare facilities and also how the government has attempted to reform healthcare so that financial incentives for hospitals and doctors line up with High quality health care and keeping costs low\/eliminating waste. We discussed Medicare, Medicaid, diff models of health insurance plans and much more. Exams are detailed, but so long as you keep up with the readings and thoroughly learn\/study everything it should be fine. Would definitely reccomend this class. It was super interesting and very engaging. The prof is extremely knowledgeable and there are a lot of cool guest lectures. Worh taking for anyone interested in learning about the US health care system, Obamacare, and why it's important in regards to the US budget.",
    "I would reccomend this course to a student of any major, because the healthcare industry is something everyone participates in, and should know a little bit about.",
    "I would recommend this course for sure! Gives you not only a great understanding of the American healthcare system (useful for anyone) but also an understanding of why economics is important -- in a way that you might not get from an intro micro or macro course. Great professor and especially good if you do the optional readings, which were actually fun to read.",
    "Yes.",
    "Definitely take this, especially if you are pre-med. It will give you insight into your role in the system as well as what the healthcare future is. Definitely recommend.",
    "Yes! Really good mix of healthcare info and public policy, with more policy info than you'd find in a typical econ class. Really felt like learning about a real thing relevant to most people in the country. The tests were more 'econ'ish than the lecture, weirdly. The workload is reasonable, with some short homework assignments plus a midterm, final, and final paper.",
    "Descriptive review of health econ with little to no math involved. Overall, a great class especially with Prof. Forman. He's very funny and personable, and encourages questions despite the number of people in the class. Only 4 required readings (the rest are optional) and very light workload. Pretty essential to go to class though since the slides don't mean much without an explanation. Great class to take to ease a heavy schedule. Best of all, you immediately notice the benefit of what you learn from this class. While doing the research paper, I could understand most of the journal articles and understood the debate over Medicare\/Medicaid and Obamacare. One of the most satisfying classes I've taken thus far at Yale.",
    "I'd recommend the course to people interested in US healthcare or for economics majors looking to get credit towards the major but want something different from traditional economics courses. However, for econ majors, be wary that this course is more of a public policy (similar to political science) than it is an economics course.",
    "Yes, it is as rewarding as the work you put into it.",
    "Only if you need it for a requirement. Unless they change it to fifty minute classes, I don't think the lectures are worth sitting through in exchange for less work. There is a ton of material to know, but the delivery is bland.",
    "I recommend this class to any student interested in learning more about the world of healthcare. Students hoping to attend medical school would be particularly interested in this class.",
    "I was frustrated a lot with this class in general, but the student TA was super helpful. 1. I felt the class was really disorganized. Maybe it had something to do with the fact there was no textbook? Forman taught at a fast pace each lecture and I know a lot of kids were lost during each lecture because he used foreign terminology or just explained some concepts badly (and he doesn't realize when he explained something well and didn't, but he should because kids in the lecture are too confused or reluctant to ask Forman to explain the concept again). The slides aren't entirely self explanatory, and I feel like Forman could write some clarifying notes at the bottom of the ppt slides with important information (in the notes section of each slide). 2. I found the TAs to be terrible teachers, unenthusiastic when helping students, and overall incompetent. The TAs never went out of their way to ensure students were falling behind. Sure they held review sessions once every two weeks, but they weren't really helpful, because I went to a few and kids just asked their own questions, but what would've been more helpful is just a review of some lectures. The majority of students would prefer this because 1) you learn something better when learning about it a second time and 2) more often than not students don't even know what they don't know, which doesn't make the type of sessions the TAs were running very useful; the TAs should've realized this, and I feel like they were kind of lazy and just wanted to sit around and answer any questions that arose instead of taking the initiative to ensure students didn't misunderstand any concepts; also I was surprised there weren't weekly review sections like normal lecture classes 3. A LOT of kids in class are frats\/sports kids who have TONS of resources from past years. They had past tests and study guides and HWs to look at theought the semester. I didn't really have anything and felt that there was no support system in place. It was frustrating. I talked to one friend who took it last year and he said the TAs were great and really helpful in explaining things.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, yes, yes! Extremely interesting material if you were already tangentially interested in healthcare and healthcare policy in the first place, and Dr. Forman is an awesome professor who is super willing to talk to you, answer questions, and get to know you.",
    "I would highly recommend this to any student. The healthcare system affects everyone and everyone should have a general understanding of how it works. It's a very well taught course with very relevant content.",
    "This is not a gut class. Whatever the workload ratings might suggest, the assignments and tests in this class are graded harshly, and the midterm and final are not curved. Take this class if you are semi-interested in the material, and are willing to put in the necessary hours before the midterm and final.",
    "Take this class. 1000000%. One of my favorite classes, totally manageable workload, and you'll learn a lot. Sometimes you'll be overwhelmed with info, but everything is applicable and important. Discovered a secret passion for healthcare.",
    "If you are interested in the fundamentals of our health care system and hope to approach it with perspectives of economics and policy-making, this would be a great intro class you should start with."
