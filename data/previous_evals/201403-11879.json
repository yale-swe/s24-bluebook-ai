    "Only take this course if you are willing to travel 6+ hours a week to see shows in New York City. The opportunity to see shows is amazing, and the writing is pretty cool. But be prepared to spend a lot of time on the train!",
    "It's unclear what this class will look like in the future, if it's taught again, but YES, I'd recommend anything taught by either professor -- the co-taught class is perfect! (The 10-student cap means a 5:1 teacher-student ratio, which is great.) You get to go to NYC and see a bunch of shows, and you get to write about them in experimental ways. I rated workload \"Same\" as other courses; the reading and writing are just a tiny bit less work than average, but the out-of-class commitments (shows in New York and several on-campus performances) add up.",
    "It is a great class that I would recommend, but there are definitely things you should be aware of. First off, you are going to New York almost every friday, which means you miss Friday night basically. You come back at around midnight -2am. You leave for the metro north at about 3pm. It is very time-consuming and kind of expensive. Get a 10 trip pass (like $120, if I remember correctly), but also remember you will have to eat and the tickets themselves (they are subsidized but still cost money) are about $80. That being said, it is a great experience to see all of these shows. We saw many shows from the Brooklyn Academy of Music New Wave Festival. Every week, you will respond on the website (like a critical reading response, but trying to make it experimental) and one of the performances, will be your main critique (just a bigger more thorough assignment). Every week, everyone will read the main critique for that performance (sometimes it is two people doing the same show) and during class, you talk critique their critique and you talk about the performance. At the end of the semester, you have to come up with a new approach to critique your assigned performance, and also edit your first critique of that performance."
