    "I have a better understanding of what it means to be a consultant and deliver a high-quality group project to a client.",
    "This is hard to answer as its very project-specific. If you like a project and think it can add to your knowledge- or skill-base, then take it.",
    "- How to cooperate within a team, in a real-life business problem setting - How to effectively communicate one's idea, to accommodate differences and to reach consensus - How to organize ideas and present to the client - How to form surveys and focus group study",

    "Communication with client, deal with ambiguity and scope change , work with a team",

   "comments": [
    "Strength: client projects, final presentations Weakness: Guest lectures were okay. I'm not sure how much they contributed to the overall outcome of my client project or guided my understanding of consulting for my client project.",
    "Provide students with more optional readings or lectures.",
    "The course is strong in setting up students with interesting projects and clients who are eager to collaborate. I also enjoyed many of the speakers who came to visit - particularly those from Framework LLC. The course is weak in providing up-to-date, cutting edge consulting advice for students. Sometimes our lectures didn't seem that relevant.",
    "The quality of the course is highly dependent on the client and group members, which can be both a strength and a weakness. The in-class lectures are fairly basic and straightforward and could have more engaging conversations about consulting and corporate engagement.",
    "The lectures for this course are largely unnecessary and are not very helpful, although the Curtis packaging and the fish guy were really, really cool.",
    "- I would appreciate it if we could have an ice-breaking session at the beginning of the course so as to let team members better know each other",
    "Liked the balance of lecture and group work time",
    "Strengths - you get to work with big clients in the industry and build a relationship with them. This is a great class to consider if you want to go into consulting or if there is a specific client you wish to work for in the future. Class does not meet every week and I was able to use that time to get ahead in my project milestones for the course. Guidelines for the presentation and report are helpful and clear. Weaknesses - NDA signing process was a nightmare. It took one month to get everything straightened out for some teams. Clients can be difficult to deal with at times when it comes to NDA signing and so can the university.",
    "I think it depends a lot on the client and the team. Fortunately, I had a great team that could deliver a good project even with uncertainty coming from the client",
    "strength : structure weakness: delay in projects due to issues around NDA"

    "- Jump out of your comfort zone and get ready to be challenged by your excellent teammates and clients!",
    "Great class, but totally depends on your client. Focus more on the project content than how impressive the company sounds",
    "Team evaluations carry a large weight in final grades. Make sure you are communicating effectively with them and know when to back off when a group consensus has been established that you don't agree with. Trust your teammates and\/or clearly state your point of view.",
    "Your experience is very dependent on the project that you are assigned. Be sure to keep an open mind!"
