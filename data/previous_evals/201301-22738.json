    "CHEM 423 taught by Professor Ellman is a great class to take. You learn about more recent chemistry, and Professor Ellman does a great job of providing prospective on the current direction of methods research.",
    "The proposal we had to write was pretty rough. A lot of very modern stuff, so it was hard to understand everything. Interesting stuff though, and if you take synthetic methods, take it with Ellman",
    "This class focuses on the most important and novel areas of synthetic chemistry. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "This is a must take course. It goes up there with my favorite courses at Yale and you learn so much. Even if you are not directly interested in synthetic methods I can't imagine a better introduction. I will definitely be taking this notebook with me to graduate school and using the references provided as a starting point if I need to look into a particular transformation.",
    "Okay, so you're looking at this class as an undergraduate who plans to major in chemistry. My recommendation for this class goes both ways. I advocate for taking it, making the case that there are zero (0) exams the entire semester. The grading is 50% problem sets, 50% final proposal. Ellman stresses throughout the semester that this really is not a stressful class.However, I would also advocate against taking this course on the basis of interest in chemistry. At the end of the semester, I don't really feel like I've learned anything new and I don't feel motivated to learn. Yeah, you come to lecture and copy down Ellman's copious and well-organized notes. But the simplicity of the psets and lack of exams allow you to bypass the traditional science course requirement of learning how to apply the material. As a result, I would show up to lecture for the sole purpose of copying down the notes.Bottom line, if you want a pretty chill high level chemistry course, this is the right one for you. If you want to feel engaged and feel like you learned something, I'd suggest looking somewhere else.",
    "This is an excellent survey course that focuses on modern synthetic transformations in organic chemistry, requiring only an orgo II background. The main focus is catalysis, starting with transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions and moving on to organocatalysis. Professor Ellman is an amazing teacher and moves through material quickly, but you will never feel like he is rushing. He puts great notes on the board that are extremely helpful during the problem sets, which are largely based on his notes (this is also the sole complaint I have; synthesis is so empirical-oriented that at times you feel like you're copying the notes while doing homework and not comprehending what is going on). Weekly homework assignments are not very long, but can be challenging, especially if this is your first exposure to organometallic chemistry (he does a good review of it however, so you don't have to take CHEM 452 or even 252 before). There is a proposal project at the end where you have to come up with a new synthetic method, and it is a BEAST. Starting early on it requires a lot of self-discipline, especially with the shorter reading period, but trust me, it takes WAY longer than you think. For example, you suddenly realize that your method has been implemented before after spending hours marveling over \/ writing about how ingenious it is, or that your method is unfeasible because to get the starting material, you need 15 messy steps and toxic reagents. However, you will have learned more from the project than from any science paper you've written before.",
    "A good introduction to key transformations in synthetic chemistry, with a strong focus on catalysis. Essential to synthetic chemists, and very well taught with Ellman at the helm.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with a strong interest in organicsynthesis. You cover a lot of material, read a good deal of primary literature, and learn to use search engines like scifinder to look up compounds and reactions. If you are not sure if organic synthesis is for you, you will find out fairly quickly. There were no tests, which was nice, but the research proposal, which counted for 50% of the grade, was a bit intimidating. Take it with Ellman if you can. He's a great lecturer and always willing to help at office hours."
