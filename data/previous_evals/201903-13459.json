   "comments": [
    "I learned about a wide range of topics relevant to \"agrarian studies\" or \"peasant studies\" more broadlyincluding migration, the complexities of human ecological intervention, and some of the systemic problems facing both agriculture and peasants globally. I think this course broadly opened up issues of the environment and human life to me from a more critical perspective, and taught me the right sorts of questions to ask about some of the daunting issues facing vulnerable populations and ecosystems. There was a big emphasis on the importance of local knowledge, and a really instructive tendency by the professors to actively question conventional framings of issues and solutions. I think I definitely learned a lot about the limitations of pure social science research, and the ways in which other fields are helpful in reframing poorly framed issues in the social sciences.",
    "I learned about the agrarian dynamics of civil war, the dynamics of famines, and the intricacies of agriculture cultivation.",
    "I gained insights into various aspects of the study of agrarian societies - from the history of human migrations to new understandings about plants. This course covers a wide range of topics so is difficult to summarise!"

   "comments": [
    "I thought it was great that this course was so broad in the topics it covered, and assigned readings from such diverse genres and disciplines. The classroom atmosphere was also really great in that the professors lectured for the first couple hours, but left plenty of time for questions. It was also very cool to get to hear three great professors have discussions with each other. Also, the professors are each individually so great and interesting! And good feedback on reading responses. I think having four total hours of class, with the second two being in smaller seminar groups was a bit much. Sometimes it felt like the seminar discussion didn't need to go on for two hours. And it was often unclear exactly what role the discussion leader was supposed to playsometimes the professors deferred much more or much less to the discussion leaders. I think the absolute flexibility of the final paper was also a bit overwhelming for an undergraduate without graduate-level research to rely upon. But overall great class!",
    "The subjects of the course were very interesting and the lectures were informative. However, the discussions and length of the class tended to drag on.",
    "The principal strength of this course is the level of engagement from the three lecturers. I think it could be helpful to shuffle the discussion sections around maybe halfway through the semester as it would have been interesting to hear the perspectives of other students from the class."

    "Yes, if you are interested in the environment, the relation between social sciences and other disciplines, questioning assumptions of your fields, and interested in a diverse set of readings (in terms of genre and discipline). It is definitely a lot of reading, but much of the reading was quite interesting, and you could definitely skim some things if you were short on time.",
    "absolutely",
    "If they have the wherewithal to survive four hours of class then it is a very rewarding class.",
    "If you are interested in agriculture, or pastoralism, or in forests, or climate change (or so many other things), you will be given intriguing things to think about in this course (even if some of the specific topics are less interesting to you)."
