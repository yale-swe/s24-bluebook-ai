   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're want to know about cutting-edge research in bioimaging",
    "Yes, worth taking. Very high-level view of neuroimaging. You won't have to do ANY math, but you will definitely learn a lot about the contemporary debates in neuroscience. The interesting thing is that the professors themselves have been very involved in this debate, because the Yale medical school neuroimaging department is actually quite good -- so you'll be talking and the professors will talk about these landmark research studies that their friends did.",
    "BME 485 is a great class. While there are no prerequisites for the class, it's probably useful to have some understanding of the more technical basis of MRI\/MRS. The course is basically structured so that each student gives a presentation about a chapter from the text each week. Professor Rothman and Professor Hyder are both excellent teachers and have done extensive research in the field, so their contributions during class discussions are well worth the time.",
    "Definitely take it!! The professors are wonderful and neuroimaging is a fascinatingsubject. I was nervous about taking a class outside of my major but my fellow classmates were such a pleasure and I feel like I learned a lot about the experiments that are presented in neuroscience and psychology classes.",
    "Great class for anyone interested in Neuroimaging. Don't be intimidated by the fact that it's also a grad student class. This structure of the class really allows you to explore topics and critically think about neuroimaging without being stressed out about memorizing things for a test."
