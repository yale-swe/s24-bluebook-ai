    "This was a really unique opportunity to research a topic in depth, and I think we all appreciated Prof. Camacho's commitment to keeping the class to (almost) all seniors because most of our work was either related to or on our theses. This made for in-depth discussions about each other's topics and an interest in listening to each other's progress. Prof. Camacho is amazing as well.",
    "One of the best classes--really allows you to focus on something you love and make a contribution. Professor Camacho is excellent, and the other students are always fun to work with.",
    "absolutely!!! Even if you're not an AMST major, this course gets you interested in and devoted to a topic for an entire semester, which makes you realize what matters most to you academically.",
    "I would recommend it. Make sure you enjoy the project you select. Most of the class will be working to develop your project. Keep an open mind in this class - this class will change a lot of your preconceived notions about legitimate forms of scholarship.",
    "If you choose a topic for your independent project that you are really passionate about, this is a phenomenally rewarding class. Work on the project is cumulative, with feedback throughout, and you end up with an unhurried and high quality product. If you are more interested in the readings and class discussions, it might be less compelling for you."
