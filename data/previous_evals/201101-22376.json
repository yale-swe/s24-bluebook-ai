    "Do not take this class. It is boring and taught to the textbook. I feel like I intellectually stagnated in it. Psets are tedious and a waste of time that involves a lot of looking up of formulas. Tests are equally tedious. You learn how to use a formula pretty well, but that's about the extent of the learning that goes on in this class. No actual intellectual development. If you already know 1+1=2, you're wasting your time taking this class. Search elsewhere for a more stimulating class.",
    "yeah. take it if you don't want to take a real science or QR",
    "APHY 110b is a great course if you're looking for a fun class where you learn a lot. Be careful, though, as it is not a gut and requires a fair bit of thinking and work on your part. If you attend lectures and do your problem sets in advance, you should be fine, though. Expect to put in a solid 4-5 hours a week altogether.",
    "Work consists of attending lecture, doing short weekly problem sets, and studying the night before tests\/final",
    "Take it if you have to...",
    "If you're ever forced to take this class at gunpoint, embrace death with the assurance that you're much better off. This class was my worst academic decision of my Yale career: Henrich is a drag in lecture, the slides and problem sets are never online, and the material is not as rosy or easy as it may sound.",
    "If you need a science credit and want to learn about how things (LCD tvs, solar panels, x-rays, etc) work, take it. There are 3 exams and weekly problem sets. And the exam that you do worst on only counts for about 5% of your grade, which is nice b\/c I did a lot better on the 2nd exam than on the first. The problem sets aren't that difficult and you can take 2 sheets of notes to the exams (life saver!). If you are taking this class though, you need to make sure and attend every lecture. There is no textbook and most people take notes by hand, so you can't just have someone email them to you.",
    "Very little math and science needs to be understood to do well in this class. It basically comes down to memorization... you have to memorize a lot of facts about how different technologies work. If you can do that, it's a great science credit. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Cool course on everyday technology. Tech World doesn't have a tone of work, but it is not a gut. You really have to know your stuff before exams, and you need to check your homework answers with friends. Very fun as a credit\/d course. If you don't care about how a CD or x-ray machine works, don't bother taking this, you'll get bored.",
    "It's a pretty interesting class and it's cool to understand how some things work. It can be a bit frustrating, however, since you don't really have a textbook (the physics book barely connects) and have to rely solely on lecture notes. If you've taken science in high school, the math\/problem sets won't be too bad.",
    "yes, it's not a gut, but it is a thought-provoking science class that takes little background knowledge. Great course.",
    "Good, easy class. Very interesting.",
    "This class is INTERESTING. For once, you will sit in a Yale classroom on a foreign side of campus and be INTERESTED in a lecture. Prof. Henrich is princely. He is generous with his time and enthusiasm about the coursework. Topics include liquid crystal displays (LCDs),GPS, CAT scans, x-rays, solar panels, LEDs, motors, sound, light, antennas, cell phones, fiber optics, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray, stealth airplanes, 3-D, pixels, and parabolic dishes (all by way of waves, binary, magnetism, polarization, electric fields, quantum physics, and how silicon works). Go to the lecture. If you can handle that for the rest of the semester, it's worth the ride. Get help from the TAs if you get lost.",
    "Definitely take this course. Interesting material, good lectures, not a ton of work.",
    "I would recommend this class but it is not a gut. Just make sure to do all the problem sets and really study for the tests. If you do this you should be fine.",
    "Interesting class applying science concepts to tech applications. Pretty easy workload.",
    "Tech World is not a gut. It is hard. I did not enjoy it while I was taking it because I was constantly confused and never had any clue what was going on. HOWEVER, now that I've taken the final, and I studied my butt of and I understand everything (somewhat) I can honestly say that I am soo happy that I took the course. It is a great course in organization and the TA's and Professor are AMMMAZING (GO TO THEM EARLY AND OFTEN FOR HELP!!!-- I went every week!-- couldn't have done it without them!) I'm glad to know how tv's, lightbulbs, motors, generators and computer screens work... even though I've never taken Physics before... and I suck at math, I found the applied nature of the material interesting!",
    "I would take a different science class for the credit.",
    "It's an amazing course that teaches you the physics behind everyday appliances. I definitely appreciated all of the scientists involved in discovering the theories so that I can use various devices! Because I hadn't taken any physics before, it was very difficult for me throughout the course, but the course was very well taught. The professor was also very encouraging, an attitude that you almost never find with a professor in the sciences. A great course overall!",
    "Don't take it unless you have a supremely good attention span.",
    "Interesting class and definitely not a gut.",
    "Yes, but don't expect to take it as a gut class. You have to put in a lot of time into it even if you are good at physics.",
    "Tech World is a great class to take to fulfill a sc credit",
    "Great course, highly recommended for non-majors. If you go to class, it should be a breeze. If you don't you'll be sorry.",
    "It really depends what you want out of the class. If you are genuinely interested in learning about how modern technology works, then you will really enjoy the class. The lectures are interesting, the work isn't too difficult, and you come out of the class with a pretty solid (maybe basic, but still solid) understanding of a lot of cool technologies that you use in your daily life. But if you're just looking for a science credit, and have no interest in being there, then you might find it a bit boring and tedious.",
    "Take it if you are good at science and math. Do not take it to fulfil a Sc\/QR requirement. It is difficult!",
    "This is a \u0093how stuff works\u0094 class, and I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This class doesn\u0092t have too much work, but you need to really make sure you understand the core concepts very well to do well in the class, and this is a class where you definitely can\u0092t afford to miss lecture.",
    "The material is interesting, but the lectures are often dry. If you have any math or science experience, this class isn't too difficult, but it does assume some previous experience. Be ready to write a lot on the exams.",
    "Don't take this class! If you need a science credit, there are other classes that are lot easier, a lot more interesting, and much better taught. The material seems interesting, but this class is terribly boring and becomes a drag very quickly.",
    "Good class for a humanities major with an inclination toward math but little interest in science. Also, it's harder in the beginning so just hang in there and it will get easier. By the end I definitely felt like I had learned a lot of cool stuff about technology (GPS systems, DVDs, stealth technology, etc)",
    "Take it if you need a QR, but it's not wonderful.",
    "This course is extremely rewarding for someone with an interest in applied physics who is not interested in pursuing a science major.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has an interest in technology and who has a basic background in physics (if you had trouble with HS physics, don't take this)",
    "Great class, depending on your interests. Take it. Not that tough (although some people really struggled with it).",
    "I recommend taking this course. It's a great science credit. I found it really interesting getting to learn about how things in everyday life work. The workload is very manageable-just problem sets, two midterms, and a final. If you go in for the TA sessions, the problem sets are a piece of cake. And the exams aren't too bad either.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. If you are looking for a gut this is NOT it. Electronically sprint away from this page and this class. But if you want a course that will capture your imagination from time to time and will give you a window into the technological world, this class is for you.",
    "This is an interesting course that will teach you only the most practical application of basic physics concepts. I liked it even though I was reluctant about taking a 'gut' science course since I really liked science in high school.",
    "This class covers a lot of cool technology. You get a very basic understanding of how a lot of things work and Prof Henrich does a pretty good job in lecture. It is not a lot of work (no readings) but it is honest work.",
    "Yes, take the class if you are interested in knowing how all the technology around you works. It's actually really cool stuff to know. As a humanities-brained person I'm lucky I took AP Physics in high school because I would have been totally LOST at times. Definitely make use of the textbook (you have to rent it in Bass on closed reserve) to better understand the concepts he teaches in class. In the end the class was worth it for me. Also, this is definitely NOT at gut class, if you haven't realized this by now. I went to every lecture and took notes on everything he said, but still had to read the textbook and get help on p-sets.",
    "I would recommend it if you liked the material...it's all applied physics which means you get to learn how plasma TV, GPS, or X-ray work.",
    "The Technological World was a fantastic course. It not only brought science down to a level for non-science majors, but actually made it extremely interesting. I was so much more interested in learning the material when I could see the tangible influence it had on the world around me. Plus, Prof Henrich is amazing.",
    "Basically a \"How Stuff Works\" course, heavier on basic math and physics at the beginning, heavier on technological applications for the rest of the term. The class has no mandatory reading, so you have to go to lecture to understand anything. It's not a chore, though, because Professor Henrich is an engaging lecturer, cheerful and passionate. He usually uses videos or displays or demonstrations or some combination thereof to make class more entertaining. The problem sets aren't hard (if you go to the review sessions you can bang them out quickly with the TFs explaining anything you don't understand), but the tests can be tricky, and it's easier than you might think not to do well on them even just because they don't have many questions. Still, overall the grading is fairly lenient. If you want a SC credit or a QR, are interested in \"how stuff works,\" and are willing to do the (minimal) work, I would recommend it.",
    "A very straightforward science and math. Be warned, if you don't go to class or try or listen or take notes, you probably won't do well. Also, there is no text book per se. But Prof. Henrich is a good teacher, is very organized. If you need a QR\/SC, take it and get it over with. You'll just be panicking the night before tests, and then hopefully realize everything will be okay in the end. Alternatively, if you're decent at physics or problem solving, you can can an A.",
    "NOT A GUT",
    "It's an okay way to do a QR credit---you really just need to be able to plug stuff into a calculator. The problem sets don't take very long at all, either. However, if you are not fast at doing problems, the two hour long exams can be difficult to finish, as there really is no time to think through any of the problems. Some topics are more interesting than others, but I wouldn't say it was an especially good use of my credit. That being said, there aren't many good alternative QR classes",
    "Good class. Harder than you expect if you don\u0092t have a physics background. But the teacher is great and the TAs are very helpful. Definitely go to them before each pset. First test is designed to be harder than you expect. Go to class.",
    "This course is quite interesting. It gives an overview of how many of the technological concepts work at a physical level. As such, the course contains a non-trivial amount of math, but it is definitely manageable. Overall the course is an interesting overview of topics, and will teach you things you can't learn in any other Yale course or indeed anywhere else.",
    "This is a class that will teach you exactly how technology like LCD, GPS, and other devices function all the way down to the nitty gritty. It's a but mind-boggling, in a good way and a bad way.",
    "I strongly recommend this class, especially to people with little background in physics or technology. I expected the course to be just a \"How Stuff Works\" type of class, but there is also a fair amount of basic physics. This is a very applicable class; if you don't think it's useful for you to now how technology works in future classes or a career, it's at least interesting in everyday conversation. But in an increasingly technological world, this class will probably be very useful, even if you don't major in any physics or technology-related subject. Prof. Henrich always makes sure to use demonstrations, visuals, and videos, which not only makes the class more interesting but is genuinely helpful. He doesn't teach to quickly, emphasizes the important points, and takes time to answer questions. This is a great course; I learned a lot, but wasn't exceedingly stressed.",
    "Applied Physics is great science class for someone who is a non-science major but doesn't want to take a gut. It is challenging but doable at the same time. You have to work hard and put in the effort but it's honestly not rocket science. It is also very interesting overall.",
    "This is not an easy A and if you are not proactive about getting help, its going to be extra hard.",
    "This is a fascinating course for anyone who enjoys physics and learning about its real life applications, even though he\/she is not a scientist . I LOVED it. Since the course doesn't have a book, you need to attend class regularly and take good notes, but the class is always fun because the course material is very interesting and Prof Henrich always has couple of videos to show& demonstrations to make during class. I have never seen a class in which 80 students watch the professor with their eyes wide open and with collective 'Wooow'' sounds. Definetely take this class if you enjoy learning about physics and technological developments.One last recommendation: Prof Henrich's office hours are super helpful. If you attend the office hours, the psets just take 20 mins to complete and you easily get high grades from the exams."
