   "comments": [
    "don't expect it to be easy.",
    "Very fast paced if you have no previous french knowledge. Be ready to have to be proactive in figuring out what you need to learn and how much time you need to put in.",
    "Don't take it unless you need it for requirement.",
    "French 110 is an introductory language course that teaches you the fundamentals of French. It was work-intensive, because the class meets everyday and there are exams every Monday. Also, the nightly homework can be a lot at times...since the assignments can take up to 2 hours. However, I don't think that a language class can be taught any other way. Yale's French department is one of the most intense departments (aside from probably Yale's Chinese Department), so they really make sure you learn the language, if you are willing to put in the work. I started off the class with NO French background, and the fact that I could read, write, and understand French at the end of 14 weeks is pretty amazing to me. I can watch TV shows and movies, but for the most part understand the gist of the French being spoken. I bet with another semester, I will see more improvement!",
    "French 110 is a great way to learn a language very quickly. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who is interested in learning French in an immersive, engaging way. This course does take quite a bit of work and involves significant class time and participation, but the thinking skills that it employs are quite different from those used for any other non-foreign language class at Yale.",
    "Tedious but simple out of class work. Need self-discipline to keep up with the workbook, but, again, the work isn't difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend FREN 110 to anyone interested in learning a language. The French in Action video, textbook, and workbook program is fantastic (and sometimes hilarious). My professor (Schneider) was always energetic and involved in teaching us, and it seemed like all of the other instructors were as well. At first, the total-immersion aspect intimidated and frustrated me, but if you stick with it, you'll see that it's probably the best way to learn a language. If you're struggling, tutors are available. Weekly Monday night tests kind of suck, but it does free up an extra day in the week to prepare for the tests and learn the language. Be prepared to do a lot of work. If you do all of the audio exercises and homework, you will be working for at least two-hours five days a week. Don't let the work discourage you, though -- FREN 110 was one of my favorite courses this semester, and I'm looking forward to learning more.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking French with Madame Schneider! She is wonderful, and I doubt you'll ever be bored. It may be a little intimidating at first because it is full immersion into the language from day one, but there's no better way to learn a language. It is a lot of work from day to day, but it's all very enjoyable, and you'll learn so much...it's great!"
