    "Yes, good class discussion, not boring",
    "Latin American Film was not a particularly structured or organized course, but it was an incredibly interesting one. For anyone who has an interest in film studies or Latin America, it is a must. Paulo is highly engaged with the material and eager to share his knowledge, even if at the cost of fostering class discussion. I thoroughly enjoyed watching all the films, though it is admittedly tough to always get through four films a week. Ultimately, the class was what you made of it, and if you are willing to put in the time to watch at least most of the films, I would definitely recommend it."
