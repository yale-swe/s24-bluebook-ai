    "This was my favorite course of the semester. The field trips were not only incredibly fun, but so much work went into designing full, informative days, making it a valuable learning experience. The course was incredibly informative, both for someone wanting introductory overview, and for depth of content. If I would change anything: The days with long lists of plants and uses were a bit challenging for my attention span. but still really useful and interesting information. The budget exercises were great and it would have been fun to do more interactive projects like that. It would be really cool to do a nutrient budget, like the one from las Canadas, too. Again,the field trips were spectacular, but I would have liked to be a bit more hands on at times. Thanks so much for a wonderful course. It is super valuable to the school, and really hope it's taught every year.",
    "This is the best course i've taken at FES. Eric is the best lecturer i've had at FES and his command over subject matter and current events within agroforestry was amazing.",
    "Eric is a really great, dedicated and knowledgable teacher. I learned so much and felt that he was always available to talk through things and give additional perspectives.",
    "I was auditing and did therefore not attend field trips or do the readings, so I didn't answer these questions.",
    "incredible course with lots of technical and practical knowledge for those with agriculture interests. Eric is a wonderful professor and has a wealth of knowledge. FES would be very advantaged by continuing to offer this course with Eric as the professor."

    "My classmates presentations and Eric transmitting his knowledge and experience to us.",
    "Despite being a 3-hour class from 6-9 in the evenings, Eric kept lectures very engaging with his passion about the course content, and interactive in-class activities. The New York and Mexico field trips were phenomenal opportunities for students to learn more about agroforestry in person, easily among the top highlights of my time here at F&ES.",

    "The weekly responses are fine but I wonder if they could be made more meaningful\/interactive, as right now students are not sure if they are being read or just checked off.",
    "Perhaps it would be good to do a bit more about absolute foundations (think silvicultural aspects when mixing plants) of agroforestry.",
    "Eric can improve his lecturing style slightly. Some lectures were repetitive of the readings. I would have preferred to use the readings as prep for learning new material from the lecture"

    "This course provided a great practical understanding of perennial agriculture with the chance to see these systems in practice. While there are some agricultural policy courses at FES, this is one of the only ones to actually examine agricultural practices.",
    "It was new subject matter to me but it was taught very well. It opened my eyes to sustainable agriculture (my background is in clean energy) and has motivated me to consider a career in agriculture and agroforestry.",
    "This class changed my life. I not only discovered what it is I want to do, I made great connections along the way and witnessed sites that will influence my future decisions on the job.",

The class is currently capped at about 12, but even if you shop it and don't get in the first time, Eric is welcoming to auditors and independent study projects.",
