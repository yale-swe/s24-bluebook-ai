    "NO",
    "It was a semi-interesting course. I would recommend it for the person wanting to chill.",
    "It's highly recommended",
    "The material in the course is interesting and relevant to modern times, but the material presented in the course was pretty messy and disorganized at times. It might just be because this was the first year they offered the class. Not clear. Having two lecturers was a little confusing because the material was somewhat disjointed. Either way, it's definitely not the best class in the history department, but it isn't the worst one either",
    "Very interesting material, manageable workload, and interesting readings. Pick your TA wisely, because there was a lot of variance between TAs in terms of approachability\/ability (and grading!). The Professors seemed very nice but I've heard several (very reasonable) complaints from friends who ended up dropping the course because of said professors (and hence can't write reviews). At times I also felt like it had an undue focus on China, and that was probably due to one of the Professors being a China expert. There was little study of finance outside of Europe and China really; this class could've as well been called \"A comparative study of finance in Western Europe and China\". Take at your own risk.Most of the readings are from Goetzmann's book; which is a joy to read.",
    "Take it if you like history",
    "I absolutely would not recommend this class, it is structured in a terrible way and makes you complete stupid meaningless assignments that are tedious and dont add to your understanding of the material.",
    "It is an interesting class and you learn a lot, but the lectures can get pretty dry.",
    "It is a good class and an interesting topic.",
    "First time the course was taught. Grading is unclear, wish this could have had more clarity throughout the course. (The exams were curved in the end.) Section is essential to learning the best parts of the course. Lots of cool\/rare artifacts shown both in class and section. Exams are harder than you think; not just a course where you memorize random info and regurgitate. Professors structure the course to make you *synthesize* material, tying together themes eg from the evolution of Mesopotamian law, to ancient Greek debt cases (a ship of wine cargo mysteriously sinks and the sailors come back with salted fish to pay off debts... Credits to Will Goetzmann the man); to ancient China's currency crisis and multiple inflations caused by heinous governments who never learned their lesson; to the promiscuous Venetian gambler Casanova who ran away from his debts by euro-hopping; to the 2008 sub prime mortgage. Just take the course. Especially if you want to start your own company one day.This is like \"why people \/businesses fail 101\" summarized in a cooler form.",
    "Take the class if you need an easy but interesting humanities credit. Basically, the whole course is based on Professor Goetzmann's book, so it's not even necessary to go to lectures to be able to take the exams. His book is a super interesting story about financial innovation since ancient Mesopotamia and I really enjoyed the read. The only homework is a 500 word essay every week to be handed in in section.",
    "Yes, though it's a decent amount of work.",
    "Interesting at times. I would recommend it",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I am a senior History Major and this was the worst class I have taken at Yale. It was poorly organized and the lectures were not interesting. Gotezmann's lectures were somewhat enjoyable but Prof Hansen's lectures were awful. There was very little continuity and it was obvious she knew basically nothing about Finance or basically anything she was talking about. She would show up to class unprepared and ramble about something that wasn't important. I have never gone to a lecture and learned so little. Overall a very bad class. Overall I have never taken a class run by people who were almost completely incompetent (Gotezmann was the exception).",
    "Strengths - Doesn't ApplyWeaknesses - EverythingI would attempt to enumerate all of the weaknesses of the course; however, it is sufficient to merely state that it was absolutely the worst course I have ever taken at Yale. The complete and utter incompetence of the instructors was evident in almost every lecture. I have not only not learned anything, but also feel dumber for having listened to Hansen's complete drivel.Furthermore, I must warn you that Hansen's laugh resembles the kiss of a dementor -- it will consume your soul.Please do not subject yourself to this abomination",
    "This was a decent class, and by the end you learn some cool information about the history of finance. Goetzmann is a great lecturer but Hansen is mediocre. There are some overarching themes, but more focus on tons of details and specific examples. Probably interesting if you're into history and\/or finance.",
    "Probably not unless they restructure it some how. Hopefully they do those because the material was rather interesting.",
    "I would not recommend the course unless you need a GPA booster",
    "WorldFinancial History starts out seeming like a good class with an engaging and funny professor -- but do not be fooled. It quickly descends into one of the worst Yale classes. The sentiment was shared by many people in my section, and the whole class apparently, since lecture attendance dropped significantly after the first few weeks. The professors didn't seem to care about the students (only about presenting their research and their fields of interest), the class was extremely disorganized, grading was arbitrary, and the point of the class\/themes seemed to get lost. Assignments are extremely random -- the professors designed them and tried to be \"creative\", but the overall result ended up being confused students completing HS-like assignments, and getting random points taken off. There are better ways to get a Hu. Do not take this class. If you want to get a better grasp of finance, wait for some other course.",
    "The TFs make this class unnecessarily difficult. Don't take it if you are looking for a casual history class.",
    "Really interesting subject matter, wild and unpredictable course format, definitely take credit D.",
    "Informative, especially for a noobie to finance like me. I'm really glad I took it, because now my understanding of finance rests upon original foundations, which really helps me understands the concept that are in the works today and run so many aspects of society. I would recommend, but the class would be much better if taught only by Goetzmann.",
    "I would recommend it to a student with an interest in markets and possibly and entrepreneurial streak involving financial products."
