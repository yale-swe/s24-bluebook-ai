    "Really great course, no obvious weaknesses at all. Only suggestion is it could be fun to have a lesson one day on how to use the flat bed printer in the ccam.",
    "wish we he had more time in the studio.",
    "Alex is a great professor, the course was really focused on allowing each student to explore their own interests. The skills we learnt helped to generate an array of approaches to these individual explorations.",
    "This class was very fun and consisted mostly of studio time. I do wish there was a slightly tighter schedule. There could have been time for an additional smaller project. Also, the critiques took too long; they could have been timed better."

    "Yes - I loved this class! As a non art major it was an awesome chance to learn new skills and Alex is a really wonderful teacher who always makes time to meet with you and offer advice - you get exposure to a bunch of techniques (screen printing, some 3D sculpture work, risograph printing, litho ink, book binding, etc).",
    "this is a really great class, and alex rules. you definitely get out of it what you put into itand if youre willing to put in a lot of extra work outside of class time, you can do an incredible amount.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed it.",
    "This course is really fun! As a graphic design concentration, I really enjoyed learning about printmaking. Even though this class is labeled as Printmaking 2, most of my classmates had no prior printmaking experience. Additionally, since it is interdisciplinary, there are opportunities to bring in your own interests."
