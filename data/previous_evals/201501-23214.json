    "Not that this class will probably ever be offered again, but if it is you should take it. Worth it for the chance to commune with Tamar and Paul and hear their thoughts on a wide variety of habits-related topics (and try to express your own thoughts). Worth it for the readings, which were endlessly fascinating. Worth it for the chance to hear the amazing variety of speakers and then get to have dinner with them and ask them questions. This class could be frustrating at times (a lot of strong overachieving personalities in a very small room) but it was ultimately worth it.",
    "This course may never be taught again, but if it is, take it.",
    "this course was great! I loved the fact that the instructors really Helped us to forge a community. I also loved the guest speakers. It was a little disorganized at times, but all of the readings were very interesting.",
    "This course is likely not to be offered again, but if it is, there is EVERY good reason to take it. With an extremely selective admissions process, you're guaranteed to be surrounded by passionate students who really care about the subjects that are discussed. The topic in and of itself is extremely interesting, and it's academically so rewarding. It's a relatively low workload, with great reading and a final paper which forced us to flesh out a single idea thoroughly. The format of the class was great, and the guest speakers are once-in-a-lifetime experiences that cannot be paralleled by a single professor. I personally have found this class so rewarding, and everyone should have this experience.",
    "Incredible course and I am lucky to have taken it.",
    "Habits of Mind has been one of the best experiences of my undergraduate career. The course seamlessly merged psychology with philosophy, crossing boundaries between the sciences and the humanities. Paul is not only a giant in the field of psychology, but a devoted instructor who is committed to sharing his knowledge with his students. Paul is not afraid of pushing back on conventional ideas, truly pushing academic bounds. Tamar is simply incredible. She is both brilliant and caring, devoted as could be to teaching and to her students. Tamar forces you to consider the value in each idea, pulling apart concepts and driving down to their very core.",
    "Habits of Mind was the most rewarding and best class I've taken at Yale. The weekly reading plus the responses could be a lot of work (and honestly without putting in so much effort the class may have been less rewarding). Tamar and Paul are brilliant, had a great rapport, and always led interesting discussions-- they were very willing to push students on claims. If it, or something similar to it, is ever taught again, I would highly, highly recommend it.",
    "This was a fantastic course. Coming from a neuroscience background, it was often very abstract\/theoretical for me, but that was a great change and challenged me to think about cognition from a new perspective. Tamar Gendler and Paul Bloom are both incredible instructors and were really invested in the course. They brought in wonderful speakers who added a lot to the class (they were experts in specific topics like self-control, gesture, etc.) and designed a very thoughtful curriculum. Everything that we studied related back to the central theme of habits, and crucial questions included: where is the line between unconscious and conscious processing? How can we apply research and theory from philosophy and psychology in order to live more meaningful lives? I would definitely recommend this course if it's offered again.",
    "A seminar that meets every Monday. Will change your life. You will read many studies about many interesting things. Every single reading was relevant and on point. Although it meets once a week, you will be thinking about it every day. The guest lectures were also so spectacular. Seriously, every single guest lecture was so relevant and so well-spoken. I left each one wanting to ask questions for hours. I would entirely recommend this class. I can't objectively evaluate the workload of this class because I just enjoyed the work so much that I would take extra time doing it. If thats not a marker for a good class, then I don't know what is.",
    "The Shulman Seminar changes drastically from year to year, but given the experience I've had, I think I might take it again. If anything, it's a fun class to shop and a great lecture series.",
    "CGSC 403 is an incredible course that I would highly recommend. It is an in depth examination of many of the unconscious decision processes our brain uses. Essentially, it is a close study of Daniel Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 processes as outlined in Thinking Fast and Slow. It was an amazing class, and one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Truly fascinating."
