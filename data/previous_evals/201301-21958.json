   "comments": [
    "I would take it if you have any interest in European history",
    "Great lecture. A bit of a whirlwind if you have no background - the class is filled with buffs. Very interesting though, worth the early hour - a good one to Cr\/D.",
    "War in Germany is an interpretation of German history from Professor Adam Tooze's perspective from the Thirty Years War to present day. This is not an intro history class; you will get the most out of this class if you have knowledge of European history coming into it. Lectures are amazing. Tooze is a pleasure to listen to, and he makes even the drier parts of history come alive on the page.",
    "This is a good introductory course. I would take it if I were a freshman looking to major in history. If you comine it with Timothy Snyder's course and some sort of British history course you probably get most of 18-20th century Europe. As an upper classmen this is a fine course not as good as Snyder's.",
    "AMAZING CLASS. Among the top five courses i (a senior mbb major) have taken at Yale. Tooze is a complete genius and his lectures are always fascinating and cogent. It's helpful to have a decent background in modern (I.e., since 1600) European history. And there are no papers!!! Readings are interesting and not too long, and not necessary to do. Just lectures will get you through fine.",
    "Take this class. It's not much work but you reap great rewards. I was already thinking about majoring in history and this class made up my mind.",
    "Yes. Good class. Very interesting, and Prof. Tooze is very enthusiastic, which makes the lectures very enjoyable.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course! It is one of the best offered at Yale.",
    "Yes. I learned so much not just about Germany but about modern warfare and European history in general.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Be prepared for hitting the ground running in terms of the material covered. Not to be corny, but it truly is a Blitzkrieg of information (400 years of DENSE German history condensed into one semester!). That said, this is one of the more important history courses I've taken, simply because the material covered is incredibly significant to world history. I definitely learned a lot. Tooze is excellent and an expert in the field. Make sure to enroll in Jadwiga's section; she's honestly incredibly helpful as a TF. Also, the reading was mostly annoying; but be sure to skim through it each week, as it can only help. No papers, just a midterm and final, both of which are entirely reasonable. Take this course.",
    "Take it - it's a fantastic course.",
    "If you are interested in History, take this class.",
    "This course is literally amazing and I would recommend it to every student at Yale.",
    "War in Germany is a fantastic class, Prof. Tooze is a wonderful lecturer, and almost all of the readings are interesting and worthwhile. I strongly recommend it.",
    "HIST 231 is an extremely important class for students of European history and covers a fascinating topic of study for everyone else. I would certainly recommend that any Yale student take it.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. Just be sure that you like military history or German history, and know at least a bit about it. This isn't really an introductory course, and Tooze expects his students know important things about German history before lectures (and the readings don't include any basic facts and dates). That said, Jadwiga, aka the best TF ever, goes over everything we didn't cover in lecture in section. The readings are really interesting, too. I would easily take this class again if I could.",
    "Warin Germany is a great class, and Tooze is an excellent lecturer -- but if you want to get something out of it, be prepared to put in the time. The readings are long, and the class as I experienced it didn't provide much historical context for the analyses Tooze offered, which made it necessary to spend plenty of time on Wikipedia and perusing outside sources if you aren't a German military history buff. (A number of people have suggested he address this problem by offering more context in class and in the assigned readings, so you may not have this problem if you take the class in the future.) But overall, it's well worth it.",
    "I'd recommend this to history majors and non-history majors. Everyone can benefit from this class!",
    "Any lecture with Tooze is worth taking. This one is a pretty good, albeit ambitious, reflection on the broad themes of militarism, nationalism, and European history.",
    "Not a general history of Germany's wars, but a number of connected ideas, attitudes, and approaches to militarism from the 30 Years War to the Cold War.",
    "I would highly recommend War in Germany to anyone ever. It is an enlightening course with a nice work-load and you actually come out of the class feeling as if you have learned something. The lectures are taught well and the section supplements lecture quite nicely. It has been one of my favorite courses at Yale."
