    "A strength is that this course had a wonderful range of speakers, taken from pre-docs, post-docs and faculty. This meant the topics were diverse and fascinating. A slight problem for those who come from outside of the IR cohort is that the structure\/requirements are not made clear at all, and there are several occasions when the timings are changed which may result in not being able to attend. This is a shame for what is otherwise a compelling series of discussions.",
    "The International Relations workshop this semester had a good mix of speakers working on fascinating research topics. I thought the overlap of at least two sessions with ISS was particularly well thought out, and enjoyed both presentations given their security slant. I would like to see the workshop continue to aim for good balance of International Security, IO and IPE topics, and would also be curious to see more multi-method research design work being presented in IR (e.g., papers that use archival or interview-based research alongside statistical or experimental analysis)."
