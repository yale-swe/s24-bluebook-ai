    "This class is a content based Spanish course dedicated to Latin American politics and U.S. policy towards Latin American countries. It forces students to consider all the motives and facts behind policy decisions and government outlooks in Latin America, which is generally an area of the country that current U.S. foreign policy overlooks in favor of larger issues in the Middle East and Asia. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested - it is a lot of work and at times very challenging to speak so fluently in Spanish, but everyone finishes the semester with a broad range of information on Latin America and valuable comprehension and speaking practice in Spanish.",
    "Really enjoyed the class. Gives you the opportunity to improve your speaking and writing primarily. There are two 7-9 pp. papers and two debates\/simulaciones. The topics of this class are very relevant and interesting too. Prof. Carballal is also a great resource for first-hand experiences about historical events. She's also readily available for students to go to her for help. Definitely worthwhile.",
    "Two simulations and writing assignments and two papers are the only assignments for the course. Not much reading. Great course overall.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You don't have to have prior information about the topics discusses at all, just a willingness to do the readings (not very many) and to learn.",
    "This was a great course that taught exactly what the description said it would teach - the political history and current politics of various Latin American countries. The course did not do anything to improve the students' writing abilities, because the only writing that was submitted was graded without commentary to help the students progress their skills. The class did not improve speaking abilities as much as expected because the professor spent a great deal of each class meeting lecturing.Profesora Carballal was a very talented and knowledgeable professor. She was very opinionated, and so lectured a big part of each class meeting, and seemed to judge students' responses based on her opinions on the topic. However, she possessed and conveyed an immense amount of knowledge about international Latin American politics to the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is an extremely interesting, informative way to improve your Spanish. Great class with a reasonable amount of work.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in Latin American politics. It's a lot less learning about the subject, however, than it is discussion it in a more vague sense. I didn't learn as much specific information as I thought I would.",
    "Learn better conversational Spanish while talking about latin american governments! Pretty cool. The readings are a bit challenging at first, but you get used to them. The two 5-7 page essays are very doable, but take time. A great class if you want to improve your speaking skills while gaining a different polotical perspective on an often overlooked area of the world.",
    "So you're proficient enough in Spanish to be ready for an L5 course, and you're looking for something more interesting than Advanced Conversation. Do you enjoy debating politics? Do you want to change the world? Or maybe you just enjoy history? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then I highly recommend this course.",
    "Spanish 224 is a spanish class that develops reading, writing and speaking skills while introducing students to topics in Latin American politics. While there isn't enough time to go into depth with every country, the course covers a lot of important themes and looks more deeply at some countries. The course is based on varied and interesting reading assignments, and classes involve a lot of discussion. I would recommend it, it was interesting, not too much work, and had a lot of useful information.",
    "I am not a political science major and so I felt at a slight disadvantage throughout the course, as it was basically a political science survey course, but in Spanish. That being said, it was a good class to practice speaking (something that's hard to find in other L5 Spanish courses) and I really appreciated that there were small-group as well as class discussions.The class didn't have a whole lot of reading each day (though it is in Spanish and that level of reading\/vocabulary took some getting used to). The assignments were a few reading responses, two 5-page papers, and two in-class simulated-discussions. All in all, it's not too much work. If you're a PoliSci person looking for an L5 course, you'll probably really like it. Otherwise, shop it and see for yourself."
