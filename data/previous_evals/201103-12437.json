    "Yes, if you are interested in the books on the syllabus.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in the material or if you haven't read any\/much African American Literature. It isn't one of the best English classes I've taken, but that had more to do with the students who were in it than the class itself. I am glad that I took this class, but I would probably not take it again if there were a more exciting option out there.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's very relaxed, there are three 6-page papers and you just have to do enough reading to talk in class.",
    "This class is about early African American Literature and I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are really interested in slave narratives. This is what composes most of the syllabus, so you definitely want to have some sort of interest in that genre of literature.",
    "This class offers a tremendous amount of knowledge. I strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in the American Literature pre 1900.",
    "Professor Stepto is fantastic. It is difficult to find a professor who is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable but also makes the material remarkably accessible. He is always open to new and different approaches, and I was really impressed by the flexibility he welcomed with the open-ended paper topics. Professor Stepto brings such a unique perspective and energy to African American literature, helped by his extensive career in the field. Every class he brings additional material, such as other books or slides of paintings or photographs, which introduced interesting, new ways to think about the material. Additionally, the literature covered in the course should be fairly unfamiliar to most students, and I really appreciated the opportunity to read this material with such an excellent professor."
