    "You took L3, it's the same structure, same teachers, same everything. Tutorials get a little more intense and the listening sections start to pick up speed. Treat this like the 1.5 credits it is and put in your hours every day and you will have a much better experience than if you try and cram (which is, unfortunately for your learning, doable)",
    "Chinese 140 was a good continuation of Chinese 130. The teaching styles were exactly the same so one could adapt easily. I found that this course was a bit more challenging than 130 but with hardworking and effort, one could definitely see improvements in their language abilities. The instructors were all great and complemented each other well. I enjoyed learning from them and will miss them next year!",
    "Absolutely!! Chinese 140 is the best!! I love the teachers and the workload is predictable and manageable. I learned so much and it's a really fun class."
