    "Lots of work, lots of fun.",
    "This course is literally the most amazing class I have ever taken. The teachers are enthusiastic and helpful every day and make Chinese fun. The workload is kind of intense but you learn so much so fast and it's amazing. TAKE IT!",
    "It is a great class that goes by so quickly because the teachers are so enthusiastic. I would recommend it",
    "TAKE IT BUT PUT IN A LOT OF WORK FOR IT!",
    "Great class. All of the professors are extremely helpful and want you to do well. The class is organized in such a way that if you do the work that's assigned to you, you're guaranteed to learn a ton and receive a good grade. That said, the work load is significant and many people have taken chinese before. However, neither of those things should deter you from taking chinese. Yale has one of the strongest programs in the country, and you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to take spanish instead.",
    "I fully recommend this class to anyone remotely interested inlearning Chinese. The teachers are great and the textbook is a fun one to learn from. While this class is a decent amount of work (expect between 1-3 hours a night), I've learned so much in the first 3 months, that I feel that if I were dropped off in China right now, I would be able to survive.",
    "Chinese 110 is a fantastic intro Chinese course. You learn so much every day and it doesn't feel forced at all. The teachers are all fantastic. Daily drills in class helped me absorb the material so well that when it came time for tests, the only thing I had to review is how to write the characters.",
    "Would definitely recommend. I took chinese as an \"I ought to learn chinese\" situation, a means to an end, but I've gotten so caught up in the pleasure of speaking the language itself.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It's intensive, but by the end of the semester the amount of Chinese you know is incredible. Also, I took Chinese with Directed Studies and made it through the semester fine (it wasn't easy and a significant amount of DS reading was sacrificed, but it was manageable). If you're serious about wanting to learn Chinese, take this class, the amount of work is worth it."
