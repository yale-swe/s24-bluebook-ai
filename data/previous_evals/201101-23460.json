   "comments": [
    "The material seemed to be applicable to only EHS enthusiasts, but I think it has the potential to be broadened to interest other disciplines as well.Criticisms: No grade breakdown, no clear information about assignments (tests, quizzes, debates) made it extremely difficult to know what the instructors were looking for (and it was clear that they were looking for something specific!). All material was at least 10 years old, and while it might be still relevant, we might as well learn about the foundations\/steps of Risk Assessment in the context of issues that are definitely relevant today (that way we gain the foundation and some content knowledge). It seemed like the instructors didn't want to put in any additional work for assignments\/lectures so they used all material that has been used for a long time. Instructors were not responsible or very approachable. Also, I would definitely rather write a paper than do a debate.Strengths: Liked the structure of the course, with the terminology\/foundation making up the first lectures and then sample Risk Assessments for the last half.",
    "Risk assessment is an inherently dry subject so it is difficult to make recommendations.",
    "This course was not what I thought it was going to be. I would have preferred a more in-depth look at risk assessment.",
    "This class covers a lot of interesting information but it is tough. The information is explained well but there is SO MUCH information and it is EXTREMELY difficult to study for the tests. Certain concepts were covered extensively in class and were never covered on tests (threshold, non-threshold models) while some information that was briefly discussed (precautionary principle) were given great weight in the exam. The debate was a really interesting way to learn. The tests were difficult and seemed arbitrary.",
    "This class is poorly organized and poorly taught. The material itself is painfully dry, and the lecture format makes it even worse. The two quizzes are based entirely on memorization which is the way you would conduct a class for a 3rd grader, not a graduate student. The final exam was so different from the quizzes - it was very unexpected and as a result, very difficult. The two quizzes should have incorporated more conceptual and thought-based questions like the final did. The only classes that I felt were useful were the last three, which involved a considerable amount of class discussion. I don't learn anything from a class in which the professor just lectures for 2 hours from a powerpoint. I learned more in those last 3 classes than I did all semester. The debate was a very good exercise; however, it does not make sense to have a debate and then final exam immediately following. It leaves little time to study for the final. There should be one or the other, or they should be further spaced apart. The fact that it was a once-a-week 2 hour class made it all the worse. If the professor insists on a lecture format, it should at least be two days a week (for one hour each), so as to hold our attention. After the first hour, it is hard to pay attention to such dry material.",
    "The course teaches about the subjectivity of risk assessment. There is a debate at the end of the course to help students understand the complexity of the field, but the course overall doesn't help students assess risk on any level. The course emphasizes the importance of vocabulary, but does not do much to help students learn about risk assessment.",
    "Pretty good. A lot of redundancy but overall the course accomplished what the instructor said it would at the beginning of the year.",
    "For policy students this was a tricky course, some of which was probably to do with it being larger than planned, but not large enough to warrant TA support. I felt it was wrong to bill it as a conceptual and not quantitative course, because I don't see how you can firmly grasp all of the concepts without doing regular quantitative exercises. Nevertheless, without the TA support that a bigger class would have had, I also recognize that setting and marking quantitative homework would be difficult. The consequence - that we had to learn things by rote - seems to me to contradict the conceptual approach.This is not the only class I have attended which has been reluctant to challenge students' quantitative skills, yet I don't see how public health can be a non-quantitative discipline.The debates that were part of the course assessment were an excellent way to help the students focus on the substance of the course materials, and useful for developing groupwork and presentational skills",
    "The course was so technical sometimes that is was difficult for those unfamiliar with the topics to even begin to grasp the concepts. More simplified examples for non-EHS students would be appreciated. Quizzes often did not reflect the concepts that most class time was dedicated to.",
    "Strengths: lectures, debatesWeaknesses: no transparency in grading system",
    "Overall, good course. Very technical for non EHS kids however. The conceptual stuff at the end was very good and easily understood, however the beginning was challenging.",
    "The majority of the work and grades came at the end of the semester with little chance to apply the concepts and receive feedback early in the semester. I thought the material was interesting but would have appreciated a more interactive learning approach.",
    "The course could use more clear direction. The order of the lecture slides is confusing which makes the topics confusing because it is hard to follow.",
    "This class would benefit from a clearer structure. The expectations, particularly for the second quiz, were not well understood nor was the grading system. However, I would say the debate was a valuable experience, probably the most valuable part of the course. I think the class would benefit from working more with actual risk assessments and less on the material found in the beginning lectures. While I understand this material was intended as a foundation, it was difficult to absorb in a lecture format and might have been better suited to an early reading in the course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak tends to be extremely long-winded,egocentric and relatively irrelevant.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Jonathan truly cares about the education of his pupils. And while his stilted prose are sometime difficult to follow in a scientific context, it is a pleasure to learn from him.Cheryl is also phenomenal. She seems nervous while lecturing, but she shouldn't be: she is brilliant and wonderful at conveying her wisdom.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Prof. Borak was a good lecturer, however I thought that I didn't really grasp the concepts of the class by memorizing words.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Jonathan Borak - knowledgeable and a great lecturerCheryl Fields - interesting perspectives and helpful",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0He clearly knows his stuff. He's smart and he's a clear lecturer. However, the class should be a discussion format, no matter the size of the class. Otherwise, no one will get anything out of it. I've already forgotten almost everything I studied, despite the final being one week ago. Furthermore, he is not clear on assignments or about the quizzes\/final. He did not give us any information on the debate format\/expectations until a few days before and so I had to redo almost everything that I had worked on for a month. He did not tell us what the second quiz would cover, and no one knew what to study, and then he blamed the class for not memorizing his definition list. I will state again - a graduate student should not be forced to memorize five pages of definitions. That is ridiculous. If he wants us to learn that vocabulary, then we should discuss them in context or write relevant papers. Not sit and memorize. Finally, the final was so different from the in-class quizzes. We had done nothing similar during the semester, which made it all the more difficult. Cheryl tried to be helpful but she rarely knew what was going on. She would tell us things, and then later she would tell us that she had been wrong.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0It's clear that Dr. Borak does not enjoy teaching the course. He always seemed irritated when students asked questions in class and gave long winded answers that only seemed to confuse students further. As a result, the class was not enjoyable.He complained about the intelligence of students in his course rather than tried to understand why most of the class did not do well on a vocabulary quiz. He is not approachable as an instructor, and asking him to clarify material is like pulling teeth.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very knowledgable and certainly open to discussion and answering questions. I felt a bit lost on studying information from the slides at times. The glossary terms were not the problem here.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Considering what a dry subject risk assessment is, I thought the instructor brought the material to life with considerable success. I would have liked to have seen the course slides available sooner (I prefer to use them as the basis of my class notes), and the mysterious approach to evaluation was unusual to say the least - a practice exam or two would not have gone amiss and would have helped with revision.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Dr. Borak is clearly an expert in the field. At times though, it was difficult to dissect the technical language and content as this was my first time exposed to any sort of environmental course. As a core course requirement, it did not seem very \"basic.\"",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Jonathan Borak's lecture style and knowledge of risk assessment are both excellent but his refusal to incorporate any transparency into his grading system limits is frustrating.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Overall, good professor. This course would've have been better in the morning. Afternoon on Monday is a hard time of day for a 2 hr course with dense material. He lectures well, but it is hard to stay awake during that time of day.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Prof. Borak was extremely knowledgable and brought an interesting perspective to the material. I think he could have been more clear though and provided more opportunities for students to participate.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Better for tox than for risk. In risk, the material was not presented in a very clear manner.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0While the professor was more than willing to talk with students, but I think additional feedback to the class as a whole would have been tremendously helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend it to another student unless they were extremely interested in environmental health. You will spend most of your time trying to guess what the instructors are looking for (because they are not clear at all!) instead of actually learning the material.",
    "Somewhat interesting topic in general, although the strict content is pretty dry.Grades are extremely subjective and arbitrary so it is almost impossible to gage how well you are doing.",
    "Yes, but I warn them that this course is not in-depth, but merely an overview of the concept of risk assessment.",
    "Very interesting subject but just know everything in and out and frontwards and backwards",
    "I would definitely NOT recommend this course if it is not required. It is painful and I have not talked to anyone who enjoyed it or who would recommend the professor.",
    "The class should really be a seminar on risk assessment. The debate is a waste of time and it falls on the last day of reading week, so good luck getting studying for finals including the one for this course. Yes, the majority of your grade is determined by your performance at the end of the course.",
    "Great for EMD people. Tricky for non EMD people.",
    "For an environmental requirement, it was nice that it only met once a week but the content was so over my head that I actually think I may have been better off in the 3-day-a-week environmental course from first semester, though that got less-than-stellar reviews as well. Take your pick!",
    "I would not recommend this to most people. I think people who like debating and don't mind working through dense material will enjoy this course.",
    "I found aspects of the course interesting, but a good deal was ambiguous. The course focused on defining risk and the vocabulary used to talk about it. Unfortunately, we never practiced applying the vocabulary but were expected to use it fluently at the end of the semester.",
    "I would not recommend taking it. It is too time consuming for a graduating student and the objectives are not defined in a clear enough manner outside of learning the vocab words.",
    "This course was a introduction to the field of risk assessment with an emphasis on terminology and the meaning of what a risk assessment fundamentally is. This course does not focus on the practicing of risk assessment. I would recommend that a student learn about this area but not necessarily take the course as it is currently structured."
