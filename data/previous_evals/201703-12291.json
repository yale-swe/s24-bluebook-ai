    "My Spanish knowledge and confidence with using the language expanded somewhat, although I wish this knowledge were expanded to a greater extent considering that the requirements for both of majors render it impractical for me to complete L4 and L5 without spending fortunes in order to stay at Yale for an additional semester. Since much of the course was largely review of L2 (which was appreciated), I feel that it was in the course's capacity to expand its topical coverage into other areas of grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I learned how to read, write, and speak in Spanish. I hadn't taken Spanish since freshman year of high school and I was still able to come back and learn it all again.",
    "My prior knowledge of some of the grammar fundamentals was thoroughly revised. I also learned a great deal about some new tenses, and also was taught extensively about Spanish culture.",
    "Improved speaking and understanding of subjunctive",
    "I learned new grammar concepts (past tense, future tense, subjunctive, commands) as well as a number of new nouns and verbs. My speaking improved significantly throughout the course, and I gained a greater appreciation for Spanish culture.",
    "My Spanish speaking and writing skills improved drastically. The area that I most improved on was speaking while actually using the correct grammar.",
    "Helped me improve my grammar and confidence in speaking",
    "I am much more confident in my speaking and grammar abilities in the Spanish language. I can more confidently write a cohesive essay and also can converse with others in a more confident way."

    "The class was great for refreshing and expanding on my fluency in Spanish.",
    "One of the main strengths of the course was the fact that it required us to comprehend a variety of materials - books, videos, short-stories - and therefore equipped us with different skill-sets. There were no blatant weaknesses.",
    "A strength is the three essays that students are required to write. Additionally, the three exams, while rigorous, forced me to study hard and solidify my knowledge of the concepts discussed in class. I also enjoyed the daily music videos, the Spanish literature we read, and the various Spanish movies we watched. The instructor spent a lot of time in class reviewing the daily grammar concepts. Her presentations, while helpful, took time away from other activities. I would have liked a bit more time to put the grammar concepts into action, through worksheets or speaking activities. We only practiced having extended conversations with each other a few weeks before the end of the semester. I would have appreciated more opportunities to have extended conversations throughout the semester.",
    "Strength is that it helped improve skills tremendously but a con were the readings",
    "It would be helpful to be able to drill grammar rules in more engaging topics that will make it easier to see how to properly speak in conversation.",
    "The course is very European-centric, when Latin American focus would serve the students better, being more applicable."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. Although I took it for the language requirement, I still enjoyed the class and felt it was very useful in my ability to speak Spanish.",
    "Yes I most definitely would. The course explores and revises some of the fundamental grammatical concepts that are needed in order to succeed in the language.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are truly interested in improving their Spanish speaking and writing abilities. There is a steady stream of work each day and the exams are not a breeze. If you are looking for an easy language credit, this isn't the right course. If you are willing to put in the work, however, you will see considerable improvement in your abilities by the end of the semester.",
    "Yes. I have taken almost exactly the same class with the same textbook already in 10th grade of highschool and I got so much more from taking it again with a different approach.",
    "Yes. Even if youre not very strong in Spanish, the teachers are very helpful",
    "Absolutely, if you need to review verb tenses and want to work on your writing ability this is the first step class for you."
