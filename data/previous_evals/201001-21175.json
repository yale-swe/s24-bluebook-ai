    "This class is a broad overview of many important topics in particle physics. It does not help you learn any of the topics in any detail, but it does familiarize you with them.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, in the sense that this course lead to to the field of particle physics.",
    "Covers the the foundations of particle physics. Really useful for someone who is interested in getting a feel for particle physics without going through tons of nasty calculations and also for someone who is going to work in experimental particles.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone else- it's a perfect elective course, and the workload was enough to have you learn something while not so much that it's like another core course.",
    "taught more of several small topics than overall arching topic",
    "Yes , I would recommend it. It is a course that is useful for many sub fields in physics. It should be offered more often, I hope every academic year.",
    "A good class to learn about particles, with realistic expectations in terms of work load.",
    "Definitely would recommend it."

    "This class gave me the first taste of several subjects I will need to understand for my research. It is the only class (out of 7) that I have taken this year that directly applies to my research.",
    "This course taught me many aspects of particle physics to some extent that are useful in my research.",
    "Relevant to research - background and techniques",
    "The class was relevant to my dissertation research- I'm really glad I took it!",
    "It gave some good insight into things that are important to know but not necessarily taught in other courses.",
    "This course was crucial to my studies, and I think it should be offered every academic year. There is much to learn from this class! Every single lecture was packed with directly useful information.",
    "This class was good at emphasizing the important points that a particle experimentalist will have to know. At least, that's what Paul told me. Ask me in 4 years.",
    "I think it will be helpful."
