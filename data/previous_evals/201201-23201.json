   "comments": [
    "The course introduces one to several fields of thermodynamics, but in very limited manner. While it may help gaining a bird's eye view of different segments (like irreversible, bulk, interfacial thermodynamics, etc.), you might want to do additional reading to get the maximum benefit out of the course. The assignments, though simple but at times lengthy, make for great learning experience if supplemented by reading from the references. A typical engineering course, but there's interesting science to learn too if one can go that extra mile!",
    "I would recommend this class to students only if they think it would be useful to their research. There are plenty of topics covered in the labs that do not require thermodynamics, but it can be helpful to many students...",
    "Useful lecture. I would recommend classical and statistical thermodynamics to other chemical engineering student. This is the basic course for other further study on specific courses.",
    "A must take core class!",
    "Yes. It is helpful for chemical engineering students.",
    "This course is very good and I will strongly recommend it to other students. The course is well organized and each topic is fully developed. People can learn a lot from it.",
    "It was a challenging course. If you learn well by carrying out mathematical deviations, this is an excellent course.",
    "It covers some basics of classical and statistical thermodynamics.Yes.It helps us build the foundation for our further research"

    "Served as an introductory course towards using thermodynamic analysis for applied research.",
    "I had my thermodynamics knowledge brought to an introductory graduate level. I think the material will end up being useful for my dissertation.",
    "The course gives basic knowledge for further study.",
    "Great to acquire fundemental principles.",
    "This course is essential for our chemical engineering students",
    "The course helps build a more solid backgroud in physical chemistry. It also introduces climate change, thin films, interfacial and statistical thermodynamics and deepens my knowledge of these areas",
    "The statistical thermodynamics section seemed relevant to my research.",
    "It helps me better understand some physics and will be conducive for my further study."
