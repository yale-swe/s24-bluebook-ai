   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend if you are at all interested in race policy (affirmative action) and inequality. Shows importance of having perspectives beyond race relations in the US",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I had no previous knowledge of the content and found it really fascinating to learn about. Professor Seekings teaches part time in South Africa and thus has first-hand experience with the topics we discuss. A good amount of reading, but does not need to be read in great detail. Class was always interesting. The two term papers were a bit intimidating, but graded very fairly and very helpful ways to organize all that we'd learned in class.",
    "Go ahead and take it if you've ever wondered about how race and policy plays out in other countries. This course will really improve your analytical skills and make you think beyond your own frameworks.",
    "If you are interested in welfare policies, race, affirmative action, poverty, then you will enjoy this class. The readings are interesting and the professor is great.",
    "Pretty good class. Not too much reading, not too hard of a grader, and pretty interesting class. The readings are really thought-provoking, although class discussion can be a bit boring at times. Not the right class to take if you want to think about race and class in th US, it's heavily focused ok South Africa and Brazil.",
    "I recommend this course for anyone interested in understanding race conceptions and social relations in the U.S. and abroad. This was a very engaging course with highly relevant and engrossing material."
