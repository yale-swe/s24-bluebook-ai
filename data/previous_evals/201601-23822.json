    "Math 665 is a good class not so much because of the material but because of having to learn how to present it. Each student gives 2 lectures and has to do a writeup on them. Sam and Dave are demanding but this results in higher quality work and a better understanding of the material. Be prepared to work in this class. On the whole it was rather good."
