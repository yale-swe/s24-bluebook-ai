   "comments": [
    "I would summarize Spanish 140 03 as a good continuation of SPanish education. If you really want to take take your spanish speaking and writing skills to the next level then this class really should be taken. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because of how interesting and useful it has been.",
    "The professor was absolutely wonderful! The material was ehh, and the stories not too interesting, but the conversation was great. I feel it really helped with my confidence in speaking. TAKE IT WITH MERCEDES CARRERAS. Mercedes was absolutely delightful! She really knew her stuff and as she barely spoke english, forced us to really improve our Spanish. She was very fair, and made me want to go to class every morning. No weaknesses!",
    "Span 140 is your typical L4 Spanish class. It builds nicely from L3, and the material is presented in a way that draws on concepts that you've already learned. The workload isn't too bad if you stay on top of it, and the supplemental readings are actually really enjoyable, a fairly unusual thing for a language class. If you can, try to get into Prof. Carreras' section. She's awesome, and does a great job of helping you out with the material throughout the class. If you need to finish up your Spanish, or want one more course before L5, then definitely take it.",
    "If you can get into Carreras' class, take it. It's really easy and she's a lot of fun. She makes sure everyone does well in her class, so even if you're a little hesitant about taking L4 she'll definitely make this class worth it.",
    "If you want to learn Spanish, I suggest going to another section. Prof Carreras was very sweet and funny and encouraging, but she pretty much gave everyone 95s or higher on all the tests, giving us very little incentive to study. Our class discussions were quite boring and usually of the question-answer format, giving us very little practice with natural dialogue.",
    "If you need to take L4 Spanish, TAKE THIS CLASS WITH MERCEDES CARRERAS. She loves her students and will make you enjoy the class. Aside from the teacher, L4 is just a basic grammar\/vocab focused spanish class with some reading\/video enrichment.",
    "Take this class with Professor Carreras, it's the most fun I've ever had learning Spanish and I feel like I learned a ton. Seriously, taking it with any other professor would be a mistake-- try to get into her section!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 140 to another student. The course load is light and you get to practice your Spanish everyday in class.",
    "With Mercedes, yes!",
    "I would recommend Spanish L4 with Professor Carreras. The material is composed of some higher level, but not too difficult grammatical constructions, paired with readings and activities. I would definitely recommend Professor Carreras, as well. I think everyone in my class really enjoyed having her.",
    "YES! TAKE IT WITH CARRERAS! Seriously, though, take it with Carreras. Change your schedule. Do whatever it takes. Take it with Carreras. You will not regret it."
