   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course if the student is passionate about East Asian Studies!",
    "DEFINITELY.It was a great class, that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in East Asian culture in general. There were many students who weren't necessarily East Asian Studies majors, which made it less intimidating. There are a lot of readings but half of them are supernatural tales (translated from Japanese or Chinese), so it's very enjoyable. The articles (secondary literature) can be a little long and dense, but they are very interesting in terms of interpreting the stories that you read.",
    "I would recommend it to a student interested in the topic or interested in learning more about japanese\/chinese culture.",
    "this was the coolest class ever, the readings were wonderful--take it if you will really put the work in it that it deserves",
    "Fantastic Tales in China and Japan covers classical supernatural tales and their place within the broader Chinese and Japanese cultures, focusing mostly on the 16th-18th centuries with some forays into earlier and later periods. This course is a serious literature seminar, so expect a lot of reading (150-200 pages\/week) and weekly disucssions that go quite deep into the readings. Experienced humanities majors may find this course pretty standard, but science and social science majors who get into the course should prepare for a different way of thinking and writing. However, that doesn't mean that science majors should avoid this course - I'm a science major and I had a great time learning about ghost, fox, and serpent spirits. If you've got an open spot in your schedule, aren't too averse to writing reading responses and papers, and enjoy folklore, you'll probably find this course quite fun.",
    "This class is about Chinese and Japanese 19th century ghost stories. Which is awesome, but also involved a lot of background reading on religion and funereal traditions that got pretty dry at some points. Professor Joo is a really wonderful person who has clearly put a lot of thought into the syllabus, and who is incredibly helpful in writing comments on student work and meeting with students. If you're willing to do a lot of reading\/skimming, this is a very cool class on an obscure-but-interesting topic."
