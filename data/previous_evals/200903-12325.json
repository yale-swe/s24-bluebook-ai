    "This course is difinitively strange, but really cool. The traditional class sections are a little weak--lectures are pretty boring, and readings definitely don't crop up in class or assignments--but the crazy unique parts make up for it. There are \"field trips\" to the library printing press and the art gallery, guest lectures by artist\/musicians, and opportunities to handle Medieval scores and the newest notation technology. The class is barely any work, but you have to be willing to commit to some pretty strange modes of creativity, which can make you find yourself working long hours on weird notation projects. If you can sit through the weirdness and some boring lectures, the new way of thinking and unique opportunites are totally worth it."
