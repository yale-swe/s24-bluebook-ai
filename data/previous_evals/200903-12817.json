   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely take this class! Mme Charney, while a bit eccentric, is fun, full of energy and will definitely make you smile during class. Novels, plays, and films balance out the grammar and speaking aspects of the course. The workload can be pretty heavy at times, though, and I didn't do as much speaking in class a I would have expected for a \"conversation\" course. Nevertheless, a fun class and good for those who received a five on their AP exams in high school.",
    "I would recommend French 150 to another student. It's a great way to complete your language requirement. Perhaps a little slow\/easy\/boring if you took AP french senior year. I took it junior year, so I appreciated the grammar review offered in 150.",
    "Great way to maintain French. If you want to challenge yourself and force yourself to speak more fluently, take a higher level course.",
    "I would recommend French 150 as a way to fulfill the language requirement, but I might not recommend it as a way to improve French in general. It was a lot of work.",
    "Unless you plan to take literature classes later or are just trying to fulfill a language requirement, this class is not very interesting or informative, especially if you have already had AP French.",
    "If you have taken other French classes at Yale, you might find some of the films and literature for this course disappointing(compared to French 130etc). However, your grammar and speaking will improve and if you want to get better at French you don't have much of another choice.",
    "Recommend for anyone wishing to pursue French language studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 150 to another student. It was a useful review of French grammar concepts, paired at the same time with French film and literature which were both very interesting. The class moved at a nice pace, and the sections of 150 were small so you got to know the other students in your class. From what I saw, all of the teachers were very skilled at conveying the concepts learned in class in interesting and learnable ways.",
    "Madame Charney is really nice and flexible, so although the syllabus is at times demanding, this section is not that challenging. The laid back atmosphere made bonding as a class easy and the overall experience positive, but people seeking a rigorous, challenging section should probably try another one."
