    "The text book was useless. The final project was beyond useless. It was clearly something that directly benefits the Pace Center with no benefit to the students. We're basically creating a resource for our professor to use at his day job, while learning nothing in the process. I am actually one of the few students interested in planning \/ urban design and I am incredibly disappointed in this class. I'm going to be bold and say this is THE worst class I've taken at F&ES. It builds off of nothing. It leads to nothing. It's a complete waste of time. Words cannot adequately express how disappointing this class has been.",
    "Question 9b: It would have been useful if transportation had been provided for the field trip to New York City.",
    "Q8: Perhaps because of the size of the class or the configuration of the room (G01), this class just plain missed the mark. It should be broken up into a more frequent\/shorter class so as to avoid being lectured at for 3 hours a week with minimal input\/discussion from the class. It felt like a real missed opportunity, given the experience of the students IN the class -- it went largely ignored, and we had very repetitive presentations from guest speakers who felt it necessary to define very basic concepts (like greenhouse gas emissions, sea level rise, climate change and LEED ratings) repeatedly and for the first hour of their presentations. At times, it was almost insulting to our intelligence\/the fact that this was a graduate level course.",
    "Question 9: I think more emphasis could have been placed on field trips to planning or community meetings rather than site visits.",
    "The readings were very good. Unfortunately I didn't do a lot of them. It would have been good to have more discussions around the readings. The final paper was a good exercise, though the groups were divided unevenly so that some groups had 5 people while others only had 1 or 2.The field trip to Griswald was not good. The people were more than 1\/2 hour late and we were standing around in the snow with nothing to do. I caught a cold from that exercise and was sick for a week.",
    "important to incorporate more critical approach to what is going on in the field of land use planning. more about the history and what other approaches may be. potential to incorporate more about the academic perspectives",
    "Regarding question 9 (b) I think that the field trips were a positive part of the class but greater emphasis should be put on attending a land use planning related city meeting. I attended one near the end of the course and it helped clarify and put in context part of the process that we had been learning about all semester. I think that if this was required earlier and maybe included in class discussion one session we can have clearer ideas about how plans are approved and how to guide positive environmental change in this respect.",
    "I enjoyed going on the field trip to the airport that was purchased by the city of Madison. I thought the issues involved in that acquisition were very enlightening.",
    "Question 10: This class was like many at FES, a bit too advanced for a complete beginner and a bit repetative for someone in the field. This was definitely not from the lack of the professor trying to make it fit....but really an intro and an advanced class would serve FES better and is a path that the administration should go for in the future.",
    "This is an important course to have at FES, as the planning profession is tied to environmental management. FES needs more planning courses...especially those related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.",
    "1.&4. The textbook, Kelly\u0092s \u0093Community Planning\u0094 was great. Many of the articles and other readings was not so good. There is a great book, called \u0093Growing Cooler: The Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change\u0094 which had been assigned too. The work would have been as much or more than other classes if I (or anyone else) did the work. But no one did; this relates to the issue about the quality of the readings.7.&8. The TA was great, but worked WAY too hard for too little pay.9. Field Trips:The two provided field trips\u0097to the Griswold Airport Site in Madison, CT and the High Line in NYC\u0097were useless. Students were given the option of substituting going to a city planning meeting for one of these. I did this, and it was much better, but I regretted only doing it so late in the semester. In class, we were always talking about planning meetings in the hypothetical. Attending a city planning meeting should be a required field trip within the first half of the course! The professor\/TA should provide a list of options, and people should have to choose one. It would greatly help illuminate the course. Ideally, people should go to meetings that will be dealing with contentious issues. It\u0092s hard to know that in advance, of course.After the field trips, we had to write up a report. But the due dates for these were ambiguous and most students turned them in late. Students should aim to turn in your field trip within 2 weeks of doing the field trip; I put it off and then had to struggle to remember the details from the trip."

    "The fact that the work load was minimal might be a positive aspect to this class.",
    "This is one of only a few courses in the country that deals with land use planning, environmental science, and land use law. It was great to approach each topic from all 3 perspectives.",
    "The textbook--though never once referenced in class--was great. Access to Prof. Nolon's articles and the PACE resources were also helpful for my other research\/class work.",
    "It was VERY practical and relevant.",
    "Occasionally very interesting guest speakers. Solid introduction to planning issues and some innovative solutions.",
    "Excellent topic, some really strong visiting instructors, very interesting student output.",
    "The emphasis on policy. Getting to see some examples of land use practice and hearing from professionals in the field.",
    "the practicality of the class learning about the ways these laws work and who determines them etc.",
    "Great visitors - superb insights to different topics. Professor Nolon created a good framework within which the guest lecturers fit nicely.",
    "The course could be a good introduction to those not as practiced in urban land use or urban planning.I also specifically enjoyed the conversation with Rob Lane. He was engaging, smart, and had a good presentation whereby we could comment and work on some hypothetical scenarios. The class seemed to get into the lecture a bit more. His presentation should definitely be one that's kept in the fold.",
    "Exposure to various land use planning and sustainable development strategies, using many practical case studies.",
    "The best things about this course were the frequent in class visitors. I was very impressed with the wide variety and quality of people that Professor Nolon brought into speak to the class and I really enjoyed this collection of opinions and innovative ways about land use planning.",
    "If you know nothing about land use planning, it's an opportunity to get a basic understanding",
    "Not sure.",
    "Professor Nolon brought in lots of speakers that were experts in there fields. I also found Professor Nolon's dedication to the topic very contagious.",
    "Field Trips- very informative and great to have access to real planners in the field.",
    "The variety of materials used for the assigned readings made the preparations for each week's class interesting and different. The guest speakers were also a great way to have subject matter presented and expounded upon.",
    "guest lecturers are great to allow interaction with professionals in the field; the question and answer sessions with these folks was very interesting;very straightforward descriptions of the pathway of land use planning by the professor and his continual push to engage us in the conversation.the griswald fieldtrip was great because we got so many viewpoints on a single project....you could very clearly see all the of the different angles each person was coming at the project which was much more informative than having one viewpoint speak....",
    "- Some of the invited guests were outstanding- Research opportunity on up-to-date information on a specific land use planning subject of interest- Great readings- Field trips were helpful and fun",
    "-The topic is very important.-Nolon brought in lots of real-word professionals, who had interesting insights. Nolon is also very experienced and knowledgeable.-The papers we had to do, while overly structured (more on that below) were not just academic exercises.; they will be used by the Land Use Law Center to provide real advice to policy-makers. I also liked that we had to conduct interviews for the papers; I learned far more that way than I would have from just reading, and if it hadn\u0092t been required, I might not have made those phone calls."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "Get rid of this class.",
    "Some of the lectures were a bit repetitive. It would be more engaging if each lecture tackled a more specific topic.",
    "If teaching this class again, there MUST be a way to engage students more directly and meaningfully. I suggest requiring pre-requisites and keeping enrollment smaller -- that way the very, very basic definition of concepts could be skipped and more advanced discussion could take place.",
    "It should be split into one-hour, twice a week classes. Three hours is just too long.",
    "expanding the material outside of the new york metropolitan region... many of us are not working in this area and do not plan to work here - I would be interested in hearing how other parts of the country and other places in the world are dealing with these issues...also there was too much overlap week to week in the speakers. If I had to hear another speech about how sprawl was contributing to climate change and environmental degradation I was going to scream.. most of us have been hearing that since 2004. That's why we were in the class to get after solutions.",
    "Too repetitive, weak and boring classroom lectures too frequently. Could on the one hand foster more class-room discussion. Lectures, on the other hand, could be mad more narrative. I think a few short writing assignments or problems sets could have added value (if intelligently put together)",
    "While the the concept of bringing in professionals from the field is a good one, it made for a rather inconsistent class. Some speakers were good while others were not. My favorite ones were the Manhattan one (class 3?) and the Ann Arbor one. My least favorite was the one where the guy was trying to sell us a combined heat and electricity generator. Speakers often repeat basic information that we already know. I think a better class would be more lectures and discussion around the reading, with maybe 3 visits from professionals to showcase some current projects.",
    "there needs to be more information presented in class. this could be done in the form of student presentations too if need be.",
    "Some of the readings were lengthy for relatively little (or light) content. At the beginning, some of the essentials relating to climate change were repeated too many times.",
    "The course was too much of a review if you had taken Daniel Hernandez (via Brad Gentry)&the 1-credit Land Use Seminar course.The final paper was not exciting. We were working on topics to help the Pace Land Use Law Center, however I think we would all have preferred a more creative, intellectual, and personal project in the end.I think that we should be required to build a comprehensive plan for a hypothetical city (or a hypothetical plan for a real city). Each week, teams could work on certain issues of the plan that were discussed and a cursory document could be created at the end of the class.Also - more relevant assignments to what we were learning in class were needed. There was work for the course, however again, it never felt personal or as related to the in class lectures as it should have been.Lastly, the course structure made it hard to follow. The once-a-week lectures were muddled after a few weeks had passed. The class would be better if split into 2 classes per week (perhaps 1 day with Prof. Nolon, and a guest speaker the next). This, plus smaller but more homework assignments that pertained to the weekly discussions would help the info fuse better in our minds I think. In general, the material is simply dry (land use law is notbear-management, gaussian plume modeling, or urban ecological experimentation), so there needs to be more emphasis on the structure and how to keep each lecture exciting and engaging.",
    "I would have liked to hear Professor Nolon lecture more in his areas of expertise, rather than having guest speakers dominate the discussion every week. A teaching of land use fundamentals would have been beneficial as well, instead of a series of case studies.",
    "I would encourage greater clarity and depth in presentation of the subject matter, using more frequent examples in class to support this exploration of innovative ideas, but also including standard practices that are outdated so that we can think of ways to develop upon these. I also think that the student research should have a midterm component of presenting to the entire group to foster greater discussion and development.",
    "The speakers were repetitive, and many gave presentations that seemed intended for an audience that knew nothing about climate change. Too many of the presentations were boring.",
    "The lectures were very slow and repetitive, especially for a three hour class. The idea of guest speakers every class is great, but there is too much repetition of basic information each time. Need to be better catered to the audience.The class was always addressed as if we were in a professional land use lawyer program, however this was a mixed interest class and should have been taught as such.",
    "Although the guest speakers were great, I thought that we could have used less of them and more of the experienced hand of Professor Nolon. He is a great lecturer and the other people who he brought in varied in their skill.",
    "Cohesiveness between speakers and lecturers.",
    "It would be useful to have a more detailed explanation of the specific law processes behind land use planning.",
    "3 hour lecture style course was very difficult with this subject matter; This class would be great taught in an 1 or 1 1\/2 hour chunks, perhaps with a guest speak one day and Nolon the other;Going to a planning meeting as a class and discussing it would be great to make sure everyone is on the same page (again, with the beginnger and advanced discussion, some people had been to MANY planning meetings and others none....)I greatly enjoyed the juxtaposition of viewpoints from the speakers on the griswald field trip....I think that the guest speakers could be enhanced by having two or more different viewpoints speak on the same project so that we see the project from many angles (this could happen on different days so that we can see what the developer and the planner and the land conservationist and the scientist would all say without the other groups in the room).....that really lets you see the process from all sides. With only one person talking to you, the vision that they present always seems like the most logical because they make it seem like theonly answer....other viewpoints would be interesting.",
    "- A lot of speakers started with the same repetitive information about climate change (I would ask them to focus on specific topic of interest for class date)- Readings were very informative and helpful but most of these were not discussed in class, so sometimes we did not feel inclined to complete all class readings. I would recommend to implement a mechanism to promote class discussion on assigned weekly readings.",
    "-Nolon\u0092s lectures were slow, boring, and repetitive one week to another. This caused many students to get bored and goof off on their computers instead of listening. For many of us, the lectures were boring in part because we knew some of the material already. But I talked to a first-year who didn\u0092t, and she said that she knew that she didn\u0092t know most of the material, but still ended up not paying attention because of the bored atmosphere generated by all her classmates.-There was not nearly enough discussion! Three hours in lecture straight is TOO long. The class should have 1 hour at least dedicated to discussion. Alternately, since most classes had one-half Nolon lecturing, and one-half guest lecture, the class should meet twice a week, with those two lectures on different days. This latter option is difficult for a professor who is traveling from Pace Law, which may be another argument for a more local professor.-The guest lectures varied tremendously! Some were good, but many others were not useful at all.-The paper was overly structured. We were told how the paper should be structured (the names, content, and order of the sections), and what it should cover, and who (in group projects) should work on which sections.-The class was too big. The syllabus said they would limit the enrollment to 30 with applications. They decided not to do this. I wish they had; the class would have been much better.-The breakdown of the grade between various components should be made crystal clear."

The course is about local-level land use policy, but these policies are critical even if you are interested in looking at the state or federal level.

But I knew something about many of the techniques described already. Maybe there are just not that many.I also think land use is defined way too narrowly in the class. For example: one of the biggest land use-climate links in vehicle traffic, and the increase in vehicle miles traveled. But our discussion of transportation focused almost exclusively on zoning rules like Transit-Oriented Development. But what about highway development? High-speed rail tracks? The rules for sitting of long distances of rail tracks or high-voltage power lines? These are all land use issues. I think these were excluded because of the local-level focus. The course focused entirely on how local planning and zoning boards govern land use, ignoring and dismissing most of those areas where state and federal control is both dominating and critically important (disaster management being the exception). This narrow thinking continued to the conceptualization of the assigned paper topics, with limitations over what we should and should not be considering."

   "comments": [
    "Nice to learn from each other as we all had different backgrounds and strengths to bring to the project.",
    "For me, group work was helpful in this course especially on an issue that the Land Use Law center had not explored previously. I think that it helped us explore a range of projects deeper and share what we were finding. We probably could have achieved a similar end with three and possibly some projects could with two - but it was helpful to have that internal feedback and structure within a project.",
    "I thought our group would run smoothly, but sometimes we did not communicate very well. We ended up producing a fine product, but it could have worked better. Our roles were not well defined and that hurt us. We did pull through, but I think it was a bit more stressful than I would have liked.",
    "Different perspectives, splitting up of the work, good coordination.",
    "The project was made less unwieldy by having a partner to grapple over the topic with. I liked that there were some joint and some separate parts of the paper!",
    "The main disadvantage of the group work was that the group selection was not voluntary. In such situations, it is often the unfortunate case that group members end up with unaligned goals.",
    "The project topics were assigned (based on a list of interests). Some people got to work independently if they were the only person on that topic. You had no choice as to whether you worked in a group or independently, and some of the group-pairing were sub-optimal.The way \u0093group work\u0094 was framed in this course was very strange. We were expected to work in pairs\/teams, but much of our research was supposed to be independent. We each had to turn in our own paper, with the first few sections written together, and the final few written completely independently. Yet this was not made clear; my partner and I were very confused about this until only a week before it was due. We ended up going in different directions, and so even those sections we worked on together ended up different in the two papers. This structure meant that it was a lot more work for the group paper than it would have been if we had each done our own. My partner did less work than I did, too. In short, I think the group work added nothing except more writing, and more editing, and more pain."

   "comments": [
    "Drop it before it's too late. Dropping this class will be the best decision you'll make at F&ES. By the way, is this advice ever actually given to students? How do we access the text responses in these evaluations?",
    "Try to develop a term paper subject that you find interesting. If you enjoy your term paper subject, you'll get much more out of the course.",
    "I would really encourage the faculty to reorganize this class so as to appeal to advanced students -- otherwise, I'd say only beginners take this course.",
    "If you're interested in practical, realistic course work that gets into the nitty gritty on how cities and towns can improve their environmental performance through zoning, legislation and resolutions, you should take this course.",
    "It is really helpful to have taken or take at the same time Environmental Law and Policy.",
    "If you're interested but havelittle experience in the field of planning - take it. If you already have experience or have taken the 1-credit planning seminar, I'd skip it.",
    "Read the textbook and understand that this class is based on a series of case studies.",
    "I biggest advice that I would give future students is to make sure you at least quickly read the articles every week and the background of every visitor. They were very helpful to provide a foundation for the lectures and for having questions ready.",
    "Make sure your final paper is on a topic you're really interested in.",
    "If you are strictly interested in procedural land use law, take this course.",
    "I would advise them that Professor Nolon is one of the greats in land use planning and they can learn a lot from him.",
    "do the readings",
    "Make sure to request that this course subject is maintained at the FES curriculum, as the planning profession is tied to environmental management. FES needs more planning courses...especially those related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.Recommend that the course not only focus on weekly presenters, but it also dives into in-depth land use planning subjects. Promote mechanisms to stress the discussion of class readings, as the course provides some excellent selections.",
    "In the event that this class is offered in the same semester or year as the \u0093Seminar on Land Use Planning&Practice,\u0094 don\u0092t take both."
