   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The material and the class notes are excellent. The assignment and exam schedule is consistent, which is the model that should be adopted for other core courses. However, attending lecture was not necessary. Very little new information was discussed in lecture that was not in the class notes.",
    "Good intro to the fundamentals of public health research. Helps look at research and public health issues in a scientific, quantifiable way which is a great skill.",
    "Great course.",
    "I loved this course. It is a lot of work, but you really learn the important components of epidemiology.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The objectives and expectations were clearly laid out, and classes were very helpful.",
    "Wonderful! Very challenging, but very rewarding once you figure concepts out.Strengths: you are truly taught the fundamental concepts of epi...actually you teach them to yourself, but Dr. Dubrow supplements very well.",
    "really good introduction to epi.",
    "The course was fantastic. It was challenging for me, and the tests were difficult, however I learned a lot.",
    "Strengths:1) The instructor and TAs were amazing2) Use of case studies3) Homework assignments covered important principles and nicely supplemented lecture4) Fair grading and evaluationWeaknesses:1) I know this is a survey course, but some more analytical details in confounding controlling would have been interesting.2) More advanced methods overall would have been interesting to explore.",
    "Course was a lot of information, if you have never seen this before it's a lot to digest.",
    "The strengths of the course were the class notes, articles, and homework assignments. There was no formal textbook for the course, however the Class Notes served as an equivalent. The Class Notes were extremely well-written and thorough. I thought the integration of research articles into the text was well done. In addition to the class materials, the lectures and lecture slides were also great. Professor Dubrow did a great job presenting the class material.No weaknesses to report about the course.",
    "The course very good because Dr. Dubrow is talented in teaching.",
    "This is by far the most well-designed course I have ever taken (in my 5 years) at Yale. If every class were taught this well, I would have such a better grasp on every aspect of public health.First, the textbook or \"course notes.\" These are amazing. It is very clear, very concise, very relevant text with clear definitions, clear explanations, and perfect examples to understand each concept. This is a resource that I will keep in my future career as a reference. Very impressive text. My only qualm is that I wish it were available in a hardback cover.Second, the course design. The homeworks are very helpful and while they were admittedly annoying to do every week they made sure you kept up with the class which in the end was very helpful. Quizzes and tests also came at appropriate times within the course and were extremely fair. I left those tests (which were a little long but rightfully so) feeling really good that I could confidently answer questions about really pertinent information regarding Epidemiology. The answers I missed were always from my lack of understanding or overlooking something in the next and never due to poor wording or lack of coverage on concepts.Third, Dr.Dubrow. He's an incredible teacher though he's probably not the most charasmatic person I've ever met. Classes are very well structured, the slides are wonderful, but lecture would be slightly boring sometimes. Especially when I could go home and read the excellent text, there was less incentive to show up to class. He tried to get audience interaction a few times but ultimately no one ever got to feeling really comfortable about talking in class or answering questions. I realize that we're not the most outgoing bunch of students and it is hard to set a really interactive dynamic but that would enhance class somewhat (especially when Dr. Dubrow asks samples questions in class).",
    "I really enjoyed the class and I learned a lot. I really like that the homeowrk was pass\/fail. It made it low pressure but I still had incentive to work hard on it. I also got a lot out of section.",
    "I learned a lot during this course - both facts and concepts.The professor was clear, helpful, and available weekly to answer students' questions. The readings were very applicable to the lectures, and the exams were very relevant to the materials and fairly graded.",
    "great",
    "Fundamental concepts for public health, very useful. Carefully selected cases and organized course structure and slides.",
    "Strengths: Good use of classesv2 to upload all course resources, weekly assignments and monthly quizzes\/tests ensured I kept up with course material, abundant amount of TA\/Instructor office hours.Weaknesses: Often unable to cover all lectures slides each class and had to finish remaining slides next class. Somewhat disjointed and difficult to get 'train of thought' back.",
    "Strengths: Very important subject. The Class Notes were very detailed and informative.Weakness: I had a hard time figuring out the the overall picture of the ideas in Epi I. It was so much information that I didn't know what were the most important concepts I needed to grasp. There were too many case studies to keep track of.",
    "It is ok",
    "The class was a great overview to the different types of epidemiological studies and how to analyze data. The class went very in depth in examples (perhaps a bit too far in depth), but every concept was shown through both the theoretical lens and the practical lens. There was a lot of information covered in a short time span, but the class was fairly manageable despite the workload.",
    "Boring, but useful.",
    "Weaknesses: Grading scale is a bit extreme. Miss three multiple choice and you have an 88. Questions are designed to confuse you rather than test your understanding of the material. I recommend not READING WORD FOR WORD slides in class...it is a bit insulting. Get rid of discussion. Giant waste of time. If someone has a question, they can go to office hours and and not waste fifteen minutes arguing a trivial point with the TA when all the rest of the group sits there in agony. Rather than discussion, have another day of lecture for those who enjoy having slides read to them like mindless idiot zombies.",
    "This class was incredible. It was a great introduction to epidemiology. For an introductory course I was impressed that I came away feeling like I have learned some applicable skills that will be useful for my future. The course was very organized and structured. The lectures were very direct and informative.",
    "It's a good class but the exams\/quizzes are not as well as they should be. Also the use of multiple choice (with very similar answers) tests more the ability to understand the professors thought process than present your own. The format should be changed to short answers to allow students to explain and display what they've learnt from the class.",
    "No weaknesses. The material is presented in an unbelievably clear manner. Great course.",
    "Overall a very well organized class with well-defined learning objectives.",
    "Good intro to epidemiology but takes a lot more time than most other classes because of the amount of material",
    "Interesting material, but a lot of it. I think it could be pared down, in terms of the information presented and\/or class time.",
    "This class was great. Though the content is a little tedious at times Professor Dubrow is an awesome professor.",
    "It was the best class I have taken. I feel that it has provided me a good foundation for my future Public Health career.",
    "I think this course is fundamental to the understanding of Epidemiology and Public Health. I learned basics that will guide me throughout my career and now have a solid foundation upon which I will build all future course knowledge while at Yale and beyond.",
    "This class was well structured and the goals were clear. Also, I appreciated how well thought out the assignments were. The tests were challenging and required synthesis of the materials covered and were good indicators of understanding.",
    "Great course, well organized, very interesting.",
    "The course is comprehensive but covers too many details.",
    "This was a great class. I learned more from this class than I did from any of my other courses this semester.Even though the material could be a bit dry at times, the lectures were always interesting and engaging. The exams were appropriately challenging and fair, and the discussion sections were helpful in reviewing the homework assignments.One suggestion would be the possibility of using clickers for in-class questions (which were very helpful). I know that a number of Yale courses (outside of YSPH) utilize this technology. When asking exam-type questions in class, using clickers would allow each student to electronically submit their answer and the distribution of class answers would be displayed on the powerpoint. This way, the instructor (and students) would know what percentage of the class is REALLY understanding the material, and not just looking around to see whether other people are raising their hand, or not raising their hand at all.The course packet and case study articles were a good resource, but not necessary to do well in the course. Having a printed-copy of the course-packet would have been extremely helpful.",
    "very interesting class, requires ALOT of time and energy and concentration.",
    "A solid course in the foundations of public health.",
    "Dr. Dubrow is a great instructor, and I feel like I got a comprehensive introduction to epidemiology. Lectures were well structured and interesting. Reading assignments reinforced the concepts covered and allowed for a deeper understanding of lecture material.",
    "Tons of work and a lot of material covered, but overall a great course.",
    "it's interesting and most important in the field of epidemiology",
    "I would strongly recommend the course to take. Firstly, the course is very well organized, and the instructor always did his best to facilitate the class participation. He deligently provided lots of helpful materials, including assignments and practice examinations, for students, too. The lecture notes have almost always been uploaded on time. The exams are not very easy, but overall, they were assessing what they should.",
    "The course was very heavy in information and was demanding every week (homework every week) but I did learn a lot.",
    "Overall, the course was great. I felt that I got a thorough background in epidemiology and have been exposed to the important epidemiologic principles. There were no major weaknesses of the course.",
    "Epi is just a really hard subject, so most of the difficulty just comes from this fact. I understand students are never happy with this course. I wish that it was a little more 'dumbed down' at time for those of us that have no background in Epi and are really starting out from negative square one. The labs\/discussions really need to be more helpful, instead of just going over the homework. Discussion should happen and we should take about the larger areas where these small homework problems fit in.",
    "The course material is difficult to understand. It is an extremely useful class and the basis for public health work, but there is so much to learn the first semester that its somewhat overwhelming.The powerpoint lectures are extremely wordy and don't facilitate understanding during class. In addition, weekly sections don't allow for review and understanding of the material because it is spent going over homework.Students should be allowed to switch out of TA sections that they feel is below par of the other sections.",
    "This course was challenging but fair. It provided me with a good background in epidemiology.",
    "I thought that this was a great class as an introduction to epidemiology. The assignments were enlightening and the readings were interesting. The subject material is very applicable to public health issues. This class was a great overview and I learned a great deal.",
    "This was a fantastic course and a solid introduction to epidemiology.",
    "The course gave an excellent overview of the general study deisgns, epidemiology concepts, and applications. I enjoyed learning about the theory and then reading papers that demonstrated the theories. The class notes, readings, and homework were also very helpful.I don't think there are significant weaknesses, because Dr. Dubrow surveyed the class mid-semester and addressed some of the issues we were experiencing.",
    "2nd 1\/2 great! lot of content, easy to loose big picture",
    "The course is great at describing principles of epidemiology. Not only were we presented with epidemiological study frameworks, but given examples through case studies and shown their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Although having a typed homework assignment was a lot sometimes, it was necessary to learn the material. This should definitely remain a required class for the MPH degree because you gain so much knowledge about epidemiological studies that have been done in the past and you can read scientific articles with a much better understanding once you are familiar with epidemiological concepts.",
    "There is a heavy reading load for this course. Principles of epidemiology is a concept intensive course. The lectures are not always interesting and have a selective preference toward chronic disease epidemiology. The homework can be a challenge because the questions are not always discussed or covered in lecture before the homework is due for the week.",
    "The course was too intense, detailed and demanding as a core class required of those who are not in the epidemiology-related division. the amount of information presented was an overload that actually hindered retention due to frantic memorization in preparing for the test and quizzes",
    "Although the course covered a lot of information, the course was very structured and continued to build of previous material which made learning the information much easier. Furthermore, I enjoyed learning the material in one lecture then learning through a case study in another lecture. That helped re-enforce the material.",
    "This is a very comprehensive course, which includes weekly reading assignments and homework, two quizzes, midterm and a final. The instructor is outstanding- the lectures, homework assignment, and readings were all necessary and helpful. The quizzes helped us prepare for the midterm and the final. And the TAs were very knowledgeable and always available.",
    "It was a very good introduction to epidemiology. The material was comprehensive and examples from the epi literature in various topics were helpful in understanding concepts, formulas, etc. The material was well paced as well.The homework assignments were helpful in ensuring comprehension of the material, yet I felt some of them could have been shorter.",
    "Overall it was a good course, but it could have used a lot more infectious diseases case studies.",
    "This was a huge course, and a shedload of work. The material was very interesting and I almost feel ready to set up in medical practice now! It felt like a medical course, and at times I struggled when the terminology took a higher level of medical knowledge for granted than I actually possess. I'm not sure I have quite synthesised the conceptualisations of bias, confounding and effect modification, but I do feel like I'm on the way to doing so, and I certainly recognise how important they are.No real weaknesses. Some minor adjustments to the course were made as it progressed, and they were helpful. The way that homework was used primarily to give students feedback, without pieces being graded, was really helpful, and helped make sure that learning rather than assessment was the main focus of the course.",
    "I really liked the material, and think the Dr. Dubrow's slides are great. However, his delivery is a little timid and awkward, and I think the biggest improvement in the class would be through him becoming more animated.",
    "Strengths: Covers a variety of skills in epi; uses a variety of real-life data sets; uses updated and classic literature studies.Weaknesses: The text would be better with more pictures or diagrams along with historical anecdotes.",
    "This course was very thorough and a great introduction to epidemiology even for those like me who have never taken such a course. The course notes packets were suplemented by lectures and the readings and it all came together perfectly.",
    "strengths: good teaching, great coursebook, useful assignmentsweaknesses: tests not indicative of knowledge learned",
    "strengths: homework discussion sections, multiple quizzes\/exams,layout of the material and general difficulty of the course.weakness: the case studies sometimes felt like they were too much. There were too many examples given and the thought of being tested on them was overwhelming.",
    "This course has a great structure. The class notes and use of examples in the lecture are really helpful. Lectures can be a bit boring but well taught overall.",
    "The class was excellent. I have no ideas for improvement.",
    "This course is very clearly the core of public health and I found it to be interesting, informative, and most importantly, essential to my studies in Public Health.",
    "Excellent course. Dubrow puts so much care and effort into the course material and the lectures. The problem sets are incredibly useful and his exams are well-designed. I really enjoyed this class and felt like I have learned a lot!",
    "the way it is taught could be more fun",
    "The course is very well organized and provides a great deal of background on what public health is.",
    "Strengths:Instructorinteresting materialWeaknesses:way too large of a classthere was so much information that exams\/quizzes at times felt like more of an assessment of my ability to cram random facts than it was of my analytical skills.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and Dr. Dubrow was wonderful!",
    "This class is a great introduction to public health. The class notes are really helpful.",
    "Once you get a hang of the material and outline of the course, you learn to love it.",
    "hard to know what's important or not important from the lectures",
    "I wished that the class had been more focused on the material presented at the end of the course- I was expecting much more about tracking diseases, but got a lot more math.",
    "great classnotes and lecture powerpoints",
    "I'd like more time focusing on problem solving and extension of what we've learned rather than drilling on formulas. The last exam was best, because it had more conceptual questions.",
    "This was the best course for me this first semester. It was interactive, had regular assessments, and was responsive to student suggestions. Improvements were made during the semester to improve without fundamentally changing the course structure.",
    "Strengths-Class notes and lecture slides were well organized.Good understanding of the material provided.Relevant articles discussed in the classWeakness-Too many unanswered questions in class notesVague questions (which could have more than 1 right answer) asked in quiz and exams.",
    "coure started off as my least favorite, but ultimately, was my favorite of the semester. dr. dubrow was enthusiastic and passionate--very important for the course!",
    "Assessments- they challenge you to really understand the material and apply it."

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Couldn't tell you. Did not go to lecture after week two. For the love of god, stop reading slides and wasting our time. We spend a TON of money to be here and I feel like I am taking an online course because all of the material can be learned from home.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is an incredible teacher. He knows so much about the subject matter and is very good at delivering lectures and helping students understand the material. It was obvious he really tried to cater the class to the needs of the students and took all of our critiques of the course into account. He put so much effort into being an effective teacher for us and it really paid off.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He's good.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0DR. DUBROW DOES AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB of presenting and organizing material in a manner that facilitates gaining an understanding of the foundations of epidemiology. He may put in more effort than any professor I've ever had, and his work will influence the career of every student fortunate enough to take his course.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow designed a very organized class and created extremely clear and helpful slides and reading materials. Adding questions into the lectures during the second part of the semester was helpful in engaging students more and making the class more interactive. Engaging the students even more during lectures would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Good lecturer but could do more to focus on concepts rather than studies",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Prof. Dubrow seems very nice and approachable. However, it wasn't always clear in lecture what the main concepts were...at times, he would present the concepts after an example, which was frustrating. Also, there was a lot of time spend on miscellaneous information - at times it was hard to understand what the underlying point was.However, I did really appreciate him taking class time to do review questions...I think it would be great if he could add 2-3 of these to the end of every lecture (instead of spending so much time on study examples) to review the main ideas.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a great professor. He was happy to respond to concerns, he taught the material exceedingly well and was extremely knowledgeable on the subjects. Definitely the best professor to be teaching this class. Even haven taken epidemiology before, I feel as if my understanding and knowledge in this area is better and deeper for having taken this class.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He is an amazing professor. Funny and very nice. His power point slides, office hours, homework, and review questions, though not easy, really provided great information and knowledge. The instructor is one of the best professors I have ever had. Thanks, Dr. Dubrow!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a wonderful instructor. He made class learning fun and exciting. He posed thoughtful questions that allowed us to think outside of the box. I don't think the course would have been as enjoyable with another professor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0The instructor was extremely conscientious of the difficulties the students were encountering. However, I think sometimes the class participation detracted from the learning for the rest of the course. It might be beneficial to work on limiting this.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Surprisingly dynamic, engaging, very understanding and willing to work with students in terms of how the course was run.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is patient and dedicated.However, I hope he could make the class more interesting.The most important is he could have stress the main ideas better if he give up those unnecessary details.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a great instructor. He was always willing to answer questions, and it seemed like he truly wanted everyone to understand the material he was presenting before he moved on.I liked that he gave us a mid-term course evaluations and used our suggestions in the second half of the course. That showed me that he values his students' opinions quite highly. I liked the multiple choice exam-style questions that we did in class, and the case studies were always interesting, provocative, and illustrative of the material.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He's highly responsible for students, a good instructor, a thoughtful test giver.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow truly cares about the success of his students. Rarely have I ever seen a professor with such compassion.

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a great instructor. He was responsive and accessible to students. His lectures were informative and well organized. He also took the time to explain difficult concepts and offered continual feedback to students throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0First half of the course, I felt that I wasn't get much from his lectures since he would read off the slides most of the time. But after the midterm and listening to comments made from students, he was improved greatly. I like that he included sample test questions after he lectured. I thought that this was really effective.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Good professor, very nice and available to answer any questions. Although he's little monotone when he lectures which might put some people to sleep.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He always kept sensitivity to how well students understood the course materials. After the midterm examination, in particular, he sedulously collected the feedback from the students as well as changed some parts of the course (e.g. solving problems during the course together) as they wanted. He wanted to deliver the best to his students, and I am assured that it worked!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He was a good instructor who really wanted us to understand the information he was communicating to us.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a fabulous instructor. He explained the concepts clearloy and was sensitive to when students were not grasping material to ensure that they understood the concepts. After the mid-course evaluation, Dr. Dubrow incorporated the students' recommendations to enhance our learning experience, which I appreciated it. The questions that were incorporated into the lecture to reinforce concepts from previous lectures were most helpful.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dubrow is great considering the subject he is faced with. It's difficult because he is so precise and detail oriented that he has trouble coming down to our level. I think he needs to budge a bit with his multiple choice, especially when the TAs tell him that the lengthy problems and the 'pick two' problems are pretty problematic for people trying to learn the subject matter. I would also be great for us to know what we're getting into before the first quiz so we don't all fail. We need to know the definitions, have them memorized with the formulas, and then know how to apply them.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is extremely knowledgeable about the material and cares that students understand the material. However, his powerpoints are extremely wordy and difficult to follow during class.The course material is dry and Dr. Dubrow doesn't help make it anymore interesting.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow had high, but fair, expectations. I think he's a wonderful instructor with passion for the subject.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a great professor. He was eager to improve his teaching methods and cater to our likes and dislikes. Overall, I think he did a great job on his slides. They were neat and coherent and included just enough detail to understand the concepts. The examples that were presented were interesting and thorough. They emphasized key points that I would have not caught on my own. Understanding the examples improved my understanding of the material.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was a great instructor. His lectures were clear, cogent, and comprehensive. Homework assignments reinforced the concepts from lecture and the readings. The exams were a fair assessment of the material covered in the course.",

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Robert Dubrow was an incredible instructor. He was thorough, he listened to our comments and responded to feedback. This only strengthened an already good course.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is an excellent teacher. He is very passionate and knowledgeable about epidemiology and it shows. Although powerpoints aren't necessarily the most exciting teaching method, it fit extremely well with his textbook and the structure of the course. He also seemed to work closely with the TAs to make sure we were all on the same track with the homeworks, etc. Also, Dr. Dubrow did a great job of trying to make sure the class was the best it could be by making improvements based on comments he received at midterm. I think adding in sample multiple choice questions or reviewing a few questions many people got incorrecton quizzes\/exams helped break the powerpoints up a bit. Too many questions in the middle of a chapter's powerpoint got a little too much a couple of times, but I definitely like the idea of it and appreciate that Dr. Dubrow listened to students and started doing that.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow has his moments of spark. He can be witty, which really gets the class going at times. Epi can be challenging material to cover due to its analytic nature and therefore, lecture is sometimes very dull. However, Dr. Dubrow consistently encourages the students' engagement and participation. He genuinely cares about their success and understanding of the material",

Although it was a challenge, he was able to address and\/or accommodate may students' requests which is very commendable.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a fabulous instructor who really cares about his course and makes sure that we all comprehend the material. His lecture slides, class notes and homework assignments are comprehensive, helpful and coherent. He is very responsive to any questions and needs. And his exam questions are very fair and well thought out.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He was a great instructor. He was always approachable and open to receiving feedback. He interacted with the class well and encouraged participation, which was a more effective teaching style. I especially liked answering the multiple choice questions and discussing them as a group.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Instructor was great.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0A really well organised instructor, always had the course slides up on Classes V2 the night before classes, always reviewed his slides before class, always knew exactly what he wanted to say, but always happy to defer to students' practical experience when that led to a different take on things.Dr. Dubrow has a very nice manner in class, earnest without being overbearing. There was never any doubt that the students were his main interest.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0See answer to Question 6. Basically, Dr. Dubrow is a good teacher, but needs to liven things up a bit.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow is a sensitive, methodical instructor--the examples he used in class were both insightful and entertaining. He solicited student feedback midway through the course and made adjustments to his instruction accordingly. I love the slides for studying purposes, and I think that the class might benefit if he did more presenting of the material than reading of the PPT slides.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Robert Dubrow is a thoughtful and thought-provoking professor and his classes were a pleasure to attend. I can't believe how much he was able to teach us in a semester. The only weakness that I can think of is that the exams were difficult with some unclear questions.",

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0He was thorough",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I thought Dr. Dubrow was a fairly dry lecturer, which I suppose is understandable given the fact that this was an intro class. I really appreciated that he read our mid-semester evaluations and changed some things, or explained why he didn't- I've never had a professor do that, and I thought it was really helpful and a respectful thing to do.",

    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr Dubrow did a good job while teaching epidemiology. He always has been very punctual and is also sensitive to student's questions and queries.The teaching can be improved by giving more practice questions in the class and by avoiding vague questions that has multiple right answers in the exam.",

    "Chris Kim was a genuinely nice TA. However, he was not good at explaining the concepts.",
    "Elyssa Gelmann was an INCREDIBLE TA.Every week she had very well put-together slides going over the homeworks which were extremely helpful. She clearly put a lot of time into them and they were tremendous study resources. In addition, she'd provide very thorough feedback on our written homework and clearly dedicated a lot of time to grading as well (which was much appreciated).She was ALWAYS very well prepared, had a very obvious comprehensive and extensive knowledge of the entire course material and was very good at setting a supportive environment for when we struggled through some of the problem sets.Section was enjoyable and extremely helpful.

    "Aracelis was fantastic.",
    "All the TAs are great, but Linlu was very thorough and helped the class learn concepts if the lecture was not clear.",
    "Whatever. I can only speak for my own TA who did an adequate job. They have no real training so they just awkwardly fumble through the material and can't really give good answers.",

She also employed appropriate examples to help students' understanding. Even very before the final exam, for instance, she willingly worked for my questions that were not covered during her session via email. Besides, whenever I had to review previous homeworks for the examinations, her powerpoint slides became enormous help. To sum up, she was the best TA among those who I have ever met so far!",

    "Linlu was a fairly good TA. I think that for PhD students who are shy and aren't great at presenting, and aren't great at explaining things, and maybe don't feel comfortable teaching, there should be another option. It's stupid to make grad students suffer because a PhD student is being forced to teach. People should only GET to teach if they are qualified and would make good teachers. I think YSPH pays well enough to ask for qualified teachers that are capable of explaining things. Linlu wasn't bad, but Elyssa, Katie, and Yang were just really really really really good. We need TAs who can dumb stuff down for us!",
    "Aracelis Torres was a good TA. She was great about helping students outside of section with questions, etc.",

    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in public health. Although it is an overview of epidemiology, many in-depth and useful topics are covered, all of which are important for anyone working in public health.",
    "Yes, I learned alot in this class and all of the work was really reasonable. Every assignment was for a good reason, and really helped me. Would definately recommend this class.",
    "Excellent! Lecture and section were interesting and important. Not only is it required, but i'd recommend it to everyone! It truly tests your reasoning capabilities, but rewards you for hard work.",
    "This course is work intensive, requires a lot of time and hard work. However, Dr. Dubrow is an amazing professor and explains the material well. I learned a ton in this course and would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Summary:A survey course over the basics of epidemiological study designs and principles. The course gives insight into the epidemiological perspective on biology and science.I would recommend it for students aiming to gain an appreciation for basic epidemiology and not for advanced epidemiology students.",
    "Course is difficult, but required. Good luck.",
    "Of course I would recommend this course. The material covered in this class is necessary knowledge for any MPH candidate. This course covered fundamental concepts that serve as a base for more in-depth studies. All of the material learned in this class can be applied to other courses in the public health school.As a policy student, I am disappointed that I will not be able to take Epi 2, since it is scheduled the same time as a mandatory policy course.",
    "This epi course is definitely recommendable to other students because of its importance in public health.",
    "Great course, you learn a lot and it's very easy to understand what material you are responsible for. It's fun. Sections on Friday morning are slightly annoying but are usually pretty laid-back. Dubrow is awesome but not super high-energy so sometimes lecture is a little borring though you can get most of what you need out of the incredible course notes that he uses as a \"textbook.\"",

    "Yes, I would recommend it. Though the lectures can be dull, the subject matter is important. I read research articles and I know what kind of study design it is, and I know the basic strengths and weakness. It is a practical and useful course to take when you plan on designing your own research experiment.",
    "Its a required course",
    "Excellent intro, with a teacher that really cares",

    "Good intro to epi. Be prepared to receive bad grades initially if you have been out of the classroom for a while.",
    "Great intro course to epi.",
    "I don't really think we have a say in taking the course or not. My recommendation is to sleep in and study on your own time. No benefit from attending lecture.

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone with an interest public health.",
    "Definitely recommend this class to all public health students, especially those interested in continuing with epidemiology.",
    "This class was a very comprehensive introduction to the field of epidemiology. I wouldabsolutely recommend this course.",
    "Definitely recommend. preferred more discussions of specific studies b\/c it really helps to understand the applications of princples reviewed in the class",
    "I will recommend it to any one who major in public health and who want to do other social sciences.You would get the common sense on epidemiology from this course, and would know how to apply this knowledge to practical research and the analysis of others' researches.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It is an important foundation for public health studies, and Dr. Dubrow is an excellent instructor.",
    "you have to take it no matter what.remember to concentrate in class more~",

    "Principles of Epidemiology was a course that taught students to recognize, analyze and critically evaluate patterns of health and illness as well as determinants of health. All students should take this course to get the proper background in public health research. Epidemiology will help you understand how to read public health research papers and can give one a sense of how to conduct research properly in order for it to be valid.",
    "Learn and understand the material, as well as how to apply it. Memorize all the formulas and understand how to do the math. Try to find a TA you like and who's schedule works with you, and just go to their office hours every week and talk about things and do the homework. Make sure you understand the material.I wouldn't recommend EPI unless it is mandatory, it's A LOT of work for someone who doesn't have to take it. A LOT.",
    "The course is extremely useful for public health work. It is an introduction to the understanding of epidemiologic studies.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students.",
    "This course was an introduction to the statistical methods in epidemiology, the types of studies that are used, and the ways in which epidemiologic concepts are important for public health innovation. I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "This course is an introductory epidemiology course that covers basic experiemental design, epidemiology measurements, current studies, and current problems in epidemiology. I would recommend it, it will give you a solid grounding in epidemiology studies.",
    "Its the basics of epidemiology. Its an incredible course, especially for those with no basis of knowledge in epidemiology.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. The course material is extremely important in public health and Dr. Dubrow is an excellent professor who really wants you to learn. The structure of the class and the TA discussion groups make sure you learn the material as well. Also, take advantage of TA office hours if you need extra help because that certainly helped me throughout the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The material that we covered during the course is a necessity to the field of public health. Although not all students like the style of the lectures, it was very organized and structured and helpful in learning the material.",

    "I would recommend it to anyone needing a solid introduction to epidemiology.",
    "This course\/professor is very good if your interests are in chronic disease, but less interesting if you are an EMD student.",
    "Be prepared for pain and reward, in equal proportions. The instructor's attitude and organisation will make it all worthwhile, and you will be on the first rung of the ladder of epidemiology if you can keep up.",
    "It is a good intro to epi. I would recommend it because of the fundamentals covered.",
    "Thorough introduction to epidemiology taught by a professor who is experienced in his field and a pleasure to learn from.",
