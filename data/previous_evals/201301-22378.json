   "comments": [
    "This course provides both a great introduction to texts of the German enlightenment and those that are influenced by it, but also a great supplement to people who want to broaden their understanding of (mostly) German Literature, Culture or Theory. I would recommend this class strongly to anyone interested in German intellectual history or the Enlightenment\/reactions to the Enlightenment in any capacity. Kirk is a wonderful professor who will work with you to help you grow to produce better and better work. And the writing focus allows for low-pressure draft deadlines. This is a great class for people who want to learn to write about the kind of literature and theory taken up in the class.",
    "I will recommend it especially to students who are interested in thinking about broadening the knowledge of ideas around enlightenment. This course includes quite a variety of materials, some of them quite unusual to my eyes, but very mind-blasting and question-raising.",
    "The DS of the Frankfurt School (??). Wide and good reading material. Professors are knowledgable and helpful. The class would benefit, I think, from some final, cumulative discussions and systematic reviews."
