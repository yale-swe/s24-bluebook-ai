   "comments": [
    "I learned to be a better writer and became much more acquainted with some of the classics! These were tales and myths I had only heard of or read about in adaptations (ie Percy Jackson in middle school) but I got to know them so much more in depth.",
    "I definitely learned how to better analyze texts and think critically about specific moments and texts as a whole. Also, my ability to write thoughtfully and concisely improved in this class.",
    "I feel like this was the first truly college level course I took and it in turned prepared me for all future writing and literature courses at this level. I feel capable of delving deeply into symbols, themes and motifs present in works of authors spanning centuries. In addition, my own writing and analysis has improved greatly. I can closely evaluate and respond to passages of text and extrapolate those thoughts into larger ideas.",
    "How to write a good literature essay, analyze texts, and present ideas in a seminar.",
    "Knowledge of the famous works in the western canon",
    "I learned how to write literature papers and analyze ancient texts.",
    "I learned useful tidbits about how to make my papers better, such as information about transitions, paragraph organization, and more.",
    "The fact that most of the texts we read are in translation was at first a challenge for me as I could not analyze texts as I normally did, looking closely at authors' language. This meant I learned to appreciate symbolism, structure, and pace a lot more.",
    "I learnt to be a lot more thoughtful and careful about my writing.",
    "Literary analysis skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The works we read are great, and discussion are excellent.It is hard, however, to fully engage with the txts we read when we go through them so quickly.",
    "One vital strength around which all the other positive components of this course were based was the reading list. I loved it! It was diverse in terms of genre, style, author motivation and time and place written. The discussion in class occasionally became bogged down around small points of questionable value but the frequency of this tendency to manifest itself diminished over the course of the semester due to Professor Markovits' agile manuverings.",
    "The materials were unexpectedly interesting so finishing the reading is not a problem if you don't procrastinate. Amazing lectures, brilliant peers, Professor Markovits knows the materials inside out and offers all kinds of insights and asks thought provoking questions.",
    "You will gain a lot, but the pace is too fast",
    "The professor was excellent and I really enjoyed the reading, but sometimes we did too much at once and I wasnt able to process.",
    "A strength was that I learned a lot about writing papers, and a weakness was that I often felt our discusssions had no direction and were purely based on our own observations rather than a larger point or argument about the work that the professor wanted to get across.",
    "The strengths are simply that the course teaches strong literary analysis skills. It really helps understand and reflect of complex and difficult texts."

    "It's a lot of work, but very worth it! I had a fantastic instructor who really pushed me to be a better writer. It's a lot of reading and a lot of writing but I'd much rather be doing that than a problem set.",
    "Due to the intensity and overall strength of the course, I feel extremely prepared to take on any literary challenge I may face in the future.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in literature at all.",
    "Yes! Take it with professor Markovits!",
    "Yes, it was very fun and intellectually fulfilling. Also, it significantly improved my paper-writing skills.",
    "I would reccomendation thiscourse to another student interested in English.",
    "It really depends on what the student wants to get out of the course",
    "Yes. It is eye-opening."
