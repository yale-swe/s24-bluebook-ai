    "It's great to be able to pursue our own research interests, but at the same time, this is a very challenging class due to the paper. Though it seems we have a lot of time to work on the paper, somehow the time passes by quickly, and before we knew it, it was crunch time.",
    "The class involves semi-regular meetings (every week at first, then less frequently towards the end of the term) during which the students present their ideas and their progress, and the instructor and other students offer their feedback and suggestions. By the end of the term, students produce a paper that is ideally of greater depth and consideration than what usually comes out of seminars.I highly recommend this course to other students who are interested in improving their research and writing. The class also presents a good chance to get to know what one's colleagues are working on in a more intimate way."

   "comments": [
    "I was able to do a lot of research I was interested in, and explore new topics too. This course was very helpful for pursuing my research interests.",
    "As noted above, this class was of direct use in improving research and writing abilities, which are primary skills for those pursuing academic work.I also believe that the specific research I did will figure into my dissertation, which is a bonus that I did not expect going in to this course."
