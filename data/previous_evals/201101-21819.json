    "Interesting overview of Brazilian culture. Very helpful in improving oral comprehension.",
    "It's a good and easy L5. Worth it if you're into Portuguese.",
    "Yes, it's an excellent class. Also would make a great 5th class. Not too much work -even if you put zero effort you still learn an awful lot. The resources for the class are fun, there's lots of variety (movies, short films, essays, poems, excerpts from novels, music, etc) so preparation for class is quite fun."
