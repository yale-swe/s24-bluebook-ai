   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend African Studies 531, or any other course taught by Daniel Magaziner, to other students.",
    "I would recommend this class with hesitation. While the information was helpful and intriguing, I would warn a fellow classmate that he or she will be doing most of the learning from readings and other students in the class rather than experts.",
    "Overall I am very happy with the class, and would recommend it to any friend interested in South Africa.",
    "This is a seminar course that explores a different aspect of 20th century South African history each week. The readings are primarily academic articles, but we also draw on novels\/plays, films, and some visual material. Different students lead the discussion every week. I'd definitely recommend this course for someone interested in South Africa. Discussion was rarely dull.",
    "I am personally passionate about apartheid South African history and think Professor Magaziner is the best person to learn from on this topic. I would recommend this course, however, for students who are already familiar with apartheid history. The course is less about giving you foundational knowledge about apartheid, and more about exploring how the social repercussions of apartheid today is connected with apartheid and pre-apartheid history. If students are interested in this, then I would definitely recommend this class. I would not recommend it, however, for those who may know nothing about South Africa or its culture and history."

   "comments": [
    "This course was a really great way to learn about a region I knew little about. It helped me look at history in a better way and understand historical teaching and thinking more fully. I am debating between political science and history for my future, and this class pushed me further towards history.",
    "I have a better understanding now of how to approach academia as a historian - the kinds of questions they would ask and how to write in that discipline. So yes, it taught me some invaluable lessons.",
    "This course was extremely helpful for my personal M.A. thesis research work. I was particularly interested in the weeks of the course where we explored the role of visual art during apartheid and the impact that such a politically tumultuous time had on artists who may not have felt they had the freedom to freely express themselves outside of the liberation movement. I also appreciated that our professor included literary works as part of our texts and was helped by our week on Zoe Wicomb. My personal research interests are in exploring canon formation in South African literature which ends up being predominantly in English, and Zoe Wicomb is certainly an important writer that remains a central part of the conversation on South African literary production. I plan to keep in touch with Professor Magaziner even while he is on academic leave and know he will continue to be of resource to me."
