    "Great class!! I definitely recommend it! Prof Erikson knows a lot, she is sooo nice, and the workload is not that huge, it's really whatever you wanna do with it. But I guarantee you you're gonna want to do more :)",
    "I took the course as an econ major and I'd say it was definitely worth it. A nice break from pure econ theory and intriguing to see economic problems approached from a sociological view. Also, the application of game theory to historical institutions and events (like Mediterranean merchants) was awesome. The workload is very reasonable: 4 3-page responses, class participation, and a final 10-page paper. Some readings were dense and full of theory, but they were in the minority. Often they were quite interesting and even drew on practical topics like venture capital and the financial markets. Prof. Erikson was great, and very helpful on paper topics, reading responses, tough readings, etc. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Readings are pretty dense and long, but it only meets once a week so it is doable. Not too much work besides four responses. And have freedom in final paper. Great class.",
    "I thought this course provided a good overview into the world of economic sociology. Professor Erikson is a wonderful teacher and a really, super nice person. Having a two hour class at 9:25 was brutal, but overall I'm glad I took this course.",
    "A lot of dry reading followed by slow discussion. The bottom line is it's just a hard topic to grasp.",
    "Very good course if you actually do the readings and come to class prepared to speak about them.",
    "Excellent course. The readings were manageable and it is a great class to take on a Tuesday morning relative to some of the other seminars.",
    "Overall, I would not recommend this course unless you are very interested in the material. I took this course as a way to learn more about economics but that is not what the focus is. In fact, I learned very little about economics. Most of the readings were abstract, theoretical pieces which were difficult to read. These dull readings often made class discussion unexciting and difficult to sit through. Something to think about before taking this class considering it is 2 hours. Professor Erikson is a great teacher but unless you really love this subject I would try to take a different class with her."
