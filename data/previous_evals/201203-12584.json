    "A great class and introduction to both Javanese gamelan and other cultural music and history in the surrounding region. Sarah Weiss is an enthusiastic, fun, and positive person to work with\/learn from. She is evidently very passionate about the material that she teaches, and you cannot help but also become equally interested in seemingly obscure subject matter! The only negative side to the class is long rehearsal time in addition to the 2-hr lecture per week.",
    "When Else would you get to play gamelan? Its a great class with manageable work",
    "You should take this class. There is absolutely no question. It's a great way to learn about another artistic culture, and seeing as Yale has very few classes on South East Asia and Oceania, it's great that there's such a well taught class which focuses on this region. I put that this class has an average workload. This class takes up quite a bit of time in terms of class hours - there's 2 hours of seminar each week, plus two hours of rehearsal, plus another hour of section every second week, plus a reading response most weeks. Concerts also consume an entire day. The class time and rehearsal doesn't feel like work though, as you're doing something physical and social. I found rehearsal to be relaxing, even though I was always super tired (as I had too many problem sets due on Thursdays). I would say that I've bonded more with classmates in other classes (though this happens as a science major with problem sets), but I still made friends in this class who I hope I'll see still once semester ends.",
    "take this for fun!",
    "Absolutely take this. but ignore its categorization as a gut class. It involves a lot of writing, and rehearsal and class time combine for about 4-5 hours each week.",
    "Highly recommend it take it",
    "This class was great! I really enjoyed having Sarah and Lauren as instructors. Sarah was amazing in how she was able to remain positive even with the regular frustrations inherent in the class regular rehearsal. This class was a great way to begin exploration of a new type of music, without a lot of pain from a burdensome workload. I definitely recommend it!",
    "Definitely take it, a great fourth class, and an awesome Yale experience.",
    "This is a great way to learn how to play the gamelan and get introduced to the kinds of things ethnomusicologists think about. Be aware that it is mostly a performance-focused class: you will spend most of your time practicing music. Because you spend so much time playing together, the class gets to be a close community pretty fast, which is great.",
    "Amazing class, with a totally reasonable work load, especially work a writing credit. Honestly a gem of a class and one that I wish I had taken earlier in my Yale career. Professor Weiss is one of the nicest professors and people that I have ever met. The TA is also unbelievable helpful even when you have no idea what you are doing. It's nice to have some concept of music going into the class, but it's not totally required. While the assignments and whatnot don't take much time, the time spent outside of class in rehearsal \/ performance should not be ignored, although it's all very fun if you have any interest in music at all. Which you should if you're going to take the class, to be clear.",
    "If there wasone class I've taken at Yale so far I would recommend it would be this class. You make friends with everyone in the class. The teacher awesome. The instruments we played were fun. I really saw no down side to this class!",
    "Definitely try to take this course if you can - one of the most unique and interesting academic experiences you can have at Yale. Not only do you get to learn about the culture and history associated with an instrument you likely have never even played (or heard of, in my case) before, but you also get to play it in rehearsals as well as several performances. Professor Weiss is awesome, and her enthusiasm for the subject is very contagious. All assignments can be resubmitted a second time for a higher grade, as well, making for an overall low-stress experience.",
    "I came to this course with a bit of a different perspective as I have never taken another music class at Yale. I am happy to say; however, that that lack of experience didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this class. I think that Javanese Gamelan is one of the best hidden gems at Yale, that there are few other courses that so capture and reaffirm Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideal of liberal arts. Often during the semester, when I told people I was taking Javanese Gamelan, their first reaction was \u00e2\u0080\u009cWHAT?\u00e2\u0080\u009d followed by \u00e2\u0080\u009coh gut class to boost your pre-med GPA?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The answer is an emphatic NO.Why ought you take this course then? You ought to take it because it is a course that will stretch your imagination, because it is a course that will introduce you to a new culture and music, because it is a course run by a professor, Sarah, who is one of the nicest and most supportive people you will ever meet, because no matter what year you are, if you pass Yale by without taking this course or a course like it then you may never discover the true wonder of having come to a school like Yale.From the time we began applying to Yale, we were often exhorted to broaden our horizons, to follow Luxet Veritas wherever that might lead. It is in taking this course that I realized what that meant. If we are to pride ourselves in being citizens of the world and in being broad thinkers (unlike those robots in pre-professional schools haha), then we must embrace the opportunity to take courses that at first make us a little uncomfortable, that aim to teach us something new about ourselves. Make no mistake, I have only minimal music background and the rest of my schedule was chock-full of upper level sciences. Even so, it was this course that I will remember the most about this semester. I will leave it to others to cover the basics about the course, but I will end by saying that if you are willing to take the plunge and explore a new subject, perhaps even one that makes you feel shy or nervous (emotions that we seem to pride ourselves in not showing), then you will find no better guide than Sarah and no better course than this one.",
    "Super fun class! You may not know what Gamelan is, but this course is still an ideal writing or humanities credit for you. You spend most of the class time learning to play Gamelan instruments, which is very fun, and was a nice change of pace from most of my social science and math courses. You're never really assessed on your musical ability, though, and the grading for the assignments is very very easy (you can even resubmit them if you want a better grade). The tradeoff is probably that there's a bit more of a time commitment for in-class hours than you'd see in an average course. Every week, there's the 2 hours of seminar time plus a 2 hour rehearsal, and the course also has sections (they meet roughly every other week). There are also 2 performances, both of which take pretty much all day, but they were fun experiences. I actually didn't mind the time, though, because Professor Weiss is incredibly nice and I enjoyed having the chance to experiment with a musical style at which that people didn't really expect us to excel at, but instead just to appreciate and enjoy.",
    "I would definitely recommend Javanese Gamelan to another student. If you like music it is a great class to take. However, if you don't like music and don't want to rehearse for 2 hours a week then maybe look elsewhere. However, Sarah is one of the nicest and most intelligent teachers I have met. So definitely shop this class and see if it is right for you.",
    "This is a really fantastic class if you're interested in learning a totally different, sometimes slowgoing, musical system and spending a lot of time playing the instruments. You really get to learn to play every instrument in the gamelan orchestra through this class. It is not something you'llever use again, but if you like music, especially from other cultures, it's an experience you shouldn't miss. Sarah is really fantastic--such energy, she really cares about the students and enjoys teaching, and she is SO FREAKING TALENTED and knowledgeable on all things gamelan it's amazing. Basically it's a 2 hour lecture once a week, but often you spend the second hour playing in the gamelan room. You have almost weekly writing assignments from 2-3 to 4-5 pages long and then one big 8-12 page paper at the end of the semester. The readings are pretty interesting, and are important to writing the papers, but you can technically get away with not doing all of them--of course, then you get less out of the experience and learn less about the culture and background, if that's what you're interest is. This is a pretty big time commitment outside of class--once a week 2 hour rehearsal and a 1 hour section every other week for the first half or so of the semester (which is basically a rehearsal in small groups.) Then there are 1 or 2 concerts which take up basically the entire day, about 7 hours, because of all the moving and setup of the instruments. If you're into ethnomusicology at all, this is one of the very few opportunities at Yale to really study another culture's music, and Sarah is definitely a person you should meet. It's not a gut, but it's not crazy hard either. And if you like learning some cool meter stuff and playing music, it's a blast. I totally loved this course!",
    "Javanese Gamelan is an extremely rewarding course that expands the student's abilities on several fronts: writing, critical reading, introduction to a little-known musical tradition, and musical performance. It's ability to count towards one's distributional requirements is an added bonus, but the course would still be more than worth it without that benefit.The time commitment is the only part of the course that I would advise a prospective student about, since at first the once-per-week meeting time looks very attractive. There is also a two hour rehearsal every week and an hour-long section. On the other hand, the time required to complete the homework is very manageable. But overall, the course is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
