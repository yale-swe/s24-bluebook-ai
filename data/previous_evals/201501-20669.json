   "comments": [
    "The course is very helpful for people working on stars or exoplanets. I definitely recommend it.",
    "This is an absolutely essential course if you're considering doing exoplanets or stellar research, and you'll learn a lot of useful tools.",
    "You study the physics of stars and their interiors. You learn about the approximations and shortfalls in the current theories and stellar modelling. Some notable topics include convection, nuclear reactions, and asteroseismology. Class largely consists of copying down derivations for certain stellar properties and relations. You learn the basics of using our stellar evolution code, YREC, which can evolve a star, or calculate consist values of metallicity, radius, mass, etc. for given inputs. The textbook is very good, even if it doesn't show that many steps in derivations. This is one class where the textbook is definitely worth getting, especially since you can use it, but *not* your notes during exams. I recommend the class for those who meet either of these conditions: 1.) are interested in studying individual stars or stellar evolution (or exoplanets) 2.) are good at\/enjoy physics, especially thermodynamics.",
    "I would recommend the course if you're interested in stellar astrophysics or exoplanet research. I know a good deal more about how stars operate, and potentially more about what we're unsure about concerning their structure and how to model them! Just be sure to take fast notes, or follow the text closely.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in stellar astronomy or exoplanets."

    "This course was a great help to my knowledge of stellar astrophysics. While I personally don't plan to do stellar, I think in providing general knowledge of the scope of the field of astronomy, this course will prove helpful.",
    "I also learned to use command line programs and run scripts and use remote computers, which will be valuable moving forward. As a prospective exoplanet thesis student, I now have a much better understanding of stars, as well as the uncertainties in their parameters, which often are magnified when applied to planets.",
    "One thing I understand now is how difficult it is to disentangle some of the degenerate properties of stars: a"
