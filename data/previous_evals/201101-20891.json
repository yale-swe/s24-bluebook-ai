   "comments": [
    "Take it - it's a good, engineering approach to immunobiology and biomaterials and you will learn a lot from it if you don't know anything about the subject. The material and workload aren't bad at all.",
    "I would highly recommond this course to any senior undergraduate or graduate student. The fundatmentals of immunobiology are covered very well up front, followed by some practical engineering designs.",
    "If you are interested in the material, this class is perfect. Even if you aren't previously interested in the material, you miht still find this class interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone else. Prof Fahmy was very receptive to his undergrad audience and really wanted you to understand all of the information. The class is a lot of work because the problem set questions take a while, but you learn so much information. This class made me really happy to be majoring in BME.",
    "One of my favorite courses so far. I learned so much and was able to find so many applications for what I learned.",
    "Yes, it's a great class even if you've never learned about the immune system. The class starts with the very basics and works all the way up to the awesome ways it can be manipulated by engineers.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in immunology.",
    "It's a great course. Take it if your interested in immunology with an emphasis on actual research."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course was very helpful in providing me with a better understanding of immunobiology and how engineers can duplicate the functions therein. This course provided me with the fundamental knowledge to understand much of the work being performed at the university. The final project proposal also made me think in terms of what type of research is possible and where clinically things can be applied.",
    "It really augmented my knowledge of the immune system and its intricacies.",
    "I didn't know a lot about the immune system before taking this class. I found all of the material really interesting, and I'm just more excited to take more BME electives in the future!!",
    "This course is structured in a way that really makes you think about new studies that can be performed and the enormous impact that the field has on medicine. This course really excited my passion for BME!",
    "Most of my background was in drug delivery and biomaterials, with a shaky foundation in immunology. After this class I'm confident discussing and thinking about immunological systems and I'm excited to learn more."
