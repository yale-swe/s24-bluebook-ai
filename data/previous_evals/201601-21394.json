    "The class is made a lot more difficult than it has to be by teaching that is not so up to par. Also, the reverse class technique used by the teachers is very ineffective. This class would probably be better as a traditional class setup. I would recommend this class for those who are taking a related major, but otherwise, I don't think it's worth taking.",
    "The flip classroom is not very effective. It's a lot of work to make sure you understand the material. Expect to put in a ton of work.",
    "Take it if you like calculus. Don't take it because you did something similar in high school, because there are so many more ways to fulfill a requirement.",
    "Good",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who has some calculus background and may not feel ready to move on to multi calculus math. It covers basic calculus and is helpful for giving you a strong foundation in calculus.",
    "Tough course, I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to.",
    "If you have not taken calc BC in high school, do not take this class. Many people have taken the same class in high school and will kill the curve for you. If you have taken BC calc, then the class will be pretty easy and not require too much of your time. You'll probably be bored in class, but you'll do well and understand everything that the class covers. The class is set up where you watch a video and do prep problems on a certain topic, and then the next day in class you will be taught by the instructor that same lesson, but not much teaching actually occurs in class. You pretty much have to learn it on your own and hope you understand it. There's one problem set a week, but it's not too bad."
