    "I would definitely recommend taking L1 Italian if you want to start a new language. It's very similar to Spanish and it's a beautiful language:)",
    "Not as easy as you think but worth taking",
    "This course will give you a great foundation in Italian. You will learn enough Italian to make descriptions, speak in simple past, present and future tenses and make commands in Italian. The vocabulary is practical and the combination of auditory, visual, and verbal means of learning will facilitate your learning process.",
    "I loved italian this semester! It was super fun and the class size was great because it really caused you to prepare well for each class and I feel I was challenged to improve which was great! I would absolutely recommend it to another student and especially would recommend Francesco Rabissi as a teacher, he's absolutely great and I loved taking his class!",
    "I would tell a fellow student that Italian is a fun, challenging and very manageable class for any student. While there is course work, it is very straight forward you are never expected to know something that is not directly from class teachings or the book. The staff is also great with being available to provide additional help when\/if needed."
