    "I feel I got a glimpse into the lifestyle and scandalous side of aristocratic society in 18th and 19th century France. It was the first time I had really engaged in in-depth discussion and study of French literature, and centering everything around one specific topic gave me an interesting perspective and way of thinking about what we read, as well as our everyday interactions and relationships even today."

    "The readings were excellent and offered a wide scope within what may at first appear to be a rather narrow topic. However, this was an excellent way of organizing the course to always give direction to the reading, discussion, and interpretation. I appreciated being exposed to such a variety of literature and the essay topics were interesting. However, after the first few classes, discussions seemed to drag at times, yet seem pressed for time at the same time. Perhaps having some more structure and direction as to what we want to generally accomplish during each session would be helpful, and balancing the time better would prevent us from spending a lot of time on some detail in the beginning of the reading and then having to rush through really important sections just because they're nearer the end. As well, I feel there was very little feedback about our actual language skills; the course was more focused on talking about the literature, which was great, but as a non-native French speaker, I was expecting the course to have some more emphasis on improving speaking and writing skills rather than treating these as secondary. After all, the only requirement this fills is for L5, yet it seemed more like a WR or Hu. There also didn't seem like a clear goal on what our learning outcomes would have ideally been, so while the course was very interesting and enjoyable, I don't think I really learned anything concrete.",
    "This course had great readings with a mix of books that are super common as well as more unconventional or unexpected texts."

    "Yes! The readings are excellent and it's a very interesting way of interpreting great literature and a less commonly considered facet of 18th and 19th century French aristocratic life. The discussions could drag sometimes and Prof. Saint-Amand could have managed time better, but overall, it was a very interesting and enjoyable course. The assignments are reasonable, but treat is as more of a literature course than as a language course, as there is very little emphasis on actually improving language skills; those are more taken for granted.",
    "No way",
    "I would recommend this course to any French Major or anyone interested in reading the more scandalous side of french literature. The reading was manageable and the writing assignments were enjoyable!"
