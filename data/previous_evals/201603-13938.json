   "comments": [
    "This was a phenomenal course. I gained so much knowledge about the philosophy of life and technology, AI, genetic engineering, bioethics, and human extinction risk. This course also pushed me to expand my thoughts and consider a lot of emerging phenomenons that are frequently ignored.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about life and what it means to live in an age of human dominance. This course was not at all practical, but may have been one of my most fulfilling courses yet at Yale.",
    "The most valuable part of this class was reading and engaging with the critical theory of Heidegger and Jonas. Thanks to professor Leslie's facility with these texts, I learned a lot about how to approach them. I could never have learned this on my own.",
    "I developed an awareness about the current condition of humanity that I had previously not considered. Reading about and discussing our proximity to human extinction, given modern technology, gave us the tools to talk about why we should or shouldn't attempt to preserve the human species and the ways by which we can ensure survival and preservation.",
    "In this course I learned about the philosophy and social theory of technology and the various ethical, social, and political concerns about the implications of the use of modern technological innovations.",
    "It was my first EPE course, so I learned how to consider questions from an interdisciplinary lens of ethical theory, politics, and economics. The economics portion of the course introduced important ways to think critically about economics and capitalism. Furthermore, the social theories of technology and philosophy of intergenerational relations gave us tools to not only critique emergent technologies, but also other social practices or policies in other classes and in the real world.",
    "I learned how to think both philosophically and empirically about hard hitting issues of extinction. I thought the debate was a useful exercise in learning to defend views you may not agree with.",
    "I was able to think very deeply about my own motivations for caring about the survival of the human species, which turned out to be really important and helpful.",
    "Loved this course! Learned so much, really excellent overview of prominent thinkers\/philosophers in the fields of technology, extinction risk etc. Fascinating topics, class discussion was always really interesting. Topics that are so important to consider in the current age and relevant to practically every interest\/discipline."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the incredible readings, class debates, and, of course, David. The course is perfectly structured to expand your mind. Some of the readings and concepts were very difficult to comprehend but David always did a fantastic job of clarifying them in class. The debates really pushed us to critically analyze such topics as the morality of genetic enhancement, the need for bioethics, and the possibility of superintelligence. Overall, the only way this course could be improved is if it lasted longer.",
    "Strengths are the reading-lecture-discussion style setup of the course. Weaknesses might be in the frustratingly complex early readings, even though they were valuable. I still don't really feel like I understand Heidegger. But, honestly, who does.",
    "Professor Leslie has an uncanny ability to explain critical theory in a way that *almost* makes sense. That alone makes him extremely valuable as a professor, and I hope that Yale will try to keep him. This course, on balance was a disappointment. I came in expecting an in-depth discussion of the threats that face us as a species, in order of urgency and severity. I also hoped that the discussion would revolve around ethics, politics, and especially economics in a way that served our quest to generate a framework for considering and analyzing existential risk. What I got was a class that was 75% critical theory of technology, a class in which our most-discussed topic was \"Why computers can't actually be intelligent\"a topic that has little to no relevance to existential risk. The only feedback I received from professor Leslie during the entire semester was a single paragraph on my term paper proposal. It would have been nice to get some commentary on our debate performance, as well as some more general feedback given that there were only two assignments (really, only one, since the first was a proposal for the second.) Another major flub: Professor Leslie hadn't read some of the books before he assigned them, and it turned out that quite a few of them were duds! I've never known a professor to assign books that he has not read. If professor Leslie wants to teach a philosophy class on critical theory, great! But don't trick me into taking it by telling me that it's an EP&E class on existential risk. This course could be improved in one of two ways: First, incorporate more economics and politics and make this a real EP&E course. Dump the critical theory and focus in on the most pressing existential risks: climate change, nuclear war, bioterrorism. Second, move the class into the Philosophy department and call it \"critical theory of dangerous technology\" or something like that.",
    "The strength of this course was its structure. We'd read engaging texts before class, the professor would then talk for 45 minutes or so on the reading, and then we would engage in a class discussion regarding the material. The conversation and debates I had in this class were by far some of the most interesting ones I've had at Yale. A weakness of the course was the diversity of the authors in the syllabus.",
    "This course had very interesting readings each week. The beginning of the course was more philosophical and theoretical and the latter half featured fascinating technological applications such as artificial intelligence and synthetic biology. Professor Leslie is a great professor; he managed class discussion very well. The debate portion of the class made students very engaged with the reading and the topics we discussed. Students are able to write research papers on a variety of interesting subjects.",
    "Strengths: Good theoretical foundation Broad selection of texts in the theoretical department Class discussion was a good mix between lecture and student discussion. Very enjoyable discussions. Weaknesses: I think the debates could have been better formatted (time-wise), though I understand that we sort of figured out the format as we went. The trouble with the lack of format, I think, made the debate more of a discussion. Cross Ex was the most interesting part of debate, so maybe just having a \"panel discussion\" might be better. The debates seemed to get caught on small wording issues or interpretations of words, and I wish they had gone deeper in to the content.",
    "I really liked how the first half of the course was more philosophical and the second half more empirical. I think we considered a lot of really interesting issues about life and consciousness, and class discussion was passionate and engaging. I think the debate topics could have been more clear (or a required part of the debate should've been to meet with Professor Leslie to know exactly what we're defending). I loved writing the final paper and being able to choose my own topic.",
    "I really liked all the classes, but I think the way it could be improved is less of a philosophical background in the beginning about the importance of life and humanity, and more focus on actual extinction risks and ways that they are similar\/different in our approach to thinking about them and trying to solve them.",
    "No improvements needed. Really enjoyed the course as it, great introduction to the field of extinction risk, looking at some of the prominent philosophers\/thinkers both in the past and current day. Having debates was an interesting exercise during class discussion. Definitely need more future-oriented courses like this at Yale."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY. If this course is taught again, YOU MUST TAKE IT. You will learn so much from it and your eyes will be opened to new, emerging ideas that will shape the next century.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The topics covered in this course are very important to today but are rarely discussed. It combines philosophy of life and technology with case studies of extinction risks to create an interdisciplinary dialogue on the greatest threats to our existence in the next century. It requires broadening perspectives on why we value life, what life we value, and how to protect life as we know it. It also challenges you to extend your value calculations for generations and generations into the future.",
    "Yep, yes, if you like discussing the possibility that we'll all die, and don't mind thinking about dark possibilities in the future, this course was phenomenal. David is a great guy who really just likes talking about philosophy and existential risk. This is the only hour and fifty minute seminar I've ever gone to that felt shorter than a 50 minute lecture.",
    "I'm honestly not sure whether I can recommend this course. On the one hand, Professor Leslie has an uncanny ability to explain critical theory in a way that *almost* makes sense. That alone makes him extremely valuable as a professor, and I hope that Yale will try to keep him. If you're interested in critical theory, and especially that of technology, this class is likely to interest you. But, on the other hand, it is bizarre to label this as an \"EP&E\" class, given that 90% of our discussion was philosophical (and much of it existential rather than normative). This is a class on critical theory, not one on existential risk. As a professor, David Leslie, is, shall we say, idiosyncratic. We received no feedback during the semester save a single paragraph and grade on the proposal. The readings varied in quality. Some were amazing, but most of those were books that you might have read on your own. Some were horrible, and he acknowledged this when he admitted that the hadn't read them before. Overall, Professor Leslie has a deep familiarity with the tremendously difficult texts of critical theory, and that alone may make his class \"worth it\" for some. But if you aren't particularly interested in critical theory, I'd stay away. Sadly, of all the EP&E seminars I've taken, this one is the worst.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to have engaging discussions on some of the most uncomfortable questions regarding the future of humanity, this is the course for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The technological applications about which we read, discuss, and debate are absolutely fascinating. I would certainly recommend this course to any student who is interested in the theory and philosophy of technology and its use and to any student who is drawn to the opportunity to assess the political and social implications of scientific and technological processes. Professor Leslie is great and among the most passionate and knowledgeable professors I have ever had.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who enjoys intellectual history. I think the bulk of the course was very enlightening; it taught us how to think critically about history through teaching use how people have theorized about the development of life, technology, and human civilization. I also think people from all majors-- whether coming from a STEM background, EVST or G&G, or Humanities background-- can find meaning and usefulness in the material if they are willing to put in the work to understand the material. The material at times can seem dry or difficult to understand, because we are reading philosophy, but many modern philosophers are also entertaining to read-- it balances out. Discussions are great and Professor Leslie is a joy to listen to in the \"lecture\" portion. He makes many good connections in the text that you may not have seen the first time.",
    "If you're interested in issues of how we define life, why it matters that humanity could be going extinct, how technology is changing and facilitating extinction risk, bioethics, etc. definitely take this course. The class discussion was fast-paced and people got really passionate, but this was definitely fun. We also watched Westworld which was great. Professor Leslie is honestly very impressive -- super kind and way smarter than you'll ever be, but he's really open guy and very willing to help.",
    "I would, it was really interesting!",
    "Take it!! Such cool topics being discussed (AI, immortality, outer-space expansion, just to name a few), brings up questions\/concerns that are extremely relevant to the modern-day. Prof. Leslie is really great, clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the topics being discussed. Loved going to seminar. Highly recommend, regardless of your particular interests\/major, definitely need more future-oriented classes like this at Yale."
