    "My time in this class directly improved my critical thinking, analytical writing, and clarity of discussion. I became more familiar with in-depth analysis of literary themes and characters, and I learned all about the historical context of Victor Hugo's epic novel Les Miserables.",
    "I wish I could answer this question more in-depth, but It's finals and I'm slowly dying. Suffice it to say that Professor Samuels was fantastic, taught me so much about French history, and should be tenure-track if he isn't already.",
    "I developed my reading skills and my ability to interpret passages and apply them to the historical context.",
    "I gained a deeper appreciation of the complexity of the Restoration period.",
    "We read the entirety of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables and discussed the historical contest of France at the time as well as Hugo's personal intentions and beliefs."

    "I think this class was phenomenal, and I can't think of anything I would do to improve it. But I will say this: don't get rid of the oral presentations because they were super helpful in providing an engaging context for the reading material.",
    "The class was literally perfect.",
    "The strengths were the way discussions were led, it was very engaging. In addition I enjoyed the variety of assignment. It could be improved by changing up class dynamic at timesperhaps splitting into small groups or something.",
    "Strengths: engaging and historical Cons: would have liked more class time",
    "This course was so great, and there were no weaknesses."

    "Absolutely. Take the class and you'll understand why.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes!! Especially for someone interested in French history or simply who loves Les Mis. Was a nice break to study something random but that I cared about.",
    "Yes, it is engaging and a must for any Les mis fan.",
    "Everyone should read Les Miserables, and especially with Professor Samuels. Hes very knowledgeable about literary criticism and French history and culture.",
    "It's a really fun class. Reading Les Mis is a feat, but you'll feel so accomplished to have done it by the end of the semester. We got to interact with a lot of cool French history and even discussed some of Hugo's social and political theories.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Samuels is a wonderful teacher and person who is obviously excited by the subject! I found myself constantly engaged in class and learned so much about critically reading a novel and 19th century French history. The workload was very manageable and Professor Samuels and the TA are there to help you every step of the way. The seminar format allowed for lively discussions and a relaxed environment. If you have any interest in Les Mis, french literature, French history or just want a class with a really great professor, taking this class is a must!",
    "This was my favorite course this semester, so I would definitely recommend it."
