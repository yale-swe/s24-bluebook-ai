    "Great class overall. Instructor is VERY knowledgeable in all aspects of course topics, and provides a great learning environment that is conducive to students' questions and short discussions along the way.",
    "More rigorous interaction between readings and class lectures would improve the course. Weekly assignment had little bearing on the class and not receiving grades on those assignments was a missed opportunity for skill building in writing\/analysis ect.",
    "I think it would be helpful if there was more cohesion between the readings and the material presented in class, and if there was more opportunity for students\/teacher to discuss the readings in class. There wasn't really much incentive to do the reading....In general, I think the class would be more engaging if there was more back-and-forth, as I think many classmates have great perspectives from their own experience that would be interesting and relevant.It would also help if the individual classes were more structured\/organized in terms of what material would be covered, and then if the class session stuck to that plan.",
    "The course material was very interesting and well-presented; hearing from someone involved in the day-to-day work of planning was invaluable. I do wish that perspective had been balanced by a bit more feedback on class assignments and a focus on the tools and process for assessing different plans on our own. I found it most helpful when David ran through his decision-making or evaluative process, so more attention on this, and on how to weigh different factors according to context, would have been great.",

    "Kooris' lectures were interesting and engaging.",
    "Very knowledgeable and approachable professor and TA, freedom to write about pretty much whatever you want on reading responses and term paper, very interesting course material with applicability to local issues.",
    "I gained a much greater understanding of how urban\/regional planning fit into the political process",
    "David has a lot of professional insight into city planning and can provide first-hand examples of many of the concepts taught in class.",
    "Getting practical information about urban planning. I think more courses should teach students the more pragmatic aspects of the subject.",
    "Kooris' breadth of knowledge is apparent in the course lectures. He is energetic and passionate, and that makes the class more enjoyable.",
    "Lectures were very helpful due to the amount of visuals Kooris was able to show us to compliment the things he was saying.",
    "The flexibility and causal format of class time made it easy to have discussion based on particular interests.",
    "Real examples and lecturer experience and in-depth knowledge on regional issues was great. More opportunity to engage lecturer would improve understanding of these issues --- ie more time to analyze decisions rather than just hearing about what happened would make the class more challenging and beneficial.",
    "The first few lectures were awesome. I think that's what Kooris is really into and what many of the students found most interesting. I actually think that if the entire class was structured around planning lessons and techniques that were used during the development of the New York Metropolitan area, it would be far more interesting and useful.",
    "Kooris is very knowledgeable, so it was fun to get his perspective on specific issues. The topics we covered were also very current, interesting and relevant.",
    "I really enjoyed to focus on the northeast& the open nature of discussions.",
    "The breadth of material and Prof. Kooris's wealth of knowledge and experience.",
    "easy to learn a little material in a field I have no prior experience with",
    "First-hand perspective into the planning process.",
    "The professor really knows the course material. He's really well informed and prepared to answer anything related to the course.",
    "The lectures in this course were interesting and useful because the instructor has many years of experience in urban and regional planning in the Northeastern US as well as in other regions, so he is a wealth of knowledge about the realities of planning practice. The lectures incorporated case studies from his work on various projects and initiatives, and in general the material was very up-to-date.",

   "comments": [
    "The lectures are hit-or-miss. I much preferred the sessions that addressed broad themes and those about which Kooris was either passionate or better prepared. Several sessions got stuck in the weeds or suffered from what felt like a lack of energy\/preparation on the professor's part. This is understandable, given that Kooris has a full day job in addition to teaching, but the course does suffer for it.",
    "Three hour once-a-week evening format can be grueling, though I understand why Prof. Kooris does it as a result of his own time constraints. No complaints other than that.",
    "I think the structure of the semester needs cohesion. I didn't get much out of the readings or weekly responses, especially since they were disconnected from each other and the content of that week's lecture. And then the final paper completely stands apart from everything else; it feels like something I could have written with or without the course, rather than drawing on the concepts and knowledge I have gained this semester.",
    "Lectures can get lost on tangents. It is hard to see some lectures as valuable or building on previous material.",
    "The assigned readings didn't seem to have much thought put into them in that they were often too long to be able to finish on time, and then other weeks we wouldn't have any readings. If the readings were reasonable for each week, then I would have been more likely to do them. Also if we had discussed them more in class there would have been more incentive to do it.Kooris could also be hard to reach, which is understandable given his full-time job elsewhere. But it would make the final paper more fulfilling and probably better if we had easier access to the professor.Overall the course could be better organized. Having dinner consistently in class would definitely make it more enjoyable given its Thursday evening meeting time. If the slides were more oriented to note-taking that would also be beneficial, as at times it was difficult to follow along with the professor if he was talking on a tangent for 20 minutes.",
    "None really, aside from better coordination of if\/when food will be ordered... 3 hour lecture that starts at 5:30pm is rough if you haven't eaten dinner.",
    "More clarity of concepts and terms.",
    "Three hours of lecture is a bit much -- more opportunity for interaction with students and problem solving\/analysis of cases\/projects would be helpful. Perhaps small group work would be beneficial.",
    "As the semester wore on, the 3 hour evening lectures, with little to no student interaction, became drawn out and boring. Mixing it up with some class discussion or interactive lessons is much needed.",
    "I think just more integration\/cohesion in the materials of the course. It would be great if they built upon each other somewhat, and if there was more connection between the readings and the lectures. Having more time for student participation, and more facilitated, semi-structured discussions.",
    "No matter who the lecturer is - 2 hours is too long to listen to someone without a break.",
    "The course would be more engaging with more discussion and student involvement.",
    "could definitely make this course more hands-on. maybe some exercises emphasizing real-world application of the lecture material. this is a professional school, after all.",
    "Clarify\/frequency of feedback and criteria. Examples of successful papers, for instance, would have been really helpful in visualizing how the final paper should look.",
    "The lectures. It's really hard to pay attention to a 3 straight hours lecture. I would recommend making them more interactive, have discussions, make the students participate more. If not, after the first hour or hour and a half, students start to loose attention.There is no feedback throughout the whole semester (with the exception of the exploratory paper). We did not get any grades on any of the weekly article summaries and only got feedback on our exploratory paper for our final project. This makes it hard to realize how is your performance during the semester and also makes it hard to outline a final paper.",
    "The format of the lecture over the three-hour class period was somewhat tiring. Interspersing more class discussion and problem-solving into the course would help greatly to make it more interesting and valuable. I had the sense that most of the other students had a lot of relevant academic and work experience, but there were not many opportunities for discussion and learning from one another.",

I really enjoyed it, though, and it made me think more critically about where I want to live when I graduate - knowing more about the regional and local planning processes as well as climate and transit plans and financing will be very helpful to make sure that the community where I someday buy property will be somewhat predictable for the coming decades. It made me want to be on my local zoning board, that's for sure.",

I wish there were more like it at Yale.",

If you are looking for a course that is very structured, with regular assignments that seek objective answers, this is not for you. But as a forum to discuss urban issues with a very knowledgeable and approachable professor with real-world experience, this course delivers. I was very satisfied.",

    "Keep up with the readings because Kooris refers to them regularly throughout his lectures (but does not delve into in-depth discussion); readings will help keep you focused on important topics covered in lecture. Make sure to nail down your paper topic early on; Kooris is more than happy to help students get in touch with people.",
