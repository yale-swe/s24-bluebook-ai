    "A really easy fifth class that also has good applications for psych majors. Even though lectures are fairly boring and the material could probably be covered in half the time, the way the course is taught is actually fairly helpful. The course centers around SPSS, a statistical analysis program that's almost universally used the psychology research. The course will give you a very solid understanding of how to use this program, analyze data, and read primary literature. The professor should change every year, so I can't really comment on the lecture style too much, but the content of lectures was pretty unimportant compared to the applications learned in section\/lab. There is a fairly large final project at the end of the year where you collect your own data and analyze it, but you'll be fairly prepared for it by the time you work through all of the problem sets which are basically just mini projects each week.",
    "Stats for people interested in psychology. It's a wonderful class and you should take it.",
    "Easy way to fulfill your statistics requirements and a bit fun at the same time",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "A QR that feels VERY APPLICABLE to many things that we encounter in every day life. Everyone's always trying to trick audiences by using statistics- don't get fooled again! Learn how to interpret primary-source journal articles by yourself and to take a second look at any advertiser touting certain numbers.",
    "Tests and homeworks are harder than regular Stats, but the class is much more interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are interested in statistics. I think it is a really valuable thing to learn and Professor Samanez-Larkin taught it in an engaging way.",
    "Take it! Take this course especially if you need a QR credit!",
    "Take it",
    "PSYC 200 was an awesome class! I needed a QR & my suitemate recommended it to me, after shopping the first day. I gave up a playwriting workshop for this & have NO REGRETS. Professor Samanez-Larkin really defined the class experience for me; he's a wonderful professor. The TF team was on-point; Piazza really worked as a forum to clarify any questions. The class is very accessible & you don't have to work in groups or look stuff up online to do the assignments (i.e., it doesn't have unreasonable expectations of you, you are equipped to do everything yourself!). You don't have a textbook; everything you need to know is taught in lecture. Sections (labs where you learn to use SPSS software) are the real crux of the class; skills from section are the ones measured in assignments, the research project, and the midterm\/final. The class has great pacing so you're never really stressed, & the professor was truly invested in what each of us was getting out of the class. If you're a stats whiz, this class is going to be too basic for you, but otherwise you should definitely take it with Professor Samanez-Larkin & surprise yourself with how much you look forward to the class!",
    "In PSYC 200, you will learn how to use correlation tests, regression tests, and ANOVA tests in a social science context.",
    "Take this only if you need it for the MCAT or psych major",
    "This is a great fifth class; you learn a lot of important information, but it is all broken up very well and into digestible chunks. Totally manageable workload, and Professor Samanez-Larkin is INCREDIBLE! He is hilarious and everyone (!!) in the class seems to love him.",
    "Definitely take it if you need this class for the psyc major. Or if you just want to learn some stats. A really good class.",
    "PSYC200 is a simple, psychology-based survey of statistical tests and concepts used in several professions. It's much less technical than other introductory statistics classes, focusing more on examples and functional use of statistics software than logical proofs, etc. The class involves 10 (relatively painless) problem sets and two exams, both of which he released 24 hours in advance (minus the data), so all you needed to do during the exam period is fill in the blanks for an outline you wrote the day before. Again, painless. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Great class if you are curious about statistics - very user-friendly but also gives you a good understanding of what stats mean when doing a psych study, reading scientific papers, or just being a smart consumer of media.",
    "I would recommend this to students in the sciences between also students who wish on understand stats. These skills are useful for all career paths and the class is pretty interactive.",
    "Looking back, I learned a lot. But I think I taught myself everything. Lectures are pointless. Section is where you actually learn. Then you reteach yourself everything the night before the final and you'll do well if you're lucky.",
    "Great introduction to statistics that is straightforward, well taught, clear, and not too difficult.",
    "Necessary but annoying because it shouldnt consume so much dang time",
    "I'm guessing you have to take this course, so take it with Professor Samanez-Larkin!!! The class is great at giving you the concepts to understand the theory behind the statistical terms and tests, but it doesn't expect you to regurgitate those concepts or utilize a lot of heavy pen and paper math. You'll learn statistics like you'll actually use it, especially if you find yourself reading or writing research papers down the road. Not to mention that Prof. Samanez-Larkin is engaging and good at making the large lecture feel small. Even if you don't have to take this class, I would recommend it. It's a QR that you will actually use in the future. Workload is very reasonable.",
    "This course was incredible. Professor Larkin is a great teacher (note: I said TEACHER not professor because he actually teaches instead of reciting some of the brilliant thoughts he's come up with) and really cares about his students. As a psychology\/pre-med student, I also found this course actually helpful and applicable to my daily life and other courses, because I can now understand psychology and empirical studies much better than I did before. I even used some of the statistics I learned in this class for my final project in BIOL 104. Overall, a great class (if taken with Larkin--I've not heard the same great things about Napier).",
    "A great class, despite how \"boring\" it may sound. The workload itself is pretty easy, but even for experienced statistics, the class is helpful to really solidify knowledge. No formula memorization: just application and having fun with SPSS. The TAs are all really great and homework grades are returned at a reasonable rate and are worth 30% of the grade: a good thing if you're willing to put in the work throughout the semester.",
    "Definitely worth it if you need a QR or want to take a statistics course or even just want to take a cool course that won't take up a huge chunk of time. Prof. Samanez-Larkin is very cool, very approachable, and does some great demonstrations in class. He's clear about what you need to know and what you don't need for the midterm and final. The project can get a little annoying but the TAs are very helpful and willing to go that extra step to help you out. Pretty straightforward and for anything that is unclear, both Prof. Samanez-Larkin and the TAs seem to be helpful. Definitely worth it to take this class. You learn a lot of interesting, applicable stuff, but in a less hectic, easy-paced way.",
    "If you're a psychology major, this class is required. Don't worry too much -- it's not a painful experience, the material is easy to grasp, and as long as you pay attention in section you'll do fine on the problem sets and the exams. However, if you're just looking for a QR credit, I wouldn't recommend this class. First of all, there's not that much quantitative reasoning involved, because all of the tests are run on SPSS without much explanation of the math or theory behind the formulas. It's also not necessarily an easy or \"gut\" class, because there is a fair amount of busy work. There are probably other QR classes that are more valuable and interesting.",
    "Before I rip on this class, I want to let you know that he\u2019s going to walk on his hands. In fact, he predicates the repeated example for the first half of the course upon professors walking on their hands. Then, like a performing bear in a circus, he does it; in our case, in the presence of Yale Broadcasting cameras. He asked that we didn\u2019t include that in the course review, but he was such a wretched professor, I spoiled it to spite him. And to be honest, these few sentences were so therapeutic in ways I didn't expect them to be. Back to the course at large, I would summarize PSYC 200 as the celebrity restaurant of the psych major. There was a lot of hype about how it was going to be a great class, but with Prof. Samanez-Larkin (He\u2019s so Trendy! SO trendy!) at the helm, it was atrocious. I found his incessant need to be accepted by the students sad and pathetic. I found his teaching style to be condescending and unfitting of Yale faculty. He\u2019s really hip and his life is really awesome \u2013 which are great pieces of information, but tragically irrelevant to my learning statistics in a way that will help me career-wise. He did a great job up to t-tests. Then he started sucking. Maybe if he spent less time advertising dance events and ending EVERY sentence with \u201cright?\u201d and a little more time delving into those far too complicated \"conceptual topics,\" I\u2019d know something about statistics. But alas, those are pipe dreams. I would not recommend this class if GSL is teaching it. I would in fact recommend that you get out immediately and find another offering. Wait until Prof. Napier is teaching and you might actually be able to do something.",
    "Interesting introduction to statistics that gives the student a baseline for consuming quantitative information.",
    "If you are looking for a comprehensive statistics course, this is probably not the class for you. But if you want a sprinkling of some of the statistics tests out there, then this is probably a good choice. Prof. SL is a fun professor to have.",
    "If you have a genuine interest in STATISTICS, take this as a follow-up to ANOTHER introductory statistics course. This class will serve as a supplement to that foundation by teaching things from a more practical end. You will learn how to use SPSS, report its output, and draw conclusions. More importantly, you'll learn how to analyze data sets and use them to construct research reports. If you're interested only in fulfilling requirements for the psychology major or med school applications, this may be ideal as well. It's not a lot of work, and the problem sets, midterm, and final are extremely predictable.",
    "YES. Take this over the stats 101 class.",
    "Easy stats class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I appreciated its conceptual approach. I feel very confident in my statistical abilities after taking it, and I can now understand\/analyze statistical claims that are present in numerous web articles",
    "I think this was a great introductory stats course and would recommend this course. What was especially rewarding about the class was being able to apply statistical analysis to real data using relevant stats software. I also think this course did a great job of providing the students with insight on how to be better statistical consumers. There is a fair amount of work but it's all very insightful.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is not too demanding and the class atmosphere is fun.",
    "Boring class and boring subject, but amazing prof. If you have to take stats for your major or discipline, take it with Samanez-Larkin. Don't even shop other stat classes!",
    "If you are going to take psych stats, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR SAMANEZ-LARKIN. He is awesome and he makes the class interesting. Weekly psets, a midterm, a final, and a project.",
    "Take it.It isnt the freshest material, but it is definitely an interesting way to approach the topic. It can function as a QR or you can use it as the statistics course for pre-med requirements.",
    "Professor S-L does a great job of making the topics relevant and relatively easy to understand, but the constraints are pretty tough given that it's generally dull basic statistical concepts. It's probably more enjoyable than other intro stats classes, but it's essentially a stripped down version that cuts out everything that isn't related to interpreting psychology studies and methods (like probability). A very math-minimal QR, as you will never have to more than basic fractions.",
    "This is a great class with Samanez-Larkin! It is also very practical and not at all like any other statistics class you will take, because it emphasizes using SPSS and real world data.",
    "Definitely take this course with Professor Samanez-Larkin! Even though this was his first time teaching the course, but from past year\u2019s evaluations, he definitely seemed to have made the course a lot better. In his lectures, he explained all the concepts super well and made sure that we understood everything. He included funny and cute things in the lectures that made every lecture worth going to! His powerpoints were super informative and clear and the designed the labs made sure that we understood everything. The HWs are long but definitely do-able and reinforces the week's new material. This way, at the end of the course you learned all the concepts very well having reviewed them every week with the HWs. I had such a great time in his class and I'm sure anyone would!",
    "Well-paced, interesting course. Would definitely recommend!",
    "PSYC 200 is a more conceptual, rather than quantitative, view of statistics. You should definitely take this course if you are interested in understanding why things are the way they are and would like to master SPSS, a program used to analyze data.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to other students especially students who are majoring in other than psychology and biology.",
    "If you're considering taking some kind of introductory STAT course to satisfy any requirement really, try and see if this course will work in your schedule. Seriously, the STAT department at Yale sucks canal water. I tried to satisfy the stat requirement for my major with STAT 101, and I had to drop the class. They overwhelm you with so many long equations and proofs that you don't even know what you're doing half the time. You don't learn simple stats concepts. This Psych STATS course, although it's through the psychology department, is BETTER than any other stats course you will find. This professor walks you through every concept and equation. The concepts you learn are the same as those taught in the STAT department. Better yet, the problem sets involve using a program (so you actually learn how to use a STATS software) to answer statistical questions with DATA FROM YOUR OWN CLASS! He doesn't move to fast through the material, and is super open to asking questions during lecture.",
    "Psyc 200 was not what I had hoped from a statistical course. It was extremely disorganized and poorly taught, and I do not feel that coming out of the course I have learned anything or developed any useful skills. The assignments were time consuming but busy work. Lecture did not teach anything, but the only useful stuff was covered in section. The exams placed a much greater weight on things that were not actually taught in the class (ex. discussion skills) than the actual ability to identify the correct statistical test to run and to report the results correctly. The project was also an extra assignment that was not useful but time consuming. Considering that all we did was learn how to use the basics of SPSS in this class, and no one even uses SPSS, I would say that this was not a useful course.",
    "Definitely take this course. Solid QR credit. Midterm is a little rough but the course is totally fair.",
    "Probably the easiest stats course, if that's what you're looking for. Workload is a few hours\/week for the weekly psets, and the material itself is very accessible. The final project is also a great opportunity to learn how to conduct and report your own mini-study.",
    "Yes. Take this class!",
    "PSYC 200 is fun, especially with Gregory Samanez-Larkin. It's not very much work, and covers useful concepts for many fields today. However, the emphasis on computers and SPSS made the course feel pretty useless and meaningful for me personally--I was looking to learn how to think about statistics so that I could use knowledge to react to statistical claims in the world around me, yet feel that all I learned was how to run a few types of tests on various types of data sets in SPSS. For Psych majors, I guess take this class because you have to. For those looking for an easy QR that's low stress and fun, it's a good thing to take. For those looking to really learn and expand their minds, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I'm assuming must students take PSYC 200 because they have to for their major, so whether or not I would recommend it doesn't really matter much. But there are multiple professors who teach it, so I would definitely recommend trying to take it with Professor Samanez-Larkin. This was his first year teaching it, but he clearly puts a ton of effort into making the class informative, but also interesting and engaging. Your grade is distributed across many different components of the class (homework assignments, midterm, final, project, participation) which takes some pressure off each individual thing. He uses clickers \/ ResponseWare technology so the data you analyze for the homework\/labs is actually collected from the class, which is kind of cool. For the midterm\/final, he gives use the test minus the data the day before, so you can figure out everything you have to do for the test, but just can't get the actual numbers. I wouldn't say I walked away from the class with a really strong theoretical\/conceptual understanding of statistics, but I definitely know how to use SPSS and run tests to analyze data, which is more important from a practical standpoint.",
    "PSYC 200 is an intro statistics course geared toward psychology research. Many of the examples given in class and data used for the problem sets was psychology-related, but the class is definitely applicable no matter where your interests lie and generally gives you a solid foundation for interpreting basic statistics, as well as computing them using the computer program SPSS. Definitely take it with Professor Samanez-Larkin. He is incredibly dedicated to the course and really made an effort to engage with and get to know his students, even though it was a large lecture. His energy and genuine passion for statistics and for thinking analytically about the world really made this class engaging.",
    "It is a good class, if you need a QR take it. You will have to put some work into it but it will be worth it, you will learn a ton. Not the easiest QR but you can get an A if you put in the work.",
    "Even if you're not premed or a psych major, if Professor Samanez-Larkin is teaching it, you should still take this class! I found stats incredibly useful and interesting, and Professor S-L is AWESOME! Midterm and final were a little harder than expected, however, so even though you get the questions (but not the data) beforehand, you still need to spend time the night before planning which tests to run and stuff. Still, overall not too much work and a good time!",
    "It's a great class to learn practical skills, and I'd definitely recommend this class to another student. Greg and the teaching fellows are all very fair graders and very helpful; they want to make sure you truly learn and apply your skills in the future, so it's nice that they're all so supportive. Take it! Great way to fulfill a QR",
    "It was an okay class that didn't really go into theory, and I think it's possible to enjoy this class. But the professor was very new and had a hard time making the material understandable, especially to those who have not taken stats before. I would only take this course if it is a requirement.",
    "I would take it. You have problem sets due every week, but section is super, super helpful in figuring them out. My TA even made extra slides for us and would hold 5-10 min review sessions at the beginning of each one to clear up any questions about lecture material. And section is where you learn how to use the software, so if you go to section you'll never have any questions about it. Also this was my first class with Piazza and although it can be a little hectic with all the questions being asked, it was pretty helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course because its interesting, easy, and with a good, dedicated professor.",
    "I mean if you need to take it it's not that bad. Otherwise, don't. It's basically learning how to use and interpret a computer program. If you don't anticipate needing to know the mechanics of SPSS for conducting Psyc research, DO NOT TAKE THIS. If you do, then fine, take it. It will be annoying but put in effort and you'll get through it without too much pain.",
    "I found it very interesting, which is high praise for a stats course in my opinion. He teaches you what the various tests mean and how you'd calculate them by hand so that you understand the concepts, and then it makes a lot more sense when you plug things into SPSS. The tests were awesome: open notes\/lecture slides\/internet, didn't require memorization of useless facts, and were great practice for research reports (I used my midterm as a reference for a research report I wrote in another class).",
    "It is more work than expected but a good intro stats class.",
    "Absolutely yes! Fascinating course -- a good QR that doesn't require any math, but rather more logical thinking, analysis, and psychology. Really cool topics!",
    "You're probably taking this class because you're a psych major and\/or pre-med. If you're pre-med, definitely take this stats class. I can't speak on the other stats classes, but I would bet they're not as good (especially if prof SL isn't teaching them). If you're a psych major and this is a requirement, then luck you, this is a fun class. The psets are relatively easy, prof SL is very accommodating and helpful, the group project is fun, and the exams are definitely less stressful than they are for other stats classes.",
    "A great class that you shouldn't be discouraged from, even if you have never taken stats before. PSYC stats gives you more real world and interesting applications, I think, and the format of this class was really effective. You have weekly psets but they reflect the same concepts you go over in lab sections, so even without previous experience with SPSS, learning the software is straightforward. Using clickers to answer questions in class and then using that data for the psets or midterm was really great, because you were able to apply what you were learning to real data. The end of semester project allows you to apply to course concepts to any question, using either already available databases or data you collect yourself. Although you have this in addition to a final, you gradually work on the project towards the end of the semester, completing the intro and methods for a pset for example, and it's pretty feasible, as long as you do start developing your ideas early. If you can take this class with Professor SL, even better!",
    "Amazing",
    "PSYC 200 is a great class and I would recommend it to everyone. The course is very manageable as far as work is concerned if you show up to lecture and discussion section, the material is fun and interesting, and the course does a great job of showing how statistics can be used in many other contexts. If possible, try to take the course with Professor Samanez-Larkin because he is an amazing professor and makes the class great. Anyone who thinks that they might need to know statistics at some point in their life (which is everyone) should take this class because you learn important skills and concepts in a fun and manageable class.",
    "Yes. If you need to take a QR or stats class take this one. I took it because I had to for my major and did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The Psets and labs really prepare you for the exam and the methods of analysis we learn actually feel relevant. My issue with most math\/stats courses is that they feel way too conceptual.",
    "It is a great overview on statistics especially for people wanting to study psychology. I think it is necessary for people to take this course if they want to do psychological research because it really helps you understand how to analyze data. Its pretty fun.",
    "Useful information",
    "I recommend taking any course with Professor S-L, even if it is not this one. He is an excellent lecturer and a passionate teacher. This course is not a hard one. I actually found it a little disappointing. I could have gotten more out of the course if it was harder.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. It wasn't a ton of work, it wasn't too hard, but I learned legitimately useful applications of statistics and when to apply them to real world research and interests.",
    "I think it is a great introduction to statistics. Professor Samanez-Larkin is wonderful and hilarious and really cares about the students and the material he is teaching. It is not too hard, but if you are not a very technological person, it might be more difficult than expected.",
    "I would definitely recommend psych stats with Professor Samanez-Larkin to another student, a psych major or otherwise. The class was very interesting and engaging and I feel provided me with very practical skills that can be used in other disciplines. The assignments were interesting and not terribly challenging. It was great that the final grade was based on many components, so there were many opportunities to try to improve. This class was great and I definitely recommend it.",
    "I think it's a good class, but some of the policies were a bit unfair. A lot of people had trouble with clickers and lost valuable points on that",
    "I would recommend Psych Stats to other students because I think, as a general rule, it's important to understand the statistics that surround us in everyday life. Professor Samanez-Larkin is fantastic, funny, and keeps things interesting, and the work isn't too demanding while still being satisfying. The class was a great experience, and while it wasn't my absolute favorite, I still learned a pretty good amount about how to interpret statistics, and run analyses on raw data.",
    "yes!! professor and structure of the class make it a course that should be on your shopping list!",
    "Definitely recommend, and take it with Greg if you can!!",
    "This is a great class to take if you need a stats class for pre-med or your psych major, or even if you just want to learn more about stats (without having to learn all the difficult math behind it).",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It helps you better understand how statistics are analyzed in the world.",
    "This is a great introduction to statistics for any student in or outside of the psych department. It covers many useful topics at a great pace. I recommend it to everyone.",
    "It's a good class if you need it",
    "I recommend taking the class. Easy, low commitment, less work than other courses.",
    "Basic intro statistics course for social science majors. Emphasizes the psych side of using statistics in real life. Great professor, easy QR credit, surprisingly fun.",
    "So, personally, I loved this class. I think this was largely due to Professor Samanez-Larkin, however, and realize that the teacher you have is entirely going to change whether or not this class is going to be fun or else tedious and a seeming waste of time. As a prospective psych major, I think it was important to get this understanding of statistics under my belt - but I won't lie, a lot of the class is based on just performing functions in SPSS (slash actually all of the class is this). You don't really get into the mathematical basis of things - you learn the general overview of what different statistical tests tell you, and then just begin performing\/interpreting them in SPSS. It is not a very difficult class as long as you pay attention in section to learn how to use SPSS - with that knowledge you can easily get through homework and midterm\/final. But really guys, Professor S-L is one of the best Yale has: you will love him, so if he teaches this class again (or especially if he teaches another class) TAKE IT.",
    "only if you must. :( no redeeming value.",
    "This class is a fair amount of work, but it's work that you can get done if you put in an hour or two every week. It's not an outright gut, but if you're good at basic quantitative reasoning, you'll probably do well. Easy class to take. I'd say take it if you need a QR. Prepare well for the midterm and final, they're probably not going to be similar to what you learned in class. Pay a lot of attention in lab, but you can chill in lecture because the lecture slides are great.",
