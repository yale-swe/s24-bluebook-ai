    "It was often a bit unclear what I was supposed to be taking from the course. More, short in-class assignments or cases, or an outline of goals for each lecture might have been useful. I did not learn much from the class and was often not challenged.",
    "The most important feedback I have is to ensure a TA is secured at the beginning of the semester who can commit significant time to the course and hold regular office hours. This is not commenting on Shane Burgan (who did a great job) -- but rather beginning the course with no set TA was just difficult as there were no regular office hours etc.",
    "The readings usually weren't directly tied into the lectures or assignments. It was difficult sometimes to know what I should be drawing from them, especially the denser ones.",
    "I would have loved more out of class practical assignments. I felt the course was too slow to learn as much as we could have and I don't know if the feedback\/involvement was enough to get as much out of the class as we could have. Having a very involved TA who understand the assignments and involved with the people would be really helpful.",
    "I loved this course and Prof Spaldingthough I found myself disinclined to attend class each week. This was in part due to personal preference, but we also had a few classes cancelled or delayed, which kinda got in the way of getting into a routine. Regardless, Deb is awesome and I wish I could've recorded her lectures--- because they were so grounded in reality. Its great to have someone so intelligent-- and similar to us-- really break these complex topics down into something understandable. I feel lucky for having the opportunity to take this course.",
    "I appreciate Deborah's approach to the subject matter. It is direct and accessible. Even so, it would have been helpful to have more support during the first weeks of class to ensure that those of us with no financial background were clear on the fundamentals. Perhaps next semester this is taught, having a committed Level 2 TA at the start of the course (and maybe a backup, just in case) would alleviate this need.",
    "Course is highly relevant and holds great potential value; the Deborah is smart, caring and flexible with students' schedules."

    "Introduction to basic concepts of managing timber as an asset",
    "Deb has a great sense of humor and really made an effort to answer student questions clearly and so everyone could understand. I like that she's a professional and could draw on real-life, current and applicable situations.",
    "The assignments were awesome",
    "Deb's lectures. She's just so real and honest with how things work in practice. That was really, really, infinitely, helpful.",
    "Gaining financial modeling skills Learning varying methods for assessing the value of land Incorporating ecosystem services into land valuation",
    "Professional experience and perspectives of the instructor were very valuable. Homeworks and readings were great.",
    "Deborah is extremely knowledgable and she's also funny, which makes for good class sessions. The other best aspect of the course is the assignments, which are intended to mimic real-world situations and require students to push their limits and work outside their comfort zones to answer complicated questions with limited information.",
    "The course was informal, and the teacher was flexible since she, herself, had a difficult schedule. The homework assignments helped me learn to use Excel and apply it to forest measurements and valuation.",
    "Learning how to build these models where you can do a financial evaluation.",
    "The class gives an understanding of how land appraisal works and how to manage ecosystems.",
    "The assignments. They were highly relevant, based on real-life information, and did a fantastic job of training us in financial modelling."

   "comments": [
    "Lectures were often too rushed or just not presented in a way that I took much away from them. They were not necessary to do the assignments, so it was difficult to engage with the material.",
    "I would reiterate my input earlier regarding the need for a TA from the beginning of the course. I really enjoyed Deborah as a lecturer and valued her experience-- it would just help to have someone support the \"infrastructure\" of the course and speed up returning assignments as I realize she is not a full time professor.",
    "I could have used more instruction on how to set up excel spreadsheets to do the financial projections. I wasn't always clear on what she was looking for in the assignments. Perhaps we could have done more financial examples in class. Deb was also frequently rushed during class period. The timing was a bit difficult for everyone, being late in the day and very quantitative, people were naturally tired and sick of being in lectures. I'd suggest an earlier class time next time the course is offered and make sure Deb has plenty of time to get over from work and settle in.",
    "Involvement with TA",
    "If there is a way to somehow have it at a more reliable\/available time for Prof and the guest speakers, that'd be great. What about Saturdays? Or some other time that would be easy for everyone to reliably attend. Also, I bet there are a bunch of people that would love to TA for this class!! It would be so much fun! It'd be great to find a TA a little earlier. Perhaps advertise for it in the spring semester, such that someone is dedicated for it in the fall. It could be interesting to have an SOM student TA it as well. It seems like there could be some potential interest-- that could also be useful for the students taking the course.",
    "Skills needed to complete assignments could have varied more. The course was largely just an assessment of cashflows, and simple NPV and IRR calculations.",
    "Class time often did not seem all that efficient.",
    "The beginning of the course, which focused on financial modeling basics, was clear and conveyed a lot of concrete and useable information. The latter part of the course, while more interesting, also provided fewer applicable takeaways. Perhaps in future years these sessions can be used to tie the larger, more interesting concepts back to how the financial modeling and decision-making works.",
    "The homework assignments were very applied, while the lectures were much more theoretical. Showing us how to complete basic forms in class would help understand the sometimes very sophisticated models needed for homework assignments. This course should NOT be targeted to both SOM and FES students. Their relative abilities with financial modeling are dramatically different which places unnecessary pressure on the instructor to meet everyones needs. This is FES, and the course should get into gritty details related to the specific fields of interest with hands on modeling with the instructor(s).",
    "We really, really need a class on how to build models like that in the course. There were a lot of people that have never done one and just supplying us with a pre-formed model we should adopt is (especially if you are not that well-versed in Excel) just not a viable option. So connecting the course material better to the assignments would be the biggest improvement I could see.",
    "The class would benefit from a field trip. Also, a stable TA who will be the watchdog for assignments, as well as a helping hand.",
    "Organization of the lectures - needs to be more consistent, start\/end on time (esp. with guest lecturers), etc.",
