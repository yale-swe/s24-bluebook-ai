    "mambo is truly as easy as its reputation: that being said, if you show up and skim the readings, you really can learn a lot. if you are actually interested in african art and dance, this class will be super enjoyable.actually go to lecture. RFT may be hard to hear, but he is very smart and cares deeply about his students. if you participate and show up, mambo can be ridiculously fun.",
    "Take this class because it is very easy to do well in it and the mood in class is always happy. Master T is very funny.",
    "yes",
    "This is a good course if you want a credit without a lot of work. There are two hour tests (essays on a very general prompt) and a 10-page paper on a topic of your choice. If you really want, it is possible to learn a lot from this class.",
    "YES......BECAUSE OF MASTER T.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course if you want to learn about a new topic and not have a huge work commitment. There is the term paper and two tests but if you go to the lectures you will be fine.",
    "Absolutely, take it with T. He's the best!",
    "GREAT...take it. without a doubt, best class. no work and just two tests. great 5th class",
    "It is a great way to get an art history class in, but do not think you can just slide by. Yes I would...you learn a lot!",
    "Don't take it. It's like 3 different classes- one for the paper, one for the material on the exams, and one for the lectures. The information barely overlapped between the 3. Also Professor Thompson likes to talk over audio and videos he plays and it's super hard to hear him. Also if you don't like dancing in front of people, avoid it. He'll make you dance, no matter where you hide.",
    "It's a ton of fun. You learn a lot. There's not a ton of work. The only things you turn in are the final paper and 2 exams. So, I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Great class...entertaining, and you actually learn quite a lot.",
    "It's a good class, take it.",
    "Yes and no, depending on your TA.",
    "This class was interesting if you are willing to learn about other cultures and truly take the time to understand how modern practices and ideas developed over time. I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "100% yes.",
    "Philosophers often question if there is such a thing as a soul. This class renders this question irrelevant because whether or not the soul exists it will be wrenched by this course and the beauty of the Afro Atlantic traditions of the MAMBO. As for Robert Farris Thompson, some men are legends, this man drops legends off in the toilet. His passion is unparalleled. Many people do not even attend class but those who do are graced by the essence of cool which RFT carries as if possesed by Shango, the thunder God himself. Take this class and take it to heart and you will be pleasantly surprised.",
    "Yes, I recommend it because it is a fun class.",
    "The class is a fun way to learn about the history of African dance art and music\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093its roots and traditions, and how it became prevalent in the west, NY especially. It's a very relaxed class, and good to take if you've already got a few tough courses for the semester.",
    "Awesome easy 5th class .",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. There is no course like Mambo.",
    "I would highly highly highly highly recommend this class. It's so stress-free. You only have to study or work maybe 4-6 days out of the entire semester. Lectures are very relaxed. Not many people would go, but those that did were rewarded by watching the amazing Master T dance with football players. The incredible thing about this class is that you actually learn stuff. Shocking. You could miss lectures to work on other classes or sleep in and then cram the day before for the tests and do very well.",
    "If you don't take this class, you're crazy. Not only is it incredibly low stress, but its also incredibly fun. You dance in class, play drums, look at awesome artwork, and are constantly entertained by Master T's antics. A lot of people take this class, skip every lecture, cram for the tests, and pull off okay grades.. sometimes even good grades. They run around, laughing off Mambo as a classic gut class, even though they most likely brought up the bottom of the class with B's and C's. Thats great for them. I would recommend actually going. if you're looking to relax for an hour a day, engage, have some fun with it, and zone out to what is practically a comedy routine put on by master T at 11:30 every day, then you are rewarded when you have almost no extra preparation to do for the exams. I just laughed, danced, chanted, and sang my way to an A, and all I had to do was show up and be entertained for an hour. For all you science, econ, and math majors.. grab the free HU creditAgain, you have to be crazy not to take this class. I will remember it for the rest of my life.",
    "Yes. The class will change your view of the world and shape your knowledge around African culture. Also disproves the notion that Africans are barbaric and primitive.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is fun, interesting and not hard.",
    "I would recommend the course for anyone who is looking for a lighter load, but at the same time wiling to do the readings and follow the course agenda. such an interesting and fun class.",
    "Mambo is a very interesting class where you learn about different dances and music that relate to African American cultures. I would definitely recommend it to other students because it is stimulating, informative, and simply a fun class to take.",
    "The class is great to take when your other courses have a heavy workload. You do not need to go to lectures but going to the lectures is a treat because Professor Thompson is amazing. There are two hours tests and one research paper (which isn't bad if you manage your time correctly). The tests are relatively easy if you go to lecture.",
    "Awesome class! This is the most memorable and entertaining class I have ever been in. Professor Thompson is a legend and it is a privilege to learn from someone so respected in his field. Lectures are always interesting; his enthusiasm is contagious and he makes the class fun and hands-on. You learn a lot that will change your perspective on how you view the world around you, and have a great time doing it.",
    "It is an enjoyable experience unlike any other class you will take at yale.",
    "This class is a journey through Afro-Atlantic culture and explores many avenues of evolution through various dance, art, and music styles.I recommend this course because I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "This class is amazing! Even though master T doesn't teach in a very structured way, everyone learns tons and comes to appreciate Black culture more by the end of the course. Everyone at Yale should definitely take it some point.",
    "Take it!",
    "Mambo is a fun, exciting fifth class. There are a few good guest lecturers, and the lectures with the professor are engaging. He often picks on students to perform a dance with him and it's always fun and not at all scary.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "Take it! You'll stress the day before each test and a couple days before the paper is due, but totally worth it. Grading (in my experience) was very fair and rather generous. Go to class - RFT is hard to understand at times, but sitting in class is a lot of fun, and he tells the best stories.",
    "Fun, laid back and easy.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is looking for an interesting subject with a more than manageable workload",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Just for the pure joy of hearing and seeing Master T lecture. He is unlike any other professor. He exudes a love of the material and a spirit unmatched by his colleagues. If you're looking for structure in class, however, this is not the class to take. If you're willing to go along for the ride and just let the hilariousness\/wisdom of T pour over you then go for it!",
    "Good class to take. Not too difficult and very interesting.",
    "Mambo can be entertaining and quite fun, but frustrating at the same time. There literally is no syllabus or structure to the class. Grading seems to be similarly opaque and arbitrary so make sure you get a good TA.",
    "A very important and necessary course for anyone interested in learning something about the continuities between Black culture(s) in the Atlantic World.",
    "Honestly the best way to get an A in the course, regardless of who your TA is, is the following: First and foremost, do not use the team notes that are passed around. The TA's are on the lookout for them and immediately give you a lower grade just for using them. Secondly, come up with a good thesis. The exam questions are extremely general (e.g. \"Describe the black visual tradition and how you know it when you see it or hear it?\"or \"What have you learned since the last exam\"), so a good thesis is pretty easy to do. In fact, if you start studying early, you can probably ask the TA about how your thesis sounds. Once you have a pretty good thesis, come up with three examples from the course, so far, that support your thesis. Again, you do not need to describe everything you learned, which is a common mistake most students in the class make. Write a paragraph for each example using your notes, internet, and the book about each example, and memorize 2 quotes for each example for a total of 6 quotes from the book. It is also helpful to drop a few people in there. You definitely don't have to read the whole book to pick out some intellectual sounding quotes. For each paragraph refer back to how this example relates to your thesis. Finally, add another paragraph with few tidbits that he says in the review session (e.g. list the five african tribes with descriptions; name 7 artists), and use some book quotes. Last, but not least, put a conclusion. In essence, you should prepare an essay before you even show up to class and memorize it.",
    "This is a very interesting and fun class in which Dr. Robert Farris Thompson(aka Master T)explores the music and art traditions of different African tribes; the general traits of the African art and music tradition; and finally how those traits have been transplanted to the \"New World\" and how they can be seen in dances like Mambo, Tango, Bomba, Hip Hop and many others. Throughout the course, Master T invited a couple of speakers to demonstrate things like Capoeira or Bomba. Master T focuses a lot on demonstrations-whether it be singing or dancing, and he calls out people in class to do these things. His explanation: You won't remember a lot of the things you learn in college, but you'll remember that. Master T is very passionate about this subject and an expert in the field. Though you may not agree with everything being taught, it's an interesting perspective and this is a class worth taking if you just want to explore and have fun while doing it. Nevertheless, despite popular opinion, I would not regard this as a gut class. You'll have to work for your grade.Strength: Passionate Professor, Engaging through DemonstrationsWeakness: Lack of Structure in the Coursevery Ambiguous Questions for both the Midterm and FinalMay be at loss in knowing what to study for the midterm and final",
    "Mambo. Virtually no work, but be careful about getting a good TA--some of them have chips on their shoulders. Also, if you want an A, don't follow verbatim the study guides that all the teams send around--everyone taking the class writes the same essays.",
    "Take it...T is a hero",
    "I would recommend the class!",
    "Great class. I would definitely recommend taking the course.",
    "Absolutely, its introduces african art and its influence in modern america",
    "I would summarize it as a very interesting and involving course that allows you to learn and interact with a different culture.",
    "I'd recommend, but its more work than you'd think.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to people. I learned a lot and the class was not only interesting but also a lot of fun.",
    "definitely the definition of a gut class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is interesting, fun, and Master T is amazing!",
    "Take it!",
    "I would honestly recommend taking this credit\/d later in your time at Yale when you just need to fill your schedule. It's a perfect senior class.",
    "It was definitely an enjoyable class. I had a lot of fun with it and would recommend it. The subject encompassed a fair amount of material, but it was interesting to learn about.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Every student should be taught by Master T at least once.",
    "YES. New York Mambo is an experience that you owe it to yourself to have while you are at Yale. Master T is both hilarious, but also really very brilliant, and you'll learn things that are very important to know about that you can't get anywhere else. On the one hand ,you'll crack up every class and enjoy going to Mambo more than any other class (and please do yourself a favor and actually come), but you'll also leave with a newfound appreciation for African and African-American culture, and knowing something more about the arts (music, dance, art) than you did before. It's also very little work, and is an amazing way to fill out a schedule, especially if your other classes are intense or pretty heavy-duty. Do yourself a favor and just take it.",
    "Every student should take a class by this guy before he ends his teaching career.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is a fun an interesting class with great guest performers. You have to do a lot of studying for the midterm and final and put effort in to the paper but other than that it is not too difficult",
    "Extremely easy gut class. Possibly the easiest class at Yale. It can be incredibly boring, but if you just casually look up the dances that Professor Thompson looks up then it can be interesting. Take if you want\/need an A.",
    "Take it but beware of the TA's, especially if you get a hard one.",
    "definitely. great Hu credit and if you pay even the slightest attention it is impossible not to walk away quite impressed by the development of african culture through the slave trade.",
    "Yes, very fun and interesting!",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course for every Yale student.",
    "Fill in the blanks:Violins are strung with cat _ _ _Rain from your roof collects in a _ _ _terYour first instinct is your _ _ _ reactionMy _ _ _ reaction was to take this class",
    "The course work is not very demanding but you should take it seriously as he is a man you can really learn a lot from.",
    "Take it",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who is trulyinterested in the material. The loose structure of the course is not conducive to anyone else. If you want to take the course simply for a good grade, then you will not enjoy it. Lectures will seem pointless.",
    "I would recommend it as a quintessential Yale class, but really think students should take Prof. Thompson more seriously despite his eccentrisim. He's definitely brilliant and I wish I had taken advantage of having him teaching from the very beginning.",
    "I would summarize it as an excellent and interesting class that I would highly recommend to any students. It is a Yale course that every student should take and experience an excellent teacher like Master T. It is truly a gift to study under a great professor as Master T.",
    "Amazing, take it! Prof. T is Dat Dude.",
    "Overall this was a great course with an easy workload!",
    "Take the class. It's a great fifth or sixth class, a no-stress credit.",
    "Great class, take it if you have the time in your schedules. Entertaining professor, manageable work load, interesting material if you pay attention, and not too needy in terms of course requirements. Take it as a great 4th, 5th, 6th or even 7th class. Enjoy!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others. This class gives a great background to African culture. It is very interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it! It was entertaining, and I learned a lot about a topic I had no background in. The workload was very enjoyable as well.",
    "Take it! As a science major, I was hoping to take a fun and interesting humanities course. Mambo was a great experience. Master T is an expert in his field. Also Dennis is a great TA but I think TAs are randomly assigned.",
    "I would recommend taking the course because of its interesting material.",
    "It was a great class that taught a lot about the African culture as well as how African influence is seen in today's culture.",
    "I recommend",
    "It was a class that every Yale student should take."
