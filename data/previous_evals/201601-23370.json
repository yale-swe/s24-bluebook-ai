It has also helped me become a more effective communicator. Readings were great, very useful. The workload was slightly above average - readings, weekly papers, huge final project but definitely worth it."

I had the opportunity to interact with them in a small group setting and outside the classroom, and I thought it was a great way to really delve into campaigning and to network.",
    "Hearing from so many guest speakers and being able to have a conversation with them!",
    "The guest speakers were excellent and I really enjoyed the simulation of a campaign planning meeting.",
    "The weekly guest speakers were by far the best aspect of the class. Hearing from professionals in a variety of active campaigns was extremely valuable.",
    "This class is awesome! There are many speakers brought in, but Hank does a great job of focusing them on campaigns, so we get a well-rounded look at what running an environmental advocacy campaign is all about. I learned a ton in this class."

It is not just about campaigns - it is about critical thinking, problem solving, communicating, negotiating -all skills that FESers need! I think the speakers are advertised a lot more than these skills. The skills might be attractive to a broader population at FES.",
    "A small thing, but the readings were often not available until just a few days before class. It would be helpful to have all the readings available at the beginning of the semester.",

    "I thought that perhaps the best part of the course was when we got together and simulated a campaign project planning meeting. We all assumed different roles and acted as though we were planning out an entire environmental campaign. This gave us real insight into how this process works in the professional world. I would suggest having more such exercises in this class in the future."

    "If you're at all interested in campaigning, whether it's related to environmental, environmental justice, or health issues, I fully recommend that you take this class. There are so many aspects to campaigning, that you'll definitely leave the course having learned a lot.",
    "I'm not interested in campaign work at all and I am extremely happy with my decision to take this class. I have been given the opportunity to work on so many communication skills on a variety of environmental topics in a great environment. It is taught by a practitioner -- and if you've never taken a class with a \"non-academic\", you must. This class had a slightly above-average workload but to get the most out of the class it was necessary.",
    "Take this course! Start your final paper early!",
    "Take it! It's very valuable to understanding how environmental (and other) change is made in both the US and globally. Plus, you get to meet some incredible campaigners.",
    "Absolutely take it! Hank is the best--he really cares about his students and is great to talk to about career paths. This class is really about getting stuff done. Lots of FES classes focus on the problems, few focus on solutions. So, if you're interested in changing the world, here's a good class to start."
