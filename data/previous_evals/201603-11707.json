    "My understanding of Spanish grammar and my ability to read Spanish improved tremendously. The class gave me confidence to speak in more difficult tenses but I find that I still struggle to speak with fluency.",
    "I definitely became much more fluent in the language and learned a lot more vocabulary.",
    "I became more proficient in my spanish speaking and writing. The daily homework and classwork does a great job at getting your speed of vocabulary up to date. I also became more culturally aware with what was going on in Spanish speaking countries."

   "comments": [
    "I think that different stories should be picked that don't romanticize Native Americans or include cultural appropriation. If these stories are still used in the course then the professor needs to address these issues.",
    "One weakness of this course was the lack of time spent speaking. Being forced to formulate your thoughts and become comfortable speaking in Spanish was not a priority.",
    "There are many strengths to the organization. I was very impressed by the level of structure of the class. The review materials were really great. One thing is that I would make it so the supersite does not take off points for not capitalizing a letter.",
    "The course can at times be very fast, almost too fast. However this speed makes the student stay on top of his\/her work daily which helps their reading and writing develop faster.",
    "Solid Spanish course. The biggest strength was Professor Tortora; she made the course engaging, interesting, and was always available to provide help when needed."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The professors are great. It's a lot of work but worth it if you want to learn Spanish.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because the department is filled with nice and welcoming professors. If you commit yourself fully than this course can be very prosperous.",
    "Spanish 130 is a great continuation of the Spanish program. I learned a lot and definitely became a much better Spanish speaker. The one thing to keep in mind is that there is a fair amount of homework on every night of the week."
