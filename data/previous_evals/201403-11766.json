   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone who wants to start a new language. It has been very enjoyable and is a fun way to meet the yale language requirement, especially if you're interested in taking a language outside of the traditional french, spanish, etc.",
    "As other reviews will tell you this is an excellent class. The instructor clearly cared a lot for his students and was prepared to devote a lot of time outside of class to ensuring that all students understood the material. Looking back, I am very surprised by how much my Swahili had improved by the end of the class. The homeworks were well written, and helped drill what we learned in class. Swahili was also taught predominantly in English rather in Swahili. This is a welcome change from other classes (that teach in the language of instruction) because it made the teaching and any instructions very clear without sacrificing on learning verbal skill. The exams were on relevant material and everything was graded fairly. If you put in the work, you can definitely do well and get an A. The other thing that I liked about this class is that the instructors all showed a lot of understanding for the difficulties that students face during college and try hard to be accommodating.",
    "Easy language, fun class.",
    "I can't recommend taking L1 Swahili enough. The class is an absolute joy to be in, and I learned more that I would have ever imagined in one semester. The class includes a variety of activities that will help you cement your knowledge of the language, including a lot of dialogues with your classmates and some writing activities. If you're at all planning on taking a langauge at Yale, I would urge you to consider taking Swahili, as I greatly enjoyed it and am looking forward to learning more of the language."
