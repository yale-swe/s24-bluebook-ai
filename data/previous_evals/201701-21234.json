   "comments": [
    "I learned how to take better pictures, regardless of medium. I learned how to take more intentional and thoughtful photos. I learned how to develop photos in the darkroom, and in the process learned a lot of patience, carefulness, discipline, and creativity. I learned how to appreciate and critique the photography of others.",
    "I gained a fair deal of technical knowledge about photographing with a 35mm camera and printing in the darkroom. I learned a bit about photography as an art form and some about famous photographers.",
    "You'll learn how to load 35mm film into an analog camera, take pictures with that analog camera, develop the film into negatives, enlarge the negatives to make big prints of your pictures. You'll learn a brief history of photography, and you'll learn how to talk about photography. You'll learn to think critically about your own work, your classmates' work, and the work of 'professional' artists.",
    "I have learned how to take film photography, developing negatives & prints in the dark room, and how to make enlargement. Throughout the semester, I have gained much knowledge on the history of modern photography and top photographers.",
    "I learned to find a new way of looking at art. Art by capturing and transforming the world instead of through creation. Giving strict rules to art also gave me a new perspective on media."

   "comments": [
    "With Ted teaching, it is very open ended, which on the one hand is pleasant, but a bit more direction might have been nice.",
    "It is very expensive, which likely excludes financial aid students like me.",
    "Strengths-good intro to darkroom, survey of famous black and white photography Weaknesses-more guidance could be good, critiques sometimes too harsh",
    "One thing that my have improved better would be more visits to photography exhibitions and outings to provide opportunities to shoot together as a class. It would be interesting and helpful to learn from each other's perspective.",
    "There should be more opportunities for students to receive feedback on their work. Besides the basics of darkroom photography, the actual capturing of an effective photograph is downplayed."

   "comments": [
    "I am a graduating senior and this is one of the classes I am most thankful to have taken at Yale. I learned so much and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I am so glad to have learned this new skill, as well as to appreciate photography in a way I never did before. Also Ted is the best, never a dull moment.",
    "This is overall a good course. With Ted, it's pretty open-ended, you just take pictures of what you feel like as opposed to for assignments. So it's probably best to have some ideas of what you'll do coming in to the course. Developing film and making prints takes a while, so expect to put a fair bit of time into this course, otherwise you won't get much out of it, but it's about average workload wise, not at all overwhelming.",
    "Take it if you have the time, have the money, and you really want to learn. Don't take this during a busy semester and don't even think about taking it as a fifth class. You can get treasure chests of wisdom from this course if you're willing to take it completely seriously and invest yourself. This is a great course for someone who wants to push themselves artistically and get a taste of art school\/the art major\/the art department.",
    "Not a great credit d class",
    "Yes, everyone should have a photographer's eye to develop critical observation and thinking.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. As an introduction to photography, black and white photography forces one to work on skills and have an understanding of the medium that digital does not offer."
