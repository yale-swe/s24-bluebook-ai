   "comments": [
    "Good intro level class for learning about genetics and how genes control development. There's a heavy emphasis on model organisms, proving necessity\/sufficiency, and experimental evidence for theoretical ideas. Instead of p-sets, there is one long research project that initially seems insurmountable but is actually pretty interesting once you delve into it. We had weekly quizzes, which were pretty reminiscent of and at about the same level as Bio 101, and there was a final exam. You read a scientific paper each week and discuss it in section. Overall, the class was interesting, touched on a lot of new topics, and wasn't too much work. I would recommend Bio 103 to another student because of the interesting material and Professor Slack. You probably have to take it as a pre-req, anyways.",
    "Bio 103 is an overview of developmental biology and covers the main points that pertain to the topic. The information is disseminated in case study form.",
    "BIO 103 was probably the best of 101-103. I would recommend it. Its focus on important experimental concepts relevant today made it memorable and compelling.",
    "Typical introductory bio course in the 101-104 sequence. Maybe the toughest of the four but definitely the most interesting. Class is full of premeds who work very hard so expect a tough curve with high averages on the quizzes and final.",
    "yeah I mean if you have to take a bio course, it's a pretty good one to take.",
    "103 is by far the best module. It's definitely worth suffering through 102 for and it's actually very interesting. Professor Slack really knows how to teach an intro class to undergrads and he's a very interesting lecturer.",
    "I really loved Biol 103. The concepts were never really abstract, for we always talked about ways that we could apply what we learned in the real world, but at times the concepts weren't presented in the most clear way. Even follow-up piazza questions were hard to follow. But this, I think, has to do with the nature of the content, and not with the professors' or TAs' faults, because the content we learned was beyond (not too beyond, but beyond enough) what a typical AP Biology course would cover for genetics. Overall, I liked the content, and this just confirmed my future involvement with genetics research and taking more advanced genetic courses!",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably have a good reason. Just keep that reason in mind as you go through this module. Fingers crossed for you that they've changed the homework a bit.",
    "BIOL 103 is, of course, a requirement for any major in the biological sciences, so therefore I suppose that I would recommend it to anyone interested in taking biology. However, it was more than just a requirement to me in that it was the most enjoyable of the intro bio sequence segments that I have taken so far. I can legitimately say that I enjoyed this course, unlike 101 and 102, which I found interesting but would not have taken if I hadn't been require to. Professor Slack is a very good teacher and I would strongly recommend him.",
    "A well taught course in developmental biology and genetics. Professor Slack is an engaging lecturer. On occasion the elaborate metaphors or analogies used to explain certain concepts muddle things for me, but for others they were effective and helpful. Professor Chandhoke is phenomenal in all regards. I think, perhaps more so than the other modules I've taken thus far (101 and 102), a lot of prior knowledge is assumed, especially when the course starts to focus on genetics. As somebody who hadn't taken a biology class since Freshmen year of high school, coming to slides that said something in the vain of \"you should know mendelian genetics\" wasn't helpful. It's very doable if you put in the extra time and effort to fill in the gaps yourself, but I feel as though the purpose of a foundational biology course should be to fill in any gaps before getting into more specialized sub-fields. The papers were excellent! Don't get me wrong, Dr. Mooseker is the BEST, but some of the papers were hard to tackle. In contrast the papers for 103 seemed much more manageable to me. (Though, maybe that's due in part because 102 did an excellent job prepping me for 103!) Finally, in reflection I can't say how much I appreciate having to write the research project proposal. It was great to have guidance as to how to write a proposal, now that I have to write one for summer research grants etc.",
    "Fairly straightforward class on genetics and development. The weekly quizzes aren't a big deal if you attend lecture and review the slides a couple of times beforehand. The homework assignments, which involve creating a research proposal, provide a great opportunity for learning about scientific writing.",
    "The hardest intro circuit course, but probably also the most useful.",
    "A clear, interesting, and applicable module on genetics! Its applications in cancer were fascinating and very emphasized.",
    "This is a course that you need for the bio sequence. Im not sure its entirely enthralling, but it's a solid preparation for other things you are probably going to want to do. However this really isn't a great course just for a science credit. It is highly contextualized as a preparation for more coursework.",
    "If you do not need to take this class, you are extremely lucky. Each week, I felt like I went to class to get information that was either extraneous or could have been distilled into a 10 minute lecture as opposed to a 75 minute one. I do not feel that I learned an appreciable amount, and this class almost made me dislike genetics, an area in which I am extremely interested.",
    "I would recommend Bio 103 to another student, but I would strongly suggest consistent reviewing of lecture material and practicing the concepts explained in lecture. Quizzes can be tricky, but if you are interested in the material and willing to work hard to understand concepts you don't understand, the concepts will come together in a really pleasing way. TAs are really great for the course, also! Use them as a resource when working on your research project.",
    "BIOL 103 is a fair and interesting class if you are interested in genetics. Definitely take it if you need it as a requirement, and maybe even take it if you are genuinely interested in genetics. The only problem is that you will be competing against over a hundred potential pre-meds, which can make it difficult to do really well grade-wise. Overall, it was definitely a decent class. A very welcomed improvement from 102.",
    "Do not take unless you absolutely have to.",
    "Yes, a great and interesting introductory course that exposes you to research methodology and thinking.",
    "I would definitely recommend Biol103 to students looking to major in a field related to biology, or even to those who aren't. The material covered in this course is interesting and the examples that Professor Slack gives really help you understand the different topics. Professor Slack and Surjit are wonderful people."
