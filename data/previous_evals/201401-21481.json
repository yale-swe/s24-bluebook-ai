    "take it",
    "It's a gem",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who's just starting out in the major and needs to get a good, solid overview of comparative politics. if you attend lecture and keep up with the readings you'll learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend PLSC for anyone who wants a general grasp of political science knowledge, but for more advanced political science students, I might recommend something more complex and higher level.",
    "Straightforward political science class. Not a class in politics, in the modern sense of the word, but a class on the dynamics of government and conflict in the past and in the developing world.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in trying to explain broad trends in international politics, but it is not a survey course.",
    "Very light but very solid course for someone interested in political theory. You read a couple theoretical articles for each class, and learn the basic tenets and suggested mechanisms of state formation, democracy, autocracy, conflict, and etc. Interesting readings and often really interesting lectures. Easiest class I've ever taken, but a great overall light class to add a schedule, and very strong for an introductory survey Political Science class. Note, though, that you will get literally nothing out of the class if you don't do (and engage with) the readings. If Beth is leading a section, take it.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would take this class but it is not your average PLSC class in that a lot more critical thinking and analysis is required and it is more grounded in the theoretical rather than practical implications. The mid-term is very easy if you've done your reading each week and the papers are not challenging, in that you are encouraged to give your own opinion rather than research.",
    "Definitely! I enjoyed the class and learned more about what I cared about like insurgencies and developing countries. It's a great introduction to an underrated part of Political Science. The professor is great--just make sure to get a good TF!",
    "Definitely take this course, especially if you are thinking of majoring in the field. You learn a lot and it challenges you to think but is not hard to do well in.",
    "Overview of different ways to compare politics. Would recommend if you don't mind very theory heavy lectures.",
    "It's too basic. You definitely leave the class feeling you've learned something but it's quite on the surface and stuff that you could learn just be reading a book",
    "PLSC 116 is a good introductory course for those who want a general review of the leading voices in comparative politics. It's relatively straightforward and assessments are manageable. Take it if you want to dabble in political science."
