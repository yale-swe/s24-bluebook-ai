    "There is a large gap in the teaching abilities of the professors. The tests are fair and the videos every night help to learn the material.",
    "The class covered a lot of information. However, that was part of the problem. It seemed to cover too much information. It was hard to keep up with all of the work and information as the class continued on. It would have been slightly more beneficial to learn less information and go deeper into the topics we did cover."

    "I would recommend this class to another student if it is required by their major. If not, I feel it would be way more interesting to take a different QR class and gain credit in a class that is actually more interesting to them than a general calculus class. It's not the most stimulating class."
