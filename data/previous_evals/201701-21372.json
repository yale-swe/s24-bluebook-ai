   "comments": [
    "Lots of close reading. Lots of writing. And discussing.",
    "I was exposed to some of the best poets of the English canon and learned techniques for close reading. I also improved my writing skills within the context of literary analysis.",
    "I learned historical context for many poems and poets. I also learned how to analyze poetry on a deeper level and how to make stronger arguments in essays.",
    "This course offers a great glimpse into Major English Poetry, but it does so through historical periods rather than mere individual poetic talent. All the others read represented a time period and energy of an era, which made reading them very approachable.",
    "By the end I actually did have a greater appreciation for poetry. I got better at doing close readings, and I now have a greater foundation for understanding other literary works.",
    "This course provided a really helpful and enlightening overview of the canon of English poetry. Prof. North did a wonderful job of contextualizing the material, as well as engaging with the readings' more problematic elements in a careful and rigorous way. I also found the essays particularly the broadness of the prompts and the specificity of the feedback extremely useful in promoting experimental but thoughtful analysis. Overall, it was a wonderful course, and Prof. North a wonderful person with whom to take it.",
    "A reminder that I like poetry, a confirmation that no one who ever wrote in English could forget about William Shakespeare, the making of some friends, a more serious rigor in my close reading and analysis of a few lines of poetry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was incredible. Professor North is great; enthusiastic about the subject, breaks down\/synthesizes major points clearly, and can get everyone to laugh\/feel comfortable. Weakness? I generally wish I received essay assignments\/prompts\/essay comments+grade sooner. I would have loved to received the essay prompts more than one week in advance.",
    "The course was excellent! In my opinion there were no weaknesses!",
    "Professor North is great! His level of engagement in the course makes it incredible! He is willing to admit the strengths and faults of all the different poets.",
    "Weakness: Paradise Lost is being moved to 125. Strength: If Paradise Lost were not moved to 125.",
    "I mean, thank god you guys changed the English major requirements because the cannon actually blows. Obviously Joe is brilliant and much better at discussing the obvious problems in these texts than Minnis who didn't even address them, but still like I completely checked out for Pope because his stuff is not only offensive but totally inane. I get that he's okay at rhyming and maybe clever about using meter, but those are objectively the least interesting aspects of poetry. The class would be much better sans Pope with more modern poets.",
    "One of this course's major strengths was its emphasis on close-reading, not as divorced from contextual, historicist ways of thinking about literature, but as inextricable from them. I really appreciated the way Prof. North was able to take us so deep into a text that we could see what was outside it I found this especially fascinating when we arrived at Eliot, and it really opened my eyes to what could be possible in an English classroom. I really do wish, though, that the syllabus for this course could be updated a bit. Please. No more Pope. That poetry and I were like opposite poles of a magnet; the more I tried to like it, the less I wound up liking it. That is all. Everything else on the syllabus I loved. I promise.",
    "I don't know how English 125\/6 could be improved but I know it makes me sad. It's sad to walk into a room where a bunch of people don't care, where you've had a few days only to read Paradise Lost and The Waste Land, where you gasp at clutch pathetically at erudition and profundity before the class ends and it's a new poet. I don't want to be so rude as to suggest how this class could be reformed when there are many professors working hard on reform. I don't know. Maybe more reading? More papers? One ten page paper? We are sort of under the yoke of identity politics right now, which means we pay little to no attention to things like metre. We know no literary terms whatsoever... does that matter? I don't know. I have no idea what actual erudition looks like, but intuitively I must say that I don't think I found it in 125\/6. Can Directed Studies please count for something? I got more out of King Lear, Wordsworth and Milton there than I did here, and I feel like I've wasted two classes on 125\/6 if only because I did them in DS and had the great fortune and privilege to take similar classes in high school. Is flexibility the answer here? Again, I don't know, and I'm sorry for my querulous, petulant tone, but when one slips into do the cot\/benefit analysis and thinks how much money is being spent on each class, the experience of a 'failing' class and a 'failing' student quickly becomes infernal.",
    "This is a great class if you want to read Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and Eliot. If you don't, it's just fine. The supplemental readings were really interesting, and though I wish we spent more time on Eliot and less on Milton, the pace was good. Ultimately a little dry, but that's what you get from a required course."

   "comments": [
    "Sure I would. Professor North is great; although I didn't particularly enjoy 3\/4 authors we studied, he led seminar and discussion in a way that allowed me to find a vantage point that kept me engaged. If you're picky about the authors (we focused on Paradise Lost, The Rape of the Lock, poems from Wordsworth, and The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock\/The Waste Land) maybe look into other professors' 126 syllabi. But no complaints about the instructor.",
    "Absolutely! Even if you are not an English major, I would recommend taking this class!",
    "Yes! Especially with Professor North!",
    "Outside of English majors who are required to take this class, I would only recommend this class to people who have a genuine passion for poetry. Many of the poems are very long and it is hard to engage with them if you are uninterested.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, especially English majors. It is not overbearing in its approach towards the idea of a canon. It engages students and encourages further study of the poetry at hand.",
    "I mean what can I say about recommending or not recommending this course? If you're not an English major, don't take it. If you are and are using the new requirements, definitely take 126 over 125. But no matter what, this class is purely fine and nothing more. It's required, and you'll get through it, especially with North who is amazing, but it might well be in the bottom half of classes ranked by enjoyability you take in college.",
    "Definitely take it; this course is worth your time even if you're not an English major. Make sure you take time to linger over the readings; you'll get so, so much more out of Milton and Eliot if you really let them sink into you. And Prof. North is wonderful; he never asks you to just look at these texts in a vacuum, and will challenge your preconceptions about what these texts mean in a way that's exciting and profound.",
    "Take this class because you have to. But be prepared to feel a modicum of grief as you chuck the reading at hand over your shoulder to pick up the next book. However, the poems and poets are great.",
    "Like others have said: this is required, so it's kind of a mixed bag that you have to just accept. That being said, Joe North's section is great, and he's a really excellent professor, so if you're going to take it and want to improve your writing and reading, take it with him!"
