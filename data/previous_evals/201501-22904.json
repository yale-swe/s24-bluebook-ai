    "This course isn't a lot of work, and honestly the subject matter is very interesting, but it was really hard for me to keep up, and it isn't really necessary to keep up since you can learn it in three nice chunks, so I don't think that I got a lot out of it, but someone could.",
    "PDEs with Frenkel is overall a good class. I liked the setup with 3 \"units\" and 3 tests. Sometimes you don't really follow what's going on, but I feel like I generally understand the basics of PDEs and their solutions. Frenkel is really easygoing and a pretty good lecturer. The homeworks were quite reasonable and the selected problems didn't feel too boring; I actually felt like I was learning something while doing them. The class is definitely geared towards physics\/engineering folks, since the proofs aren't super rigorous. You still learn a lot though for sure",
    "Very useful material to know, especially for physics, and less difficult than pure math classes. This course would not be satisfying as a pure math class studying existence, uniqueness, etc. because it does not presume a knowledge of analysis. The end of the course is very interesting although the beginning is pretty elementary.",
    "Only take this course if you have to. Lectures are extremely difficult to follow and homeworks are often difficult. It does so happen that it is fairly easy to do well in the course, but that does not in any way make the course worth taking.",
    "It's a fairly relaxed class in partial differential equations. If you are interested in abstract math, this is not for you. If you are interested in physics, I strongly recommend this. You learn about Green's Functions, Legendre Polynomials, Bessel functions etc. Which pop up in physics all the time",
    "Take this if you want to memorize a lot of proofs; if you want to deeply understand the subject, perhaps this isn't the class for you.",
    "If you have the chance to take a course with Prof Frenkel, you should. He is a kind and brilliant mathematician. PDEs is a great subject with vast applications. The workload is reasonable, and learning proofs in lectures gives my understanding of the physical applications of these equations a solid grounding.",
    "If you are studying an area of math, science, or engineering in which partial differential equations might be useful to you, I would recommend the class, as a full semester course can be helpful in digesting PDEs more fully than just from using them when required in science, engineering, and applied math classes. Professor Frenkel is also one of the most kind, thoughtful, approachable, and accommodating professors I have ever had, going above and beyond to make himself available to students to answer questions and be of help during class and outside of class, and also very reasonable and willing to make accommodations for students. He really is such a caring and genuine professor, and that adds so much to the experience. On the other hand, lectures I felt could have been organized more clearly, and I sometimes\/often found myself lost and couldnt quite decipher exactly the step-by-step logic behind what was being written on the board, which of course also makes it difficult to decipher class notes when looking through them later (Professor Frenkel would stop frequently to ask for questions and ask if everything was clear but theres that certain level of lost at which you cant properly articulate even what youd like clarified). I also didnt particularly like the textbook, which was understandable but not organized in the clearest or most sensible way. Homework assignments were extremely reasonable and manageable in length and difficulty, although I felt the questions were often too mechanical and narrowly-focused and consequently didnt offer a tremendous amount of insight to reinforce our understanding of the material and its full scope. That said, they were very manageable, and you do pick up a lot purely from devoting a full semester to a single class of equations. Exams were also extremely manageable, and at least this past semester, Professor Frenkel offered three non-cumulative exams of equal weight and thoughtfully gave us the option to omit a question on each exam and to ask in advance (as a class) if we wanted to omit certain material from the exams altogether. The manageability of the exams and Professor Frenkels very thoughtful accommodations definitely took off a lot of pressure but then dont necessarily push you terribly hard to learn all of the material as completely as possible. Ultimately, I would recommend if you think PDEs will be useful enough to you to devote a full semester, but just be aware of the plusses and minuses in advance so that you can proceed accordingly.",
    "I would recommend AMTH 247 to people who are either very interested in the topic or for those who have some background in PDEs. I came into this class thinking that it would be an extension of ODEs. It's actually the other way around. PDEs are more of a generalization of differential equations whereas ODEs is the specific 1D case. PDEs is much more challenging than ODEs.",
    "One of the best math classes at Yale. Professor Frenkel is a pretty clear lecturer who genuinely cares about his students. Students with a variety of background levels can learn a lot in this class, and the assessments are VERY manageable. Professor Frenkel manages to maintain a good balance between breadth and depth, and along the way exposes you to lots of different areas of mathematics."
