    "I had never written a screenplay-- now I have!",
    "Everything you need to tell a story, whether it's a screenplay, novel or whatever - this course sets you on the the path and Professor Crowley guides you through what can be a daunting process.",
    "I learned the structural elements necessary to writing a screenplay, how to navigate film pitches, how to write a beat sheet, as well as how to incorporate other people's feedback into my screenplay without losing sight of my own vision for my film.",
    "I learned the basics of screenwriting and long-form storytelling.",
    "Intro to screenplay structures",
    "This class was a extremely useful experiment in long-form writing. Though my main interest is in prose fiction, not screenwriting, I feel like I've learned a lot in this class about writing a longer story from beginning to end. This course was also useful in learning to provide feedback to other writers, and to make use of other people's feedback and suggestions."

   "comments": [
    "Was great, but could have been a little more structured. A lot of workshops but too many screenplays to work on during each time period, so it was a little unstructured and people didn't always give great feedback. Professor Crowley was still very helpful though!",
    "A major strength is the flexibility of the course - we had real-life stories, sci-fi, fantasy and thrillers. Every class was like stepping into an imaginary world where characters could do and be anything we imagined. The course is only as weak as its weakest students, so people unwilling or uninterested in receiving or giving feedback can be a bit of a drag. The fact that this course was dedicated to writing your story, it was really nice to not have a bunch of other side projects or busy work - it was legitimately all about our screenplays and helping one another write great stories.",
    "Much of this course was exciting and engaging. I think the structure of the workshops could be improved. The workshops could be more organized, and could begin with what the student did well, so that students are more receptive to constructive criticism.",
    "The course is well paced, well structured, and definitely facilitates student creativity. More films could be watched.",
    "This is a great course for a beginner who is interested in screenwriting. It could be improved upon by starting the writing phase earlier so that students don't get so time-crunched at the end.",
    "The instructor is very focused on shaping one's work to be closer to his preferences, making it taxing & difficult to experiment with pieces that do not fit comfortably into genres, or experiment with liminal emotional spaces outside the realm of standard storytelling (which is linear, coherent, and discrete).",
    "The structure of the assignment - going from beat sheet to writing a screenplay from beginning to end with gaps in the middle - was very effective practice in developing an idea and creating a long-form piece. The sample films we watched and discussed were helpful though this aspect could feel more like a lecture than a discussion. I wonder if there would be a way to incorporate more discussion in the portion of the class about story shapes - like thinking of examples or coming up with a story as a class that follows this structure."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Great way to write a screenplay if you never have. John Crowley is excellent-- highly, highly recommend. The workload is pretty backloaded, so keep that in mind if you're planning classes!",
    "YES! My favorite class at Yale, by far. Professor Crowley is great, and the class is fantastic.",
    "Would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, especially if they are at all interested in writing dialogue or in film production (or even appreciation) in general.",
    "I loved this course. It is good for anyone interested in screenwriting with limited experience.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if the instructor is dedicated to helping you realize and articulate your vision without imposing over it.",
    "Definitely a fun course if you have an interest in screenwriting - and even if you don't it's good practice in writing a story from beginning to end. Professor Crowley is very helpful with feedback and insightful in his explanation of different kinds of screenplays."
