   "comments": [
    "If you think that you're interested in grad school, you should definitely do this. not only will it give you research experience, but it will also help you decide whether or not you really enjoy the field.",
    "You need to be an independent learner and take initiative. It can be a very worthwhile experience if you are interested in conducting independent research.",
    "Do this if you want to work in a lb. Just make sure that your course plan is structured enough so that you actually get something out of the research experience.",
    "A good way to get research experience. The class depends on who you do research with.",
    "If you're even slightly considering graduate school I think it's a great idea.",
    "I would recommend directed reading\/research to fellow students as it is a wonderful opportunity to pursue a subject of particular interest.",
    "AMAZING. Yes yes yes, take it! You'll learn a lot, with much less effort and B.S. than most classes",
    "It really depends on what research you do, in what lab, and with who. My experience was wonderful!",
    "I would definitely recommend doing Directed Research in Psych if the opportunity arises. I worked in Kristina Olson's Social Cognitive Development Lab, and it was a great experience. It's ten hours of work a week, which is definitely as much as, if not more than you would put into a regular class, and the paper at the end is manageable, especially with the support of those who worked in the lab and Professor Olson. Psyc492 is a great opportunity!",
    "This all depends on the relationship between the advisor and the student. I liked my particular set-up: I was self-sufficient in creating and sticking to deadlines, and my advisor met with me semi-regularly to provide guidance and support. I had to be pretty proactive about setting up meetings, though, because my advisor was very busy this semester.",
    "Research is a valuable experience, very interesting, and very enjoyable!",
    "I think that a student should take this class if they can find an adviser that knows the topic well and if they know they are passionate about the topic. It is a lot of work and takes good planning but it is worth it.",
    "Yeah. Generally working in a lab seems to be good experience and it sets you up for writing a senior essay.",
    "Definitely do the research credit if you can. It's a great experience, and an unusual opportunity. Plus, it helps with your senior thesis (and thus, graduating). The key is to have a good senior thesis advisor.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for all Psych majors. Working in a lab is a different experience from taking all classes which I found very useful and interesting. It is a fair amount of work, but the scheduling is much more flexible.",
    "This was an independent study so my reflections probably won't be applicable for anyone else...",
    "Recommend",
    "I would definitely recommend it for people who want an option for doing research in a lab that they genuinely enjoy working in.",
    "Definitely. It's a great opportunity to understand some of the aspects of clinical research.",
    "I think most people take directed research as part of the psych major, but I took it out of pure interest (I am not a psych major). I think directed research is a great way to get hands-on experience in psych labs - why take Research Methods when you can take control of your own project and get the same research experience under your own terms?"
