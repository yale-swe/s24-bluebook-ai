   "comments": [
    "English 120 is the first class I would take if you want to improve your writing. It can get a little intensive in the early\/middle of the semester, but things slow down toward the end when some other classes pick up. If you want to be a better writer, take 120.",
    "Yes definitely recommend if you want to learn more about less strictly \"academic\" types of writing.",
    "This is a course in which you compare the readings from authors like David Foster Wallace to Langston Hughes, breaking down their most effective tools in writing and experimenting with how we could incorporate them into our own work.You write 6 essays, a personal narrative, a description of a place, a profile about a person, a cultural analysis paper, an argumentative paper, and finally a comedic paper. A paper consists between 4-6 pages on average, with the comedic paper being shorter on average.Many students will opt for 114 because it might be perceived as being a better course for beginning writers& an easier workload. I would actually argue that these thoughts are false.I considered myself an average writer at best coming into 120, and the professor& class were very supportive of me from day 1. My writing progressed rapidly, and I have learned skills that I can incorporate into both my personal and academic essays through this course.As far as the workload goes, the advantage of this class is that there really are no research papers. You'll have to interview somebody for the profile piece, but that is not too difficult to accomplish. When talking to my buddies in 114, I actually felt lucky for having chosen 120, as their assignments sounded much less fun& a lot more work.I highly recommend this course.",
    "A good course overall, with interesting essays to read and fun essays to write. It's not too much work if you're not afraid of writing or revising a draft every week.However, I would say that classroom discussion could have done more to criticize the essays we were reading, and Hopper could have done more to spark controversial and interesting debates, rather than just praise the authors' techniques (which can get really boring really quickly). I found the grading to be pretty harsh in this class, though that might have just been my experience - I was always pretty worried about how well I was doing compared to other students as this was never really indicated. Otherwise Hopper was really nice to all her students, such as having us over to her house and baking food for us!!",
    "A must-take. One of the few early classes that rewarded students who could write concise stories instead of rewarding students who can turn 10-pages of ideas into a 15-page paper.",
    "If you want to learn how to be a better nonfiction writer, take the class. It will definitely improve you skills, for sure.",
    "Nonfiction creative writer's check-in point; great way to get your writing out into the open and to get more comfortable with the editing process. Would recommend to anyone who does any form of creative writing.",
    "I strongly recommend English 120 for a fellow student. Students will learn how to write and think outside of the boundaries of academic writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 to another student. If you are a writer and\/or considering the English major, it makes a great introductory course to the English Department at Yale and serves as a great catalyst for improvement. Even if you are interested in another field of study, English 120 is an incredibly enjoyable course that allows its students to write more or less what they want. The prompts are very open and freeing, and it can provide you with inspiration and confidence to share your writing with an even larger audience, whether through blogging, social media, Yale publications, or even beyond."
