    "A good intro to music reading and music theory. An easy course too that won't take up a lot of time in a busy schedule, and you get a slightly useful skill out of it. Homework is tedious, but it takes little brain power and can be a nice break from more strenuous homework. Loren was a first time teacher, but she's kind, relatable, and will mostly likely improve with experience.",
    "a good class, not easy at all, a lot of worksheet type work, a lot of memorization, I learned a lot, but not everything i learned was helpful. This is not an easy class, only take it if you are seriously interested in music",
    "An important class for everyone and a good HU credit. But you just have no idea what you're getting. The department can't seem to find a way to standardize the curriculum, pedagogy or even class assignment.You will be surprised (even if you think you're a big shot and \"know music\") at how fast the class progresses. It's all good stuff and you're not really ever wasting time.",
    "This is a fabulous class! I used to play the piano, but I stopped when I was like 14 and I took this course to rekindle my love of music and any knowledge I used to have. However, I wouldn't recommend taking it if you haven't played an instrument at some time in your life since everyone in my section had (or was in a singing group) and the basics of reading music is covered extremely quickly. By the end you are composing your own pieces! It's really fun and little work (the homework for each class takes an hour or less). Loren is a great teacher if she's one of the options.Take it if you have any interest in music and music composition!!"
