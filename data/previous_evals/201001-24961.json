   "comments": [
    "Yes, i would recommend this class if the student is willing to work. This is not a gut. the textbook is named \"Neuroscience\" and that's exactly what you're getting yourself into. very very very interesting, if you like psychology or have ever wondered how a certain brain disorder actually functions at the cellular level.",
    "How the Brain Works is a perfect science credit if you are interested in Neuroscience. You mostly need to know the concepts (no need to memorize random chemicals, etc.), and the big picture of how things work together and you are mostly set. You also learn about some diseases such as ALS, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and a few others, as well as some cool technologies that are used in treatment.Reading is also something that you can take lightly. While the course is designed for non-science majors, the textbook is not. However, everything will be made clear in class so don't kill yourself over the reading.",
    "I would recommend MCDB 135 to anyone who has any interest in the brain and brain-related diseases, like Parkinson's and huntingons. There are three non-cumulative exams throughout the semester with no final (but one 5 page paper). The exams are essay format, often asking the student to tie concepts together and reach conclusions by himself. I wouldn't say the class is hard, but it requires work as well.",
    "An introduction to the processes of the brain and some major neurodegenerative diseases. I would recommend it to another student. It's not too much work (though you definitely need to study for the exams).",
    "I really liked the material and the structure of the course, but I felt the professors weren't the best. I would only take this if you're interested in the material, or else you will be really bored.",
    "Take it!!!! I think it's one of the best, if not the best, non-science major class. If you have any interest in neuroscience and have no science background, take it!",
    "Pretty good class, Wells a pretty decent lecturer, Kundel could be a bit dull sometimes. Relatively easy science credit.",
    "I think it's a great class for non-science majors. It's not super enthralling but it gets the Sc credit done.",
    "Since this class was specifically made for non-science majors, I assumed that it would be less techincal than other natural science classes. I was definitely wrong about that. However, as long as you're willing to memorize the pathways of neurotransmitters and the anatomy of particular parts of the brain, it's an interesting seminar to take. At least the class is fairly graded in that you have 3 exams, one paper, and participation, which each count for 20% of your over all grade.",
    "This is the best possible way to get your science requirement filled. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and the information is relevant to everyday life, unlike some more abstract science.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I feel like the lectures were interesting and I learned a lot about the brain (and a few other things, like finding\/reading scientific journal articles). The tests weren't that hard if you studied the information, and the final paper could be about literally any brain-related topic that interests you. Overall, a great science class.",
    "Good for non science majors, interesting and substantive",
    "MCDB 135 is accessible to people who are not scientists, but it is not to be taken lightly. I would still recommend it, though. You will learn a lot!",
    "Take it if you need an SC but not if you want to have to do work. You won't get off the hook in this class. There's a lot of memorization and it's hard to figure out exactly what they want you to know, but by the second test you should have a better idea. Best way to avoid a science final!!",
    "This class is interesting, but really, really boring. Not too much work, but its just heinously dull.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in neuroscience. This is not a course for people interested in psychology.",
    "I highly recommend this class to other students, especially those that are not science majors. The professors explain topics in a manner that is easy to understand. However this is NOT a gut class! It does require work and you can NOT miss the lectures."
