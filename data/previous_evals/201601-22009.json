    "It was nice to be in a small seminar. I got to know the other students fairly well. However, the class could get boring as the students didn't contribute much to the discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in fashion",
    "Summarizing history through the lens of fashion and clothing. Sure, different type of history especially if you find fashion interesting",
    "The class is really good if you want to take a small class and really get to talk to your fellow classmates. I think the class is worth taking because it approaches the history of fashion, not a common subject a Yale, through political, social, economic and technical changes. I think the biggest weakness of the course is that the quality of discussions really depend on which student is leading that day and how well prepared other students show up to class. But overall, it's a great course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. It really enhanced my Yale experience forsure",
    "Great idea that should and can do better",
    "This course looks at fashion and it origins, introducing a history that is often overlooked. The class requires quit a bit of reading but I would recommend it to a fellow student. Along with fashion history, you learn a lot more about other aspects of history during the time periods than you would think. A lot was revealed about the history of feminism and the modernization of technology. Definitely a class I recommend .",
    "I'd recommend this course for sure. The information is pretty interesting if you have just the slightest interest in fashion and the class is pretty chill\/ fun overall"
