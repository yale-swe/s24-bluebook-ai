   "comments": [
    "Take Math 120 if you have to. It's a very simple, straightforward course that I basically learned out of the book. I would have taken ENAS 151 if given the chance, but as a potential math major, decided to remain within the department.The teacher was okay. It was one of his first times teaching, and he certainly tried very hard. He's a very nice guy, but not always the clearest when explaining difficult concepts and tends to get caught up over minute details.",
    "Math 120 can be a good course if you take it with a professor. If you end up in a section with a TF, Math 120 generally is not a good course. If you need to take if for a major\/think you might need it for a major, then wake up EARLY and get into a section taught by Michael Frame or another professor! I did not know to do this, and my section was dull and generally not very helpful. I like math, but multivariable calculus is generally pretty boring and arbitrary if you're not also taking physics (and thus can't appreciate any of what you're doing...that was me!)Also, whether or not you're in a good section, MIT open courses has a great video series of the entire multivariable calculus class, plus extra practice problems. I highly recommend it.",
    "Math120 just isn't a great course, and I think it would benefit greatly from switching to a single lecture model, much like MIT's multivariable course (which you might want to watch online). Multivariable is MUCH more difficult than BC Calc but I suppose all in all I'm glad I took it. The workload isn't too bad, with short weekly problem sets, but the tests can be a little difficult and the curve is not very forgiving. I would probably recommend that you take the ENAS version of this class instead. As for Minh-Tri Vo, I think he is probably one of the best Math 120 teachers, but I don't know if he is ever teaching the course again.",
    "I think Math 120 is a great course for anyone interested in majoring in the math\/sciences (even though it is required for a lot of those majors). The material is hard and there's a lot of work, but the math is very interesting to learn.",
    "Great course, but if you want more application than just pure math, you should take the ENAS version of the course.",
    "If you came out of high school taking BC calc, and you haven't taken any multivariable calc, I definitely recommend this course. Just be warned that the course gets harder as the year progresses. It may seem easy at first, but it covers pretty complicated topics towards the end of the semester. Overall, I'm glad I took this course.",
    "Standard multivariable calc class. I would recommend it only to those who need to take the class. Plan on learning mostly from the book and from your peers. Try to gain an understanding of how the math works, rather than memorizing how to do problems.",
    "It was good. Make sure you actually go to class.",
    "I would recommend it only if it is one of the prerequisites for your other courses. If you take this course, I would recommend studying on your own. The lectures aren't too helpful. Also, this couses itself doesn't go very deep. It only tells you to memorize the theorems and apply them in very simple conditions.",
    "Math 120 is a thorough course in multi-variable calculus from differentials to integrals. I would recommend it to another student since it is very useful for further work in math and science, though a student should also consider the other math courses, such as those in the Physics or Engineering department, to make sure it fits their future needs for their major."
