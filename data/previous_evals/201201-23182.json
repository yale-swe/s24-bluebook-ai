   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It is designed to enhance your writing and expose you to different styles of texts, books and poems. I liked being in a small class and getting to know my classmates and the professor well.",
    "I would summarize this class as a course that will improve your writing skills for academic papers and arguments. You learn a lot about how to formulate a claim, support your claim, and defend it. This was a great course, it was very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to another student. The professor was nice, and the work was challenging but manageable.",
    "Yes. It is a fun class with good reading. Be prepared, however, to teach yourself how to improve your own writing during the course, because although it is WR, you don't do much with writing (outside of the 4 main papers).",
    "English 115 was a very good course offering readings from a variety of fiction texts and forms. I would especially recommend it for someone looking to establish sound fundamentals in writing style and construction-- this is a significant component of the course. However, for a more advanced writer looking to focus exclusively on reading and analysis, this instruction on how to form strong conclusions, introductions, and the like may be somewhat tedious. However, you can get a lot out of the course if you put the energy and effort into it. The workload was also very fair.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for a fellow student. For me, it was a good reminder of what a liberal education is all about, as I was constantly challenged to come up with unique and interesting ideas about classic and modern works for my papers.Professor Menges is awesome. The reading is interesting. The workload is extremely reasonable. You'll become a better writer (possibly also a cooler person). You may get to meet James Franco. Taking this class should be a no-brainer.",
    "This is a good course. I don't think it improved my writing very much but the discussions were interesting and the reading list was great. It also wasn't too much work.",
    "It's not as 'extreme survival' as you think, I often forgot myself that was the topic. But that didn't detract from the awesomeness that is this class.",
    "YES YES YES TAKE THIS CLASS. If you can get in through preference selection, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is amazing and you will absolutely love it. Mywriting has improved tenfold as a result of this class. You will learn so much and you will love the professor and the reading. It's a pretty solid amount of work, but as I said, the reading is fantastic and won't feel like work. Four papers, two with drafts, makes for a managable workload. You're always working on something, but you never feel too stressed about not having enough time. The professor is very fair grader, and you will improve dramatically. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "English 115 is a great Freshman\/ Sophomore English class that I would suggest for any student interested in English that does not want an extremely heavy work load. We began the year by reading poems and then read a variety of English novels which were extremely interesting. There were four main essays throughout the year which was not too stressful.",
    "Yes. It was a good class. Take it over 114!",
    "English 115 is a seminar style English class which involved writing four papers throughout the semester. All of the assigned readings throughout the week could be challenging, but were very enjoyable and therefore, never seemed time consuming. I came to look forward to each class and therefore, I recommend the class to anyone who is seeking a literature and writing seminar.",
    "I would summarize it as a great introductory writing class. The subject matter- extreme survival- is very interesting and it is a great opportunity to read texts such as \"Into Thin Air\" and \"The Road\" in an academic setting. It definitely requires a lot of work but I would recommend it to another student because it is a challenging course on an interesting topic."
