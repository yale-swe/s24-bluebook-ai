    "An amazing class that makes you think about literature in a big way. I'm a STEM major, but I found the material in the class and especially the discussions in seminar meetings to be really interesting and informative. The class is unique in that half of the class meetings are lecture-based, and the other half are seminar-based, which made the whole experience really enjoyable. To get the most out of the class, there was a lot of reading, and working on the essays was tough, but it's a really fulfilling class.",
    "Don't take this if you're not a Lit Major. LIT 120 is a waste of your time. The syllabus is scattered and incomprehensible, and many of the lectures are 1) chaotic 2) obvious 3) uninteresting.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course to any student regardless of their studies, major, department. The course wonderfully guides the student through the history of story-telling and the historical implication fictional or non-fictional narratives have on both the individual and society.",
    "Only if you have to take it.",
    "Lit 120 offers a broad, consistently interesting syllabus, and is a good introduction to the kind of analysis you might do as a literature major. The class a combination of seminar and lecture, and is team-taught by four professors. The professors seem to care a lot about this course--they're constantly experimenting with new ideas to improve the lectures and the way online assignments are run. It was a privilege to be in Professor Figlerowicz's lecture, in particular--she's incredibly brilliant and incredibly approachable! She led fluid, coherent class discussions that I was always so happy to be a part of. The lectures, on the other hand, could be hit-or-miss and often felt a bit disorganized, but the professors work hard to make this class approachable to students for whom this is their first writing class, and to students who are considering Lit as their major."
