    "Make sure you follow the lectures closely. The homework gets behind the lectures so if you only know enough to do the homework you'll be behind in class, which left me in a negative state, although I am attempting to learn it all for the final. You will cover mechanics, relativity, and E&M. Physics is a really beautiful subject, although I didn't quite grasp the beauty of E&M this semester. It seemed tedious to me at the time.",
    "Take it if you are allowed to! The math prereq stated isn't actually what you need; many people in the course only are just taking math 120. Make sure to do the psets in study groups, though, or else you'll get so many points off for seemingly trivial mistakes.",
    "Physics 260 is a pretty hard course with occasionally easy homework and an astonishingly easy midterm. The thing that scared me about this class was how it changes back and forth from ridiculously easy to ridiculously difficult without any warning. At one point Prof. Baltay asked us if we'd seen the quadratic equation before, yet he assumed all manner of prior experience with vector calculus and various physics concepts.The best thing about this class, though, is Baltay. He's a great teacher and a hilarious person. Even if he were talking about art history, I would go to see him and I'm pretty sure I would enjoy my time. I'm certainly glad that I've taken his class.I went into the class having taken AP Calc BC and AP Physics C, and I took ENAS 151 at the same time. I feel like that's perfectly good preparation - despite what the course description says - but I also felt a little bit intimidated by the class (both the material and my peers). It was a very new experience for me, but one that I enjoyed a lot. I'd certainly recommend it over Physics 200, which I've heard some bad things about.",
    "If you've taken AP Physics C in high school AND Multivariable Calculus, this is the best class for you. It doesn't say multivariable is a requirement, but we use triple integrals, Stokes' Theorem, and other multi concepts in the problem sets. This is SUCH an interesting class though. If you love physics, you will love this class for sure. Professor Baltay also does a great job of teaching the material and keeping the students interested with his awesome sense of humor.",
    "This class is as hard as an intro physics class gets. While Math 230 knowledge certainly isn't required (I have no idea why it's a prereq), multivariable calculus knowledge is quite essential to doing well. If you're considering this class and haven't taken MVC before, seriously consider taking at least Math 120 concurrently (and be prepared to learn some MVC on your own to use in physics).However, Prof. Baltay is great (when the concepts aren't going over your head). Just be prepared for your mind to be blown. And to work super, super hard.",
    "-physics with a good pace and not too much busy work",
    "If you're trying to decide between this and Physics 200, I would definitely say go with 260. 260 covers deeper material and may also, from my conversations with people in 200, be the easier course. Problem sets are short, and the exams generally have very simple questions. Sometimes material will come up on problem sets that you won't know how to solve yet unless you have already completed a multivariable course, so you should be prepared every once in a while to look up new math on your own, but in general 260 is a class with just the right amount of difficulty.",
    "Interesting course. Hard to follow at first if you haven't seen vector calculus, but it is easy to pick up if you devote a little time to it. The extra math adds another dimension to the physics. The homeworks are not too time intensive.",
    "This is a very good intro course for those who plan to major in physics or have a high level of interest in the subject and good preparation in math. Baltay is a solid professor with a very methodical teaching style--he might not blow you away with his antics, but his lectures are easy to follow and the pace is perfect. The homework load is very manageable (seldom more than 4 hours a week), and the material is interesting. The fall semester covers a good chunk of mechanics and electromagnetism, and while some depth is lacking, it leaves room for introductory quantum mechanics and general relativity in the spring. The lectures and problem sets tend to be mostly on the theoretical side (no plug-and-chug, thankfully), and the tests aren't bad.Baltay doesn't spend a lot of time on the math, though, so if you haven't studied vector calculus beforehand, you might have a bit more work to do (even if you're taking multivariable concurrently--the math classes tend to cover the relevant material later). Ignore the Math 230 corequisite--not only does it go far beyond Physics 260 in its treatment of the material, but it doesn't even cover the useful vector calculus until the spring. Math 120 and ENAS 151 are much more applicable to the class.",
    "It covers mechanics and E&M as well some additional topics that you may not have covered in AP Physics C, suchas Lagrangian mechanics, special relativity, Maxwell's equations, and a little of electromagnetic radiation. Take it if you liked physics C; it's mostly review, but it sets you up for 261, which I'm assuming is more advanced topics (he alluded to general relativity, quantum mechanics, and a rederivation of E&M using special relativity).",
    "Yes, but understand what you are getting into. The class is full of the really smart physics kids and if you don't keep up you will fall by the wayside. The problem sets are not hard but the E and M ones take a lot of time. Take this class if you really feel passionate about physics and you are not just trying to get a physics credit.",
    "Don't be intimidated away from this class! The first semester, at least, isn't too much more difficult than AP Physics C. The workload is very manageable, and I feel like it's given me a better grasp not just of the specific physical laws on the syllabus, but of quantitative problem solving methods in general. A caveat about the math: you can take Math 120 concurrently with this class, but be prepared to not understand some things the first time they're presented. I've found that 120 lags a week or two behind this class, and it can be a little confusing sometimes. Don't hesitate to take them together though, it's totallypossible.",
    "This is a good class. It is intellectually and conceptually fast paced but not ridiculously slow, though it definitely assumes you have mastered AP Physics C. Baltay is funny, speaks well, and writes well (his handwriting is incredible). Much more theory than practice, and he sometimes gets lazy about negative signs--he cares more about the big picture than the details.",
    "Good class. We zoomed through Mechanics, Special Relativity, and Maxwell's Equations, so we'll be getting to the interesting stuff next semester.",
    "Do not take Physics 200. Take 260 instead. Though the material taught in 260 is harder, students in 200 seemed to gettings tests asking questions that they hadn't been taught how to solve in class. In 260, Baltay will teach you everything you need to know, and though it is fast paced, if you stay on top of your readings, you will learn very much, and will be very prepared for future courses.",
    "Not your classic intro physics course at all. It is very fast and demanding, especially once E&M starts. Personally, I found the need to devote a lot of time outside of class and the mandatory assignments.",
    "Like the name suggests, PHYS 260 is indeed an intensive introductory physics course, and is usually intended for people wanting to major in physics. This course assumes a comfortable understanding of multivariable calculus. However, taking a multivariable class concurrently doesn't feel bad either, only that you would just accept what Prof Baltay said without really knowing the validity of the theorems or proofs he did in class, and that everything will make so much more sense after you finish your multivariable class.Although the contents of 260 are harder than those of 200, after several discussions with people from the latter course, exams for 260 are surprisingly easier. You just have to be comfortable with what Prof Baltay teaches and you'll be fine. I am a MechE major, and I don't feel taking 260 will deprive you from the engineering examples you will get in 200. You can learn all of them once you're in the higher level classes. Consider taking it to gain a real understanding of physics. Maxwell's equations are beautiful, btw!",
    "Semi-difficult but rewarding class. Take it if you can handle it. It doesn't take much, just a consistent work ethic.",
    "I would recommend physics 260 to anyone who really loves physics. The material presented in the class is beyond high school physics and is really exciting. It may be tedious at times, but I think it's worth it at the end.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who enjoys physics and is good at mathematics. It is a fast-paced class, but you'll learn a lot and Charles Baltay is fantastic.",
    "Sure. It's good if you're planning on being a physics major.",
    "Very dull. Avoid if possible.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are deciding between 200 and 260. The workload seems much easier and more manageable and the texts are easier to read.",
    "Best intro physics class at yale. If you place into this class take it! The lectures are challenging and interesting, but the homework and exams are deceptively easy. Baltay is a humorous and enjoyable lecturer",
    "Physics 260 is great if you're interested in physics and want a quick go-through of Mechanics and E\/m--don't take it if you aren't already somewhat familiar with high school physics with calculus, as Baltay goes through Physics C material (especially E\/M) very very quickly. Also, it really helps (by the end, at least) to have taken Math 120 concurrently at least.",
    "Physics 260 is a very good introductory physics course. You should definitely have a strong multivariable calculus background prior to taking the course, but plenty of students take it concurrently. Taking math 230 concurrently is generally not enforced, and the math learned in that course doesn't apply to this physics course directly. Prof Baltay is a very good lecturer and his derivations\/explanations are thorough and easy to follow. The class covers a large range of topics, and we covered essentially all of AP physics (both mechanics and e&m) along with special relativity in a single semester. If you took AP physics, presumably without multivar calc, this class is a good step beyond that. The problem sets are reasonable, and take a few hours to finish at most. I thought this class was going to be a extremely hard, but it was actually pretty straight forward.",
    "Absolutely, completely recommend.",
    "Take it. You will not regret it.",
    "if you know physics and enjoy it you should definitely take this class, but it is difficult",
    "Physics 260 was mostly disappointing. With a few exceptions (relativity, Lagrange's equations, and vector calculus applied to Maxwell's equations), all of the topics are covered in an AP Physics class and none of the problems on the homework or exams were more challenging than anything you'd see in high school. For this semester at least, Physics 200 covered about the same amount of material, and had harder homework problems. The class is good for getting prospective physics majors onto a common starting ground, but not much else.",
    "Take physics 260 if you need to take physics and you took physics C in high school and multivariable in high school or math 120. The problem sets are cool and very manageable and there's only one midterm and then the final. Baltay is good and down to answer questions and things like that.",
    "Not a ton of work but reasonably difficult. Memorize the E&M formulas. All of them",
    "Physics 260 is a great class. It's really interesting, math heavy, and makes you feel like you have a very solid foundation for what you're doing. The second half of the semester was harder than the first, but overall it was a manageable workload and a fun class. I recommend it to people with solid math skills who are interested in physics.",
    "It was a great class. If you are at all interested in physics and can get approval for the class, you should take it. Baltay is fantastic, and you will think about pretty interesting problems. If you are looking at 260, it probably means you are deciding between 200 and 260. Without a doubt, take 260.",
    "Great class for students wanting to understand the physics instead of just fulfilling a requirement and begrudging problem sets.",
    "An accelerated overview of mechanics, relativity, and E&M. Very math intensive and a reasonable amount of homework. Mostly theoretical. Professor Baltay is quite witty and amusing.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class. Physics 260 provides a comprehensive yet in-depth overview of classical mechanics, special relativity, and electricity and magnetism. The course covers a tremendous amount of content in one semester, but doesn't feel even slightly rushed. The lectures are fascinating, engaging and always enjoyable, and the course gives a very accessible yet highly rigorous treatment of the physics. For example, Professor Baltay is excellent about showing the mathematical proofs behind much of what the class does, but he also recognizes that 260 is a physics class, not a math class, so he focuses the problem sets and exams on solving problems rather than reciting proofs.Professor Baltay is phenomenal. He may be one of the best teachers at Yale. He is absolutely brilliant, consistently hilarious, and has a tremendous grasp of the material. Baltay lives and breaths physics and knows very well how to teach it. He has been teaching exclusively Physics 260 for the past several years and knows precisely how best to convey the 260's material.Both textbooks for the course are extremely clear and genuinely helpful. They complement Professor Baltay's lectures and provide lots of additional examples and insight.The problems sets and exams are very reasonable. When preparing for exams, be sure to practice solving problems similar to the homework assignments and the in-class examples--doing so will serve you well.If you're considering taking Physics 260 versus Physics 200 or another class, if you have the mathematics background for Physics 260, take it for the quality of teaching and depth of the content. Math 230 is really not a co-requisite for the class. If you're in Math 120 and feel comfortable, you'll be well prepared for Physics 260.",
    "I would recommend Physics 260 to any student interested in physics who has already had significant high school preparation in physics (AP Physics C or IB Physics HL) and multivariable calculus. The class is a fairly straightforward survey of mechanics, special relativity, and electricity& magnetism that goes rather in-depth for an introductory course. I found the material very interesting, as it explored the foundations and derivations of concepts that are largely taken for granted in most high school physics courses. With one or two exceptions, the problem sets are not too very consuming, as they pretty closely follow the material in lecture and in the assigned textbook chapters. The final grade consists of 10 problem sets, the midterm, and the final, which I found very fair, leaving ample opportunity for improvement. If you are a dedicated worker and are into the physical sciences and\/or engineering, you should definitely at least shop this course.",
    "If you've taken both AP Physics C classes there'll be a good bit of review, but there's definitely enough new material to keep it interesting. If you have a good background in physics and calculus it's a good class to take. It's not really necessary to be in Math 230 (although that may not be true for PHYS 261), but you really should have completed multi before taking this class.",
    "PHYS-260 is a very good class for a perspective physics major, or anyone with previous physics experience who is interested in learning more. The Math-230 co-requisite is entirely unnecessary and truthfully, Math-120 would be more useful for this class (Unless you are interested in Mathematics as well). Baltay is fun and engaging and the workload is very manageable.",
    "I would not recommend Phys 260 unless you're really well prepared. It's not too much work, but there is significantly more material than ten homework problems per week could ever cover. There is little opportunity for practice and the exams are not easy. If you're a potential major, maybe try it, but definitely explore other classes\/tracks. Otherwise, take a different class.",
    "THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INFORMATIVE CLASSES I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. If you are confident with or in the process of learning math120 and have a basic understand of physics, you should definitely take this class. I came into this class with only a basic understanding of physics and now I feel confident enough to tackle harder courses in mechanics and electromagnetism. The class is taught with great clarity by a professor who is reasonable and who clearly cares for his students. He holds long office hours and replies promptly to email. He also goes through a lot of examples in class so students are able to obtain a really insightful understanding of the material. The midterm and final were fair and marked fairly so if you study hard you'll definitely be able to get a good grade."
