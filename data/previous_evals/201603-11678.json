   "comments": [
    "Improved language skills, familiarity with literature written in Spanish.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze literature with care. I learned about the importance of structure, tone, and figurative language in poems, short stories, and short novels. But most importantly, I learned that everything an author does in his work serves a purpose.",
    "This class taught me about the various movements in Spanish Literature through short stories, novellas, poems, and a play. Professor Valis is very passionate about the assigned texts and leads the class in a thoughtful discussion every class. We learned to analyze symbols and about the structures used in creative writing and poetry.",
    "This course improved my Spanish listening abilities significantly; when I first started the course, I had difficulty understanding Professor Valis, but the seminar structure allowed me to practice speaking and listening while analyzing the various texts we read. I also gained breadth of knowledge of Spanish literature, and Professor Valis has amazing analytical insight.",
    "Through this course, I learned a lot about different forms of Spanish language literature, including short stories, poetry, and plays. I gained many of the analytical skills required to critically think about Spanish prose and poetry as well as the terminology related to this field. Furthermore, I had a great opportunity to practice my Spanish speaking and comprehension skills. Additionally, I learned how to write papers in Spanish and I learned a lot of the history behind the works and authors we read.",
    "I was able to read great works of Spanish literature in their original forms, which was an amazing experience! My analytical skills in Spanish improved tremendously too.",
    "I developed skills that allowed me to carefully read and discuss various texts in a critical and analytical manner. The course also most definitely gave me a new perspective on literature from Spain and Latin America and incites in me a desire to continue studies of the subject.",
    "The course definitely improved my reading and writing of Spanish. This was my first experience reading full Spanish works, and the structure of the course, which moved from short stories to poetry alongside novels, definitely helped with that.",
    "I greatly improved my ability to write in Spanish as well as my ability to read and analyze texts in Spanish.",
    "I have gained a wider knowledge of Hispanic literature and a greater dominance of the Spanish language",
    "The courses presents Spanish literature from different time periods, as well as from different countries. It also goes into classic poetry and a drama."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was great. No change needed.",
    "One thing that could be improved would be the pace of the class. Towards the end, there were a lot reading we touched upon briefly for lack of time.",
    "The strengths of this course are the professor, who is very knowledgeable and well-prepared to lead discussions. The intimate nature of the course allows a chance for everyone to weigh in and share their thoughts. Only suggestion to improve the course is to provide more review for the midterm exam.",
    "The strength of the class was that I got to sample many different types and styles of literature. Having never taken a Spanish literature course before, it definitely gave a great overview of what there was to be found and I read many of the great authors that I had hoped to read. Another strength was that its small size allowed us to really discuss the details and significance of the works we read in a more intimate setting. I suppose one weakness was that there were so many works that sometimes it was hard to finish discussion about some of the works and move on to the next one. However, I would hate to cut out any of the amazing selections from the course.",
    "Great course overall! Class participation was sometimes low, but the teacher would always try to engage everyone!",
    "The course has a great and interesting reading list but consequently, you read a lot in a given week to only talk about it for a little bit in class, leaving something to be desired sometimes.",
    "I loved the works we read, the structure of the course, and the opportunities it presented to us as students to engage with Spanish theater and Spanish translators outside of the simple \"read and analyze\" structure of a general Spanish literature course. I think the instructors should work on recognizing that not all of the students in their class are native Spanish speakers, and ease us into the difficulty of the literature at the beginning of the course.",
    "The choices of texts was good. The reading was always a little behind schedule, and this took away from in class discussion.",
    "Strengths: good discussions Weakenesses: some reading selections could be more interesting",
    "Having a smaller class definitely helps with having discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it. The first day might be overwhelming - many students (at least in my case) spoke Spanish fluently, and the prospect of reading books in a foreign language may seem out of reach. If you have the genuine interest and a fair level of confidence in your Spanish, take it. Profesora Valis is a gem, and truly cares about the works and working with undergrads. You won't regret it. Enjoyable way to satisfy the language requirement.",
    "Yes, it's a challenging course but a rewarding one.",
    "I loved this class and looked forward to doing the readings. The essays were reasonable and the professor and TF provided guidance every step of the way. I learned a lot about literature and feel that I am now more likely to read books in Spanish on my own.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student looking for a L5 Spanish class. I felt like I really got to engage with the texts and learn more about the culture and history of Latin American countries while also developing my Spanish skills. It was a great survey course of Spanish literature and I really enjoyed looking at the different movements of literature and how they translated in the text.",
    "Yes! The syllabus is fascinating and all are worthwhile reads. It is really Professor Valis that makes the course. One of the smartest and insightful people I have ever met.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in continuing to study Spanish, this is a great course to do so.",
    "Yes! It was a wonderful introduction to all forms of Spanish literature, so I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to skim Spanish poetry and novels and short stories, or to anyone who would like an L5 Spanish course that eased them into college level Spanish courses.",
    "Yes. This class will introduce you to some great works, and the in class discussions are very enlightening. It is not the easiest way to get your requirements done, but I am glad I chose this route.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has a keen interest in Hispanic literature.",
    "Yes, if you are a high level Spanish speaker, this class is great. It introduces you to many different authors, time periods, and ideas that is not seen in typical English literature. It also goes into classic poetry, which is a bonus."
