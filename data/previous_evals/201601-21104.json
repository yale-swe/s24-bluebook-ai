    "A good course. Whether or not you go in interested in research, the seminar-style classes paired with the research project will get you a good taste of it. The major downside to this course is that the weight of the course is in a group project, which is very challenging and time consuming, and also fallible if you end up in a bad group. The upside, of course, is that in addition to learning about and playing with robots, you have the opportunity to build a novel (and potentially publish-able) research project, and execute it!",
    "Scaz opens up lab to all. Group project composes majority of term work. Classes are student presentations given by classmates and vary based on topic\/presenter. Scaz gives some presentations. Interesting discussion about the future of robotics. Don't underestimate the group project-- it is quite a substantial amount of work if you want to do it well."
