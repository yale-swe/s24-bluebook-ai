   "comments": [
    "Take if you need a refresher in grammar or want to build a strong foundation. If you already have grammar down or are fast at learning, don't take this, since most people in the class are kinda slow\/not motivated (e.x. Freshmen who took French in high school but didn't care enough to take the AP or place into higher levels)",
    "Take it!",
    "Absolutley! Although the homework can be time consuming, it is never overwhelming. I would not call this a gut class (I learned A LOT this semester), but I also never felt truly stressed out by it.",
    "French 130 was a lot of work. I would recommend it to someone who has a genuine interest in learning to speak French proficiently, and not to someone looking for a class with a light workload.",
    "YES. You will learn so much. Take it with Madame Burton if possible, she's truly fantastic. She really cares a lot about her students. She also makes an effort to make her classes a family\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you feel close to her and your classmates by the end of the term. The course, and Madame, are incredibly.",
    "YES! Take this course with Madame Burton because she is the best! She always makes class enjoyable by cracking jokes, asking a ton of questions, and creating a bunch of games to play!",
    "A class to gain a firm grounding in grammatical and vocab basics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. We read some interesting books and work on some essential grammar skills. Try to take it with Kathleen Burton if you can. She's great!",
    "A lot of work but your french will definitely improve.",
    "French 130 is a good review\/overview of the intermediate concepts of French grammar and speech. The course focuses on solidifying usage of the major tenses of the French language but also emphasizes proper use of pronouns and articles in particular. A fine course for any student seeking greater familiarity with the French language after high school.",
    "FREN 130 is a crash course in French grammar, grammar which is reinforced by the reading of novels (including L'Etranger) and the watching of films. It moves incredibly quickly and can have a lot of homework but is still manageable. Mme Burton is an absolutely amazing professor and a very sweet person overall, it is definitely worth trying to get into her section."
