   "comments": [
    "I would, through this class you get to read a lot of remarkable life stories and gain different perspectives. It is also a wonderful opportunity to be self-reflective and explore the self through the process of writing our own memoir.",
    "Reading autobiographies by mostly women, from mostly other countries (Middle East, SE and E Asia mostly).",
    "Definitely recommended. Life changing material, unbelievably profound discussion, absolutely worth all the work.",
    "The class can be a bit time intensive as there is a lot of reading and papers often take some serious thought. However, the books read represent a community of writers that are often overshadowed, and the literature expands a global context. Definitely one of the more enlightening and motivational classes that I have taken at Yale.",
    "If you're even slightly interested in literature, geopolitics, critical theory, narratives, or anything tangentially related to these subjects, TAKE THIS CLASS. The reading is difficult (especially in the early weeks) but fascinating, Prof. Chanda will be incredibly supportive even as she forces you outside your intellectual comfort zone, and you'll have some seriously high-caliber discussions. You'll also have a substantial amount of personal freedom in terms of paper-writing and the final project--which can be disorienting if your background is in STEM or programs like DS that are highly structured and clear about their expectations. But if you're willing to take the plunge, you'll be amazed at how rewarding the class turns out to be.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone, even if literature is not to your liking. Professor Chanda's discussions and reading selections were friendly to progressive discussions of gender and race issues. Her course, particularly in the Spring 2016, was a welcome respite from frustrating campus-wide discussions."
