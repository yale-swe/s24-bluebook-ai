   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend. It's math-heavy and quite a lot of work, but you do learn a ton of interesting material.",
    "This class was interesting, but had a greater workload than I had expected. In addition, there was more math to it than I was expected. I recommend it if you have interest in graphics, but otherwise hard to justify the time you'll spend between weekly(ish) problem sets and a final project.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in having an introduction to computer graphics. The course is math heavy which was difficult for some, but by the end you will use Javascript to make a game, which is fun and rewarding. Problem sets vary in difficulty, but are do-able.",
    "Anyone intimidated but interested in computer graphics owes it to themselves to take this.",
    "A middle-of-the-road CS elective. Really does require the linear algebra portion. Disconnect between problem sets and exams means you really do have to study \/ go to lecture.",
    "Fun if you like graphics and programming; the material can get a little dense and dry, especially if your math background isn't that strong, but it's certainly doable (CS major with not much math history here).",
    "Time consuming but fun",
    "This is an excellent introductory course to CG, and Prof. Rushmeier is great. There is a lot of work: 8 problem sets, 2 in-class exams (midterms) and a final project, but making images and games was a lot of fun for me and I find the assignments quite enjoyable. Prereq-wise, a little background in calculus and linear algebra will be very helpful if you want to appreciate the mathematical structures of the topics covered, but it is not required. This term is the first time we used Ganovelli's textbook, WebGL and JavaScript, and it worked quite well I think. Class material and \"how to use WebGL\" are somewhat separate, in the same way as CPSC 223 and \"how to write C\", and I had to learn the WebGL API on my own. In short, the course -- especially under Prof. Rushmeier -- is one of the best electives I've taken in the department, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has proper CS background and is interested in animation, game or art.",
    "I enjoyed this class a lot! Being one of the few CS electives that I've taken that goes really in depth into a particular subject (I haven't gotten the chance to take OS or databases, etc), I felt like I learned so much and got a lot out of it. It was a ton of work, so be prepared to put that in, but then again, most good CS classes are. I definitely liked being able to see the things I made.",
    "Yes, highly recommended for all interested in CS and Art"
