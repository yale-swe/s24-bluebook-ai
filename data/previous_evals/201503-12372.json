    "Enthusiastic teacher, however I feel like he could do a better job at explaining nuanced concepts during lecture in an organized and detailed way. Kind of hard to follow tbh. I liked the subject, but didn't like the class due to not enjoying lecture.",
    "This is a very difficult course, and part of the reason for this is that it varies so greatly based on the instructor that you get. The PSets take a decent amount of time, and sometimes there are questions that require methods that are not covered in class. Certain classes learn different methods of solving the same problems, so at review sessions you might end up not understanding how a problem is being done even if you did it in class(the same goes for trying to get help from someone other than your own instructor). Classes also seem to move at different paces even though the same homework is due each week. The tests are difficult but short, so missing one problem can drop you an entire letter grade, sometimes even two. Partial credit is technically given, but if you get the wrong answer, it doesn't seem to matter how much of your work was correct. If you've already taken multivariable, you'll probably be fine, but if you haven't I would definitely shop a lower level math in addition to 120. For section 06 in particular, Jose is an incredibly nice person and he is very helpful before\/after class and during his office hours. He's also very good about making sure that everything on the board is visible to the entire class. We did some to run out of time before finishing examples quite a few times, mostly when people had lots of questions.",
    "I would recommend MATH 120 to a student who LIKES MATH. It's very difficult to get much out of the class if you're just taking it because you want to stay in a math class like you did in high school. Personally, I didn't have a great experience because I realized about halfway through the term that I don't really enjoy math. However, I had a great instructor and it was not a terrible course.",
    "I would summarize Math 120 as a multi-variable calculus course that moves very fast and focuses more on theory and less on application. I would recommend this to another student if they have a background with multi-variable calculus or are very comfortable with single-variable calculus and are ready to progress to the next level.",
    "MATH 120 is a well-structured and comprehensive course in multi-variable calculus. The course works through material at a dependable and understandable pace. In many ways, the course is a very logical extension of earlier calculus work or AP Calculus BC and contains few practical applications or overly theoretical proofs. It seems the appropriate math course in the MATH 112\/115\/120 sequence.",
    "I'd take math 120 if it's either required\/recommended for your major or if you really like math and are fairly good at it. The class is really time intensive; the p-sets could take anywhere between 5 and 15+ hours to complete, depending on how far the professor went in class. The quality of the instruction is also highly dependent on the professor (try to take it with Miki ideally, or with Jose or Miriam). The exams are very difficult, and the class is not curved, so you actually have to do really well in the class. A lot of people taking the class have previously taking multivariable, which in turn makes the class harder because it goes very quickly and the exams are really challenging. The class is meant to be a weed out, so it is hard. Basically, take it at your own discretion.",
    "Take this class if you need to take it. If you need to take it and can't get in to Miki's section, definitely take it with Jose. After seeing some of the other teachers in various review sessions, it is clear that Jose is a much better teacher than all of the other professors for the course (with the exception of Miki). He really cares about teaching and is very approachable. As for the class itself, the problem sets are extremely tedious and the tests are more about avoiding stupid mistakes than actually understanding the material. There is essentially no curve because half of the people in this class have already taken multivariable calc in high school. If you're prepared, definitely go for 230 over this.",
    "It's a good course, though do take note that a lot of your classmates would have learnt multivariable calculus before in high school. Practice a lot of exercises, and you will be fine.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While many students make it seem incredibly intimidating and scary, upon taking the course, I found that there were so many amazing teachers and helpful resources that the class was much more approachable than other students had made it seem. The topics are interesting and challenging but still doable.",
    "I'd recommend the course, and I'd definitely recommend Professor Gonzalez's section. The workload is very reasonable, one relatively challenging but not-too-long problem set a week. Dr. Gonzalez is great at explaining concepts in class at a good pace, and although he sometimes makes a computational error or miscopies a part of his notes on the blackboard, his explanations are clear and understandable. If you want extra help, it's always available - Dr. Gonzalez has tons of office hours, and there are other tutoring resources available.",
    "Only if it is necessary. Again, the varied skill levels make some grading skewed.",
    "Math 120 is well-taught and a fairly straightforward math class. It really only makes sense to take it if it is required for another class",
    "MATH 120 covers a large amount of material, and anyone taking the class should be aware and cognizant of how much time they should dedicate towards comprehension and mastery, as this will vary between person to person. There are different sources of help with the class, as it is very structured, and this definitely allows for a better understanding of the material. Jose taught this class decently well, his handwriting is nice and his explanations are generally easy to follow. If you find an interest in the applications of theorems, as opposed to the theories themselves, then it is possible you would enjoy this class. Keep in mind the work and the rigor of the material, as those are two things that one might not necessarily realize can be challenging.",
    "A course that tests you on your ability to not make mistakes. There are many situations where you just memorize a formula and evaluate an integral, but it doesn't make the course necessarily easy. I would recommend preparing for this course by just practicing evaluating a few integrals to shake off the dust, as the course will immediately test you on your ability to do so.",
    "I would recommend it because it gives a really solid foundation for multivariable calculus, and the workload is reasonable. I would tell a student that lectures are pleasant (at least with my professor... I can't speak for others) and usually involve learning a theorem or two and then doing practice problems. Lectures aren't particularly active on the part of the student, but are important to attend. Weekly problem sets take a couple of hours, and there are ample resources to help with them.",
    "Math 120 is a challenging, fast paced course. The exams are very challenging but the professors do a good job of preparing you.",
    "Do whatever is possible to enter the section with Miki. If that fails, come to this section. The professor is very approachable.",
    "Math 120 is very challenging, but there is always help available and it depends on how much time you put into it. I would recommend it as long as you are willing to commit the time and effort into making sure you truly understand all the concepts.",
    "120 is notorious for being one of those classes you just have to take. But I found it to be quite rewarding, as you learn many of the fundamental theorems and logic behind your well-known physics equations and concepts. The stuff you learn in here, if you learn it well that is, is some very interesting stuff, and it's pretty intellectually satisfying. The main problem with this course is its organization and setup. Out of the dozen or so sections, you only have a couple of really good ones that people really want to get into, and I think this aspect really degrades the quality of the course. I don't think Jose was a very good professor; he definitely tries his best to help and he is very nice, but I don't think I learned as much multivariable as I could have.",
    "Make sure to really understand the concepts and how to approach problems. That is much more important than the actual problem solving.",
    "I would reccommend the course because it teaches multi variable calc throughly and gives you a good foundation for math in the future.",
    "I would summarize Math 120 as a fast paced, technical, challenging math course. I would recommend it to another student who is willing to commit a large amount of time to it and is very interested in math."
