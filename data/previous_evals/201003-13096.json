    "All the reading is really good (as long as you're interested in the topic). The course load is totally manageable. As long as you get the reading done, you'll be fine in this class",
    "If you want a fun, low-stress class to supplement your other courses, take this. You have to read a book a week, but you are reading books that you usually would not get to read in a typical Yale English or Literature class. It was like a book club. The assignments were pretty easy and Naomi Pabst is such a personable woman.",
    "It was great! The best book club you could ask for and the discussion was great. Take this!",
    "Amazing course. Great books, great discussions. Take it.",
    "Love the texts! Really great for the books! But discussions are not as enlightening as those in other courses. More like a book club.",
    "Prof. Pabst is amazing. She is very knowledgeable in her field and it's an absolute pleasure listening to her talk about the class topics.The atmosphere is very relaxed and it has a relatively low workload. This means that I was able to enjoy the readings more and I feel like I got a lot more out of this style than if I had to write a ton of reading responses.Great material, great professor. Awesome class :)",
    "If she likes you, you'll do fine. Not too much work. Fun discussion. Don't have to read, necessarily. Sparknotes.",
    "Yes, take it! It's a fantastic class and you emerge from the class better informed and a better reader!"
