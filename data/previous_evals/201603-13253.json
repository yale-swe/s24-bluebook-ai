    "Great course",
    "My last attempt at Bayesian statistics. I was going to give up if I still didn't get the hang of it after this time, but thanks for this class I think I finally get Bayesian statistics now, more or less. Lectures were useful. The first two homework can seem unnecessarily difficult\/complicated if you missed out one or two early key steps, but were actually pretty straightforward otherwise. I thought homework 4 and 5 were very useful in terms of helping me understand and really appreciate how the methods involved work in a way that did not require too complicated\/difficult a problem set-up. I thought parts of the exam was a little bit unreasonable, especially Question 4. I don't think I've taken any other exam that required so much on-the-spot algebraic derivation. Sure, Bayesian statistics does seem to involve a lot of complicated derivations and calculations, but asking noobies to do that under time constraint in a stressed-out exam situation?",
    "The course was very informative while not being too difficult. The professor is pretty awesome.",
    "Good",
    "Great materials and great support from homework or TA hours",
    "The instructor is fantastic and genuinely cares about how much his students learn. He is the course's greatest strength. That being said, I am not crazy about the course material, and I found it to be very difficult. I think the course could be improved by improving the lecture slides. To someone like me who struggles with theory, I think extra slides summarizing the theory in a simplistic way would have helped tremendously.",
    "strength: a good introductory level course into bayesian statistics weakness: it would be better if course talked more about hierarchical model.",
    "This is a great course and the lectures are informative and useful.",
    "Extremely tough topic, but the instructor was excellent at explaining and making himself available outside of class.",
    "It's perfect!",
    "Useful theory and background to Bayesian thinking and analysis, with practical considerations for how to frame a model. Fairly standard course with lecturing, weekly or biweekly homework, midterm and final project. The final project was particularly useful in that we could use our own data or tackle a question of interest. While I understand the motivation for keeping this course theoretical (at least in the beginning) I think I would have preferred a more applied format. For example, homework questions could be framed in terms of a real dataset, rather than an abstracted distribution. In addition, the order of lectures could be switched to begin with the approaches that are applied most of the time, and then move to more niche applications -- even if that's not the logical progression in terms of building complexity or the historical order of discovery. That being said, I think the topics chosen for lectures are great. The format of the class could be mixed up a bit, too. Incorporating more in class group work may increase participation and comprehension even if it means taking a hit in efficiency."

    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Great instructor",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Josh gave clear motivations for each topic, which were very important when it came to putting things in context and perspective. He was clearly very knowledgeable about his field, oftentimes citing what other big-name Bayesian researchers think of various methods. He also liked to inject his own opinions on various methods, which was much appreciated (although he tended to mention them very briefly so you had to pay close attention not to miss them). I think in general he could pace himself better. Sometimes he went a bit too fast, especially when a lot of writing on the chalkboard was involved and one needed to copy it down. I also from time to time found the jumping back and forth between the projector and the board a bit annoying, though I got used to it. It can be hard when going back to the notes and slides to recall which part of the notes was supposed to be which part of the slides. I would suggest leaving a blank slide in the slides where chalkboard notes can be written down.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Professor Warren went over the material in a reasonable manner and at a reasonable pace. He was very helpful and genuinely cared about the students understanding. Great! It's better to give more opportunities with application.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Good!",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Friendly and reponsible. Very helpful during the project or homeworks",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Dr. Warren was incredibly responsive and willing to help with anything. He is very approachable and goes the extra mile to answer questions even outside of office hours. I almost dropped the course after a few weeks but decided to continue because he was so helpful and I knew I could ask him questions throughout the semester. The only way I think he could improve is by making his slides more intuitive.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Josh is great, and always be willing to help students.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Great teacher, very patient in answering questions.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Dr. Warren delivers informative lectures and is kind and responsive to our questions.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Excellent instructor for such a tough topic",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0He is an excellent instructor!",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Clear lectures and strong command of the material. Shows strong interest in helping students and is extremely generous with his time for meeting outside of class."

    "This course can arise your interests on Bayesian methods. I would recommend it to others.",
    "Challenging but good intro to Bayesian thinking and analysis. Assumes a lot of background knowledge commensurate with it being a high-numbered class within the bis masters program framework, which can be difficult to jump into if you aren't in that track. Leans a bit more towards theory than application."
