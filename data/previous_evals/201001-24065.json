   "comments": [
    "No. I thought the course was poorly run, and the weekly readings did not supplement the lectures well.",
    "Apparently Mahoney is leaving and who knows if Yale is replacing him. I would definitely recommend this course. Don't be put off by the two page reading responses. I got used to skimming the reading and writing them in the hour and a half I had between lab and section (and getting As on them).Get Jacob D as your TA. He's a really easy grader.Lecture is kinda boring, but you'll learn a lot in this course.",
    "A strong introduction to the colonial and postcolonial history of the continent, which is difficult to do owing to its vastness and cultural diversity. Prof. Mahoney is unfortunately leaving next year, so I'm not sure how relevant all this is. Also, this may have just been my experience but this was one of the most grade-inflated classes I've taken yet.",
    "I'm not sure whether or not to recommend this class, since Professor Mahoney is leaving after this year. The subject itself is very interesting and relevant to many disciplines, but what really made it enjoyable was his lecture style. Very reasonable work-load, though, and interesting readings.",
    "I would certainly recommend History 336. I did not know enough about Africa and was glad that I could learn something about its situation and the causes for its peculiar development.",
    "YES! Take this course, especially if you don't know anything or don't care about Africa. This course will make you want to go to Africa. This course really opens your eyes and if you are a history major I think it should be required. Weekly reading responses really aren't bad, and there are no papers.",
    "I would say that the class gives a general overview of certain historical and social trends in Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, between 1800 and the present day. I would recommend it for anybody who wanted a basic understanding of where some of the modern conflicts come from, as well as people who want a better idea of the impacts of European imperialism.",
    "It's too bad that this course is not going to be offered anymore, although I think this is a general problem of the Yale history department, and its lack of focus on the \"other world\" classes. Mahoney leaving has left a big hole in the curriculum. The class definitely had its flaws- it was a bit broad and generic, as any class focusing on 200 years of the history of a continent would be. This led to te professor cherry-picking certain examples which was necessary but also limiting.The work wasn't too bad, although I sometimes found myself wondering why I was writing DBQs (It reminded me of AP Euro in high school). That being said, the readings were not extensive, but yet also interesting- you read a lot of Chinua Achebe.",
    "Yes! The class if very interesting. Weekly responses can be bothersome but readings are interesting. Tests are fair.",
    "African history since 1800 covers colonization, decolonization, and the many factors associated with these processes.",
    "Overview of Africa from 1800 to present. Manageable workload (weekly reading responses + section, 1 midterm, 1 exam, no paper), and the readings were usually pretty interesting, even including some novels which was a nice change of pace from typical history courses. Perfect class to take to fulfill your rest of the world history credit, and also good to take if you have an interest in Africa and its history. Mahoney is a great lecturer.",
    "It was an excellent class on an interesting subject. The workload was manageable and I have come out of the class feeling much more informed on the subject.",
    "History of Africa provides an overview to colonial and post-colonial African history. It's a huge topic, and I was not particularly impressed with Professor Mahoney's ability to convey breadth and depth at the same time in his lectures or choice of readings. One thing to be said: this class is extremely easy -- few readings and no long papers.",
    "MUST TAKE!",
    "You should learn this stuff, but as to whether you should do it in this course... Dunno. Shop it and see if you like it",
    "I liked having weekly reading responses rather than one or two big papers. It was more helpful with regards to learning the material and less stressful overall. I found the material that the course covered interesting and informative, and I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Very Good class. Survey of Africa since 1800. leaves out S. Africa and focuses on economic, social, colonial, legacy of this troubled continent",
    "This is a great course to satisfy your \"rest of the world requirement\" pretty painlessly. It's also pretty interesting, addressing many of the biggest problems in Africa today.",
    "Definitely take it! A lot of work but one of the most satisfying classes you will take at Yale. Will not be the same without Mahoney teaching it though.",
    "It's not being offered again with Mahoney, and Yale is not hiring a new professor because of budget reasons. Modern African history is a really interesting subject, so if they do find a new professor, it's a good choice, especially for the rest of the world requirement.",
    "What a great class!! Take it if you are genuinely interested in learning about Africa since colonization. Mahoney is a great lecturer and the material is excellent. The course is difficult at times, but very worth it. 2-3 page paper every week, a midterm, and a final.",
    "If you're willing to put the work into it, I guess this is class is worthwhile. Otherwise it's graded too harshly, and the focus is not on anything relevant.",
    "History 336 is a general overview of Africa from pre-colonial to post-colonial times. I would highly recommend this class to another student. The lectures are well planned. The teaching assistants are very good as well.",
    "Yes, definitely - Mahoney is incredible. I'm very sorry that no Yale student will be able to take this class with him again. Thank Yale for devaluing your education and putting its researched-based reputation first...once again.",
    "one of my favorite classes. i came in knowing close to nothing about african history and came out with a necessary understanding of the background of the problems that face modern africa today. mahoney is a really engaging lecturer. you could tell he's very passionate about what he teaches. i walked out of class every day feeling like i'd learned so much, more than i thought possible within the span of 50 minutes. doing the weekly responses was a pain, but worth it in the end. most of the topics we wrote about were interesting and enjoyable to learn about. it beat doing a big paper at the end. i'd definitely recommend this course to everyone, because unfortunately not a lot of people know about africa except for the fact that it's a continent plagued with poverty and AIDS. this class has made me want to learn as much about africa as i can.",
    "I don't think Mahoney is teaching it again...",
    "I would recommend it. African history can be easy to overlook to students used to D.S. or European\/American history, but it's an important subject to study and this class is an excellent way to do it. There are a lot of important modern international issues that the course touches on as well.",
    "This is a great survey course of African History. I had never really been interested in Africa before, but this class did what many survey history courses here masterfully do which is provide context for current events on the continent. As with all classes, it will depend greatly on the professor, and sadly Professor Mahoney will not be teaching the class again, so really make sure you shop any future classes, and I'm sorry you missed the opportunity.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student interested in getting a broad overview of modern African history. The lectures are entertaining, the readings are usually very interesting, and the work load is manageable. I was never bored in class.",
    "This class gives an overview history of many facets of colonial and post-colonial African history. The information is very interesting and relevant for any history major. It's a great class on its own, and it's a really good way to fulfill the \"rest of the world\" history major requirement. There was almost no reading (which was actually a fault). This class is very basic, so if you have a lot of knowledge about Africa, you might be bored.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The lectures are very interesting and Mahoney is a fantastic speaker. The reading is not too heavy and the articles are really interesting. There is no final paper which is a relief, only weekly reading responses of about 2 pages. The Midterm and Final are also very manageable.",
    "This class was alright. It's a decent rest of the world credit, and it's pretty interesting. It's disjointed, though, and you don't necessarily gain tools to answer the questions the course raises about the situation in Africa today. The reading was very manageable, which was nice, and the reading responses weren't too bad. My TF graded tough; dunno if it's overall a hard class or it was just for me.",
    "This class was a survey of modern African history. The professor focused heavily on dates, names, and places and didn't spend much time putting these things into a larger narrative or context. The lectures were informative but sometimes tended towards generalization (e.g., \"Missionaries wanted X\" or \"Colonial officials did Y\"). The lectures were rarely engaging and I suspect this is why the class had ~50% attendance on most days.The readings and section partially redeemed this class for me. It is odd that we read mostly fiction in a history class but Ngugi wa Thiong'o is a welcome change from the drier history texts. The lack of non-fiction readings meant that you had to baseyour knowledge in fiction or the lectures, which doesn't seem very academic.In the end, I feel that I learned a lot of useful facts in this class but that it did not change my life. It was not one of those classes where the lectures leave you speechless.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It is extremely interesting and provides a broad overview of the history of Sub-Saharan Africa, which is very useful when looking at the challenges that African countries experience today.",
    "Definitely a great class and important knowledge for understanding the world. His style is traditional (slide of terms\/ outline + lecture for each class) but I thought that was the best way to learn about a new subject. The reading responses are really not that bad and the reading load is certainly manageable-- a nice blend of secondary and fiction.",
    "I would take this course because it covers interesting material, has good readings which are not too long and which you have to read because of the reading responses, and because Professor Mahoney is quite a good lecturer. Be aware, though, that the course doesn't cover Southern or Northern Africa at all, only the central belt.",
    "Professor Mahoney is leaving, so this class will likely be significantly different. But as it was taught this semester, I found the class very valuable. We covered a little about a lot of different subjects, and I definitely feel that I have a much better grasp of Africa now than I did four months ago.",
    "This course is incredible. The weekly papers keep you on top of the fascinating material, and section is actually productive and engaging. The midterm and final are very straightforward, and Mahoney is a great lecturer. This was one of my favorite classes. TAKE IT.",
    "I loved this class. Each lecture was really engaging. This was definitely my favorite class this semester, one of the best I've ever taken. I knew next to nothing about Africa before coming in, and definitely walked away knowing a lot more. I really enjoyed how Mahoney focused on a few nations (Nigeria, Kenya, Congo, etc), as they represented a larger portion of Africa, and took them from pre-colonial to post-colonial times. My favorite lectures were the latest lectures about what's going on in these countries now, and even though I'm usually not that interested in economics, I really loved the econ lectures and comparing pre and post colonial economics. The movies were a nice addition to the lectures. The lectures were well paced but still managed to give so much information, and they were really well tied together by going through the same nations. Professor Mahoney is the best. His lectures were well-organized and always interesting. He managed to keep the lectures packed with information and yet not overwhelm us with information. Definitely one of the best lecturers I've had (definitely up there, if not better than, Blight and Gaddis). Great professor. Get Jacob Diamini as a TA if you can.",
    "A wonderful course. Too bad Yale has decided to ignore the history of Africa for the next couple semesters."
