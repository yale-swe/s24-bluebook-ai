   "comments": [
    "only take the class if you don't mind having 2 hrs of class every morning and needing to do at least 2 hrs of work 5 times a week on top of that to ensure that you do well in the class. Or if you really really need to finish your language requirement in 1 semester because you're a senior",
    "If you want to seriously learn the language, then take it. This course is very demanding, and it's probably not worth it unless you want to further continue your study of Spanish. Your reading comprehension will improve more than anything else. Since the course is so condensed, your speaking ability may lag behind, but it's still useful to be submersed in Spanish for 2 hrs a day.",
    "A great way to get through two semesters of Spanish in only one. Be prepared to wake up early (class was 8:20am-10am) and survive two hours of class 5 days a week, but it is worth it!!!! the class is not difficult, but it is pretty comprehensive. Only do it though if you think you'll be able to actually wake up for it though.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It went at a perfect pace that was neither rote or overwhelming. There was a lot of grammar, a lot of short readings (which really made the class interesting), and a very short novel for the last few weeks. Regular class discussions were great, in and of themselves, as well as for the purpose of practicing speaking.",
    "Intensive Intermediate Spanish is a really good way to accelerate your learning of the language; nearly two hours of class a day really improved my comprehension and grammar, and I'm so glad I took this class instead of L3 and L4 separately. Professor Pilar is a wonderful teacher and so much fun, she really made the time fly by in class. It is a big time investment and there is a lot of homework and reading, but I think it's definitely worth it.",
    "The material is about what you'd expect for a course of this kind; what made this class truly distinctive for me was Professor Asensio, who was absolutely fantastic, and the fact that you really get to be familiar with your classmates, which is kind of a fun change from a lot of other courses. I found myself really enjoying the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Spanish 145 to a fellow student.",
    "Excellent class-- I wish I had taken the accelerated version of L1 and L2 as well; it's much less misery. The first half of the semester is a lot of grammar review and perfecting your grammar. I imagine that it could have been boring for anyone coming right off of L2; I hadn't taken Spanish in over a year, so the review was quite welcome. We read quite a few articles over the semester and a short novella at the end, and it all dramatically improved my reading ability. I think my speaking was getting quite a bit better, too, by the end. Professor Asensio is very dynamic and good at pulling people out so that everyone speaks. Even though class was at 8:20, no one was ever falling asleep, which says a lot about her ability to engage students!"
