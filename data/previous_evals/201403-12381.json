    "You already know if you need to take this.",
    "necessary, if you're a physics major!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Prof. Harris is very supportive, and you have the opportunity to engage in research with leading physicists. Be aware that it can take up a lot of your time (I was spending 15 hours a week on my project), but that the time is also more flexible than most traditional courses.",
    "This is research for credit. Not much else to say. Find a good professor to work with and it will be a super chill credit.",
    "If your advisor is really busy (as most established and successful professors are), make sure you establish a regular meating schedule. I went a phone semester only being able to talk to my professor a couple times, and they regularly had to cancel our tentative meetings.",
    "This is the best part of the Physics major. I loved working at the lab, and got a lot of support from graduate students and pos-grads. I certainly picked up things I hadn't learned inside a class-room (reading published papers, discussing results with other scientists, a lot of programming and statistics), and consider this to be the most valuable experience I have had at Yale both for grad school and job applications.",
    "If you're taking this, you're taking it for the physics major\/research. Your primary interaction will be with your advisor, not with Prof. Harris - make sure everything is clear between you and your advisor.",
    "This course is way more fun and relaxed than any of the normal labs. Because it is an independent project, your experience will be shaped almost entirely by your project and advisor.",
    "Required for Physics majors",
    "You have to take it. Make the most of the opportunity.",
    "Very good; this is the senior project\/research course in physics. It might depend on your individual advisor; I had an incredible advisor who helped me work with a research group, guide my research, answer questions, and put it all together. A great course."
