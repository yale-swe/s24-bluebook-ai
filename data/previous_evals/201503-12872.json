    "If you're interested in learning QFT, this will give you the basics. It's not easy, nor is it particularly engaging, but it gets the job done.",
    "You've heard about QFT all your undergraduate career - now, go and learn it. Takes dedication, but is completely worth it.",
    "Phys 609 is a great course, although chances are that if you're reading this then you're already set on taking it. Tom's treatment is quite methodical, and he even covers a fair bit of the math involved.",
    "PHYS 609 provides an excellent introduction to field theory, loosely following Peskin and Schroeder but with important differences. The course is probably highly dependent on the professor, and I would absolutely recommend taking it with Professor Appelquist, who provides a systematic and clear approach to the material.",
    "Field theory from the ground up. I would recommend it.",
    "It's a good class, but not easy. The problem sets take a long time, but you'll learn a lot if you do them. You should take it if it's important to your field of study."

    "This course provided the beginnings of a theoretical motivation and background for my work in experimental and theoretical high-energy physics.",
    "Yes. I'm glad I took it. Since I'm not a theorist, I don't know how much it will help me, but it's good to know the theory behind my experiment."
