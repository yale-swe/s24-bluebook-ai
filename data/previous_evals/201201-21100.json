   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this, especially if they are geared towards a PhD.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone who's remotely interested in international relations and history in general. This course builds a find bridge between the two, with an emphasis on writing history with an international angle. It broadens one's understanding of some of the eternal issues in international politics by reading and writing history. It also opens up possibilities to approach history with a global perspective.",
    "Of course. Because it covers the historiography of the world from ancient Greece to American hegemony. Everyone should be interested in how to write an international history.",
    "Broad sweep analysis but not superficial look into transnational history. Will read works one must know to be a well read scholar of any sort.",
    "This is a thematic reading course, organized around weekly topics that relate to the overall theme of international history. It is a great introduction to the field of international history, and lets you know the recurring issues which have framed the key debates over the years, while reflecting the latest scholarship in the field, such as the great syntheses of the 19th century, \"America in the world\", and recent attempts at writing a history of the \"global Cold War\".",
    "I would describe the course as one that gives students a chance to engage with many historical works on a deep, analytical level, and to think about history, and especially transnational history, in a more complex way. I would highly recommend the course to another student."

   "comments": [
    "Broadened my thoughts.",
    "As a former IR student entering history, I was surprised by how different a global perspective can bring to history writing. This course nurtures my interest in IH and transnational history, and it bridges perfectly the gaps between IR and history in every aspect.",
    "Gave me a historical understanding of ir but also the subjective nature of history and political science.",
    "It certainly deepened my knowledge of the broader issues in the historiography of the European experience of international relations. It also contributed to my understanding of the achievements as well as difficulties in writing an \"international\" or \"transnational\" history of a specific topic. It contributed to my research by allowing me to see the broader, global picture, beyond my own chosen field (which is non-European).",
    "This course isn't aligned closely with my research interests. However, I can no longer read a historical account without thinking about the wider context in which the piece is situated - this has greatly expanded my way of thinking."
