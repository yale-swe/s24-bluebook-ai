    "Highly recommend.",
    "Yes I would recommend it",
    "I would recommend taking the class only if that student already has a solid background in film theory. The class is not particularly beginner-friendly, and does not provide any context for the works with which we engaged, but instead pandered more toward a hand-full of theorists whose works fit one particular approach to film theory.",

    "Yes, the deeper exposure to Bazin and his writing compliments my own research on media and its criticism.",
    "Significantly.",
    "Although we only focused on a small number of theorists, those theorists are clearly crucial to the field and have helped me establish a common vocabulary with other academics in the field with which I now feel more comfortable communicating.",
    "This is an \"introduction\" of sorts so while it won't contribute to my dissertation per se, it will inform my thinking."
