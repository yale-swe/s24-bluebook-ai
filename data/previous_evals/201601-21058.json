    "Its a lot of work. You will without a doubt pull all nighters to finish p-sets, and if by the grace of god you find the timer to study in addition to the time you will allocate to completing homework assignments...who am I kidding, there is not time to both successfully, so be ready to pick and choose which portion of your grade you actually have the time and mental capacity to fulfill.",
    "If you're taking it, it's for your major. Godspeed.",
    "Only take this class if you have to for your major. Also if Professor Vaccaro is teaching, wait a year until someone else is teaching, it will be significantly more manageable.",
    "I don't imagine anyone would take this class unless they have to, but if you have the time and are interested, go for it. Try to take it with Vaccaro, as I find he is extremely organized and committed to helping his students learn.",
    "A lot of work, but totally worth it if you care about quantum mechanics.",
    "A wonderful class, taught by a wonderful professor. The material is fascinating, although not easy to understand; the class is well-organized and very well taught. The workload was huge, but generally satisfying and not annoying. The exams were very fair and quite tough, but fun to take (even though I did not do too well on them!).Professor Vaccaro cares a lot about students and is always very helpful and responsive. Best class at Yale thus far.",
    "This is an excellent introduction to quantum chemistry. The class is very demanding but you will be provided with everything you need to understand the material and all you are required to do is put in the time. A lot of time. Time is a rare commodity at Yale, but for this class, for how much you will get out of it, it's worth it. Professor Vacarro is a great lecturer and instructor and always available to help. Chem 332 is a a prereq, but I don't think the two courses were very connected, so if you are just interested in quantum and don't really want to suffer through thermodynamics, you should be able to take this class. (that is, if you are not a chem major.) I think only chem and chem E students tend to take chem 333, but that's a shame because it's a course that any stem student interested in quantum would enjoy.",
    "This class will take over your life, but you'll learn a lot! Don't expect to do too well percentage wise (no idea bout the overall grade\/curve), but keep fighting! Learning anything here could benefit you down the road. Plus you need to graduate with the chem major so, might as well.",
    "This is probably the best course in the chem department at Yale. You start with the origins of quantum theory then work all the way up through quantum mechanics from particle-in-a-box to molecular orbitals, guided the whole time by Professor Vaccaro who is an exceptional teacher. It's definitely a lot of work, but the workload is predictable and therefore super manageable if you're on top of your stuff (there's a ~10 hour pset every week plus 2 midterms and a final). The exams are tricky, but very reasonable if you've been going to class and doing the homework. The work takes less time than Vaccaro's infamous PChem Lab, but the content here is much more complicated so beware if you're not mathematically inclined.",
    "Very good class. Worth taking with Vaccaro I cannot comment on anyone else, but he brings so much to the course I would be wary of taking it without him. Necessary for any Chemistry major, even one interested in mathematics and physics. I took this class in conjunction with PHYS 440 (Quantum I) which was definitely worthwhile. Some professors will try to convince you that there will be too much overlap. There is some, but the two different perspectives are worth it in my opinion. PHYS gives the real math and justification and CHEM gives really cool spectroscopy and actually many more advanced quantum topics. Material- A fast intro to a lot of good quantum with semi-rigorous justification. The usual model potentials problems along with applications to molecular spectroscopy and transitions. Finished up with a little bit of MO theory\/computation background. Grades- P Set grading had the usual TA mistakes, but was usually straight forward, especially if you know any math at all (by this I mean linear algebra). Test were just what you would expect and Vaccaro lets you have approximately infinite time on the midterms so there is never any rush. Professor- Amazing professor who reaches students at all levels. Whether you want extensions to more in depth material or do not grasp basic concepts, Vaccaro will almost always make time for you. E-mail him any time day or night holiday or workday.",
    "A comprehensive introduction of quantum mechanics in a chemistry context. A class that is not to be trifled with as far as workload goes, but is rewarding with much time spent. If you can, try to lighten your load elsewhere when you take this class; you'll be able to enjoy it more.",
    "Please don't take this class if you don't have to. Please please please. I know everyone says that and its because \"classes are hard,\" but thats not the reason. The department is lacking. When the racial campus climate was high during the fall and the spring, missing class was not an option.. and he moves so fast with so much information, its like singing your death warrant. If you have to work because financial aid asks you for a million dollars, you won't have time for Class 3x week, section 1x a week, and then random review sessions at night meant to go over things without a solution. In fact, if you any interest in chemistry\/\/engineering this class is so theoretical that it loses relevance very fast. If you like to be captivated, you won't be. If you like to understand the material as you sit in class, you won't. Don't even bother buying the text book, because he doesn't use it. Literally, unless you credit D this class, you're asking to constantly feel anxious about a weekly 4 page densely packed problem set or the fact that the psets are graded harshly.",
    "CHEM 333 is a hard class, there's no going around that. The material, however, is interesting, and Vaccaro is meticulous. There was a disconnect between the material taught in class, the material on the problem sets, and the material on exams which made it very hard to succeed.",
    "CHEM 333 is an overview of quantum mechanics, and as a course it can be very taxing and stressful and difficult. It is possible to get through it, and you do learn a lot, but getting to the end doesn't always seem like a possibility.",
    "Challenging course but interesting and rewarding material. If Vaccaro is teaching, I would highly recommend taking this course for those interested in chem and physics.",
    "This class is absolutely ridiculous. Professor Vaccaro has some of the highest expectations of his students and will require you to work a lot during this semester. That said, the material is really interesting if you are willing to learn it. I didn't enjoy the first part of the class too much but eventually when you get to atomic and molecular structure it all comes together and forms this really cool description of chemistry. There are problem sets every week, including reading week, that take a significant amount of time but can be done in one day if you work really hard, although I wouldn't recommend that strategy. There are two midterms, both four hours, from 7-11pm. Honestly, if you want to do well in this class, you have to put in a lot of time. Vaccaro leaves his notes on closed reserve in the CSSSI. You should go there often to review material as his notes are well-structured and easy to read. Also, go to his office and ask him questions. He'll help you with anything as long as you go to talk with him. This class is ridiculously hard, demands way too much from students, and can be a really unenjoyable experience if you let it be, but you'll get through it just like everyone else, and if you put in the time, it can be very interesting and a lot less of a hassle than it needs to be.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if not for an interest in quantum chemistry then just for the experience of taking a class with Vaccaro.",
    "Physical chemistry is not supposed to be a fun topic, but Professor Vaccaro does such an amazing job teaching the material and being enthusiastic about what he's teaching that I looked forward to class and resented it when I had to miss class. The problem sets (that Vaccaro writes himself) are all instructive and valuable, and honestly made the class. If you want to understand quantum chemistry, this is a fascinating class.",
    "Chem 333 is an intensive math and physics course which includes little chemistry. It covers the most material you will ever be expected to know ever and it expects you to know most of it. I would not recommend it to another student because of its enormous workload.",
    "Better than 330L, but if you take it with Vaccaro still requires a LOT of time and can be very rough with a heavy course load.",
    "A thorough overview of quantum mechanics in chemistry using the time-independent schrodinger equation to derive the four quantum numbers, and subsequently build orbitals, hybrid orbitals, and molecules. Truly shocking stuff,"
