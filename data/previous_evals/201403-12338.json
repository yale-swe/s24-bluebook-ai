    "You should take EP&E 276 if you are genuinely interested in the subject matter and willing to put in the time to make sense of\/deeply engage with challenging readings and class discussions.",
    "This is a great discussion on the concept of sovereignty and its relations to human rights and the cosmopolitan project. It starts off with a little historical background but then mostly focuses on recent theories. Professor Benhabib is amazing, so definitely take this class if she offers it again and if you manage to get a spot.",
    "Yes, if you are prepared to juggle difficult ideas and have a background in political philosophy and human rights.",
    "A challenging course that covers a very wide mix of texts from political philosophy to contemporary debates about human rights, from international law to institutions like the EU. The readings were very well arranged to give the course structure and the conversations picked up on earlier weeks smoothly, though some of these units were a little harder to dig into with little background. Discussions were excellent and the class consists of a large group of bright graduate and law students who brought great perspectives on the texts. Do it if any of these themes interest you, and it's a pleasure to take classes with Professor Benhabib who is a great thinker and runs these sessions very well. Reading fluctuates between being not too much to a lot depending on the week, and many of the works take more than one read to understand, so be prepared to work."
