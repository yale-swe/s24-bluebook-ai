   "comments": [
    "This class is a necessary evil, Taylor's version seems less evil than others, at least to me (I haven't taken others.)",
    "A great Linear Algebra course, the professor makes the material very accessible. The problem sets are a little long but very manageable, and the exams are pretty fair. Overall I would recommend this class!",
    "Absolutely, linear algebra is important for a variety of fields related to math and this class does a solid job teaching the fundamentals of it.",
    "If you are interested in Mathematics, Linear Algebra is a must.",
    "Math 222 is a very logical math class which requires little prior knowledge. It would be a good QR for someone who needs one, or just a fun, interesting class in general. It's equal parts theoretical and practical, so you leave the class with a very full understanding of the material. I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "It's a very basic overview of linear algebra that is very applied, so will be useful to people outside the math major mostly.",
    "I would recommend it. It hasn't been a terribly hard course and the material is interesting.",
    "This is a great class, and I highly recommend Professor Taylor if you have him as an option. He's a great and entertaining lecturer, and he really explains the concepts well. If you're looking for a strong introduction into linear algebra in a more applied sense, this is definitely the class to take. I switched out of MATH 225 into this class and was seriously happy with my decision. I am coming out of this semester with a very strong understanding of all the concepts discussed and a strong foundation for the future. I definitely recommend this class, even if you're not all that interested in math.",
    "I would say math 222 is a better introduction than 225 (which is more proof based). My section of 222 is also very good because we had an amazing TF that hosted plenty of sections (twice a week) and gave a lot of hand outs for one to practice on. The professor is very nice and wants everyone to learn. I would highly suggest taking Prof Samuel Taylors Math 222 section.",
    "Good intro linear algebra class, but there are HARLDY ANY APPLICATIONS. Only take this if you want to learn the most basic linear algebra.",
    "I highly recommend this course with Prof Sam Taylor. He made the concepts very clear the first time I learned from in class, and was very good at pacing so as not to overwhelm us with new concepts. The midterms were very straightforward. Also the weekly sections were very helpful and reviewing what we learned in class. Prof Taylor definitely made linear algebra accessible and understandable to people in the class. I learned a lot!",
    "Decent class. Sam presented stuff clearly, if a bit theoretically. Good overall balance of difficulty and work.",
    "If you put in the work for the class (which is not too much, but at times tedious), you will definitely succeed in the class. For those with some proof understanding, this is probably not the class for you as you will not feel very challenged by the content, which is very computation heavy. Nevertheless, the content is very interesting for someone who hasn't formally studied linear algebra.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class for beginners in linear algebra. Take Sam's section if he's teaching it, not Asaf's. From what I have heard from friends, Asaf's section was way behind us at around mid-semester, and students in his class sounded generally dissatisfied.",
    "This was an enjoyable linear algebra course. Not too much work and also pretty easy. To be honest I stopped going to class most days of the week about halfway through the semester. But I really liked the prof and it wasn't too much work.",
    "You're likely taking this class to fulfill a major requirement but it is a really great introduction to linear algebra that will likely expose many students to a completely different topic in math. I found it pretty interesting and different from all the other math classes I had taken previously.",
    "I would recommend it. Curriculum is interesting and really cool if you're interested in computing or statistics.",
    "If you want to learn linear algebra, then yes I recommend.",
    "Easy. Although there is no reason to take it if it is not for your major.",
    "As stated above. Fun and useful class some not very difficult.",
    "Great intro course with a lot of material and terms.",
    "I definitely would recommend math 222. Linear algebra is a topic I knew nothing about and I really like it now.",
    "Math 222 provides a foundational understanding of linear algebra and describes some of its applications. This course was very well taught by Professor Taylor, who was very enthusiastic and well-prepared for his lectures. Even if this course is outside of your major, I would definitely recommend it--linear algebra is foundational to mathematics and this course can provide a glimpse into its principles and applications.",
    "Absolutely! Sam is a great instructor, and you learn a lot! I enjoyed it much, much better than Math 120, which was a total disaster. Beware though, the exams are easy, so the curve is ridiculous. Make sure to study hard and you'll be fine.",
    "If you wanna know how to use linear algebra, but not the details of the theory, this class is a great choice.",
    "This class was ridiculously easy. We followed the textbook exactly, and the tests didnt cover corner cases or require any original thought whatsoever. Instead, all of the questions were straightforward applications of the easier parts of each chapter. (The class average on the final exam was a 94!) MATH 222 was far easier than even MATH 120. In terms of material, you do learn how to solve m by n systems of equations in a number of ways, as well as the theory behind the fundamental theorem of linear algebra, which was cool. However, we only get to eigenvalues\/eigenvectors in the last two weeks of class, and we dont learn why theyre even important, which was strange.",
    "MATH 222 is a straightforward and general introductory course to linear algebra. The course is very accessible to non-math majors and covers the major topics in linear algebra at a dependable pace. The course honestly doesnt delve into too many applications, but the examples are helpful and the course material is well organized. For those seeking a more proof-centered or more intensive course, you might consider a higher-numbered option for linear algebra. Dr. Taylor offers clear and instructive lectures. (It shouldnt be necessary to study the book much beyond what the material discussed in class). Each of Dr. Taylors lectures is well structured and involves connections to other course topics or larger aims. His office hours are helpful for any questions about subjects or the course.",
    "Linear Algebra is a cool class. It was very theoretical and fast paced, making the class challenging. I found the lectures a bit boring and too general. Take the class if you want to be challenged because the problem sets do take a long time to complete. The lectures are only okay and sometimes boring, but do provide important theorems to use during problem sets"
