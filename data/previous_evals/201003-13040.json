    "Highly recommended! The topic changes from semester to semester, so just check out the syllabus before you sign up to make sure that it's something that interests you. I would take anything taught by Mme Pinzka -- she's cheerful, dynamic, and extremely willing to help you improve your writing in French. Although it involves a fair amount of reading, it's not a literature course, so don't be worried if you haven't taken a French lit class before.",
    "I really liked this class, even though I was taking it Cr\/D I did most of the reading and didn't find the assignments too difficult. The papers are worth much more than class participation, which is good if you're shy about speaking but want to take a French class. I loved all the reading. It was mostly books that I would have wanted to read anyway, as an English major. The class made me want to go to Paris!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students who have gone or want to go to Paris. If you don't want to go to Paris after this class, I'd be surprised. It's a pretty manageable workload and you get to speak in French about contemporary topics that are really interesting. There were only 5 students in this section, which gave us each a lot of time to speak. It might have been less ideal if there had been more students."
