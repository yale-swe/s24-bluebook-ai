   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student as long as your comfortable speaking Spanish. Some people prefer writing or reading Spanish but this is a lot of speaking (as the name advanced conversational implies)",
    "It is a good discussion-based class, but if you are looking to perfect your grammar, maybe take L4 first.",
    "Some of the readings are really boring but you watch two great movies and read a really good book at the end. The first half of the course is definitely not as good as the second. There are six written homework assignments which can be a pain but are not difficult. Three quizzes, which are easy and do not take much studying. Two oral exams which require a bit of preparation with a partner but aren't all that stressful.",
    "Hesitantly recommended. If you speak at least as well as the rest of the class, I'm sure it can be rewarding. But if you start at a lower level, improving is difficult, unless you devote a lot of time to out-of-class preparation.",
    "I would reccommend it to anyone who has taken through L4 and still wants to build confidence and refine speaking the language--not grammar or picky stuff like the L1-L4 courses tend to focus on."
