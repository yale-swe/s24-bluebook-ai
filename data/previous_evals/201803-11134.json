   "comments": [
    "A cursory overview of French literature and a deeper appreciation for all the rich writing Francophone writers have produced.",
    "I didn't really develop any skills I didn't already have coming into the course.",
    "This course acquainted me with a broad selection of French texts, such that I now feel that I am in a much better position to decide whether a more specialized class would appeal to me. I appreciated that these texts were always situated in their historical and literary contexts which made interpretation more meaningful. This course improved my spoken, and in particular written French.",
    "I learned how to read and understand many of the major works and writers of the French literary canon. I also learned how to speak and write more clearly about literature in French.",
    "My French writing skills improved: in my high school class, we focused on building vocabulary and speaking skills, but never really learned to write a French essay. I am very grateful for acquiring this skill through this class. I also gained a lot of insight into the background and cultural context behind certain pieces of literature: our class discussions allowed me to better apply literary analysis skills to my papers.",
    "I improved my French writing and critical reading skills. I also got a basic overview of the history of French literature."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed Prof Girard's little lectures about the author at the beginning of classthat was my favorite part. It helped me place the author in their historical context and appreciate their unique writing more. Discussion was lacking at points and dominated by a few folks, but I don't believe that was because students weren't doing the reading. I think it's because as language learners, sometimes we truly didn't understand parts of that. I think the course could thus take a bit more of a language-learner approach. Maybe Prof Girard could distribute vocabulary sheets for difficult terms in each reading, or maybe begin discussion of a reading by piecing together some basic points of the reading to make sure students understood it. I would have also enjoyed learning about how to write an academic essay in the French style. Our essays weren't really textual analysis, more just comments on what we liked about the reading. I think it would help students prepare for upper-level French classes to have more guidance on how to write an essay in French.",
    "The texts we read were interesting, but this course was supposed to be discussion based and we barely spoke during class because the professor spent most of it on presentations that could've taken half the time and also dominated the discussions.",
    "It covers a broad span of French literature in the right amount of detail. The variety in the texts (in terms of style and genre) that were chosen was what stood out to me above all else.",
    "The reading list and the instructor were definitely the strengths of this course. Professor Girard was extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and kind throughout the semester, and her knowledge and passion for the works we read made class exciting and fruitful.",
    "I felt that sometimes our discussion questions were a bit too ambitious for a single class period: there were some pieces of literature that simply could not be thoroughly discussed in one class period, and as a result certain plot points or themes were left undiscussed. I think the syllabus should be more flexible, to allow more time to discuss each individual work.",
    "The readings were great, and Mme. Girard's in-class presentations of the authors were very insightful. A weakness would be inconsistency in the length of readings. This could be improved through clearer notice of how long the readings would be, so they could be more evenly distributed by the student."

   "comments": [
    "If you are looking to continue taking upper-level French courses, I think this class is important to get a grasp on French literature throughout the ages. If you want an L5 class focused more on conversation and culture though, take 160.",
    "I would not. Take a higher level literature course instead.",
    "I would recommend this course as a foundation to literary studies in French. I think that knowing a little bit about many different periods and styles is very useful as a framework for study in any kind of French literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to any person who wishes to understand the influence and intrigue of some of the great works of French literature. I would also recommend this course to any students interested in strengthening their writing in French, since the essays were helpful and the feedback was constructive.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, especially for students who want to improve writing and speaking skills. I cannot express how much I benefitted from the essay assignments and the final presentation in this class - I had very little confidence in my French abilities prior to taking this course, and now I feel very comfortable writing papers in French and speaking for long periods of time.",
    "Yes! It's a great introduction to French literature, as well as a great introduction to taking courses in French with coursework beyond simple language practice."
