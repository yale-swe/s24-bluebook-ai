    "The strengths of this course was that the professors are really dedicated to make sure that you do well. However, I think that the placement of some students may have been incorrect in that some students had taken French for a multitude of years prior and elected to start at L1 simply due to course requirements for work. This class moves really fast.",
    "I feel that the strengths of this course lies in how immersive the class was. Through being forced to speak solely french during class, students were able to constantly interact with the language. I think the weakness of this course was that sometimes things weren't explained as clearly as they could be.",
    "The course could be a little more open about explaining grammar points in English as well as french because the explanations in french often leave students more confused."

    "I would recommend this course mainly to students who have had some interaction with the French language. I personally feel as though this course would be extremely challenging for someone who has never encountered french before.",
