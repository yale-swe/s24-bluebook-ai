   "comments": [
    "Great course reviewing strategies, frameworks, and techniques for negotiations. Write journal responses to real negotiations that we conduct in small groups (1:1 to 3:3), and a final paper analyzing a negotiation.",
    "CSSY 280 is a great course for anyone who wishes to learn more about negotiation techniques and experiment with different styles. I found out much more about my negotiation tendencies than I thought I would and I have been applying the skills from this class to actual negotiations outside of class. The simulations are so interesting too! Definite recommendation right there!",
    "SUPER AWESOME. Your 'homework' is to do readings and prepare for in class 'simulations' which are EXTREMELY interesting and insightful (and teach you a lot about yourself). Plus the material is cool ... be willing to speak up though!",
    "I might recommend it. Definitely as a fifth class.",
    "An interesting class that is never dull. The simulated negotiations keep it fresh but sometimes they are a bit too unrealistic. Professor Kinon has clearly spent a lot of time studying the subject.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it. Kinon is an see some teacher and I learned more interesting and practical knowledge in this class than I have in any other.",
    "I think these course simulations were valuable, but overall, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure how much I really gained from the course. The recap discussions are interesting, as you get to hear how others approached negotiations, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure that I am a better negotiator leaving the class than I was before. If you've studied any negotiation theory, I wouldn't recommend it, but for people with a casual interest, it's worthwhile."
