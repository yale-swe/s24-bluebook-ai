    "I learned more about what types of projects faculty in this department are working on. It was helpful to discuss professional skills necessary for pursuing American Studies, and to discuss methods for learning or approaching research.",
    "I learned valuable skills and insights from this course. The design of the course was a great opportunity for first years to get to know faculty in our department and those who do research in American Scholars. The greatest benefits of the course were the diverse group of readings from faculty with different research interests and methods.",
    "Expanded knowledge of field of American Studies, research methodologies, and writing practices."

   "comments": [
    "I would have appreciated a more basic history of the contours of the field as well as a discussion of some of the theories\/ideas that are foundational to the field. Though sometimes alluded to, I'd also appreciate a more explicit discussion of the debates going on within the field. That said, I definitely benefited from having a more informal course to get my feet wet this first semester.",
    "The strengths of the class are the the opportunity students got to interview faculty and engaging with their work, and being able to discuss their projects in a seminar setting. There was no weakness of the course. In my opinion.",
    "This class served as an excellent Intro to American Studies. I appreciated hearing from scholars in the field and reading texts that were meaningful to them. I also really appreciated reading works in progress and found that to be a real privilege."
