   "comments": [
    "I would say that this class is great if you're not a science major, but don't be fooled: this is not a class that you can just blow off. Missing lecture is hell because the slides are not the most detailed. Also, the grades are broken up pretty evenly between tests (20% each) and a paper. Be prepared to study a lot, but not produce much work besides the paper.",
    "It's like high school biology. I'd recommend this only if you need a science credit.",
    "I'd suggest it to a non-science major that really wants to know a bit more about biology and to talk about contemporary issues.",
    "Good class to take if you are fairly good at science and want an easy science credit or 5th class. The drawbacks are a lot of class time and required section.",
    "It is a good class. I would recomend it as a good intro science class for a non-science major.",
    "GUT",
    "Great for getting an easy science credit. The three midterms are non-cumulative and the material is straight-forward and interesting.",
    "It's a good Science credit, and fairly interesting",
    "It covers many of the topics covered in the regular bio class and many issues important to policy-making.",
    "Take it if you are looking for a science credit. It's not that bad.",
    "Yes, good science credit for a non-science and a science-happy person alike, veeeeerrrry interesting subject material, quite literally enjoyable - I kid you not, but don't think it comes effortlessly - you'll have to put in the work, as with all other classes. It's not overwhelming though, so let not that keep you from taking it!",
    "I would recommend the class, if only because its not a bad way to fulfill a science requirement. If you can find a better, more interesting class, take it. A boring class isn't the end of the world, except it sure can feel like it the day before the exam when you haven't even cracked the book.",
    "great class. it really informs you on important issues you need to know about. i definitely would recommend it.",
    "I really wouldn't take this class especially if you don't have a background in Biology already. I'm sure you can find other, more interesting science classes to fulfill this requirement that take up less time. There really is a lot of time spent in class (three lectures and a section). However, the material is interesting and if you have a background in Biology it won't be too hard.",
    "It was an okay course. It's not too bad if you need to fulfill a science credit, but I don't know if I'd take it again if I could go back and do things over.",
    "As random and unorganized as the material can seem at times, I still learned a lot of useful information, and I'm glad I took the course.",
    "UGH! Its great because you are graded on nothing but the tests and final paper, but it is MIND NUMBINGLY BORING. All you do is cram hard before the test and lose all your learned knowledge by the next week. It was not awful for a science credit, just a pain to figure out which classes where actually necessary to attend... because a majority were pointless and the pointless ones were PAINFUL!",
    "I would recommend this class to non-science majors who need a science credit. It is not difficult but it is not easy either. You have to study for tests but you can get a good grade even if you studied the night before the test. You just have to be able to memorize facts very well. At the end of the day you learn a lot and can have an intelligent conversation about DNA and all the modern advancements in science and technology.",
    "I think this is a great class for a non-science major student who wants to get a general feel for science while also covering a distributional credit."
