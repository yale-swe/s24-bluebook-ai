   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Current topics used Weaknesses: More interaction needed from speakers; perhaps no computers\/ipads as they are distracting",
    "broad scope of what global health encompasses. great speakers, but just not as interested in the topic",
    "strengths: some speakers were AMAZING weaknesses: some speakers were awful, hindering on the edge of irrelevant\/rude (\"save africa\" when talking about 1 particular country)\/did not understand their audience (ex: teachers with non profit started by elementary school students)",
    "The speakers after the first one were virtually all dull and uninvolved with their lectures.",
    "This is very intresting course, which gives an opportunity to get an overall understanding of the current global health issues",
    "Great course, with great speakers. I learned a ton, and was always very interested in the presentations.",
    "Very little focus was on areas of the world apart from Africa. Nearly every speaker was doing work in Africa. I can't remember a single one focused in South America, Southeast Asia, or the Middle East.",
    "Quite interesting But I lost my interest on this subject",
    "Wonderful intro to Global Health.",
    "I think we need more dynamic speakers. I am not sure that a class structured this way is effective, especially as a requirement for the Global Health Concentration.",
    "The lectures are interesting, and there are great opportunities to make professional connections with people in global health and development.",
    "Good",
    "I think the course could be improved by starting the seminar on time each week.",
    "Diversity in topics and speakers. Sometimes, the speaker is more lively and interesting than others, but other than that they have been informative all around.",
    "I thought the course was great and most of the guest lecturers were excellent. I don't think the seminar necessarily has to be so long; it could probably be cut down to an hour and a half. Overall, it was well organized from week to week. I also appreciate the variation in food selection for dinner - please keep this up! We enjoy having dinners other than pizza every Monday night. The Indian food was my favorite.",
    "Some of the speakers were fantastic, while I wondered why others had been chosen. The student introductions to speakers could have been improved. Background information provided was helpful.",
    "Many interesting talks. If you don't want people sitting in the back row just rope them off, this need not be a continued issue.",
    "I recommend that you tell them to keep their presentation to 45 minutes & 15 minutes for questions. Many of them are really interesting but when they speak and speak and speak, they kind of lose much of the audience. At least for me, I like them less by the end of it. Deborah Birx was amazing and so was the woman who went to Yale College & then Harvard Business school-- don't remember her name. The only one that was really bad was the Kids for World Health presentation.",
    "strengths: wide range of topics; weaknesses: dinner afterwards could be a bit more intentional to discussions about the topic",
    "Great diversity of talks, more or less specific.",
    "I really enjoyed the diversity of topics and the amazing speakers. The working group did a great job. I definitely feel that I have a better understanding not only of the individual lecture topics but also of global health as a field.",
    "Some of the lectures were very interesting. However, the quality of the speakers seemed to vary dramatically. Also, the class length seemed to vary quite a bit as well.",
    "The seminar was a very interesting lecture series. It included a wide range of speakers and was an engaging introduction to global health. I was shocked, however, at the amount of waste generated by the dinners following each seminar. As future medical and public health professionals, our actions should reflect our concern for health, which cannot be separated from environmental stewardship. For example, providing bottled water when students can easily bring their own water bottles or drink from the water fountain a few steps outside the room is ridiculous and wasteful. In the same way, students should be required (or at the very least, strongly encouraged) to bring their own eating utensils. Small changes such as this not only reflect our responsibility as global citizens but also require very little effort on the part of the individual. I hope that in the future, a more responsible approach is taken to offering post-seminar dinners.",
    "Useful for getting familiar the trend in public health.",
    "Seems like it was heavily focused on infectious disease in Africa. Really disappointing in terms of overlap of lectures and not a lot of variation in topics.",
    "Some of the speakers were very interesting! I think it would be better if students were kindly reminded not to use laptops or ipads or cellphones during presentations unless they are using them for taking notes. It may also be beneficial if the guest speaker was given special treatment and taken up to get food first (and then always asked to sit with interested students in the same room). It might give students a better opportunity to speak with and meet students (as it is somewhat intimidating to go up by yourself after the session). It might so be worthwhile to consider inviting multiple people for the same night to do a panel session discussing a certain question or topic.",
    "The course is very interesting because of the diverse topics that are presented. Most of the presenters were very engaging and passionate about their research. The food has also significantly improved over the semester.",
    "The variety of lecturers was great but the structure is a bit tedious. I don't know how to best remedy it, but no one paid attention, it wasn't very engaging, and it seemed as though everyone was just focused on getting dinner afterward.",
    "I found this course to be particularly weak. It is very challenging to hold together a class that has different speakers every week, and to make sure the information being shared is relevant. I did not feel this class did a good job of doing this. Each week I felt the topic could be interesting but the speakers were often dull and not engaging - going over the minute details of their research or project and not giving us context or information that would be applicable or useful for the majority of people in the room. I think it would be valuable to evaluate What is the goal of the class, and who is the audience. If it is for MPH and other students who are interested in global health issues what is this course giving them that is useful. An overview of different global health issues, or regions. I think it if were structured in a more logical way it would be easier to see, or feel, the utility of the class. In preparation it would be good for someone to really know the speakers work and coach them on what to speak about so that there is some flow over the semester.",
    "Overall, I thought this was a useful overview and seminar course on topics related to global public health. I thought it was interesting to hear from individuals working in the field and overall the seminar ran smoothly. Hopefully there will be more ways to encourage student involvement through smaller discussion groups or simplified \"projects\" for the course.",
    "This course provided a great foundation in global health. The speakers addressed a variety of global health issues and provided in depth information about topics. The infectious disease portion of the seminar was a bit dense, but overall the course was great and I would attend these seminars even if I was not in the global health seminar.",
    "I wasn't very impressed with this seminar. The lecturers frequently didn't seem to know who their audience was and didn't prepare lectures that I found relevant to my studies. I wondered why some lecturers were chosen at all (Kids for World Health).",
    "My overall assessment to this course is very good.",
    "Interesting- great speakers",
    "Most of the seminars were very interesting and informative, but some of them did not seem fitting for an audience of graduate students. In particular, the seminar about 8th graders starting a health program seemed more appropriate for parents of middle school students than a group of health professional students.",
    "I thought it was a good array of speakers. I liked the organization of the course by topic as well. I would recommend making sure there is enough food (which became less of an issue later in the semester), and I would also suggest Chipotle as a vendor for dinner.",
    "Very good. Would like to have to listen to more lectures from diverse speakers.",
    "Lovely course.",
    "This course is essentially a good lecture series from professionals involved in public health. It is interesting but because global health is so interdisciplinary there are bound to be some speakers that you connect with more than others.",
    "On average, good selection of speakers that were able to lecture about various topics in global health. I do think that more interactive speakers could have been selected.",
    "Most of the speakers were pretty interesting and it was great to get a chance to have dinner with them afterward. I only wish more of the speakers had dinner with us (I think some left early or got held up). They had some issues with running out of food, but the situation was greatly improved by the end of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "yes i would recommend because it is a way to figure out the different ways you can incorporate global health",
    "fun required course; worth attending",
    "Yes, i'd recommend this course as it provides a great overview of the current issues in the field as well as gives an opportunity to listen to so many great speakers.",
    "Excellent learning experience, and perfect introduction to global health",
    "This course requires you to attend seminars with speakers, and dinner is provided. Work requirement is minimal, and the topics can be engaging. I would recommend the course.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures every monday night, plus the food.",
    "A good intro to some aspects of global health, especially if you are interested in pursuing the global health concentration. There were definitely at least a couple of talks that really inspired me. If you are pro-active and find something you are really interested in, it's easy to go up and talk to speakers during dinner and make connections that could lead to mentorship or even an internship in the future.",
    "This course will supplement your knowledge on global health. Good way to gain a broader view and look into careers.",
    "only if they're trying to get the global health concentration. otherwise, there's so much in global health and a lot of opportunities to explore that while at this school, so id encourage them to prioritize one's that align with their specific interests",
    "A diversity of seminars on global health, giving us a sense of what can be done, as public health professionals in the developing world.",
    "This course will allow you to hear a variety of lectures on topics related to global health. Generally, I think the idea for this course is a good one, but I would only recommend it if they can do a better job of vetting the potential speakers first, as some presenters were sub-par.",
    "Pretty good. Recommended to all the student in Public Health to take this.",
    "Large lecture series with an array of speakers and food to follow!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great opportunity to learn about the different research that is happening both at Yale and in other institutions. The course is a great place to learn about how global public health can be approached from many different disciplines.",
    "Unless you NEED to get a Global Health Certificate, it really only makes sense to go to lectures that sound interesting to you.",
    "I would not recommend it but it is required for the global health concentration. I would tell them that it is disjointed and a few of the speakers are very interesting but most for poor public speakers, and talk about things that are not really interesting to someone who is not studying that area specifically. But thats not good for a large seminar",
    "Overall, I would say this has been an interesting series of seminars and a useful way to be exposed to global public health efforts. I recommend it for those interested.",
    "Essentially provided case studies in global health with experts in various fields. I would highly recommend.",
    "This seminar consists of a variety of lecturers to provide an overview of various areas of global health.",
    "The course helped me learn from different distinguished speakers who had a lot of experience on current global health challenges including neglected diseases. I would recommend this course for fellow students. There is no better way to have firm knowledge about the current global health challenges than this course.",
    "Great topics and it's an easy class to just show up and learn!",
    "An interesting speaker series on global health topics.",
    "If one is interested in public health, this course is must-take course to gain vivid image of what it means\/ takes to work with problems of PH and find a good role model.",
    "Great way to learn more about global health in a non-pressurized setting.",
    "A speaker series from global health professionals.",
    "It's an interesting talk, a free dinner, and required for the global health concentration. Take it if you're interested."
