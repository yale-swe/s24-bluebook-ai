    "I would recommend this course to my friends, because it will teach them a scholarly approach to their work and lay a foundation for their future research. It will also enrich their understanding of material culture and its place in various religions and cultures.",
    "This is a great course, from which you can learn various methods of investigating material culture in religious studies. But I think one should first have some basic knowledge about Asian Religions before taking this class.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who was particularly interested in study the power of material culture.",
    "Material Culture in Asian Religions is more specifically about the way that religious images are constructed, written about and used. This dynamic is extremely rich, often highly complicated, and sheds a great deal of light on human practices of simply being in the world. I would recommend it very highly for all the reasons stated thus far."

   "comments": [
    "In this course, I opened yet another dimension of my field, that is the role of objects and their connection to ritual in Asian religions. I also worked on a research paper that helped me develop the skills I will need for my future research.",
    "I am going to do a dissertation on the relations and interactions between Chinese literature and religions. I will also use a lotof material culture in my future studies. This course is extremely helpful for me to broaden my perspective and deepen my understanding in the religious studies.",
    "I now fill more familiar with ways to approach and study material culture.",
    "This course taught me how to critically look at and inquire into religious material culture, it taught me research methods, and it taught me how to engage with others in these ventures. Given the vital importance of material objects and attitudes toward the material in religion, I would say that it was an invaluable element in the course of my research."
