    "I'd recommend it to students who want a bio seminar that doesn't have too much week-to-week work, but as long as they understand that the final assignment is pretty time consuming.",
    "Yes, good for any med student to know. This is an important skill that helps you think about science in a whole new way. A great skill to have. Also I loved learning about my specific signaling pathway. I have applied it to all works of my life, such as my own personal research.",
    "Absolutely. Take it. Professor Crews provides invaluable insight as to where science has been and where it is going. He will also teach you how to distinguish between a good paper and a bad paper. Writing the final mock grant proposal takes quite a bit of time, but the end result is so satisfying. Definitely my favorite class taken at Yale.",
    "The course is challenging. Reading science papers every week is pretty difficult but you get better every week and you really learn a lot and well know how to judge a paper critically. The grant proposal I had to write at the end of the semester was probably the most difficult assignment in my entire career at Yale and the most rewarding. If you have room in your schedule, take the course--it's one of kind.",
    "This is the best course I've ever taken at Yale! Take it! Take it! Take it!",
    "Overall, a great course. Not too much work- only two written papers, and then research papers to discuss every week. Crews is great. I feel like I learned more from this class, and discussing the merits and shortcomings of classes with other students, than I did from sitting in the cell bio lecture course. I'd definitely recommend it."
