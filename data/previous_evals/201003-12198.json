   "comments": [
    "This is a general knowledge course in Financial Accounting, covering the four basic financial statements and their application to real-world company analysis. This is a good course for any student, as its content can also apply to personal finances.",
    "Take this if you want to learn about accounting. Learned quite a bit but the material often seemed dull.",
    "If you're looking for an easy class with some real world applicability then you might want to take this class. Lectures are pretty boring because the lecture slides used come directly from the text book, but this means that you can easily do well if you just read the text. As you would expect it's a pretty dry class, but it makes a good credit\/d class for senior year.",
    "Recommend because the material is very useful. The class is probably the most practical\/applicable to real life you can take at Yale. However, reading the book suffices for learning most of the material on your own. Doing a homework assignment before each class on material that hasn't been taught yet can also be timeconsuming. I took it Cr\/D\/F but ended up wishing I had taken it for a grade.",
    "Only if you need it for i-banking",
    "I would recommend it only if you want a career in PE (private equity) I banking, or equities. if you want to do fixed income then no.",
    "Accounting 170 provides a good intro to basic accounting. The topic is boring, the professor is nice though even though the lectures are dull. Most people don't come to class and the book was very good. Overall, its good to know these things, even if the class is not the most exciting.",
    "Take it if you can, just know that the material itself can be dull at times, but the instructor is very good",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Great background that every student should know before heading out into the real world.",
    "Yes. The course is basic fundamental information that you'll need to know for a career in anything in the business field.",
    "It is a good overview of basic accounting.",
    "Take it if you want to teach yourself accounting, or if you want to BS your way up the corporate ladder in banking interviews by knowing what \"profit margin\" or \"cash flow\" means.Final exam was IMPOSSIBLE, and UNFAIR.",
    "Yes. Good practical financial knowledge and understanding of how companies work.",
    "May be the only practical course taught at Yale. Important for all graduating students.",
    "The course is exclusively based on the textbook materials, but it's very straightforward and a good foundation for financial accounting",
    "It's a great introduction into the world of Finance, which is certainly useful if students have an interest in business or finance. It gives you a great foundation for understanding and evaluating companies and the markets.",
    "If you want a basic understanding of accounting take this course. It doesn't really go in depth beyond the accounting basics, but if you're interested in finance, this course will give you some bearings when it comes to financial statements.",
    "You can get everything that you get from this class by reading an accounting textbook, but, if you aren't willing to do that on your own, I guess this class will force you to do so.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that has career aspirations of going into business or finance. This is the only course I have taken at Yale that is applicable to real-life.",
    "Yes. This is a must-take course if you're interested in finance.",
    "its a good knowledge base to have especially if you're a senior and going out into the real world. i think all seniors should take it no matter what their major. the course is easy and everything is straightforward (tests\/final are all open book). only about half the class shows up to lecture, but i liked going because it forced me to constantly review the material.",
    "I highly recommend this class for anyone interested in finance. It's a pretty easy class (easy grading), and a ton of people take it credit\/D. The tests are incredibly reasonable.",
    "I would recommend ACCT 170 if you have no knowledge of accounting and would like to learn the basics. I had no previous finance or accounting experience, and I found the course doable. There are problem sets due every class (twice a week), which can get a little tedious, but it's just that, 2 open book exams and the final. Things I thought were helpful were the concepts of assets, liabilities, and shareholders equity, bonds, present values, amortization, and financial analysis equations. Somethings I could care less about were the different ways to declare inventory, leases, and deferred taxes.Take it credit\/d.",
    "A summary of financial accounting.",
    "You should take this course if you are interested in finance. It is also just good stuff to know in general. The material is pretty straightforward and not super interesting. A lot of people don't go to the lectures. The homework is manageable and regular.",
    "This is a good class for seniors to take. It covers material that is useful to know, especially if you are planning on doing something finance-related after graduation.",
    "Very useful material, everyone should take a basic accounting class whether or not they're intending on going into finance. With that said, you can get everything you need from a basic accounting book instead of taking this class, but like everyone else I took this because I know I wouldn't have devoted time to reading an accounting book otherwise. Also, take it Credit\/D. this class doesn't count toward anything and the final is actually kind of challenging.",
    "good intro accounting class. take if youre interested in material. can follow along easily if you keep up with the book",
    "Take this course if you want to learn something from Yale and get a finance job.",
    "Practical knowledge for the real world (probably the only class that falls under this category at Yale) but I think that there are far more awesome Yale classes out there you should take. Don't worry about \"looking good for a job\" or getting ahead for the real world. Enjoy every minute of Yale and take crazy fun classes.",
    "Despite what anyone says about learning investment banking on the job, which is undeniably true, take this course if investment banking is even remotely on your radar. It will be the most pragmatic class you take at Yale towards performing successfully in an investment banking internship.",
    "If you've never done investment banking and want to learn basic accounting, take this course. If you have, you won't learn much.",
    "It's really a course where you could learn all the material by reading an accounting textbook. There's no section, but because of this, the review held by the TFs isn't very helpful. If you need an easy credit, I would take this class, but it isn't an easy class. You actually have to do the readings and the HWs. If you do, you can pull a solid grade, but if you don't you're more at risk for a C or getting a D for Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Many students come into this class thinking that it will be useful for finding a job, or something along those lines. To be honest, parts of the course were a little helpful in consulting interviews, but overall, I feel that the class was not for me. If I had the chance to do it again, I would NOT have taken this class. I never went to class, took it Cr\/D after I got my job and kind of resented having it on my transcript. However, if you are looking for a Cr\/D class, this is a FANTASTIC Cr\/D class; easy problem sets and open-book exams.",
    "The professor is sweet and really cares about the class but the lectures just weren't that interesting or necessary to attend. The book was straight forward enough so I feel like I learned a decent amount.",
    "The class is a good overview of accounting that I would recommend for anyone interested in business.",
    "Yes. Pretty straight-forward. Past classes have complained about having to do problem sets before he taught the material. This year, it wasn't a problem because he used a new textbook which was really simple. However, I don't think he liked the textbook and may switch back to the old one for future classes. Tests were open book.",
    "Teaches basic accounting skills and is not too much work. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes. Important to know concepts whether or not you do finance.MANDATORY COURSEYou will be better off after taking this course",
    "It's not a particularly fun or riveting class, but it's a solid intro to accounting. You end up learning most of the stuff from the textbook, and the tests are open book. Useful for anyone going into finance or business, but not necessarily anything you can't learn on your own without the class.",
    "If you are planning to go into the financial sector, this course should definitely be a priority.",
    "How to read the basics of a financial statement (balance sheet, income statement, cash flows, shareholders' equity). The information is valuable and certainly applicable if reviewing a company's financial performance is in your future, but motivated students might save time by reading the textbook alone. The class is mostly textbook-based and lecture can be a drag as it's just reviewing the chapter. The professor practices accounting and is both very friendly and approachable. Short homeworks due at the start of each class, tests are open-textbook."
