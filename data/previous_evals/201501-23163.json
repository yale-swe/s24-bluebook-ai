    "No I wouldn't recommend this class. This class is not representative of Yale or any of the engineering majors it is under, except for maybe environmental. This class is too focused on how fossil fuels are necessary rather than helping us find alternative fuels. Do not take it.",
    "This is a difficult class that I would recommend only if the student had a strong science background and was willing to be frustrated in order to learn a lot about energy.",
    "The topic is interesting, but try to find another class that offers similar material. If you are looking for an introductory-level course, try to find another professor as well."
