    "Take it. Much better than L3, actually offers a wealth of vocabulary and grammar, and solidifies your oral use of the language. The novel and films also help with language acquisition. Rosamaria, with her attentive and professional nature, will also help you hone your Spanish skills and maximize your potential.",
    "I would recommend Professor Leon.",
    "A great course with lots of different windows into the hispanic world, lots of different ways of learning, I would definitely recommend it",
    "As with most Spanish courses, if you need to get it out of the way then you should take it. It's certainly more difficult than L3 due to the extra presentations and more strictly graded compositions. However, while Sra. Leon could sometimes seem hard, she is fun and understanding for the most part. You can't really go wrong with any of the L4 teachers. It's really the students that make the class.",
    "I would say that Spanish 140 is definitely an enjoyable class and any student who takes the class would improve tremendously in the language. It is definitely useful for people who want to be fluent in Spanish or plan on studying in or traveling to Spanish-speaking countries. Students in the class also learn a little about culture, such as music and dance in some Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "I would recommend this course only for those who wish to improve their speaking skills or need to fulfill a language requirement."
