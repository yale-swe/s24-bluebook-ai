   "comments": [
    "I got a better grasp of musical dictation and I learned a significant more about chord recognition and analysis than I did in my AP music theory class. It has definitely made me a better musician.",
    "I've learned hugely important technical details this term: tweaks in embouchure, implementation of nasality, consistency of vibrato, breath support, and the mindset--it has all made improvements of my voice that have been noticeable within the course of a single term.",
    "Piano playing!",
    "I took clarinet lessons for credit. Through this class, I re-developed my embouchure and learned techniques for better tone production and more consistency (to that end, techniques involving both voicing and reeds).",
    "How to be a better musician.",
    "I took so much away from this semester of lessons: although I have lots of progress and learning still to go, I feel much more comfortable about my foundation of technique than I did at the beginning of the semester. One result of that was that, when it came to learning new repertoire, I felt much better equipped to study the pieces thoroughly and perform them without having to close my eyes and hope for the best. Overall, I felt like this semester of lessons was very important to supplementing musicality, what I consider my strength in music making.",
    "Further developed cello playing, performance, and musicality skills.",
    "I learned to sing a whole lot better than I thought I was even capable of.",
    "It is amazing to finally have saxophone lessons available at Yale!!! Carrie Koffman is such an incredible teacher and so knowledgeable about everything saxophone. This course helped focus in on areas of weakness in my playing that need to be worked on, and was a great first exposure to classical saxophone. It would be great to have a more conservatory-like experience, with a final jury and perhaps some performances to complement a serious study of the instrument. It is really exciting to have something like this available!",
    "Breath support techniques, expanded repertoire to include German and Italian, developed greater presence and comfort throughout voice."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the consistency of the course; every week we would do dictation and analysis, which was very helpful. However, I didn't feel like I improved my sight reading all that much from the course.",
    "The schedule for this class was very flexible, and the one-on-one format was very useful in getting feedback on my playing. I found that the teacher with whom I was paired for lessons was very compatible with my style of playing and learning. If there was one thing I could improve about this class: I wish there were opportunities to perform, perhaps at a solo recital.",
    "Just what I wished for, albeit a little intimidated by the fellow pianists' level.",
    "I have very little criticism about my lessons. They were all very engaging, and I always walked away having learned a lot and having a clear idea of what I was going to work on in the following week. If I were to pinpoint a criticism, I would say that it felt easy to get discouraged or not feel satisfactory, but I think I am just too sensitive! I am excited to keep on working hard throughout the upcoming years, and I will feel more comfortable and confident in my abilities as the years progress!",
    "I enjoyed the one-on-one exposure to my cello professor every week.",
    "The structure of any lesson program such as this leaves a lot to the student to do on his own. This was good for me in that it allowed me to set my pace but also made sure that I didn't let that pace fall too low. However, the pass\/fail grading system didn't give me much incentive to take the lessons as seriously as I took my other classes, and it wasn't until Lucas and I sat down and talked that I really understood how much effort I needed to put in. After this conversation, which took place at about the halfway point in the semester, I made huge strides and caught up to where I needed to be, but it was even more work than I'd anticipated because I'd let myself fall behind. This doesn't necessarily speak to a structural weakness of the course, but rather very much to a personal shortcoming, however, I believe that this lack of focus on my part could've been aided by more stringent and defined deadlines.",
    "This course was a great way to gain invaluable knowledge from Professor Koffman. She is really fantastic and is an incredibly patient, wise, knowledgeable, and encouraging teacher. Would not trade studying with her for anything! It would be great, as mentioned previously, to add a skills proficiency component to the lessons-- perhaps a final jury or some performances could help ensure the proper acquisition of skills learned in class and add an aspect to the lessons that goes beyond the lessons themselves and personal instrumental practice. Also, as fantastic as Professor Koffman is, it would be great to be able to study Jazz saxophone as well, perhaps with Professor Escoffery, who teaches MUS 559 at the School of Music. Finally, one difficult issue to deal with was the context of the lessons-- Yale is not a music conservatory, but it is difficult for students to give the instrument all the time it needs (often just to complete assignments in time) in the context of a full academic course load. This is not necessarily a problem with the course, but more a reality that serious study of music confronts in the context of an academic institution."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this class because you will become a better musician. Even if you have taken extensive musicianship in the past, I would recommend taking this class because it is throrough and actually really fun.",
    "All singers should learn how to connect with their voices via philosophies and training of coaches like Janna. Singing is great, but being connected to your voice in these challenging ways is pure joy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I love Prof. Parisot, she is absolutely incredible and weekly lessons with her is something that I always look forward to. She really cares about her students, and makes sure that you are making progress.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is serious about improving at their instrument. The grad student instructors are all very high caliber, and improvement is rapid.",
    "Likewise effort would yield likewise rewards.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend lessons for credit to another student. The rigor feels really good; Yale is so fortunate to have excellent musical resources, and I was so pleased to feel like I could challenge myself to a very high degree with my musical involvement at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would. Professor Akahoshi is a thoughtful person and nurturing teacher.",
    "Always take lessons and see what you get out of them. If you think, though, that just meeting with a teacher once in a blue moon is going to be your magical key to good vocal technique, you won't get much out of it. Practice outside the lesson room is as much, if not more, a part of the responsibility.",
    "Lessons for credit are a must-do if you're serious about performening music, and Professor Koffman is just about the best person to study saxophone with. She is tremendously knowledgeable, incredibly patient, is very flexible yet effective in her approach, and will make you consider aspects of the saxophone that you have not considered before. She is truly amazing!"
