    "After taking this course, I can say three things: 1. I would hands-down take this course again if I could 2. I absolutely would recommend this course to you in a heartbeat 3. I feel as though I could talk to anyone or any audience with a high degree of authority about Edgar Allen Poe and his legacy. I grew up reading Poe's short stories, but now I have such a deep appreciation for his entire collection of tales, poems, and essays. Professor Grimstad is phenomenal, too. Take this course!!!",
    "Take this class. Professor Grimstad is the best professor. He is encouraging, passionate, and extremely knowledgable about Poe, French, cinema, and many other interesting subjects\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of which he can relate to Poe, a breath-taking author and slashing critic that you will want to know more and more about each class.This is my favorite non-creative writing English class that I have had at Yale.",
    "Yes. Here are your two worries, probably: 1) single author courses suck. That's generally true, but Poe put out such a diversity of material that it's almost like reading multiple authors across the course (though his style is remarkably uniform). 2) Poe won't be that interesting. WRONG AGAIN. His stories are so suspenseful, his essays so provocative and intelligent, his prose so delicious, that you've just got to take this thing.",
    "Yes, especially if you're a writer. This class will teach you how to appreciate one of the founders of all of American and French literature. Poe is super important, very fun, and probably influenced most of the authors you read today. Never gets boring.",
    "Yes, take it. If you have an even mild interest in Poe (he pioneered the detective story, which is pretty cool in and of itself) than you'll enjoy the class. And Grimstad is a fantastic professor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 very engaging and interesting.",
    "Grimstad's class on Poe provides a fascinating, in-depth look at an often disregarded American author. Grimstad is exceptionally knowledgeable about all things Poe, and you will be too after taking this class. Work consists almost entirely of reading Poe's poems, short stories, and one novel, as well as a variety of critical essays, and writing the final long paper. Class discussions tend to meander through a surprisingly wide variety of subjects, ranging from analysis of Poe's lyrical prose to his obsession with codes and connections with modern-day computing to his extensive influence on everyone including Nabokov, Baudelaire, and Conan Doyle. If you are ambivalent towards Poe's writing or strongly dislike tangential conversations, this isn't the class for you. However, if you like Poe, Grimstad is really an excellent, brilliant, and very approachable professor who will lead you in a tremendously interesting experience - the two-hour-long classes will fly by!",
    "An opportunity to explore the evolution of one artist's work, tracking stylistic and thematic elements by reading an interesting selection of his work--the popular stories along with lesser-known essays and tales. The chance to do this is rare, but invaluable for anyone looking to better appreciate a writer's work and craft.",
    "Poe is a great class if (1) you already like Poe, or believe you might come to appreciate Poe, and (2) you are an avid speaker in class. Poe's style gets repetitive after some time, something even Grimstad, for all his love of Poe, will admit to. Grimstad is very excited, articulate, and knowledgeable about Poe and Poe's work, but he is apt to take over most conversations in class. Grimstad is also aptto fall for the trap of rollicking off into another conversation, entirely not about Poe, and only vaguely related. This is great for the DS students who understand all the references being thrown around for 45 minutes at a time--less great for the rest of us who, while English majors, have not spent a large amount of time reading theory or even watching little-known movies. You will also have no idea what your grade is until the very end, given the work--one short, in class assignment, one outline, and one draft--are all ungraded. Could either be very easy, or very hard, but you won't know until you get your grade. Ultimately, I would go for something else. I took it, not just because I loved Poe, but for the pre-1900 credit. I think I love Poe less now, and I know there are better ways to get a pre-1900.",
    "Take this or anything with Grimstad, even if you doubt you have an interest in the subject matter. At least shop something to see if the class appeals to you. I have a feeling you'll know right away.",
    "Take this course! Poe is a great writer, and Grimstad is a great teacher of Poe. If you haven't read much Poe before and want to get a better sense of the breadth of his writing -- which really is wide-ranging -- then absolutely take it."
