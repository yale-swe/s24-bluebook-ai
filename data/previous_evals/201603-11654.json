    "Slightly more structured assignments for each week with hem being tailored towards the type of data or research questions each student is asking.",
    "I liked the semi-regular meetings with the other majors, as I was nice to rant about problems to people who might have gone through similar things.",
    "While a great sign of the department's growth, I think there was much to gain from the smaller iterations of the major.",
    "I think that the research design document is a useful exercise for people who are starting to bring their thesis together. I wonder if there might be a better way to give students who are further on their thesis an opportunity to make the documents more useful and use more time to put in hard hours in data analysis and collection. I liked peer work and feedback from the TFs. I'm not sure if the texts at the beginning helped that much but I assume that it's a requirement for the course. Overall, I was glad that sessions were structured in such a way that it didn't feel like we were in class just to be in class.",
    "Great course, helpful and enthusiastic TFs and professor, makes the intensive thesis digestible and builds a great community of soc majors."

    "If you're reading the reviews you're likely a SOCY major thinking about whether or not you want to write a thesis, so my advice is DO IT. Yes, it's a lot of work but it's worth it. Plus, hanging with Prof. Papachristos every week is fun and he's great to work with."
