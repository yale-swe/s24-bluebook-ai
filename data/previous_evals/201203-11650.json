    "I would wholeheartedly recommend Chinese 150. Wang and Li Laoshi are both wonderful teachers. Their teaching styles are different, which I enjoyed immensely. I learnt a lot more in Chinese 150 than I expected, especially after Princeton in Beijing. The textbook is excellent, although you must take some responsibility for distilling the slightly more challenging synonyms. Don't expect to learn as much as when you were in China (if you were a Light Fellow), but do expect an excellent learning environment, a much broader vocabulary, and a course whose workload is extremely reasonable considering it's 1.5 credits. Highly recommended if you are continuing Chinese.",
    "If you're just coming back from a summer in China under the Light Fellowship, you will inevitably find this class underwhelming. I don't mean to say the class was bad or not conducive to improving my Chinese, because it helped my reading comprehension and allowed me to discuss topics of greater depth. However, there's only so much to do in 50 minutes every day, and you clearly won't be speaking as much Chinese as you did over the summer. That being said, my Chinese would have declinedeven more had I not taken the class. I still recommend continuing with CHNS150.",
    "Yes. This question isn't too applicable with languages, as it basically just depends on how far you want to go with the language. If you're on the fence though, I'd say do it. It's work-intensive, but not too challenging to get good grades if you can devote the time. More importantly, you will learn a lot.",
    "I took this class after coming back from summer study in Beijing. This course was a fair amount of work, and since I'd just come from an intensive language study program, I felt as if my speaking abilities gotworse as the semester progressed, which I found a little frustrating. But taking the course definitely slowed the rate at which I forgot things from the summer, and the texts that we did were all pretty interesting, which made it worth it. I would recommend it if you're interested in the language.",
    "Take it even after the summer program. It's slower and I am not sure how much it helps improve your skills but can't really compare with china since in chian you learned mandarin everyday. It's more work than L1 and L2 obviously but easier after the summer program. Still have to put in a lot of work!",
    "We learnt two chapters in a week, a total of around 130 new vocabs, this was manageable. But when it came to finals and you had to remember all the vocals you had learnt in the semester it was very hard to recall everything.",
    "If you enter Chinese 150 after doing a summer program in China, it is slightly frustrating. You will learn in the class, but just because you're spending so much less time speaking Chinese, you might notice your speaking becoming less fluid. The class teaches new vocab and grammar and was pretty effective at reinforcing the things I learned over the summer, but some of it always slips through the cracks. As frustrating as it can feel to have your language skills erode, they will erode much more quickly and drastically if you don't take the class. It's a consistent workload, but a relatively small one.",
    "You will not fully realize the benefits of CHNS 150 until after you have taken the class and then reflected on how much you have learned. Especially after you come from Light Fellowship, because you will slowly lose your fluency (naturally, after being immersed back into an entirely English-speaking country) and make you feel as though you are wasting your time, but you are not! Over the winter break after the class was over, I started watching Chinese TV and was surprised at how useful the words we learned in class were, even though it seemed totally pointless to learn about Chinese rock and roll at the time. The main focus of the lessons are not to be interesting (but they are somewhat), but to teach you practical Chinese. They succeed at doing that. You just have to keep up and take each class with a grain of salt."
