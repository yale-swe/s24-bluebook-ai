    "French 140 is a great way to improve your French skills, while also reading interesting and relevant stories. Take this class!",
    "I enjoyed it. We read a lot of stories and watched some films. It really helped me improve my French skills. Make sure to do the reading on time, as if you fall behind, it's very hard to catch up. The class moves quickly to cover all the material. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who enjoys french.",
    "French 140 is a challenging course. The material is nothing entirely new, however you do go at a fast clip, and there is absolutely no English spoken. I do recommend this course, it will broaden your French skills and confidence."
