   "comments": [
    "Yes, If you're \"into\" psychology, understand math, and are up for an intellectual challenge... take this class. Even though you're not ultimately responsible for all the material, through an exam or related. You really are responsible for it because in order to write literature surveys and do the required presentation, you have to understand the material very well. That being said, it is not a pressure cooker environment, so you don't have to stress if you don't get some of the very fine, complicated details. In my opinion, It's the best way to fulfill the senior requirement",
    "Recommended if you're looking for a lower workload, higher calibre economics seminar or if you're simply interested in the topic enough to want to study it in the future (grad school, etc). Prof. Rozen moves through the material quickly but is very approachable and receptive to questions. She also makes concepts easy to understand in layman's terms if you direct the conversation that way.",
    "I would take this course again in a heartbeat. Professor Rozen is amazing and the material (although difficult) is really interesting and applicable.",
    "Interesting class with a mild. Definitely worth it if you are willing to take a 9:25.",
    "During the course of the semester you review a lot of economic papers. There are 2 writings assignments and an in class presentation on a paper. I enjoyed the class and would recommend it.",
    "Bounded Rationality is an interesting look into the limits of classical economic assumptions about rationality. The course covers areas related to information processing, memory, and behavioral economics. For a field based on mathematical modeling, the course was not particularly difficult from a mathematical perspective as understanding the general concepts behind the model was more important than figuring out the mathematics of the model. The professor knows the material well and was quite helpful in class, although she gave an impression of aloofness in meetings outside of the class.I would recommend taking this class if you are looking for an esay economics seminar and are interested in the intersection of psychology and economics. It was seminar with a low work load, but I feel like I came away learning a good amount.",
    "Some interesting material, not a lot of work for a seminar.",
    "You learn about bounded rationality concepts from the perspective of a mathematical modeling. It is really cool, but it is not a psychology course.The requirements are relatively light: weekly reading (that is not graded and which you don't need to speak about, but is incredibly interesting), two papers, and a presentation.",
    "The subject didn't turn out to be as interesting as I thought. Very theoretical and many complicated models. That said, requirements were easily manageable.",
    "Depends on what you want out of an economics seminar--I thought it was a good introduction to what theoretical economic research looks like and a good balance to understanding empirical analysis, e.g., what's read in ECON 132.TONS of microeconomic frameworks and theoretical papers, which were challenging (although I don't think many people kept up with the reading after the first few weeks). Prof. Rozen is very good at explaining them, and she's sweet, although she can seem aloof\/too busy at office hours. Mildly helpful to brush up on mathematical notation used in set theory. The course is essentially a capped lecture. Also, not much guidance on assignments\/portions of your grade: presentation of a paper, lit survey, referee report. The lit survey on a topic of your choice was a nice excuse to look at interesting models.",
    "Very easy, no tests or homeworks so you don't have to learn the material if you don't want to. Bounded rationality is not as interesting as it sounds, it's not applicable to anything but more of a fun intellectual thought experiment, but a chill class and nice professor.",
    "I would recommend it because the material is interesting, but I would caution people because the organization is really bizarre (only a few assignments and very little feedback)."
