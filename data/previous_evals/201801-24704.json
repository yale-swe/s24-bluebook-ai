   "comments": [
    "The course provided an overview of the literature and scholarship on the modernity of 19th-century Paris. Students worked with a range of theoretical, historical, and literary texts, thereby gaining insight into techniques of literary analysis and cultural history.",
    "I gained a great deal of knowledge of the literature and culture of 19th-century France. Most importantly for me, however, I gained a range of critical theoretical tools from cultural and literary studies that have already begun to reshape how I think about modernity.",
    "I felt that there was a real accumulation of material. We were connecting themes at the end of the course that we covered at the beginning, and continually bringing back concepts previously discussed. I liked the way we broke down the critical articles into their ideological and conceptual premises, and thought there was a real link between the literary and critical sources. This was my big take away."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course's emphasis on the relationship of modernity to history, and to modes of historical representation in particular, was especially well-developed and insightful. I felt the course should have afforded more space to France's colonial projects in this period, and the way modernity has been theorized by scholars such as Paul Gilroy and Homi Bhabha. Arguably, any discussion of modernity in 19th-century France is haunted by these \"other\" sites of modernity, which are also sites of \"otherness.\"",
    "Virtually no weaknesses! The class is structured so well, and the readings so rich.",
    "The course is ideal as both an entre into 19th century French literature for doctoral students in the field and a theoretical exercise. It had a clear sense of development and a continuity of theoretical and historical questions brought to the various materials we engaged."

    "Yes-- the course is an important and useful introduction to 19th-century literature, and the realist novel in particular.",
    "Yes! I learned so much. The syllabus was well thought out, and the secondary readings complemented the main texts really well. Prof. Samuels is a wonderful teacher!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in 19th-century France or theories of modernity writ large, with the caveat that its challenge is immense both in terms of the workload, but, perhaps more dauntingly, in terms of the questions it raises.",
    "Yes."
