    "In this class you will learn how to think clearly and deeply about your field. As someone who would never have voluntarily taken this class I would highly, highly recommend it. You've squandered your coursework if you don't take this class with Professor Khawaja.",
    "See response to Question 1. Yes, I would recommend the course and also Khawaja as an instructor.",
    "I would recommend this course, as much for the opportunity to work with colleagues from other subfields as for the material of the course itself.",
    "I have already spoken to this a bit in my answer to the first question, but I would summarize this course, again, as being an introduction to the discourse surrounding the academic study of religion and as a kind of crash course in finding one's place in that conversation. I would certainly recommend the course to any religious studies student, as I found myself invested in having a common conversation with my colleagues across subfields that I did not really know was possible before I took the course.",
    "Yes, without any reservations. Theres probably no better class in the department. Students will come out of it as better, more precise, more interesting thinkers and writers. They will come out of the class with a cohort and a common set of texts for their ongoing conversations in grad school. This is such a good class its the proseminar to take."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me a valuable sense of the different approaches to Religious Studies through the diversity of the readings. More importantly, Professor Khawaja's teaching has helped me to learn what it actually looks like to think critically in a sharp and productive way about our field. In this class, she also modeled for us the way in which different academic fields can speak to one another in a fruitful way. I do not know that there is any direct connection between what I learned in this class and my dissertation and research. This class was bigger than that. It was a class about forming good intellectuals, not a class about cranking out PhDs.",
    "The course gave me a vocabulary for talking about religious studies in ways that felt true to my subfield. I appreciated that the class never called on us to instrumentalize our subfields or the \"theory\" we read, and instead took for granted (I think) that theory is history and vice versa. The ancient subfields can feel pressured to take a kernel from \"theory\" and \"apply\" it to our work, which can make us feel like impostors when we \"do theory.\" This class did not perpetuate that unhelpful dynamic. I left the class knowing that I have lots more to read, but also prepared to take on that challenge.",
    "The course was an opportunity to discuss, debate, and rethink what it is we do in the study of religion. In this way, it will be very helpful for my future teaching and research, even if I do not use much of the material itself in an explicit way.",
    "Yes to the first, as noted above. To the second, I feel that the texts and our discussions surrounding them have certainly had an indirect impact on my thinking regarding the more immediate concerns of my research, but I will have to see which texts continue to stand out as I move forward.",
    "This course gave me a better understanding of the history of conversations around religion as an analytic object, as well as giving me a deeper understanding of the varied ways in which conversations about religion can be staged across sub-discipline and context. It improved my capacity as a thinker and discussant. I am sure that I will carry its lessons, both about written content and methods, into all of the writing and thinking that I do from here on out."
