   "comments": [
    "English majors should take it for a pre-1800 if they have to, but I wouldn't recommend it. There is a lot of work and reading for very little insight into the individual poetry and Renaissance lyric poetry as a whole.",
    "A class like this will appeal to you if Renaissance Lyric Poetry really and truly is your thing. Professor Manley is competent, but if you're not enthusiastic about the material already he may not be able to get you fired up about it.",
    "If you need a pre-1800: this is the best way to go about it, because it's a seminar unlike Milton or Shakespeare and let's face it, why would you want to be an English major and take lectures?Generally: if you are willing to have a few boring sessions in return for a few very, very good and thought-provoking ones, and if you want to study with a professor who can be absent-minded at times but really, really knows his stuff.",
    "Renaissance Lyric consists of a wide variety of poetry; the work on the syllabus is not consistently fascinating, but at its best (Shakespeare) the readings are amazing. The level of animation in class discussions is, of course, contingent on the participants, and though my class tended to be quieter than I would have liked, we learned an awful lot from Prof. Manley himself.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it for lovers of poetry. It's an intensive progression through history of English poetry that goes deeper than major English poets. I'd especially recommend it if you like English 125.",
    "While I was enrolled in it, I found this class fairly frustrating; however, looking back at my semester, I'm very grateful to have taken it. Professor Manley is absolutely wonderful, and the material, while sometimes a pain to deal with in the moment, is rich and beautiful and very much worth engaging with. All of the work is completely reasonable, though it's easy to neglect the reading since class discussions often focus very intensely on only one or two poems (if you're like me, reading for this class will be the first thing to go when you start getting busy ... which is pretty unfortunate!) As is often the problem with seminars, the discussion is primarily student-led and so sometimes pretty unrewarding. I recommend anyone who takes it spend plenty of time in Professor Manley's office hours; he's lovely to talk to and very relaxed, and I know I would have gotten a lot more out of the class if I'd taken better advantage of those opportunities.",
    "Strengths: great introduction to Renaissance poets with a professor who is passionate and very knowledgeable about the material; well-run seminar; exposure to some less-known poets of the period who are amazing (ex. Amelia Lanyer). One small weakness: occasionally, during student presentations, Prof. Manley would cut a student off. Overall, though, a great junior seminar. I would recommend the seminar.",
    "A good class--don't be shy about asking to talk about a particular poem. Professor Manley is incredibly knowledgable, but still manages to take his students seriously. He always wants to hear what you think."
