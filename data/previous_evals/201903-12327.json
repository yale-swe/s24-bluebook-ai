    "This course helped me develop my skills writing long papers and better understanding history as a subject, and the long and fascinating story of the European discovery of the East.",
    "I learned about how medieval historical themes have developed into many of the world systems present today. At first I didnt think the class would be very applicable to more modern history but I was surprised. I also learned how to interpret medieval texts, maps, and travel accounts to write about them.",
    "This course, and Professor Freedman, pushed me to frame my historical lens in the Medieval Era. I this course is very beneficial in that it resets one's traditional thinking and encourages the students to break out of the biases of looking back on historical events with the mindset of a 21st century history major."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Freedman is an amazingly engaging professor and has a wonderfully deep knowledge about this area. Although the class was a lot of work, it was extremely enriching and fun.",
    "I thought Professor Freedman was the major strength of this course. He provided an endless supply of knowledge and always had answers and more thought-provoking questions to our own questions. There was strong feedback on papers and lots of opportunities to meet in office hours. Maybe the only weakness was that we didnt have the chance to hear how other peoples papers finally turned out.",
    "The course is very well adapted for giving students the ability to analyze historical events with the least amount of bias as possible. The material encourages critical thinking about the reasons for medieval European events. It also successfully breaks down the European mindset from 1000-1500 and European encounters with Asia. A weakness of the course is that it predominately looks at Eurasian encounters through the European lens; this led me at least to be a little dissatisfied with an incomplete picture of the time period."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It's a very interesting course with a great professor",
    "Yes! If you like writing and find this topic fascinating.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. Im not an expert in medieval history but if youre at all interested in a medieval history class it is a great idea to take it with Freedman. He also does a great job tying it to the present, something I wasnt expecting since some of the readings feel a little remote.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this seminar to all students. The material is very interesting, the coursework is manageable, Professor Freedman is a wonderful teacher, and the course significantly improves one's writing and research skills, while allowing one the freedom to explore topics of interest through an open-ended research paper.",
    "Yes, 100%."
