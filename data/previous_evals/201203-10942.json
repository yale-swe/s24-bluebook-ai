    "History of thought concerning the Gothic and the Middle Ages, focusing late 18th century and onwards. Even apart from the visual interest inherent in Medieval revivals, the intellectual arguments and historiography are very compelling. Would recommend.",
    "While conceived as a geographical survey of medieval revivalisms, the course took on other aspects, becoming an extended discussion of the origins of art history as a disciple. I would encourage all students interested in exploring the role of the Gothic in 19th-century intellectual history to enroll."
