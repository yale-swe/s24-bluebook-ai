    "I learned how to think critically about sculptureparticularly about installation art, but also a bit about performance art. I learned how to pitch installations to galleries or collaborators. I learned the importance of allowing a work to become its own work and how to think about why artists make art."

    "Strengths are that it is small and loose structured so everyone can work on their own thing. would be better if it was later in the day.",
    "Strengths was the small class size and the critical readings Aki provided. Aki and Peyton provided amazing support for the class. No real weaknesses.",
    "Class was small, allowing students, professor and TA to bond and talk openly about their work and about the ambiguities of art-making. Class could have been improved by beginning with a focus on planning and foresight methods involved in conceptual art making and sculpture."

    "YES. It will absolutely change the way you approach art-making. Aki is especially inspiringher critiques are honest and always brilliant. She will force you to confront your work for what it really is and not what you wish it was. Her critical eye and thinking process always amazed me. There are so few courses like this at Yale - TAKE BST!"
