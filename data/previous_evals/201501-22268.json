    "You learn about a lot of cool diseases and, more importantly, the impact they had on history, culture, and society! This is an AWESOME class - one of the best I've taken at Yale. Highly recommend!",
    "This course is amazing. It runs through the major epidemics throughout Western history without losing sight of their unique points and their specific impact. Does an amazing job of integrating them and putting them in the context of modern public health. Really encouraged me, as a premed, to think from the perspective of and to appreciate historical figures, rather than dismissing them in favor of modern science. The reading response due dates weren't clear, and I might have missed one because of this but that's totally fine. Professor Snowden added the rough draft for essays as an optional assignment to increase our reading response portfolio. Honestly, this points to Professor Snowden's teaching style - incredibly well-spoken and intelligent, but also very very approachable, humble, and completely invested in helping students. I was in his section, so he'd do this each and every week there as well. I also really really admire the way that he took the time to meet with each and every student a few weeks before the end of the term to talk with us about our specific concerns and anxieties for the final exam and paper. Now I know you want to hear about this so here goes: there's mandatory section with reading responses, a take-home midterm, a final paper, and an in-class final. All of these are not difficult if you stay on top of lecture notes and understand the readings.",
    "Epidemics is a good course for someone who is truly interested in historical epidemics. I can understand how the information could be interesting but it was not something I enjoyed so it did not make the class enjoyable to me. Be prepared for a lot of reading.",
    "interesting material, manageable workload",
    "Does exactly what the syllabus says--solid and interesting overview of the impact of epidemic disease on the West. Great material if you're interested in the subject and the history of medicine, and I think there's enough history for anyone interested vaguely in the topic to get a lot out of it. Reading responses were a pain not because they were a lot of work but because of the constant pressure of reading an entire book for the week. But since you can write a good response by only using the parts that are relevant to your point, the work overall was not too challenging.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class. It is definitely a challenge in terms of workload, but the material itself would be interesting and approachable for students in any discipline.",
    "Would recommend for another student. Fair amount of work but finished with an in depth knowledge of disease and its political, social and economic implications throughout history. Very interesting and worth while class",
    "Yes. Take it it's great.",
    "HIST 234 is a great class. The topic is really fascinating and not difficult to understand. The workload is manageable, with weekly readings and reading responses most weeks, a take-home midterm, one 5-7 page paper, and a final. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The topics were very interesting. Just beware that there is a lot of reading.",
    "Epidemics was a really good class. It covered major epidemic diseases like plague, smallpox, cholera, AIDS, etc, and discussed how these were influenced by medical theories of the day, how people reacted to the outbreaks, and so on. The workload was manageable, 1 book per week with a reading response, and a final essay. I took the class to fulfill the humanities requirement and it ended up being one of my favorite classes of the semester. Definitely recommend if you want a reasonable and interesting Hu credit, or if you're interested in the subject in general.",
    "Interesting course that covers a number of epidemic diseases--with an emphasis on the historical impact of the disease. Be prepared: reading is pretty extensive and there are weekly reading responses (short essays).",
    "Interesting subject matter. Snowden is a pretty engaging lecturer. Weekly reading responses, midterm, final, and 5-7 page paper.",
    "HSHM 235 is a great class that covers the history of epidemics in the west from 1600 on. It covers a lot of material and the readings are really interesting. I definitely recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in the subject. It was great!!",
    "Take this course while you still can!! It's extremely interesting and has a great professor in Snowden. He is a legend. Workload is interesting and not too much.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially for people who are interested in medical history.",
    "There is a ton of reading and the assignments are not always super clear. That being said, the content of the class was extremely interesting for anyone who wants to learn about the history of disease and the history of medicine in general.",
    "Epidemics is a very good class overall, for history and non history majors. It's not too much work, and the class is set up to make the few assignments very manageable. Prof Snowden is a great lecturer and I found going to lectures very informative. This class hits the sweet spot of not too difficult but still interesting.",
    "Usually I am not a fan of history classes and am more oriented towards STEM classes. However I found this class to be very interesting and a great way to get myself a humanities credit. Snowden is a wonderful lecturer on this topic. There is a lot of reading, but its totally manageable if you stay on top of it.",
    "Definitely take this course regardless of your major!",
    "HSHM 235 is a course that explores the social, cultural, and political impact of epidemic disease in societies since 1600 (starting with the bubonic plague\/ending with polio). The lessons are applicable to other aspects of life, and professor Snowden is an expert in the field.",
    "i would recommend this class to people even if they are not initially interested in the subject. I am not a history or hshm major but this class was so interesting and not too much work except for the reading.",
    "HSHM 235 was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Learning about all of the past epidemics was really interesting and gave me a whole new perspective on history. Professor Snowden was an amazing professor and really tried to connect with his students. It was truly one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken.",
    "Take this if you have any interest in epidemics and diseases. Snowden is a great lecturer, and it's not too difficult to do well.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "A really interesting course! I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "I would recommend history 234 to another student, and summarize it as the effect of diseases as a driver of history in the modern era.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is a really interesting look on history of epidemics both for a science major and a history person. Plus professor Snowden is a really great lecturer and an impressive person.",
    "I found the class very interesting. I gained a lot of perspective as well because there are very relevant links between historical and modern health crises. The work is fairly standard. I know a lot of people shy away from classes with reading responses, but they were genuinely helpful. Most of the books were worth the read (or skim).",
    "I thought it was a great course if you are in need of an HSHM requirement and if you have never taken an HSHM class before. The class was very well-organized and you are guaranteed to learn a lot. Sometimes the lectures are a little dry, but they are 50 minutes each with a 50 minute section every week which really isn't bad. Also Snowden is one of so kind and brilliant, so it is awesome having the opportunity to get to know him better.",
    "I recommend because it's very interesting, not a huge amount of work, and Professor Snowden is great. There's a pile of reading, but if you're adept at skimming it's no big deal.",
    "I would recommend this course as it was interesting to learn about epidemics and public health.",
    "HSHM 235 is an excellent class and I would recommend it to everyone. It is an interesting look into the epidemics that have effected everywhere around the world throughout history. This class is extremely interesting and well-taught. Definitely take this class especially if you are looking into the HSHM major!",
    "Interesting class, moderately dry lecturer, overall take.",
    "This class is awesomeit's like going down a wikipedia black hole of diseases, which is fascinating in a kind of creepy but fantastic way. It's all social history but an interesting backdrop if you know anything about the history of the different time periods. It can sometimes feel a little repetitive or dry, particularly on the days where you talk about schools of medicine and scientific thought. Most of it, however, is fascinating, especially discussions of various diseases and their socio-cultural impact. It's an easy, interesting class with an enjoyable professor. And you can always watched the recorded lectures online if you miss class.",
    "Great class, especially if you're interested in the HSHM major! The reading responses were on the longer side (500 words instead of the usual 200), but the workload overall is very manageable and the readings are pretty interesting. The lectures are also all online which is helpful if you've missed some."
