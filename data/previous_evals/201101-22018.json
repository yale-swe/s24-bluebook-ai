    "A great class. Tons of work...be prepared to put in a long hours in the lab and outside of class writing the reports...but totally worth it. You will learn a lot and Professor Lamoreaux is great. The experiments are awesome -- much more interesting than the ones you do in prior physics labs.",
    "physics classes I had taken:PHYS 200\/201PHYS 205\/206PHYS 410i took this class concurrently with PHYS 440. In retrospect I kind of wish that I had taken 440,441,420 before taking this class because there were a couple of experiments where background knowledge in quantum or stat mech would have definitely helped. But I am grateful nonetheless that I was thrown in on the deep end because now approaching the material in class after having seen the actual experiment really helps with theoretical framework.This class is very different from 205\/206 because over the course of the entire semester you do only 3 labs. These 3 labs are much cooler and much more sophisticated than the labs you do in 206 however. Make sure you have a good friend\/choose a good lab partner starting from day 1 because you are stuck with that person for the entire semester. The labs we did were:Bell's inequalitySuperconducting Josephson JunctionsOptical TweezersWhich were all amazing experiments. We also dabbled a little with ising Model and compton scattering, which were not as fun- I would definitely recommend doing the other 3 if possible.All in all, definitely take the class. You have to anyways if you're physics intensive. And if you do take the class, make sure you sign up for the most interesting, sophisticated experiments because those are the ones worth doing. Don't do an experiment simply because its easy *cough*ComptonScattering*cough*, you'll get a lot more out of the class if you attempt the advanced experiments.ah, one last thign: make sure you do your long report and presentation early in the semester ie don't leave it to reading week. big mistake.hope this all helps! good luck.",
    "PHYS 382 is a very good lab course. Students complete three labs over the course of the semester and in great detail. The work is not challenging, but it can become quite time-consuming, since the class meets for three hours twice a week and the write-ups can take some time. This course simulates the lab experience of graduate students much better than any other lab I have taken, and the skills applied here are much more applicable and transferable. Professor Lamoreaux is great- he is helpful, nice, and pretty relaxed with deadlines. The course is pretty laid-back overall, but you can really learn a lot from it. I would recommend this to any intensive physics major, but if you don't need to takethis course, there isn't much of a point in taking it.",
    "Physics 382L is a great laboratory class. The experiments are interesting, and you have plenty of time to do them correctly. You will also begin to learn to write scientifically.",
    "Yes! Such a relief after 205 and 206, both of which I dreaded. 382 gives you time to perform 3 in depth labs that are very relevant to modern physics. Great great great course!"
