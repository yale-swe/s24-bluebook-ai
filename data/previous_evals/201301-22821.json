    "Only take this if you really want to understand Chinese economic\/financial terms. None of the information really sinks in though.",
    "Definitely take it if you wish to learn about business, economics, and finance in a Chinese language setting from an outstanding professor. However, it is a large amount of work and you must be ready to handle it.",
    "It will allow you to maintain whatever Chinese level you had built up to, while expanding your ability to talk about business\/financial\/legal concepts in Chinese.",
    "It's a great course for anyone who plans to work in China or in any job requiring use of mandarin Chinese. The workload could be heavy, however, depending on the student's background and level of proficiency. There was a great disparity in language level among the students, and some had to work extremely hard to keep up.",
    "If you are interested in one day working in China, or keeping up your Chinese, or just getting a better sense of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic system this is a great class to take. The workload is pretty heavy some weeks and lighter others. Zhang laoshi is also wonderful!"
