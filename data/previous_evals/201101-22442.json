    "If you have taken AP Stat, do not take this course. The only new thing you will learn is ANOVA. If this course is not required, do not take this course because the lectures are not engaging, and you will probably find yourself sleeping in. That being said, the workload is extremely easy (only 3 out of 4 quizzes count, homework is not graded for accuracy, homework answers are posted before the due date, etc.) and it is not difficult to earn a good grade. I don't know what the alternative is, but if you can avoid it, do not take this course.",
    "Overall, it's a good intro stats course. If you attend the lecture and\/or read the text book, it's a very easy class too. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs intro stats to fill a requirement, or anyone who just wants to get a basic overview of statistics.",
    "Its an easy QR so take it if you have to. You can learn straight from the powerpoint",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend it over taking a normal math statistics course, especially if you are into math. The class feels like you could have taken it in high school. That being said, it is worth taking.",
    "My overall assessment of this class is a troubling one. On one hand, I'm aware that's it's necessary for all psych majors, which I am not. Therefore, I know that if you have to take this class, you'll take this class. On the other hand, if you take away the requirement of the class, this class has many, many weakness. First of all, the professor is new and highly disorganized. After the first few weeks it became apparent that she was stuck with this class from the department and did not know in which direction it should go. The dates for the assignments always changed, you never knew when there wasa quiz, a problem set, or a lab due. The professor sped through the lectures and spoke just as quickly. The quizzes were the worst. They were not consistent. Sometimes they came from the book, sometimes they came from her lectures, and sometimes both. As a beginner in stats, this was frustrating because I felt like I had to know beyond all the materials in order to properly grasp the concepts. By the end of the semester, she even told us the percentages for each assignments would most likely change, but she wasn't sure how. In the last week of classes, I dropped it. And frankly, this is one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale due to the disorganization.",
    "Broccoli class. Good for you, but not fun",
    "Do yourself a favor, and do not take this class. Only take it if it is absolutely necessary for your major. The class is largely concept-based, and there is actually not that much math involved. In addition, the course is very disorganized, and the lab sections are essentially worthless.",
    "Psych Stats is fine; the class was pretty easy and not very demanding time-wise. I feel like knowing the basics of stats could be quite helpful in the future, so I do recommend this class. Also, it's probably more interesting than some of the other stats classes offered because of the psychology aspect.",
    "The course is great for everyone. You do not need a strong math background to take this course at all, and the workload is small. The exams also reflect the homework incredibly well!",
    "A good QR, but one that you will definitely need to work hard in to do well",
    "Very very very easy. It is not necessary to attend lectures because everything is posted on V2. Weekly labs are pretty boring, but its a great opportunity to get your homework done since you have access to SPSS (the program needed to complete assignments)",
    "Take this class. I mean, if you're a psych major, I guess you have to anyway. But seriously, for a required class, it's great.",
    "Pretty easy QR, as long as you go over the homeworks the night before the tests. Definitely take it if you need a QR or if you're planning on majoring in Psych. Professor Napier is really responsive to concerns and very available for questions. If you take it, be sure you actually go to lab. Some people don't, and lab teaches you exactly how to do the SPSS assignments, which would be impossible to figure out on your own.",
    "You are probably looking at this course because it is a prereq or an easy QR. There is no denying it, it is an easy QR, just be careful you don't underestimate the tests. If neither situation applies to you then I would suggest another course. Do not get me wrong - everyone should take a stats course to understand the world. This course unfortunately did not me that appreciation; hopefully it will improve in the following semesters.",
    "Yes - great introduction to stats.",
    "It's really easy, so you might as well take it, but it isn't good.",
    "I would not. The course gives students a credit if needed, but didn't cover nearly enough material or with enough depth for me to feel confident in my ability to do even elementary statistics.",
    "Basic into to statistics, as applied to psychological experiments\/studies. A required course for psych majors. Pretty easy and a bit disorganized this year since Prof Napier was teaching it for the first time.",
    "A relatively easier class which you will get a lot out of.",
    "IF YOU DO NOT NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS, DON'T. It is the worst taught QR at Yale and will bore you to death. It is sad that this is the only way that psych majors can learn the stats they will need for their careers because after this class I do not feel adequately prepared. Also, the multiple choice on the quizzes are stupid and random and have little to do with real-world applications of statistics.",
    "Pros: super easy QR, no need to attend lecture if you're not into that.Cons: Lectures were bad, homework\/labs were tedious.",
    "definitely not a hard course though you still can learn a lot",
    "Take it if you need to for major or simple QR",
    "Only take this class if you're ready to work your ass off to understand the stats concepts on your own...cos the class is too confusing. The material is pretty interesting but the awful class management and teaching makes this one of my worst experiences at Yale.",
    "This course gives you a solid foundation in statistics, with a focus on the application of statistics in psychology. Pretty easy to follow the slides and learn all the concepts, the homework is very indicative of what's on the tests (multiple choice conceptual questions + calculation questions). If you put in the work and pay attention in lecture, you'll get an A.",
    "Psych Stats was an okay course. The content isn't particularly interesting, but it's useful\/mandatory for the psych major. The worst thing about the course is Jaime Napier's teaching of it. This semester we had a lot of people take the course, which she wasn't prepared for. We had so many changes to the syllabus and to due dates for assignments that I gave up checking things and hoped for the best. It was a really poorly organized class, which made the experience all the more painful. Jaime's explanations of the concepts were also hard to understand and gave emphasis to the easy parts over the more difficult aspects. The final exam also didn't test most of the beginning parts of the course. If Jaime teaches this course again, just read the textbook. It's less confusing",
    "As taught by Napier, this class was extremely poorly organized. This was her first time, so maybe if she does it again in the future some of the organizational things will be fixed. Nobody, not even the TFs, knew what assignments were due when. Furthermore, lectures were completely useless to me - everything I learned, I taught myself by reading the textbook and working through the homework problems. Easy to do well if you are willing to self-teach. Difficult to follow if you depend on Napier to teach you everything.",
    "I LOVED this class. Professor Napier taught lecture as though she was learning the material herself, which was SO helpful in terms of helping you understand the lecture without teaching yourself. Lecture was actually useful in that sense, and studying for the quizzes actually became a review. The problem sets are fun if you read the book, which I thought provided a thorough, direct, and specific explanation of EXACTLY what you needed to do to solve the problems. This class is very practical--you can definitely perform statistical tests and actually know what you're doing at the end of the day. 4 quizzes, SPSS lab assignments, problem sets, and a final. It's really a low-key, relaxing QR course that actually makes you confident about the material.",
    "If you're a psyc major, you need to take this course, and rest assured (unless they change it drastically), it's pretty easy and really helpful for understanding the statistics behind the scientific articles you'll probably be reading in other classes and using in your future research. Prof. Napier's lectures are easy to follow and her slides have all the important details. She does reviews before every quiz and for the final, which are pretty helpful. You also have weekly lab sessions that are not stressful at all and are actually fun and interesting because you get to tinker with SPSS and analyze data and the TAs are all pretty nice and helpful! Overall painless class that I found enjoyable and super crucial for the future.",
    "only if you have to take it.",
    "It's a good, easy QR. If you really want to learn stats, take 103.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class -- if you need a QR, choose another class! It's really disorganized and poorly taught. Worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Really easy class, especially if you've taken AP stats. Material is easy to follow, the professor does review lectures before every quiz, so you only have to go to a few classes (or none. the slides are self-explanatory). Homework is easy and section is boring, but you learn how to use SPSS (if you want. you can get away with not learning it...).I would recommend this class if you want an easy class (especially if you've taken AP stats).",
    "Pretty easy but informative QR\/psych class. learning stat really helps you understand psychological articles much better. Take it if you're a psych major (duh its kinda required) or if you want a manageable QR",
    "Take it if you must but be aware that you'll be teaching yourself a lot of the material.",
    "This is your basic stat course that is very easy and straightforward (and may be useful!). For some reason though, many people here at Yale are ridiculously math phobic, and if that's the case this is not a great QR credit for you to get out of the way. Weekly short psets, 3 SPSS assignments, 4 tests (drop the lowest grade), and one final. Not bad at all.",
    "It's a requirement for the psych major, do what you gotta do but don't expect much. It's a super easy QR",
    "This course is not a gut. It's hard and poorly organized and there's a f***ing ton of work and quizzes. Stupid. Don't take it.",
    "A decent intro to stats. If you have taken the AP in high school it will definitely be a breeze. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend it if you need to take it for the Psych major. I think there are more rigorous stat classes if you're really interested in this stuff.",
    "I took it because it's a requirement for the psych major. It's a very basic introduction to psychological statistics. I learned very basic statistical procedure, and this was helpful in my other classes, as I learned to interpret the statistical data in experiments\/studies. There were four quizzes, the lowest of which was dropped, weekly homework assignments (that were graded on completion), four SPSS assignments (roughly an hour to an hour and a half each) and the final. I had to spend time on the assignments and studying, but the quizzes and assignments were easy. Basically an easy A.",
    "Don't take it unless you need to.",
    "TO PSYCHOLOGY MAJORS WHO HAVE NOT TAKEN MATH SINCE HIGH SCHOOL AND ARE SCARED OF NUMBERS: You will be okay! I was one of you! Stats is manageable! This course is doable! The material is wonderfully straightforward and Professor Napier prepares you extremely well for each quiz. There are four quizzes and you can drop one, so if you are a little shaky on the first one (like I was) don't worry! There is no midterm which is actually a great thing! As long as you study, you can undoubtedly do well in this course. And the material is soooo helpful if you are planning to do an empirical study for your senior thesis, or doing any kind of work in a lab. The SPSS tutorials are also very informative! Also, the problem sets won't consume your life like they do in math and econ!To anyone else, especially people who are used to working with math, you'll be fine. This is a very reasonable course, but I wouldn't call it a gut.",
    "I would recommend this course if you haven't taken Stats yet and would like an introduction to the mathematical aspect of it. The course doesn't really have anything to do with Psychology (except that you will use the methods we learn in class in experiments) so I can see why you would take it as a Psych major but if you're not and you want an interesting class that combines math and psychology, this is not necessarily it. However, the class was fair and the workload was not difficult at all.",
    "Really, this was a great class. It was structured really well so that you never need to worry about cramming. The class is pretty easy too and didn\u0092t require too much work. Even the final only required 2-3 hours of studying the day before to dowell because you prepared everything gradually.The professor is really approachable too. She\u0092s a very clear lecturer and she\u0092s open to suggestions. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Take it if you need it.",
    "I would recommend this course. The coursework isn't demanding, the lectures are easy to follow, the quizzes are simple (once you get the hang of them, they focus on both the conceptual [multiple choice]and analytical aspects of statistics in the social sciences). I learned a lot.",
    "Not too hard if you do the work. It's actually pretty interesting, just make sure you keep going to class.",
    "It's a pre-req. I wouldn't particularly advise taking it otherwise. Sure, it'll fill a QR but there are more interesting QRs (and easier in my experience). Though in saying that, it's not *that* hard and does offer an insight into how analyses are performed and what statistics mean when offered in the news (something I already had a good grasp of).To be blunt, I am a Psych major and had to take it. I wouldn't have otherwise.",
    "Very good overview of essential statistical skills. Workload was light, lectures were very clear. The course was a bit disorganized at first, but a lot of that was logistical issues which Professor Napier handled well. Section was pretty useless.",
    "This course is exactly what it says--an introduction to statistics for psychology. It's not always the easiest class but you'll get out an understanding of basic (psych) statistics that is somewhat interesting or at least helpful, especially psych majors who will be looking at this kind of stuff in their other psych classes. Professor Napier goes out of her way to make the course material accessible to everyone in the class, and did a review session before each quiz, which was really helpful.",
    "This was, hands down, the worst class I have taken during my time at Yale. From the dull delivery of the lectures to the major problems with disorganization, this class was FAR below what I expect from my college education. There was not enough of a connection between the labs and the class (especially when the lab got ahead of the class). Homework due dates kept changing, which was very hard to keep track of. Every single one of my quizzes was improperly graded so that I had to go back, point out the question I got right, and follow up to make sure the points were added back in. The grade breakdown itself was a mystery - I still don't know how much the SPSS assignments were worth compared to the lab participation grade. The professor never got back to me on this question when I asked her via email. The syllabus said no curve, but then the second quiz was curved (and it was also way too long), and the final grade will apparently be curved too? I just don't know.I know some of you have to take this class to fulfill a requirement. I know I did. Honestly, I feel sorry that this class will have to take up a slot when you could otherwise be taking something really great. This class was really awful on every level, and I would avoid it at all costs if you can.",
    "Only if you are genuinely interested in statistics, because it is a very straightforward class.",
    "Covers statistics used in research but does not really focus on psychology. Good section leader is very important to make the class more coherent.",
    "I would recommend this course because it's not too difficult and will help you understand psychological statistics in the future.",
    "This course was unorganized. I had to teach myself most of the material and although the lectures were informative, the subject was dull so I would skip most of them and just learn it later on my own. It is a relatively easy course but it is not worth it because it is incredibly boring. We all got our answers for the homework before it was due so TAs were pretty useless by that point because they would not check for accuracy but for completion (which can just mean copying everything from the answer key online). I feel like I did not learn much by the end of this course--- I was able to teach myself almost everything in one weekend for the final and most of it was just plug and chug math (you are given a formula sheet). If you are going to become a psych major, it will be practical to take this course because you learn how to use SPSS and use all the tests for your experiments. If you just want a stat course or QR credit, this is not for you.",
    "Psych 200 was a pretty easy class. The math itself is laughably easy (multiplication and division, literally), and the formulas are all given to you on every quiz and test. The hard part is learning the material that is not quantitative. But even that wasn't too hard. Just reading the book helped. Other calculations are mostly repetitive. Lectures were often boring, but not that bad. Quizzes were not hard, homework is graded on a effort scale, and You need psych 200 for the psychology major, and it also fulfilled my premed math requirement, so overall, not too bad of a deal.",
    "Pretty easy class. Read over the lecture notes, do the practice quizzes, study a bit, do the homework and SPSS assignments and you'll be fine. Section was alright, nothing serious and assignments there don't count, but it's good for learning SPSS.",
    "do not take this course if it is taught by jayme naipler",
    "this is a really fair class in that you can sit yourself down, read the textbook, do homework problems, and review lectures notes and by the end, you can be assured that you will have learnt enough to do well on the exams.",
    "No, not with Jaime Napier. She was awful.",
    "If you're thinking about being a psych major or really doing any human subjects research at some point, you should take this course. It's also not that difficult.",
    "Depending on what you want in a stats class, you may want to look elsewhere. This class was fairly easy to coast through, though the quizzes often separated those who had done their homework from those who had copied the answer keys.However, if you're looking for a solid, in-depth knowledge of stats, you may consider a general stats class.",
    "Psyc 200 is a very easy introduction to the world of statistics. Professor Napier presents the material in organized, easy-to-follow lectures. The workload is not very demanding. There are weekly homework assignments that are graded pretty much on whether you do them or not, a few SPSS computer assignments that are not very difficult, and four quizzes (with the lowest being dropped). The quizzes are very straightforward (never any tricks), and there's usually more than enough time to complete them (I'm always one of the last people to leave any test). This is one of the easiest courses I have ever taken at Yale (if not the easiest), but I still feel like I gained a lot from it.",
    "Psych majors have to take this class, but if you don't have to take this class, then don't. Napier was really disorganized this semester (though it was her first semester teaching) and it was really hard to anticipate what was going to happen in class. The material wasn't really difficult (I hadn't taken stat before taking this class) but my TA wasn't especially helpful, and Napier wasn't either. Her powerpoints are really helpful though. Not much of a point in going to class, since you can learn more and efficiently by just reading the book and looking at the powerpoints.",
    "It's fine for a QR",
    "This is a great introductory course, and Professor Napier makes sure that you understand the concepts completely. Her slides are amazing, and she's really clear and effective when teaching.",
    "The course is a good overview of the relevant types of statistical analysis to Research Psychology. The concepts show the basis for the kinds of values commonly seen in Psych studies (ex: \"Two-way ANOVA F(2,43)=2.34, p.05\"). The course is good in terms of its scope, but admittedly somewhat densely computational in its subject matter.",
    "This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale, and not in just the \"I don't like math and did badly\" kind of way. The class itself was truly horrible. Professor Napier should not be allowed to teach. It was incompetently run - labs weren't assigned until week 5, the final had between three and five mistakes on it that had to be corrected during the exam, there wasn't a single answer key that didn't have errors in it, the TA's were awful, labs were a waste of time, we weren't allowed to take our quizzes home\/learn from our mistakes before the next test because the professor is too lazy to make new exams every year, and I learned absolutely nothing. This was a pathetic excuse of a QR and Yale should be embarrassed to include it in its course selection. Do not take this class.",
    "Worst class I've ever taken at Yale, hands down. Professor Napier is a complete disaster, as are the TAs that we had this semester.The class got off to a rocky start, and the going only got worse as the semester progressed. I don't think Napier was\/is ready to be teaching a class that is both required for a Yale College major and typically has an enrollment of around 200 students (no matter how much she denies that the department knew that it would be as large as it was this spring). When Theresa Treat taught this course, people enjoyed it. I can say with certainty that while Napier is teaching it, I will never be able to recommend it to anyone I care about. It was a complete nightmare, and the only reason I survived it was because I had a stellar peer tutor.On the bright side, there was zero need to attend lecture this semester because she not only reads the content of her PowerPoint slides, but she also posts them online and includes a pretty complete transcript on information that isn't directly on the slides in the notes section of thedocuments.",
    "The material in this class is definitely important to know, but this class was pretty mediocre. Under half of the class showed up to lecture since the slides and notes on the slides were posted, meaning you actually gained nothing by coming to lecture. Also, homework assignments' answer keys were posted before they were due, so everyone just copied their homework from the key. (Homework would've been annoying and tedious if this wasn't the case.) If you just want to be able to apply statistics, this course will get the job done. If you want to understand what you're doing, look elsewhere.",
    "It's an easy and useful class. Not a difficult QR, and it's useful to have a basic understanding of statistics.",
    "Take it because you have to. This class was a waste of time, and if you read the book, you'll never have to go lecture. Ugh.",
    "Take it if you have to. I'm premed, so took, it to finish my math requuirement. It was pretty easy, straightforward, relaxed math course. Not painful at all like the calc courses.",
    "This is a course where you'll learn useful knowledge, but will not necessarily retain it or be that excited to come to lecture (which is boring). You have biweekly problem sets, four tests during the semester, four SPSS (electronic statistics program) assignments, and a final. I would take it for a requirement or if you love statistics.",
    "sort of a mess this year, but i imagine will be more clear in the future. not a bad qr overall and i did learn statistics.",
    "It's an extremely easy class.",
    "It's like a normal stats class with data taken from hypothetical (or actual) psych experiments. Other than learning APA format for presenting results, there's not much reference to how stats ties in with psych.",
    "She's not a good lecturer but all the lectures, homework, and homework ansers are posted online. The work is pretty tedious.",
    "Good class. You will learn a lot! Frequent problem sets and quizzes force you to keep up with the material and prepare for the final exam. Only downside are the SPSS lab sections - TA's do not teach enough and there is insufficient preparation for the SPSS assignments.",
    "No. Do not take this class.",
    "This was the first time Napier taught the course and there were a lot of issues that came up, but eventually the course became more structured. It'll probably be better next year. She posts the slides online, and has review lectures before every quiz, which include everything that will possibly be on the quiz. There were four quizzes which weren't too bad and you could drop your lowest score. Weekly homework assignment's were basically pass\/fail and section assignments were essentially what we did in section with data. I would recommend psych stats to another student as a painless QR and especially relevant to psych majors.",
    "This is a required course for Psych majors, so many of you shopping it will have to take it. It's a bit boring, but it's a manageable QR credit.",
    "I do",
    "Yes. good statistics class that shows how its all applicable for psych students.",
    "yes. gives basic understanding of statistical techniques, even for someone who is not a psych\/stat major.",
    "This is an incredibly easy class that will teach you just enough statistics to get through most scientific research papers out there. If you want an in-depth study of statistics and probability, you probably should take the stats in the math department, but if you just need to understand what your PI did in his or her research analysis, this is the course for you.",
    "This class was not very well organized but it was Professor Napier's first time teaching it so I think it will definitely get better in future years. The lectures aren't very interesting but the reviews before quizzes are very helpful in pointing out what you need to focus on and the quizzes \/ final aren't very difficult. Ultimately I think statistics is an important subject to learn and though I didn't love this class I did learn statistics so I would recommend it, though not enthusiastically.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. It's a great introduction to statistics, and ties the concepts with psychological research\/studies, which makes it a bit more interesting. Stats can be a boring subject to learn, but seeing the realistic applications makes it pretty fun to learn. There aren't any difficult concepts, nor is there any hard math, so it's a pretty easy class too.",
    "Psych 200 is a basic intro to stats using examples from Psychology",
    "ok, why not?",
    "Psyc 200 is a good background for science or psyc majors who seek sufficient statistical knowledge to evaluate an experiment. The class is what you make of it; very few people go to class, and homework is pretty much optional (graded for completeness, and you only have do 75% to get full credit). If you're going to take the class, I would recommend going and doing the homework though, because it is not as easy as it seems.",
    "This is easily far and away the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. I will touch on a few reasons: For one, the class was poorly managed from the very beginning. Prof. Napier did a poor job of organizing sections and her most egregious error was having an examination in the first few weeks of class even before people were able to attend their first section or ask questions on the material AND after the class before our exam was cancelled due to her absence. Her gross mismanagement of the basic logistics of her course trickled into her teaching as well. She made many mistakes in her slides as well as in the homework assignments she provided, which was beautifully accentuated by the several mistakes made on the final examination. To me, these errors are a result of oversights that should ring as unacceptable for an educator in her position. Finally, the TAs were nothing short of unhelpful in section. It wasn't until I scheduled an independent meeting with my TA that I received any real help on the material. The SPSS assignments which provided the TAs with their primary raison d'etre were easily the most pointless part of the cousre--they were busy work designed to further frustrate an already frustrated course cohort.If Prof. Napier teaches this class again, I suggest you shop it to see if she's rectified the mistakes from this year. If you have to take it, then I'm sorry. If you don't have to take it (like me before the course), there is absolutely NO reason to do so. I shot myself in the foot and deserve whatever fallout I receive as a result, but I would never EVER recommend someone take this course unless they have to. Take an easy Calculus course to fulfill the nonsensical imposition on your academic career that is the QR distributional requirement.",
    "This class is a requirement for the psych major and a good class for someone who isn't that mathematically inclined. Professor Napier is very clear and teaches the course well. I don't think it's that interesting, so I wouldn't take it for fun, but if you do your work and attend lecture and section, getting an A is probable. It is a lot more work now, however, than it has been in the past.",
    "This has potential but as it is currently taught it is a bit of a waste of time.",
    "A fairly easy introductory course in statistics. It's supposedly Psychology-focused but that seemed to only mean that the examples and questions were drawn from psychological studies. The workload is light and the material isn't hard, and the class is not stressful at all. It's not the most interesting class either, but it's required for Psych majors and the things you learn are definitely useful and necessary to know for the field.",
    "This is a good introductory class; definitely take it if you don't have a background in statistics, are a social science major, and are looking for an easy but useful QR. I would advise you to stay on top of the class and not leave everything for the last minute (like me) because its actually really interesting and less tedious when you follow along in class.",
    "I would recommend it only if you intend to do research in psychology.",
    "Unless the class format is changed, I would say don't take this class. It's not hard (there's very little work) but can be very, very frustrating. I've never had a class that I missed regularly in my time at Yale--until this one. Professor Napier might improve with some more experience under her belt.",
    "Worst class at Yale I have taken so far, especially considering that it is a required course for the Psych major",
    "Not a hard class, not particularly interesting, but if you have to take it that's that.",
    "It is a basic introduction to the application of statistics to psychology. As such, it doesn't really include an understanding of how the math works, but more teaching you how to know when to use which equations. I think it is worthwhile (well, and mandatory) for psych majors. I also think having some sort of stats is good just because you hear statistics all around you and it is nice to know what they're talking about. That said, it is not at all the most thrilling or engaging class in the world. Plus, it is pretty easy to learn the material straight from the slides (all posted online) without referencing the lecture.",
    "If taken with a different professor, take it for a pretty easy QR. Do not take with professor Napier.",
    "Psych 200 gives students a solid basis for statistical analysis, with a focus on the tests etc used in psychology. The structure of the course (4 quizzes, effort graded homework, SPSS problem sets, and a final) ensured that students keep up with the material, and spread the grading over several assignments\/tests.However, one could notice that the course was taught for the first time (e.g. miscommunication between TFs and professor, many changes in syllabus), which hopefully will improve the next time around.",
    "Do not take this class if you can avoid it.",
    "Take it if you need to for psych majoring and it is good to know this stuff for general analysis of statistics in media and life but also for research projects. I never went to class though because the prof just reads off the slides...She is really nice and cares about making the class better.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to, unless you've taken statistics before and want an easy Qr credit, or stats for med school. If you've never taken stats, you'll have to work much harder than half of the class, who will already know everything and never show up to class. It doesn't help that the lectures never seemed to teach much - I got more out of just staying home and going over the slides myself than I ever did from going to lecture. Ifyou've taken statistics, it'll be an easy class, but boring and you'll learn little to nothing.Also, be choosy about TAs. Make sure yours understands statistics, because most of them didn't. If they don't, switch sections.",
    "Only really if you have to take it for psych. It's not bad, and a pretty easy QR, but not very exciting.",
    "It is a good introduction to statistics. Not hard.",
    "It's a QR with very little actual work, but it's really easy to skip class and not do the work."
