    "Socy 542 is a challenging and engaging theory course. I would recommend this course to anyone who wanted to understand the major players of sociological theory and Dr. Erikson works very hard to make sure that each students understands the content of the course.",

    "An overview of classical works of sociological theory, including its foundations and development. I would recommend the course to other students.",

    "This course will absolutely help me with my research and dissertation, as I was unsure of what theoretical framework was appropriate to my research interests before taking this class.",
    "This course certainly helped me to deepen my knowledge about sociological theory and how to critically engage with theory. I learned about theories that I hadn't really considered applying to my research, as well as gained more knowledge about theories I was already interested in. In particular, the final assignment was useful in helping me to think about the theoretical assumptions of my research interests.",
    "Provided a much better understanding of the field and its foundational thinkers and contributors. In turn, provided the necessary tools and background to continue engagement with the field.",
    "- Gave a broad overview of major theories, general theoretical preparation for field exam - General theoretical preparation for the dissertation"
