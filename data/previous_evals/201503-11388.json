   "comments": [
    "It's a good and sort of easy elective. It's not really \"Advanced\" Orgo, it's more like Physical Organic Chemistry. The material is sometimes dry, but there are some interesting topics here and there. The main reason I took this class is Professor Jorgensen, he is a giant in the field of theoretical chemistry and it's really nice to be able to learn from him. Not the best lecturer for sure, largely because he seems bored and unenthusiastic about the class, but he gets the job done and also has a nice sense of humor and a lot of anecdotes to tell. The exams are generally made of sort of random questions drawn from the topics studied, but I would say they're pretty easy. Little work, only 4 psets which can be done in 2 hours and some readings from the textbook.",
    "CHEM 418 is a good choice for an elective. While lectures may be dull at times, this class helps you develop a more intuitive understanding of chemical principles. Much of the course is focused on the physical side of organic chemistry, although there is some time devoted to pericyclic reactions at the end of the course (and you'll hear about various reactions relevant to what you're learning about throughout the course). As an undergrad who has had a science courseload on the heavier side, this class was a great elective with a very manageable workload. Despite the lighter workload, I still felt like I was able to learn more about organic chemistry without memorizing a million things.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in organic chemistry. The material is fascinating, though it's not exactly what you might think when you hear \"advanced organic.\" You don't really do much synthesis, if any, and most of the time is spent learning about physical trends. A more accurate name would be Physical Organic Chemistry. But Jorgensen is brilliant, and often quite funny, and seems to truly want his students to do well. There is only 1 midterm and a few problem sets on top of a final, which is kind of frightening, because the final ends up being worth something between 50-60% of your grade, but I wouldn't worry too much about that. Take this course if it interests you! It's minimal work, and it's interesting! Also buy the textbook because Jorgensen can be confusing and rambly at times, but reading the textbook makes it clear what you need to know!",
    "This class has a lot of potential but often ended up feeling rambling and dull. That said, it's not a lot of work, so if you just need a chemistry elective that isn't too time consuming, you should shop it."
