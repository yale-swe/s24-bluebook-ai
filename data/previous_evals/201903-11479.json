    "This semester, we read selections from the maqama genre, mostly al-Hamadhani and al-Hariri. The emphasis in class was on comprehension because these texts are super difficult.",

    "Class was interesting but somewhat disorganized. Assignments were sporadic (on average, around once every other week, often with only 2-3 days' notice), so the workload was very uneven over the course of the semester. It takes a while to get used to the maqama genre, but it is fun once you figure out how it works.",

    "Anyone interested in Arabic literature would have to take this course, as one cannot ignore maqamat in that field."
