   "comments": [
    "A must-take for Spanish language people. The work load is manageable, but decidedly enjoyable. You watch films, critique them with your peers, and learn about the cultural underpinnings behind each major Latin American country through the medium of film - no brainer. Take it and you'll never regret it.As for Professor Tortora - a woman committed to her students, to her class, to Latin America cinema... beyond words. Professor Tortora's enthusiasm for the material and her students was infectious. She single-handedly fostered an environment of learning, cultural awareness and intellectual curiosity about the power of film to send powerful social messages.Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.",
    "HIGHLY recommend this class. Even if you are not pursuing a course of study in spanish or film, this class is incredibly eye opening in terms of getting to know the world around you. The movies watched in class are very different and informative. It is a great way to learn about the differences and similarities of Latin American cultures. I had not expected small history lessons in the class, but I am glad that Professor Tortora provided us with the context of the country the movie of the week was made in. The class is composed of a midterm (split in to take-home and in-class sections), a final essay or project(short film), 5 movie reviews, and 3 out of class movie screenings.",
    "A chance to learn Spanish with a great professor and with very interesting films - all worth the watch.",
    "It's a L5 course, so expect your speaking and writing skills to be pushed. So, you should be comfortable with your language skills. The class is a mixture. If you like Spanish and film, take this course. If not, look for another, less demanding (and interesting) course. Your Spanish-speaking skills won't increase a lot, but your writing skills overall will improve.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "Spanish 223 is an excellent course in Latin American cinema. It is a great way to practice Spanish and improve upon auditory skills by watching movies. You are required to watch a variety of movies from every country in Latin America. You learn a lot about the differences and similarities in Latin American cultures. As an added bonus Profesor Tortora makes a incredible effort to bring film makers, actors, producers etc, to make sure that you can learn more about making movies in Latin America. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in film, likes to watch movies, and wished to polish his\/her Spanish.",
    "This class is an incredible way to learn more about Latin American culture through film. The class is well-taught, dynamic, and really interesting. Professor Tortora is such an amazing teacher who knows so much about the films and is always so ready to share to the class. The movies, while often provocative and deep, are all very good. Even more impressive are all the extra movie screenings Professor Tortora offers, where we were able to meet famous actors and directors who presented their movies.I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in film, Latin American studies, and Spanish. Although there is a lot of work (usually 1 or 2 screenings a week, five response papers, a midterm, and a final paper), it is not difficult to complete, and all of the movies are super interesting!",
    "Yes I would recommend the course. It was very interesting and informative class about Latin American culture, presented in a thoughtful and engaging way.",
    "Yes, definitely. If the student is proficient enough in Spanish, this course is a must-take.",
    "If you like film and latin america, definitely take this course! I learned so much about latin american culture, politics, history, and just the way people live in general. I feel much better acquainted with the continent(s) and have Professor Tortora to thank. Professor Tortora is so sweet and accomadating. Beyond that her passion for cinema is infectious. She knows so much and loves to share her passion. The visits from film makers and actors were also really special and interesting. The course does not have a lot of work, but you have to be prepared to watch a movie a week and attend additional screenings often. Also the written assignments do catch up to you if you are not organized. But for an L5 course, it's pretty easygoing. But if you are looking for a class that will improve your speech, this is not it."
