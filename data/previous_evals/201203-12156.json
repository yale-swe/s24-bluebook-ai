   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you're interested in the subject matter, it's a very fun class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you are at all interested in nature writing. The course is a bit slow at the beginning (not so fun to read all of Gilbert White's \"The Natural History of Selbourne\"), but really gets better once you start reading from the Norton Book of Nature Writing. Even the papers were fairly fun to write and for non-English majors or people who do not enjoy writing analytic papers, there are creative options. Because the class is cross-listed with EVST, the group of students will probably have diverse academic interests that make class discussion more interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend students to take Nature Writing, not simply to fulfill a writing requirement, but to approach literature about nature from a multitude of insightful and innovative perspectives under the guidance of an extremely passionate professor.",
    "Reasonable workload, fun reading, fun class, great professor- check it out!",
    "Everyone should take this! It's extremely eye-opening in terms of American literature and the history of land use in this country and in others.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale so far. Everything you will read is incredibly interesting and makes you want to drop out and go live in the wild. The assignments are a lot of fun, especially if you chose to do the creative writing assignments. I would recommend this class to anyone who loves the outdoors and literature.",
    "Definitely take this course.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend English 248 to any student, English major or not. I think experience in writing\/English courses is beneficial, of course, but I also appreciated the mixture of people in the class from different backgrounds and I think any student can gain a different worldview from what the course teaches.",
    "A survey of the main movements and contributors to nature writing in English, predominantly American writers. One or two 5 to 15 page essays are assigned a week, along with sporadic but manageable written assignments. This is really about READING nature writing, not creating it.",
    "A lot of fun. Good readings. Fun assignments. Great classmates.",
    "This is a really good class, and I enjoyed it a lot. Half the term is books by 18th- to 19th-century (white) British and American men; later we went over essays or chapters by American writers (John Muir, Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard). Analysis tends to be pretty literary rather than scientific, but students with backgrounds in ecology or geology contribute a lot to discussions."
