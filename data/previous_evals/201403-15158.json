    "Right now the Arabic Department is very subpar. Take this class because you're enthusiastic about the language, not because you want to get rid of a language credit. Arabic is a beautiful and totally relevant language on the world stage, but Yale has some serious work to do with this program.",
    "Really good class, much better than I expected given the reviews from the previous years. The Arabic department sometimes gets a bad rep but I would definitely recommend this class. Really got me started on Arabic. Don't take the 9:30 am one though I struggled to stay awake and couldn't help but sleep through it a few times.",
    "Arabic is a great course to take if you are in for a challenge- the language is hard but interesting and certainly worth the time if you are willing to expend the effort. If you do plan on taking it, DO NOT take it with Aziz under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! He is very nice and entertaining but has no idea how to explain anything much less how to answer questions of his students. You would be better off just staring at the book for an hour a day rather than taking it with Aziz- youd get a lot more accomplished! Aziz is a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! If you can take it with a different professor, then definitely take it although be ready for a HUGE workload, as it requires a LOT of time each night.",
    "i would recommend this class to anyone really serious about learning the language, it is a lot of work, but i learned so much.",
    "I would say that this is an extremely intensive and fast-paced course and to be prepared to put in a lot of effort on your own, but it is worth it.",
    "I would cautiously recommend L1 Arabic with Professor Aziz to another student. First of all, if you just want a language credit without much work, don't take tho language. The homework at the beginning of the semester is burdensome, and does take a while to prepare for the weekly quizzes, 3 tests, and 2 presentations. However, if you are interested in Arabic or the wider Middle East than yes, I recommend taking it. I think the novelty of the language really bonds the class over a common ignorance towards it, and it can be really fun to learn. So, I recommend it with a warning that, if by the droop period you feel that you don't like the language, than drop it, because it does require a lot of work."
