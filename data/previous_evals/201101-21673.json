    "Yes, but take it credit\/d at least to start.",
    "There really isn't anything to say about this class that isn't apparent from the description. If you have not taken a class with Shelly before, you probably should avoid having this be your first one. That said, his grading really isn't that hard if you put time into your assignments. Fantastic class, definitely recommended.",
    "You already know you need to take this course. Unlike other courses, which teach you information and *what* to think, norm. ethics teaches you *how* to think. The essays and discussions force you to reflect deeply and think clearly, logically, and consistently. You'll forget all the facts by the time you leave Yale; you will always have the training of thought provided by this class. (As an aside, I chose this class over constitutional law, and I think I made the right choice).",
    "Yes. Definitely. Don't let the grading scare you. It's an advanced philosophy class, so hopefully you will only take this already knowing how to write a philosophy paper, in which case you will be fine. And it's really rare that Shelly leaves people with bad grades at the end, even if he gives a bad grade on a paper. I'm a philosophy major--there is an interesting mix of philosophy and EP&E majors, which makes for a funny division between deontologists and consequentialists in the class. Another thing that is cool about this class (for philosophy majors!) is that it's one of the classes where you feel like you are doing CURRENT philosophy, which can be refreshing. (At least, there is probably current philosophy being done on what you are writing your papers on.) Nobody uses the term \"philosopher\" to refer to living people anymore, but Shelly is just as much of a philosopher as he is a professor. (Or almost as much...not quite as much as Berkeley or Kant...) And he is REALLY good at breaking down arguments, and he knows a LOT about ethics. And you get a lot of attention from him (a lot more than in his intro classes) because this is a seminar. I had a really good time in this class--especially writing the papers. And I can't imagine that this subject wouldn't be interesting to everyone. Take it.",
    "Learn and debate contemporary ethics under the guidance of a world-renowned contemporary ethicist. Do it!",
    "An excellent intermediate-level discussion of normative ethics. Good to take as a sophomore or junior philosopher.",
    "Normative ethics is great. The topics of the class really made me think. Shelly is an excellent seminar leader and manages to keep the conversation flowing smoothy even though he asks students to speak whenever they wish instead of raising hands. My only complaint is that, by the end of the semester, discussions had grown slightly repetitive."
