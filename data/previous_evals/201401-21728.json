   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended",
    "Hieroglyphs is an awesome language to learn. It's not easy, and perhaps it's not as useful to know as many other languages, but it also only meets twice a week. Highly recommend it. Also, the teacher is great.",
    "A great class and I would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to fulfill their language requirement or just generally interested in Ancient Egypt. We build on what we did in L1 and go over verbal forms, followed by reading the stories \"Ahmose, Son of Ibana\" and \"The Shipwrecked Sailor.\" Tasha was a fantastic teacher and always encouraged discussion and promoted a positive atmosphere in the class. There is relatively little work, just a few quizzes, translations each class (not graded), the midterm, and the final. There is also opportunity for extra credit, so a good grade is always accessible.",
    "Take this class! Whether you intended to become a NELC major or not. This is a very interesting and enjoyable class. The workload is not heavy, and Tasha is very understanding. However do not think hieroglyphs are simply pretty pictures - this is a complex language - just like any other, which needs studying and memorisation of vocab and syntactic forms. I love this class, and it has inspired me to become a NELC major.",
    "If you'd love to learn Egyptian, definitely. After 110, you delve into authentic Egyptian texts that really cement your grammatical knowledge. Plus, the chance to translate these stories is unique and cool. If you're interested and enthusiastic about the language, then you should absolutely take this course."
