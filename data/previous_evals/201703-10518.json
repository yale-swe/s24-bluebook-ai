    "Lots of skills for biomedical image processing and analysis, mostly. Ranging from the relatively simple stuff, such as edge detection, fourier transforms, blurring, to more complicated things such as image registration and segmentation. It helped me a lot towards my senior project, which is on very similar material.",
    "I learned a lot about the mathematical background and development of the various biomedical image processing and analysis techniques that are being currently used in research and industry.",
    "I learned about Fourier transform, 2D rigid motion, segmentation, calculus of variations, filtering and others, which are quite advanced in imaging."

   "comments": [
    "This was a very enjoyable and informative course. I liked that algorithms were explained explicitly so that the logic behind different processing techniques was clear.",
    "Very interesting course and I learned a lot. If there was a continuation of this course (one in which we develop more computer algorithms\/programs and receive help in doing so), it would really help solidify the theoretical knowledge I gained in this course.",

    "I would recommend this class, but keep in mind that pretty much all the people in this class were graduate students, with only a handful of undergrads. I would recommend taking Biomedical Signals and Images before this, as material from that class helped significantly towards this one.",
    "I would very much recommend this course.",
    "Great class! Would definitely recommend, but prepare to do a lot of math and programming. There was not much help with writing the MATLAB scripts and functions.",
    "Not to an undergraduate student but definitely to a postgrad."
