    "A smaller classroom would go a really long way. Also, most structured discussion would have helped make the seminar more interactive.",
    "The seminar was much stronger this semester than the last. I found the speakers to be more exciting, enthusiastic, and informative.",
    "This is the second semester of the GH Seminar I attended and I have to say the quality of the speakers overall was much better. The speakers included leaders in the GH arena from a wide range of organizations, such as FHI, Exxon-Mobil, the GH Council and Engender Health. The seminar was very well organized. The dinner that is provided after each seminar is an excellent way to provide a setting for GH to socialize every week.The Maternal Health module was much more interesting than the Mental Health one last semester, but still, I feel it lasted for longer than it should. Perhaps the modules could be limited to just 2 weeks next semester?",
    "There was a wide variety of speakers and topics which made the course very interesting and satisfied the interests of many students. The speakers this semester were much better than last semester!",
    "Some of the lectures are GREAT, some are not so great. I really liked the session on surgery, since that is a global public health issue you never hear about. Whereas malaria, maternal health, etc are more common and well-known and have to be presented in a unique way\/new light to stand out in students' mind. Surgery, on the other hand, was not an issue on my radar, so I actually feel like I was able to learn something in an hour. Having more \"outside the box\" topics like this would be great. Prison health, for example, is super interesting and something not a lot of people are familiar with, yet it has major public healthramifications.",
    "Please get rid of the modules. It was a big pain in the butt, I didn't learn anything, and it was smack in the middle of midterms. Easily expendable.",
    "GREAT speakers. I very much enjoyed each and every speaker.",
    "This semester, the lectures were fantastic. There was a diverse selection of speakers who covered a wide range of topics.",
    "There were good speakers from both the Fall and Spring semesters but not every time. This course depends on interesting topics and specialized lecturers. So it is important to have very influential people invited to present.",
    "I thought the module was great.",
    "This semester was a vast improvement from last semester's seminar! With few exceptions, the lectures were interesting and engaging. I enjoyed hearing more practical presentations from people working in global health this semester.",
    "Interesting an much better than the fall semester",
    "Some of the guest lecturers are really interesting and it's nice to know what's happening in the real world.",
    "it covers a lot of topics on global health.",
    "Because it is a large lecture class, it is very difficult to have group-level interactions the way some of the speakers desired.",
    "Great speakers this semester! I loved the diversity of topics.",
    "This semester was much better than last semester. The speakers were much more impressive and the topics they spoke about were intriguing. Akriti did a wonderful job selecting speakers and the module was also very good.",
    "I really enjoyed the different speakers and the ability to speak with many of them after each seminar.The only weakness is that there is no grade so I think that this may have affected the effort put into the student presented module.",
    "I think it is a good seminar. It would just be nice to know what the module is for each semester's seminar so that those in the 2 year program could pick and choose which two semesters to attend for topics they are most excited about.",
    "For the most part, this course is very interesting and informative. Every once in a while the speakers are not very engaging, and it is easy to lose interest."

    "I would recommend the course to another student as a way to gain exposure to different careers in global health and be inspired to make a change in this field.",
    "The GH seminar is a requirement for the GH concentration, but after this semester's experience, I'd still take it even if it weren't. Very interesting talks!",
    "This course consists of guest lectures on topics related to global health. The speakers come from many different backgrounds and are involved in very different projects. It is interesting to see the opportunities that exist in the field of global health.",

    "This course brings high profile speakers who are movers and shakers in the global health world. They usually provide great insight as to how to effectively make headway on specific projects and topics, and can be great resources for job\/internship opportunities."
