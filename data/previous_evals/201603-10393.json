    "I came into the class with some art background, but this class helped me create art in less time. I also became better at creating works with more meaning and better composition.",
    "I learned, within and beyond the realm of art, what it means to see, observe, and replicate. This allowed me to more effectively look at the world around me.",
    "The first half of the course was focused on developing the technical basics of drawing: the use of plumb lines, how to properly hold a pencil, how to use charcoal to capture tones, perspective. The second half of the course was focused on softer artistic skills: composition, narrative, expression. By giving us an increasing amount of open-endedness in the projects throughout the term, the instructor allowed us to develop our own sense of artistic direction.",
    "I knew nothing about drawing before I took the course, and I learned a lot.",
    "I learned how to draw (wow!).",
    "I learned that drawing is merely a matter of looking and patience.",
    "learned how to draw, mainly in black and white with charcoal and graphite. learned fundamental drawing and image-creating skills and concepts. dabbled with several creative strategies and mindsets",
    "This drawing class taught me how to see shape, color, and light then translate it onto the page. Anahita and Joe's teaching was informative and effective. I highly recommend it."

    "I think concentrating on the technical aspects toward the end of the semester would have helped.",
    "I wonder if it would be possible to use color at all, that would be interesting. I did not enjoy using different types of paper, I just wanted to learn how to draw.",
    "I think the in-class tutorials could have been more diverse (topic-wise) and more specific (technique-wise).",
    "i think that perhaps showing some \"before and after\" examples of student work at the beginning of the semester could be useful in helping students realistically gage how much one semester of creative practice could improve their work."

   "comments": [
    "I liked this class, but it did become more focused on composition and the \"meaning\" behind the pieces than I expected. You don't need any experience to take this class.",
    "Yes! I think all students can benefit from a class that teaches them to truly look and see the world around them.",
    "This is a class where you really get out of it what you put into it. It's not difficult to get by in the class by not doing too much work, but if you're a perfectionist, it's easy to spend 10+ hours per week on the assignments. However, your artistic abilities will improve immensely as a result, and you will begin to look at the world around you differently. I went from not being able to draw at all (the last time I took an art class was 8 years ago) to feeling pretty competent as an artist. Anahita is a great professor, laid back but with high expectations. She assigned some pretty challenging projects, but you definitely grow as an artist as a result.",
    "Drawing is a different kind of work. It's interesting, and you gain a new skill.",
    "take it if you're serious about learning how to draw and not just looking for a fun or creative extracurricular. it is a decent amount of work, but as long as you can set aside an average 6 to 10 hours a week, it is manageable. you will not come out of this course as a master drawer, but you will be decent and have a set of tools that you can continue upon in future drawing\/painting classes\/endeavors."
