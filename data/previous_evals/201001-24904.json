   "comments": [
    "Take it if you can! One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you want to learn more about opera.",
    "Take it! It's a really enjoyable course, plus you might get to take a field trip to the Met!",
    "A great look at a bunch of libretti. Be warned that it's more literature than writing, history, or music, and if you don't like opera you won't like the class, but I loved the material. Best class I took this semester.",
    "A strong point of the course is the breadth of material we cover. I definitely feel that I have a better general understanding of opera literature; as a survey course, then, the class succeeds. Weaknesses lie mostly in organization, I think. The discussions rarely went much below the surface, and I think this has to do with the fact that 1) many people didn't do the reading, and 2) the discussion's weren't very strongly directed to a specific point. Do your reading, and you will come out with a general understanding of many libretti. But do not expect penetrating, overly interesting discussion.",
    "You will be asked to read a play or novella, and a corresponding libretto, every week. If possible, it is best to watch the operas (many are available at the music library). If no dvd is available, give each opera a listen before class. Falling behind on the reading will make the discussion very boring, as the class moves very quickly through a lot of repertoire. I found the class highly engaging, and always looked forward to seeing the many excerpts from operas that we were able to watch during our sessions.",
    "I would recommend it for another student who wanted to learn more about opera libretti."
