   "comments": [
    "Mellow course for anyone who is quantitative. Take it with someone else who is about just as quantitatively capable, so that you guys can do pair programming on psets later. Very well-organized, with lots of support (office hours, Piazza).",
    "Do it! You learn so much, and it's important to be able to program nowadays. The assignments were pretty challenging though. I really enjoyed working with a partner for some of them.",
    "A great introduction to Java and programming if you have never programmed before. The programs were never overwhelming and the TAs and professor were very helpful with any problems encountered. I would highly recommend this class for anyone with any interest in computers.",
    "Even though each assignment was pretty involved, requiring us to draw on a lot of the things we had only (theoretically) just learned, the satisfaction upon completing each p-set was immense. We did some pretty cool stuff (best assignment was simulating GuitarHero) and lectures could be exciting. I'd recommend this class for anyone with even a remote interest in programming (but probably not for anyone already acquainted with Java programming).",
    "Take this if you might have any interest in programming. If you have an eye for it, this class will be very easy and very entertaining. That said, it is an intro class, so the professor\/TAs will likely not put a whole lot of effort into it. Also, if you're absolutely terrible with quantitative reasoning and new languages you might struggle. The class is available online both on Yale and Princeton's CS websites.",
    "The course teaches the basics of java programming. There is a problem set due almost every week that incorporates the techniques learned in the previous week. The course gives multiple opportunities for assistance on the problem sets, from posting most of the course material online to hosting office hours with TAs and peer tutors to Piazza (an online question-asking service) to even having a TA on Skype. These problem sets are fun to do and to show off to friends or suitemates!I would recommend this course.",
    "Dreadfully dull lecture, but really cool material if you can get into it and devote some time to it. I never went to lecture but spent a lot of time at office hours and came to really like programming. If I weren't a junior I'd consider majoring in Computer Science after taking this! I really liked the thought process of designing programs. The class has been made more difficult than it was previously, but I don't mind it very much. The problem sets were really interesting and you are given a good amount of direction in developing your program at the start, so a large part of it is just writing the code rather than developing overall structure. Awesome stuff. Just skip lecture. The midterm was also pretty hard. Plan on 6-10 hours a week on problem sets once it picks up.",
    "The workload in this class is a problem set every week. Even if you have a natural mind for progtamming, if you come in without formal experience you're going to be spending 5-6 hours on the problem sets later in the term. This is a great course to get the fundamentals of Java, and you'll actually do some cool, useful things. Depending on how you best learn, class may even be unnecessary--I personally would only attend office hours and review sessions because there was the interaction that actually helps you learn programming. Overall, in this class, you're getting a moderately difficult workload with reasonably rewarding problem sets and a solid foundation in Java.",
    "This is definitely one of the most interesting and thought-provoking classes I have taken here. Programming teaches a skill not taught in other areas of study and it serves to get some experience in the computer science arena. I recommend this class if you want a bit of a challenge and critical thinking, however you should probably just take it credit\/d unless you are considering majoring in comp sci or continuing to take comp sci classes.",
    "This course was revamped this year to make it faster, and more challenging, and to follow the CS courses of other schools with stronger CS programs. As such, psets can be quite challenging. Make sure you go to TA office hours early, so you're not one in a queue of thirty clamoring for a sweaty, flustered TA to deliver help the night before a pset is due. The partner psets are nice, because they halve your workload. Find a good partner early. The course itself, and especially the psets, are logic-heavy. Debugging is frustrating, but the finished product gives you an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. The psets are useful, as well as fun--you can use your keyboard as a guitar, send encrypted pictures, etc.Zhong Shao is very nice, and helpful, and genuinely wants students to understand the material. He's a funny lecturer, and it's not hard (but also not necessary) to pay attention in lecture. He was very attentive with tailoring TA help -- adding more sections, starting TA review sections.In the end, the psets and this course help you appreciate the power you wield at the end of the semester from knowing how to harness Java. Zhong Shao does a good job of imprinting upon you the vast applications of programming.",
    "Unless you want to major in CS, don't take this class. Way too much work and very high likelihood of low grades.",
    "Yes. Programming is a really cool thing to learn and the problem sets were a lot of fun, if sometimes difficult. While I found the lectures to be pretty useless, the course creates a fantastic environment in which to program. They assign a manageable amount of good reading, provide challenging and interesting problems, and assign a constant stream of TA and peer tutor hours to help you while you're programming. I took this Credit\/D\/Fail, didn't complete all of the assignments, but still learned an awful lot while not having to put in a huge amount of work.",
    "I learned an enormous amount in this class, but if you're not ready to dedicate yourself to some intense problem sets don't take it.",
    "This class is an intro to the way you should think when programming. It was kind of a waste of time and I didn't learn that much. Would not recommend if the professor is Zhao or if the curriculum stays this way.",
    "The course is interesting and valuable, but it was much more challenging and moved much more quickly than in past semesters. This prevented gaining real comfort and familiarity with the material.",
    "TOUGH. you must have some working knowledge of java before going in. I would recommend only if you are willing to spend dozens of hours a week working on the problem sets.",
    "The class focuses around java and gaining a basic understanding of the syntax and some of the intricacies of the language.",
    "This class is a great course that I think everyone should take at the very least Credit\/D\/Fail. Programming is like a logic puzzle that, although the assignments take a long time, you feel invigorated and accomplished for completing them.",
    "take ONLY if you have 10 hours to spend for it each week. you still might not get an A because exams are much different than psets",
    "This is a good intro computer science course - it covers a wide range of topics. It can be really time consuming though, if you are not the best programmer. However, the TA's are great -- they are super helpful for the problem sets and there is someone available to help at virtually any time.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed CPSC 112. It made me think logically and analytically, and it was always incredibly satisfying to complete the problem sets. Academically speaking, I always knew where I stood in the class, since all the grades are broken down and there is no curve, which was nice.I had no prior programming experience and I never spent more than 9 hours on a problem set, and I spent probably an average of 4.5 hours on psets which isn't bad. I also probably could have done them faster if I'd ever gone to the copious amount of office hours and review sessions made available. You CAN accomplish the work in this class.",
    "A very hands-on approach to programming. 10 problem sets, taking an average of 4-5 hours each, all were really fun. I recommend this class to anyone, even if you aren't interested in CS at all. The future belongs to the computer literate.",
    "The course is a fair amount ofwork (8-10 hours a week), but is absolutely worth it- I've learned SO much this semester. Assignments were interesting and working with a partner was very enjoyable. Midterm was easy but final was brutal. There's plenty of opportunity for extra credit in the course though, so no worries. Definitely take this if you have any interest in learning how to program.",
    "Great introductory course to Java. Problem sets take about 6-10 hours\/week, but they're fun to do. Tests are harder, but they're only worth 30% of the grade. Overall, it's a good course if you ever wanted to learn a little about programming and computer science.",
    "A pretty fair introduction to programming. Teaches you java in some depth. Lectures are very optional because all the slides are posted online. There are many chances for extra credit and the midterm and final don't count for that much of your grade, so you could probably fail both the midterm and final and still get an A if you do all the extra-credit. Pretty easy class with about a 3-5 hour work load each week.",
    "CS 112 with Shao is a wild ride. In week 4 we learned what students in CS 112 last semester learned in their last week, if that gives you an idea of how fast we moved. I spent up to 8 hours a week in TA office hours working on the programs, and the exams were true disasters. This class is really difficult, if, like I, you've never taken any CS before (and even those who had taken CS found it ridiculous at times). I'd say, take it with a different prof unless Shao changes how fast he moves.",
    "The class is super easy but you dont really learn that much and it can be kind of a pain at times.",
    "The supplementary textbook is much easier to read. Start on psets early, use the TAs, psets can potentially take awhile, but I learned alot and it is rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this class, as programming is useful in any discipline. However, it is more difficult than it may appear and much time must be devoted to each assignment. Attending office hours were necessary for me because I needed a lot of help on each assignment. Overall, I learned a lot and am excited to take more computer science classes in the future!",
    "A good introduction to programming. More in-depth than I had expected and the homework assignments can be very frustrating if you don;t get help from multiple TAs. I definitely learned a new skill.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and definitely take it earlier in your four years, because it's a great introduction and a strong foundation for future work with stats programs.",
    "You'll learn a lot within a short amount of time. Zhao is a great guy, but be warned that this class moves very quickly. Some people will naturally catch on, and some will be like me and struggle thee whole way. Also, programming is a very large time commitment, (like between 5 and 12 hours per assignment) so if you're willing to commit to it, go for it.",
    "I would recommend CS 112 to other students. It's useful to know something about computer science and programming, and this is a great class to learn it.",
    "Unless you already have some programming experience, take it Cr\/D if you can. That's what I did, and I don't regret it. Problem sets are time-consuming but not difficult to do well on; tests, on the other hand, were very hard. However, Professor Shao is such a fun, nice person, so it was a pleasure to have him as a professor!",
    "Excellent class, easily one of my favorites at Yale. Applicable to everyone, even if you aren't a computer\/math person. Also Prof. Shao is amazing - he really cares about his students AND makes the lecture funny and interesting! The p-sets took me around 5-6 hours per week, but if you ever get stuck the TAs are really helpful during office hours. Also for the last 4-5 assignments we were allowed to work in pairs which made the work easier and more fun. Definitely shop the class!",
    "I would! It's a lot of fun, and provides you with a very useful life skill.",
    "Very interesting course, and it's definitely a subject that everyone should be a little familiar with. However, if you are just taking this course for fun or out of curiosity and have no prior experience with the subject, be prepared to spend anywhere between 3 and 10 hours on the problem sets. If you are taking other work-heavy science or math classes with problem sets, this will be incredibly frustrating. Otherwise, it's a great course.",
    "I think everyone at Yale should take this course. Nearly everyone will need to interact with computers for their career, and this course provides a good understanding of what computers are actually capable of, and what they are and aren't useful for.",
    "CPSC 112 is a great intro programming survey. Even if you come in with no programming background whatsoever, by the end of the class, you will be making android apps. Java is a great language for beginners and you will become very competent at using it. Grading is fair and Zhong Shao is a great teacher with a great sense of humor! However, 95% of the programming you will learn in the class comes from tinkering with the problem sets; they are very engaging and enlightening. Be sure to go to the TAs for help on them; they are an amazing resource.",
    "Great class, especially if you think you're interested in doing computer science! Definitely take it!",
    "I had a lot of friends who took cs112 in the fall semester and they all said it was an interesting class and not too difficult. Warning: check to see who the professor is for the course. Professor Shao was a pretty good professor, but he made the class completely different from how it was last semester. We learned a lot of different things this semester than the fall semester course did. Also, professor Shao puts all the lecture notes online, and his lectures aren't that informative, so a lot of people tended not to go to class. I went to every class, but most of the time I felt like I didn't learn much in lecture. Also, assignments make up most of your grade. Prepare to depend a lot on the TAs. The TAs are great and have lots of hours, so use them as a resource. Overall, this course is pretty good although it is harder than I expected.",
    "This was a challenging class with a lot of reward. I had no programming experience going in, and now I feel very prepared to continue on the CS track if I want to. The weekly assignments get progressively challenging over the course of the semester, so be prepared to spend 8 or more hours on them. For some, I spend over 10 hours. You should be fine, however if you start each assignment early on in the week and go to the TAs for help. What I really liked about this class was how many resources there were- email, Piazza (website for class questions\/discussions), tutoring hours, and review sessions for the assignments. However, the class was very fast-paced this semester, especially for an introductory course. If you are not a math\/logic type of person and you are looking to \"dabble\" in computer science, I might rethink taking this class.",
    "This course is a good start for anyone who is looking for a base in programming, or for anyone who is even mildly interested in programming, or for anyone who just wants to do cool things with computers. I feel like I've really learned a lot, even though debugging the most frustrating experience ever, and I think I'll be able toto use what I've learned for real things even though I'm not going into programming.The assignments (one per week) are sometimes kind of long and take a while, but they don't feel like work at all (provided you're not stressed about a million other things at the same time). Take advantage of office hours! You can figure out the answer to a question in five minutes with help rather than five hours on your own.",
    "Every math\/science\/engineering\/economics student should take this course. Programming is a highly useful skill in any field and this class is very comprehensive in teaching it.",
    "It's a great class. If you have any background with compsci, esp. with Java or another C-based language, you should probably take a more advanced course. But for beginners like me, it was a lot of fun. Prof. Shao is great.",
    "If you're getting started with programming or looking for a refresher, this is a great class to take.",
    "Great class. Really interesting material and not too hard if you complete the weekly assignments. I learnt a lot and found the process of writing programs fulfilling.",
    "I think the course is great--for pre-computer science majors and folks who think quantitatively. A humanities-oriented student, I took the class looking to take a useful (and a non-gut) QR but quickly found that I was in way over my head. Professor Shao is clearly very nice and has a good sense of humor, but lectures were generally useless in terms of enhancing my understanding of the material. The assignments got progressively harder, and, eventually, I found that I did not stand a chance unless I spent hours with a TA each week. Had I known all this during shopping period, I would have opted for a different QR class.",
    "CPSC 112, as its first lecture claims, is a broad introduction to computer science with focus on writing code in java. This semester, with Professor Shao and the Princeton textbook, was amazing! I loved doing the weekly assignments, which rarely took more than 5 hours. I felt like nearly everything we learned or were expected to learn was significant, which I can hardly say of some other classes. I came into this class not knowing a thing about programming, and it wasn't that hard at all. I do have a reasonable math background though.I would highly recommend this class to any student wanting to learn how to use computers to their benefit. It has inspired me to take more computer science classes even though I had never thought of doing that before. I initially took this class only as possible pre-req for the applied mathematics major.",
    "Pretty cool QR, with Shao (I heard the teacher before was bad), psets are very do-able (just require time) and quite rewarding, tests are much harder cuz you have to understand the basic concepts (which were actually in the optional book and not the required one so check out both!). I would recommend this class to anyone who needed a qr, but if you want to learn more practical programming skills, i think hackyale would be better",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It's extremely interesting and easy to get a good grade if you keep up with the work and do well on the problem sets. The problem sets and programming in general are both extremely applicable to any field in math and science. I think anyone who is moderately good at math or logically thinking will love this class. You will get a good grade and really enjoy the work. The only people I can see not liking this class are people who struggle with programming. That would make doing the programs every week pretty tedious. But don't be scared this class isn't too hard, and its really interesting. Any student should definitely take it if the can.",
    "If you have had any java experience at all, this course will be pretty easy for the most part. There will be a couple times throughout the semester where you will get stuck and will actually have to think a bit to figure things out, but for the most part its straightforward. The exams are fine. Not super easy but not impossible either, just a bit tedious since everything needs to be written out by hand.If you haven't seen any of this stuff before, I could see the course being very difficult at certain times, but it seemed to me that most people were getting along fine, especially with the help of the TAs. That being said, there were a couple people who really suffered, as they hadn't seen the material before and weren't assimilating the information either.",
    "Take it! Hard but worth it!",
    "Be prepared for tough weekly assignments. You will almost always need to go to office hours.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any other student regardless of what your major is. It is probably one of the most fun classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "This class will give you a working knowledge of Java, along with an appreciation of a variety of problems that can be solved with clever programming. The class is a nice mix of well-organized explanatory lectures, case studies (e.g. explaining the principles behind Google's ranking algorithm), and fun problem sets (a sample: we wrote a program to simulate a small universe, made our own recursive art, created a picture encryption program, and coded a guitar program that could be played through the keyboard!)This is a fun way to learn a very useful skill with tons of support (SO MANY useful TA help sessions that people actually used, a class website where every question was answered within 15 minutes, etc.) It will take some time; the average pset took me 4-6 hours. However, the problems were interesting enough that I always wanted to get started early in the week (this from someone who always procrastinates on papers until the 11th hour), and that meant that it could be fun problem-solving time rather than super-stressful time.Take the course for sure!",
    "If you want to take this class, be prepared for some hard problem sets (if you're taking it with Shao). Many nights, I could have just went into rage mode and punched my computer, but going to office hours really, REALLY helped (don't take this as an ego thing, everybody goes to office hours). The exams were fair (but it's really more like a gauge for quick problem-solving on the spot), and the curve is fairly generous (weighed heavily towards the problem sets, which you can receive a lot of help on). It may be frustrating to not *fully* understand and conceptualize a problem set, but remember that this is an introductory course and you're just scratching the surface.Lectures weren't greatly-attended, and a lot were on Facebook or Twitter. Not to say that I didn't become distracted (I did, I went on reddit sometimes\u0ca0_\u0ca0), but if you pay attention in lecture, Shao will illuminate concepts better than the textbook does. Just seek help when you need it. Overall, 9\/10, would take again.",
    "Yes if you can put in an immense amount of time, and put in the work FROM THE BEGINNING. Falling behind is an absolute nightmare.",
    "great class",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking to get a good introduction to programming. The class tries to cater to people of various levels of experience--I had no prior programming knowledge, and still enjoyed the class very much.I would also recommend this even if you have not thought much aboutcomputer programming. It is truly fascinating what you can do with a computer, and it is empowering to know that you can manipulate it to perform your own functions rather than relying on a program that someone else has made. Many of the assignments we did this semester were quite interesting, including simulating a guitar (and using the keyboard to pluck the strings), creating a critter world where you get to dictate the animals' behavior, and creating an animation of the universe.That said, the class will take a lot of effort, and the problem sets can be quite long. However, if you start the assignments early and see the TAs if you have problems (they are numerous and extremely useful), the assignments are not too strenuous. As an extra bonus, the course offers plenty of opportunities for extra credit, and most of the grade consists of the programming assignments rather than the midterm and final.",
    "CS112 is a lot like puzzle-solving. I liked it because I like math and puzzles and logic problems. However, Professor Zhong Shao was not the most engaging of teachers. I would recommend it to people who are interested in puzzles, but I assume that if you're the sort of person who considers computer courses you'd like this.",
    "I would recommend the course if the student is even vaguely familiar with programming or has the time and devotion to learn it well. The course really builds upon itself, so if you're not coming in with some background knowledge or at least the will to keep up with the class, you won't be gaining much from taking this course.",
    "CS 112 was a great class. I had never done any computer programming before, so it was an entirely new experience, but it was definitely worth it. The material builds on itself and you learn a lot. While the weekly problem sets may take a while, especially if you get stuck, they are a lot of fun and rewarding to complete. Some of the problem sets can be difficult, but there are a lot of opportunities for help, so you never feel like you are on your own since TA's have office hours practically all week.",
    "This class is really great for anyone that is looking to learn java. Professor Shao does a great job of making the problem sets very doable. There is one assignment a week, and some of the later ones can take several hours, but there are always TAs and peer tutors available for help. This class requires you to be able to think logically and break down tasks into smaller steps, but it's definitely worth taking if you are at all interested in computer science and programming.",
    "CS 112 is a great course, but a lot of the learning is independent. Concepts are often difficult to grasp until you code for yourself. It's pretty hard to keep up with lectures, but if you do the reading and revisit the slides online, the assignments and the exams shouldn't be too bad.",
    "Bottom line: If you don't have any programming experience or do not intend on being a comp sci major, TAKE IT CR\/D.",
    "Shao changed the level of the course completely from previous semesters. Its unfairly difficult. The problem sets are not productive at all, the story around each problem is too long and unrelated to intro JAVA, and most effort is put in understanding that. the problems are in fact so complicated that usually the entire structure is given to you, the TA's give you 90% of the solution, and all that is left is to type in a few lines. But the time it takes to read through the entire assignment and figure out what is even going on is ridiculous.I would not recommend this course in its current format with professor shao. it needs to be seriously remodified and brought backto reality.",
    "Learn Java\/ProgrammingYes I do recommend this class if you are willing to work.",
    "Overall a really good class. The problem sets can be difficult, but they are generally fun to do and really rewarding once you get them working. The problem sets count for over 70% of the final grade, and you will almost always get close to full credit if you do the work. Overall you learn a very useful skill and the class teaches you to think in a new way especially f you're a humanities major. Also not that difficult to get a good grade.",
    "I really liked this class. The book explained things very well, and there were almost always TAs available to help. I liked what we learned and I think it is a very good course for those of you looking to get a look at how computers think (in terms of the language Java). At the same time, the class could be difficult if you have a hard time with traditional math-y logic. For me, at least, that's how I though of it, and therefore very much enjoyed it.",
    "A great, fun introduction to what a programming language looks like and how you might use one in making practical or \"fun\" computer applications. This term we did things like create digital guitar sounds out of our piano keyboard and simulate orbiting planets in 2-D on our screen, which was really cool. The introduction to concepts is rather lacking, though, and the \"fun\" of the assignments somewhat overshadows the fact that they're not reinforcing the important concepts that will appear on the exams. Some problems are very frustrating, but in the end peer tutors and TAs will basically walk you through to the solution, so your grade won't suffer, but you may not get as much intellectual fulfillment that way. Take it - it's fun, you'll learn something, and you'll have fun things to show off to your parents and friends.",
    "Intro to Programming is excellently well taught. Prof Zhong is awesome. But be warned, it is a substantial commitment to devote 7-10 hours each week towards problem sets.If you take it, when you reach a point that you get stuck: use the zoo and Piazza.",
    "If you have a mind for it, it won't be so difficult, although some of the assignments will require to think. Overall, a fairly enjoyable course. Lectures were not so necessary to succeed in the class.",
    "CS 112 is a pretty awesome course. I had no previous experience with programming or Java, and I learned a LOT this semester. The problem sets are great, though time-consuming at times. The most learning takes place during the time in which you're completing the problem sets. This made the midterm significantly easier (the amount of time spent on the homework). I would definitely recommend taking this. You walk away knowing a significant amount of programming.",
    "This class is largely defined by the professor who teaches it - Prof. Shao was an excellent guide to into comp sci. I was worried coming into the course, having had a very bad\/confusing\/frustrating experience with programming in the past. This class went step by step in explaining the basic concepts and tools of Java. Be warned that some students find the material much more comprehensible and intuitive than others. I grasped the concepts fairly easily, so I had a lot of fun on the problem sets. They still took me 6-10 hours to do, but I enjoyed every minute of them. If you do have some comp sci background, you might find this course a bit trivial. If you don't - go ahead and TAKE IT.",
    "If you have even a little interest in technology\/logical thinking, this is a good course.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, no matter what your major is. It's an introduction to programming - you learn Java, but more important, you learn basic programming constructs and principles of computer science. The material is fascinating, and the assignments (and even problems on the exams) are really interesting and fun to work on. If you have trouble, the TAs are incredibly helpful, so there's really no reason not to take this class and succeed in it. You will learn so much and have so much fun doing it!",
    "It's a fun class if you are already somewhat good at quantitative reasoning. Otherwise, I imagine, it can be very frustrating. The hands-on component is probably the best part of this class. Making a program that runs is a completely different feeling from turning in a math problem set. A lot of the programs are basically puzzles that may require a lot of time spent staring at a computer screen before they can be solved, but for the most part the problem sets are very reasonable and fair. The assignment includes the algorithm and tells you, basically step-by-step, how to do each assignment, so as long as you follow the instructions, there isn't too much hard thinking. Don't be a jerk and take this class if you already have programming experience (even though the class is not graded on a curve). The tests are really hard, but problem sets are what make up most of your grade, so the tests don't matter too much, as long as you don't bomb them. Overall, pretty good class. Prof. Zhang is a poor lecturer though, and I found myself not going to class more often than not, but the textbook made up for it.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it, with the disclaimer that I am a quantitative person, and it can be a big (dis)advantage (not) to have a good sense of \"algorithmic\" thinking. The exams are difficult, but the homework is easy, and that counts much more.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to fellow students. Anyone who enjoys a good puzzle or has any interest in computers will definitely enjoy taking this course.",
    "I'd say the class is alright if you're into this type of stuff. I didn't think it was taught particularly well - I rarely went to class and usually had about no idea how to do the weekly psets. I think a lot of people in the class felt this way and tons of people always showed up to the TA sessions which were help for a couple hours every day. That was literally the only reason I was able to finish the homework. In my opinion, not a great class. The professor went at an insanely fast pace and even the TAs were shocked by how quickly we were going.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course",
    "Intro Programming was a very cool class and should be taken if you have any interest in learning about programming. The programs we wrote were pretty awesome."
