    "You know what you're getting into, I guess? Prof Patterson is great, seems demanding but is actually very kind. Papers are engaging and interesting.",
    "A great course.",
    "If you need it for the major.",
    "You need to take it if you're an English major. Taking it with Patterson will be painless. You will read things that you should, as a person, read, so look forward to it. Nothing else to say really.",
    "May be taken independently from English 125 -- a detailed examination of Milton's Paradise Lost, Wordsworth's \"The Prelude,\" Pope's mock epic \"The Rape of the Lock,\" and Eliot's revolutionary \"The Wasteland.\"Enjoyable and valuable for majors and non-majors alike.",
    "DEFINITELY take 126 with Annabel Patterson. She's hilarious with a ridiculous biting sense of humor, she's the sweetest person, and she's also a frickin genius. The focus of the course is on the epic so you'll read some pretty hefty works, Paradise Lost and Wordsworth's The Prelude are the big ones. I loved Milton and Pope, had mixed feelings about Eliot, and mainly hated slogging through Wordsworth, but Professor Patterson's discussions in class are stimulating, specific, and exciting enough that I learned a huge amount even when I didn't enjoy or love everything I was reading. Absolutely take this with her!",
    "Course in the epic. Lots of reading, a couple of essays, and ok exam. What you would expect. I would absolutely recommend it."
