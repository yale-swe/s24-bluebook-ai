   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, although most people will be taking this course to fulfill their language requirement. I was sufficiently inspired to take another German course next semester. It is likely a step above your high school German as far as expectation of reading. The grammar was difficult for me, and that was essentially all that we were graded on. However, you can get help if you need it.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course. Thoroughly enjoyable, manageable work load and interesting material.",
    "Recommended as a continuation for L4.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but I would also recommend shopping around sections if there is more than one; from what I heard, there was a big difference between the one I took and the other one offered. I liked the mix of students who had taken four successive semesters a Yale, students who had studied abroad, and freshmen who had taken AP and...div school students... it broke up the monotony that taking semester after semester at Yale with the same students can bring. I also liked the maturity that was expected of us, that our conversation didn't seem inhibited just because it was in German.",
    "This is a fine german class - good practice for reading, writing, and speaking.",
    "If you took AP German in high school and are looking for a way to fulfill your language requirement, this is the way to go. Also, because we covered a lot of literature, it seems like a good bridge into more German Studies courses. I would recommend this course."
