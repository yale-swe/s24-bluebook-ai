   "comments": [
    "She was superb in setting up several practical situations during the role play. And her feedback after each role play was excellent. Learned a lot from practitioner who is specialized in actual pastoral care.",
    "Kris was an insightful instructor. She brought her experience and wisdom from the field, but didn't overwhelm us with it. She was never a know at all, and often asked us to think through the answers to difficult situations ourselves before piping in.",
    "Kurt did a great job as our practicum instructor. I think one of his strengths was making us all comfortable in making mistakes and asking questions. He was also good at building our group dynamic and keeping the conversation and activity moving & flowing. He also did a great job at helping us dive into analysis of our various scenarios. I'm not sure that we got to as engage actively in role play as some other groups did -- or to go as deeply into a scene as some groups did.",
    "Kurt was very willing to set aside the syllabus if it meant engaging material and student needs more deeply, and zeroing in on areas of student interest or particular need.",
    "Willis was a joy to spend an hour with - and I looked forward to doing so each week! He was extremely helpful practically in the role play situations, in reflection afterwards, and also more generally in terms of pastoral ministry. He shared stories and experience from his own ministry and answered our questions as fully as he could. He asked us challenging questions and encouraged us to think about how we would respond to different situations and circumstances. He was also very sensitive to how we were feeling\/doing as people and aware of the pressures of YDS - he handled a number of situations with sensitivity and wisdom, such as when one of our group members was having a really tough time and shared some of his anxieties and journey with the rest of the group - talking for maybe 10-15 minutes. Willis was able to recognise and honour the difficult time the group member was having, whilst also recognising the small group situation - he adapted the session to almost be a real role play, saying to us, what would you say to your colleague. Even though the subject matter was difficult, covering the election, and I would have been tempted to try to move on quickly to the actual role play on the sheet, Willis enabled us to sit with the uncomfortableness of different opinions - when I reflected on this session, I was blown away by how he had embodied what we were learning in the reading and in class about pastoral care. Some of the key questions he encouraged us to ask I will remember throughout my ministry, I'm sure, such as, 'how have you been coping with this?', 'do you feel safe?' etc. He always stressed that we could email him outside of class time if we had any questions or anything occurred to us from the role play session.",
    "She was available, atentive, caring, and knowleadgeble. Truly a pastoral care giver!",
    "Kris was awesome. Always willing to discuss the intricacies of the role plays, provided feedback that was always constructive, whether positive or negative, and helped create a safe space for all of us to trust one another an integral part of a successful section."
