   "comments": [
    "Awesome class. What other classes have you taken where the homework is watching YouTube? 3 papers, a presentation, and weekly meetings. Couldn't be better. Awesome Wr.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student. It covers a lot of ground, and if you complete all the homework, you will be reading a lot and watching a lot of clips and films, but it will give you a greater and better appreciation and understand of comedy in America, and its sociocultural and historical implications.",
    "It was an amazing chance to watch and read really great comedy. DEFINITELY take it if you can get it. The papers were interesting and really fun to research and write.",
    "Take it! Eddy is awesome. You learn a lot and watch and read a lot of comedy. It gives you new perspectives and appreciation. It made me happier and I met cool people. Take it if you can! I'm not sure if it's being taught again as a college seminar though.",
    "This is an incredible class; basically it involves watching humor videos from a wide range of comedians and backgrounds. If you like comedy and history, you will love this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was really great.",
    "If you want to watch a lot of comedy, and then analyze it, go for it. I actually struggled a bit with the papers, mostly because I have not written a lot of papers in my time at Yale, but you have a lot of space. You can write about what interests you, and Eddy lets you take it in whatever direction appeals most to you. 2.5 hour class sessions go by pretty quickly, with comedy clips spread out here and there.",
    "Every week you gather with fellow comedy fans and listen to a lecture from Professor Friedfeld, which can get a bit heavy, sometimes with limited space for discussion, as he talks about comedy history and shows audio and video clips, transcripts, quotes, and other sorts of demonstrations of comedy. He has little dishes of candy to snack on during lecture, sometimes Hershey\u0092s Kisses, usually Hugs. The readings are sometimes not really crucial to the class, but they are usually quite enjoyable, especially the outside screenings of youtube clips, and of course the full movie screenings. You will encounter a ton of comedians and films both legendary that you never got around to checking out before the class, as well as smaller names that you will feel better off for knowing. You also have to do a presentation on one of your three papers to the class, so try to choose the paper you are most excited about and the presentation is actually quitestress-free and actually really enjoyable because it ends up being something you are passionate about because you wrote a whole paper on it and you get to share your project with the class. There might even be a guest speaker who will stop by, and even just the stories from Professor Friedfeld's career are cool enough. At the very end, you may get to go on a really cool field trip, which was a definite highlight. So if you can get in the class (you need to submit a writing sample, too), you really cannot go wrong with this class. It is a blast. It is more than a weekly class, it is a weekly event.",
    "It's a gut. Since it's more lecture than discussion it doesn't matter if you don't do the readings, and your papers can be on basically anything you want. It's interesting if you really really like comedy but there are probably more interesting things to do. Eddy is a really nice professor though."
