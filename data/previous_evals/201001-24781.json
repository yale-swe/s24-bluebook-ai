    "YES i would, plus you get to go to Rome for the summer!",
    "This is a course in the sort of 'intangibles' of Rome. You won't leave with a great knowledge of dates or with ability to list all of the popes in a row. You will however leave with a substantial knowledge of the myths, literature, art, and architecture of Rome. It's definitely a humanities course in that you leave with a lot of interdisciplinary knowledge that is hard to quantify (I find it hard to explain to my parents what this course is about.).",
    "Take this class. Professor Jewiss is incredible and does a remarkable job teaching a true Humanities course. The reading is a bit much sometimes, but it tapers off toward the end of the semester and is completely worth it. Plus, you get the chance to continue the course in Rome in the summer (!).",
    "Great class. Take it. A lot of reading but it's worth it. Definitely go to Rome.",
    "Humanities 396 is a great course if you want a broad overview of Rome and its relevance to history and society. I came into this class barely knowing very much about Rome. After taking this class, however, I discovered how important Rome is to the world around us.",
    "Take it. It is a fantastic class. One of my favorite at Yale.",
    "Take this class!! As someone who had never really been exposed to Roman history or many of the \"classics\" of Western thought (in other words, I didn't take DS), I was excited to read everything from Polybius to Dante to Shakespeare in one semester. And Professor Jewiss lives in Rome when she is not at Yale, so she lives, breathes, and loves the subject matter, and her enthusiasm is infectious. Not to mention the fact that I am going to Rome for five weeks with some members of the class& the professor to continue the course through Yale Summer Session..! And as an FYI, if you are interested in Urban Studies, other majors will often accept this class as part of your interdisciplinary concentration.",
    "A really great way to learn about Rome in a truly meaningful way. KNOW HOW TO SKIM. Or, know how to decide what to read and what not to read. Balancing my time between all the texts was a bit tricky.",
    "Maybe. Look at the reading list. If you have read most of the texts, I wouldn't take it. If you are looking for a broad survey course, I would take it. If you are looking for close textual analysis, I would look elsewhere.",
    "This class has a great reading list, and this is why I took it. Additionally, I was pleased by the lectures and thought that they were very good. If you find the material intrinsically interesting, you will like this class, but if you don't like reading ancient Roman works in translation, then don't take this class. The workload is pretty light--one short paper, one midterm, and one final, and none of the three assignments are that difficult.",
    "Rome is a good course, it gives a unique perspective on the effect Rome had on the western tradition and traces interesting themes through the history of the city of Rome. Professor Jewiss brings a lot of energy and thought to the class. The class has a lot of reading, especially towards the beginning of the semester, but it is more gratifying if you keep up with it. I would recommend it if you enjoy a humanities perspective and like using a thematic approach to view history.",
    "YES. Its not too much work, and it is one of the most interesting classes you will ever take.",
    "City of Rome is a class about the legacy of Rome in the Western tradition. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in seeing big themes drawn throughout cultural and intellectual history. If you're someone who really can't stand a course where a teacher has a pretty clear agenda, you might butt heads with the prof."
