   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class, because it was really interesting and informative. It also provided me with a new found interest in studying religion. It's a very fun class and you learn a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend that students take English 114 and definitely with Professor Hopper. She gives the greatest feedback on papers and you can feel your writing improve in her course.English 114 is a great introductory-english course to take if you are feeling nervous about your writing skills. There are five essays in the semester and they are completely manageable.",
    "Typical intro English seminar. Take it if you aren't ready for 120",
    "English 114 10 is an introductory writing seminar that combines writing with topics in religion and race. I would definitely recommend it to another student because the articles and essays that we read are very interesting and it really helps to improve your writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It wasn't too difficult, but I didn't feel like I was wasting my time either.",
    "I would summarize this course as a introductory writing course that discusses religion through a variety of mediums. I would recommend this course to another student interested in writing and religion in the United States.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. There wasn't too much reading, and the writing assignments were manageable. The topic of religion in America was very relevant and interesting.",
    "The class is a good class overall. Some readings will be lengthy but the papers are not too bad to write if you like writing with the English 114 formula involving a main claim.",
    "It helps to improve your writing, and it's an engaging class with interesting material.",
    "I would recommend the class to a student who does not feel confident with their research paper writing skills. I entered college without a thorough preparation, and it caught me up with what I had been missing in writing for most of high school.",
    "I highly recommend Religion in America. I particularly enjoyed the connections we drew between religion and its implications for our culture, politics, and individual experience. There are 4 essays, including a research paper and personal essay. You turn in 2 drafts of each. The first draft is not graded, it is shared with Professor Hopper and classmates to be peer reviewed. Professor Hopper varies the materials covered, which always keeps the class interesting. We looked at Martin Luther King's Speech, personal and academic essays, and films. None of the readings were particularly long."
