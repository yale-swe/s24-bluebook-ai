    "This was a good design course for me to take a part in and also set the stage for my summer design work. I learned more in depth about solar, its challenges and its applications.",
    "How to use Arduino I learnt basic coding How to design a portable solar charger",
    "I developed a baseline understanding for the operation of solar systems, what goes into design solar systems, and the financing methods and mechanisms involved in planning and installing solar systems. I also gained a baseline knowledge of Arduino programming and some engineering design.",
    "The course spanned a great variety of skillsets and taught us how wo size and develop solar energy systems, how to code using and arduino and build an energy meter, how to finance renewable energy technologies, as well as how to use these skills to serve developing communities. The class was very enjoyable to attend and covered an incredible range of skills necessary to develop renewable energy technologies.",
    "I learned a little bit about how to design a solar array through part of a reading we were assigned early on. Other than that, the course was too disorganized for me to pick up any skills.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of how solar panels work and some of the overall landscape of renewable energy.",
    "-Circuit connections and programming using arduino and how this can be used in building of smart meters for energy consumption. -Sizing of panels, batteries and inveters based on household energy load -Financing of green technologies -production of solar cells"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was very disorganized at times. I believe that the course could be structured better if there was much greater focus on the design project at the end of the semester. For this pilot year, we did not receive enough time and guidance to thoroughly undergo the design process.",
    "The course content was great and had a lot of useful topic however, organization was poor. Class readings were not uploaded on time and was not consistent. We deviated from the syllabus on more than one occasion. however, this was because we were the inaugural class and things were not well defined. Overall I think subsequent classes will be great.",
    "This course's greatest strengths were its ambitious subject matter and guest speakers. As someone who is very interested in renewable energy, both from a personal and future career perspective, I could not have been more excited at the beginning of the semester. The guest speakers Dr. Taylor brought in over the course of the semester were by far the course's greatest strength-we heard from experts in the fields of sustainable investing, solar project development, EP&C, and nonprofit work. These speakers not only offered a glimpse of what it might be like to work in the sustainable energy space, but provided an invaluable learning experience. My biggest criticism is this course suffered from what I might describe as an overly ambitious syllabus and a clear lack of organization. While the course was intended to blend knowledge-building with practical skill development (through 'lab' modules with Arduino and Solidworks, the latter of which never occurred due to time constraints), I think the only 'lab' session that was truly relevant to the course at large was the visit to Dr. Taylor's lab, when we had the opportunity to fabricate our own solar cells and learn about the solar fabrication process. The Arduino component, while interesting, did not seem to be relevant in the grand scheme of the course as this knowledge was never applied later on. I can understand the desire to provide some baseline exposure to the basic technologies that go into solar implementation i.e. an Arduino serving as a meter for a small array, but this exercise was so isolated relative to the grander theme of the course that it was difficult for me to evaluate its practical value beyond just exposing students to the Arduino technology and language. Similarly, a lab unit on Solidworks was intended to follow suit as another technical component of the course, but this was never implemented due to time constraints. While I appreciated these practical additions to the course, the intention of which I believe was to create a more holistic approach to solar that fit in with Dr. Taylor's engineering background, I am not sure these inclusions added much value to the course as a whole. Lastly, I think that in coming years this course could benefit from improved organization and more clearly delineated expectations in terms of assignments, etc. Several assignments were introduced at the last minute, particularly the final project which was assigned with only four weeks left in the semester. While my group eventually turned in our project on time, this short time frame resulted in undue stress and severely limited time to thoroughly plan, conceptualize, and work through the engineering and design phase. Overall, I think this course has huge potential in the coming years, especially if a trip to Haiti or India could be established, but it also needs to be refined and reorganized into a more cohesive package.",
    "The strengths of the course were how it covered an incredible set of topics rated to renewable energy, and it final project that helped us apply these skills. The final project was a way to bring together all we've learned and we also practices a lot of skills to present engineering work and prototypes. Only way to strenghten the course would be if it was a bit more organized around the syllabus.",
    "This course was a mess. There was a syllabus that was completely thrown to the wayside, there was a lack of clarity regarding instructor expectations for students (e.g. the readings were never brought up during class, there was no grading rubric), and we would receive announcements about guest speakers and room changes the evening before class more often than not. The professor, while accomplished according to his CV, was completed disorganized. He showed up to maybe 2\/3 of the classes. His poor TA taught the rest of the courses by attempting to help us through learning how to code and use new programs. But our final projects didn't incorporate much if any of the skills the course intended to teach us. (Ex: arduino coding)",
    "The best aspects of the course were the labs and guest speakers. I enjoyed getting to participate in a hands-on way in the process of making organic solar cells, and all of the guest speakers brought good real-world perspectives into the classroom. The client-based final project was also useful and provided some good experience, but felt a bit rushed taking place only in the last few weeks of the semester. I think the biggest weakness of the course was organization. In many cases I wasn't sure what to expect in class on a given day until receiving an email the evening before class. It was also not clear in some cases what the overall course of study was and how specific activities related to broader learning objectives. The syllabus handed out at the beginning of the semester also wasn't really followed and deviations from it weren't really explained.",
    "Strengths; A good course in understanding solar technologies An interesting concept- developing countries Presence of experts or professionals doing actual work through guest lectures The projects has potential of growing into social ventures that address existing problems\/needs Weaknesses; Not well organized Did not focus to build particular skill but had a broader set of skills that were not easy to harmonize The objectives was not clearly met"

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend this course for those interested in solar and wanting a course that emphasizes the design process.",
    "Yes! Great course",
    "yes, this class has great content but it is new and yet to settle and become well organized. It will get there!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student interested in energy. It can only get better, and I would take it again just for the speakers.",
    "The course is one of the unique courses at Yale as it has a design component and focuses on renewable energy. The course covers a lot of topics and skills and has assignments that include fabricating real organic solar cells in Dr. Taylor's lab, sizing the capacity for a solar system in developing countries, using Arduino to build an energy meter, and learn how to finance renewable energy systems. The course also had a final project that brought all these together and we presented our projects at the Yale Alumni in Energy Conference. If you're excited about these take the course.",
    "No. It was clear the professor's heart wasn't in educating the students on how to tackle the issue of energy poverty in developing countries. After the first couple weeks, the course ceased to be relevant to this topic. The lectures weren't very engaging, nothing was structured, some of the guest lecturers seemed pulled in ad-hoc (i.e. they weren't scheduled in the syllabus). Some were fine, but others were completely unrelated to what we're working on. Overall, the themes and concepts weren't well-tied together and everything had an ad-hoc feel to it. I understand that new courses require some learning but this was completely unprofessionally taught.",
    "I think the course has a lot of potential, and I did learn some useful concepts, but I think it needs to be more organized and structured more cohesively. It was not clear how many of the concepts introduced in the course related to each other. For example, I enjoyed learning how to use Arduino and a few basics of the C coding language, but these concepts were never applied to any other area of the course, and their relevance to work in the field of renewable energy was not really explained.",
    "Given it was the first time the class held,it is fair that it could have not been the most perfect class but with improvements this course is a good course in understanding the energy access challenges in developing countries and how students can use the skills learned in class to develop technologies that can address the same. The outcome of the projects are unimaginable."
