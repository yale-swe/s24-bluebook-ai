   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this particular instructor of Fren140, Katrien Wynant. She is a dynamic instructor. She shows her enthusiasm in the classroom everyday, and this keeps the students engaged in the learning process. She has keen grasp of French grammar, and she teaches it with great clarity. She also encourages discussion of the literary works assigned, thereby providing students with many opportunities to improve their speaking skills in class.",
    "French 140 was great. The French department has done a good job of making a syllabus that covers a wide range of material. You read a lot in this course (6 or so short stories, 2 books) and watch 4 films. There is also a ten minute oral presentation, but this really isn't bad. I would especially recommend Professor Katrien Wynant. She is kind and helpful and will go out of her way to help you succeed in the class.",
    "Fun class. At this level, reading and speaking is more fun than a chore. Take this class with Katrien if you can. She's awesome.",
    "It's a challenging course which helps improve your oral and written abilities. I would certainly recommend it to another student, simply for the fact that he\/she would learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who aims to reach a proficient level of French, but I would caution that you have to be willing to attend class five days a week and complete daily homework.",
    "Mdme. Wynant is the best teacher to have. The class itself is very good, and demanding enough to keep you on top of the material, maintaining borderline fluency.",
    "Great way to improve your language skills.You read, speak, write in French at a higher level and it's amazing to be in the class!",
    "If you want to learning french in school, sure. But language learning is mostly practice I feel, and it would probably be more efficient to study abroad. But everyone knows this. So if you're going to take french here, take it, although some of the material could be more interesting (too much diversit\u00e9, sac de billes at the end is kind of a pain)",
    "Absolutely fantastic course if this is your level.I probably learned more in a month in this class than in a year in high school french."
