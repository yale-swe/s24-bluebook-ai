    "20 hours or more (depending on the week). Honestly it took more time than all of my classes combined. Going into the class I thought it would be more interactive, organized, and I would be able to focus the independent work on areas outside of the Middle East. However, the class became completely dedicated to how Lebanon is responding to Syria (not really focused on what is going on in Syria). On top of a lot of reading, we had to do weekly case studies, an independent research proposal, a group project, as well as submit questions to the guest speakers. While it was interesting to read reports for the case study and had the opportunity to focus on a topic related to our interests (as it turned out the case study was only focused on the Syrian crisis), in order to write-up an adequate summary of what is going on it took a lot of time and effort to read through multiple reports, news articles, research, etc to find relevant information. For both the individual and group projects, it was very time-intensive to do research and it ultimately seemed to be a waste because of the hypothetical nature of the assignments.At the beginning of the course it seemed as if we would be able to work with organizations (at least for the group project), and while I understand the logistic restraints, having very little guidance and support made the task very challenging. Although the professor really did try to provide feedback, without being a practitioner working in humanitarian settings, he would often change his mind and he didn't really know how to give relevant advice all the time but rather ask you more questions. In terms of coming up for questions for the guest lectures, that wasn't too time consuming. However, reading the relevant articles to come up with informative questions was. Additionally, for the most part, many of our questions were not even answered because the lectures spent a lot of time describing their story working in humanitarian aid rather than discussing things relevant to the class. Thus, it was another busy-work task.",
    "Weekly readings took about 3 hours and case studies took 3-5 hours. The group project was manageable, but the individual project was a huge amount of work.",

    "In a couple of years I think this class will be great. It is wonderful that professors are able to follow their passions. However, as it is now the professor is experimenting. I did not choose other public health programs specifically because I did not want to be a guinea pig and that's what I felt like in this class. I am more than happy to dedicate time to courses, I do think you get out what you put in. However, for this class I felt like I put in a ton of effort and spent a long time working on all of the assignments (as outlined above) but didn't really get much out of the course. The guest lectures were interesting, but we would spend hours reading articles and not even discuss them. We also had a guest lecture almost every week (sometimes twice a week) so there was no consistency in the course. I really wanted to learn about conducting research or working in humanitarian settings and while I was able to hear some anecdotal stories, I'm not leaving the course knowing much more than what I did when I came in...that there are methodological challenges associated with conducting research in crises affected settings. When we spoke about the articles we read we were able to have a discussion. However, when a guest lecture just came and spoke to us we just sat and listened. If you wanted it to be more of a seminar class dedicated to guest lectures it should be that. However, the class was very different from what it seemed it would be during shopping period. During shopping period it seemed like we would focus the course on Syria but be able to explore other conflict-affected areas. However, even the individual case study became dedicated to Syria. To be frank, we didn't even talk about Syria all that often. Mostly we discussed how Lebanon dealt with it. It was disappointing to put in as much time and effort as I did and not get that much out of it.",
    "I really enjoyed the speakers and I found it helpful to submit questions in advance. I thought the reading assignments were excellent and covered a wide range of topics that I found interesting, but they were a lot to keep up with. The group project was valuable, but the timing of that and the individual project were a little too close together to derive the full benefit. In the future, it would be helpful to consider either more closely aligning the subjects of the case study, group project, individual project and individual presentation or reworking the timelines of the assignments.",
    "This is the first year this course is being offered, and I understand there are some kinks to work out still. Overall, I would say the topics were very interesting, and the guest speakers gave a great perspective on things. At times, however, the course was repetitive, and the actual nature of the course changed a lot from what was described in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester. Rather than focusing on violence, conflict and public health as a whole, we only focused on the Syrian conflict. I would have liked to have seen more topics covered in this class, with a broader range of conflicts (both historical and current) covered. It would've been nice to cover other current events as well, such as whats happening in Kenya or Nigeria. I also thought the workload was way too high, and at times it was impossible to balance all the requirement of this course with other papers, exams, etc. While there was helpful feedback on all assignments, there were no grades and whatever grade is assigned at the end will be a complete surprise.",
    "Since this was a new course, I expected a lot of flexibility and some experimentation in terms of course structure. Overall, I think the discussion-based sessions worked very well, especially when they were student-led. Some of the discussions had in class were some of the most insightful conversations I've had at YSPH. Guest lecturers were variable, but overall I enjoyed the classes that centered around debate\/discussion more. One of the biggest strengths of the class was the group project presentations at the end of the course--the panel of judges that provided feedback were not only extremely helpful, but also unusual. It is rare to receive practical, experience-driven feedback from those who have worked in the field, and the panel raised great questions. This gave the course an additional practical perspective that is missing from many global health courses at YSPH. Some weaknesses of the course included the workload. Coming up with questions for each guest lecture ahead of time, while ensuring that students did some of the readings, was overall not very helpful. Some guest lecturers did not answer many questions and others simply read questions and answered them like a Q&A session. Since the questions were pre-formed (and sometimes lecturers deviated from the topics that were expected) it made discussion feel forced at times. Having people come up with questions for maybe a 20 minute period after the lecture itself would be a better option. Additionally, the individual project and group projects seemed to have more overlap than was originally intended, since both ended up being hypothetical research projects. It would be better to differentiate between the two assignments, and perhaps slide deadlines around so the individual project is due at the middle of the course and the group project is due at the end. This would prevent the huge buildup of work for the course throughout April, which made it difficult to keep up. Lastly, the course had many good ideas that were not fully realized. The idea of using the forum for discussion was a good one, but students did not end up discussing topics via this medium. The case studies were also an informative assignment, but felt very separate from the rest of the class. Perhaps having a class session devoted to each person giving an overview of his or her case after the assignment is complete would help integrate this more--this could be an interesting learning experience. Additionally, if the course is to be focused solely on the Middle-East in future years, this should be reflected in the syllabus or course outline. Some students expected more coverage of Africa or Latin American conflicts and were disappointed when case studies were limited to Syria.",
    "I really loved the beginning of the course and didn't like the second half. On the whole though, I would say I thought this was an amazing course although I think I'm in the minority. Here are a few comments: 1. The second half of the course had A LOT of potential. This half mostly consisted of having guest speakers come in or skype in to talk to us. These speakers are experts in their field and true GREATS. But, they were horrendously prepared for the presentations and were not used for what they really could have done. Most of the speakers ended up giving more of a career talk than anything, which gets old really quickly. I think a much more effective use of the speakers would be to have everyone in the class read ONE study or intervention that they did and then spend the session walking through the study in detail. Instead of spending 40 minutes introducing ourselves, let's go through the process of conducting research in conflict settings with the people who know it best and have really worked there. 2. This class was really way too much work at the end. It was very bottom heavy meaning that all of a sudden we had three different long assignments due in one week, then two more the next week. I liked what Kaveh was trying to do with the case studies but I think the execution was poor and overall just ended up with me writing whatever just to have something to turn in rather than taking the time to really do it well. Plus, most of the information to really go in depth in these issues is NOT very readily available, which severely limits our ability to write great briefs. 3. The interactive session of an outbreak of Hepatitis in a refugee camp was excellent and should be repeated several times.",
    "My overall assessment of this course is good. I learnt a lot about the health issues of conflict affected people and research methods in humanitarian situations. The weaknesses of the course were: it was focusing only on one group of people(Syrian refugees) and course Syllabus was frequently updated.",
    "I think this course was a great intro to violent conflict and humanitarian crises. it was very interesting having so many well-informed guest speakers. In terms of weaknesses, the deadlines for projects were too fluid, and the structure of the course was lacking a bit. In the future, a syllabus with strict guidelines would be helpful. Overall, good class!",
    "Strengths: multifaceted and engaging content\/syllabus structure; phenomenal discussion due to small class size with varied backgrounds; amazing professor; use of outside speakers (!!! Just about all of them.); opportunities to also engage\/learn outside of class (HRIC & IRIS) Weaknesses: towards the end of the semester we were not as doing as much discussion on the papers being read as i would have liked (felt like I was doing all this great reading but then would come to class to talk about myself and not gain more knowledge); final proposal felt rushed and would have also liked to see an example-- i am much more familiar with Gates\/R01-- and it almost felt like we were just answering questions rather than a stand-alone grant application; case study was interesting but perhaps some of the topics could not be accurately followed\/updated over the course of the semester and every two weeks; would have liked to see better feedback and discussion generated from group projects\/proposals Improved: only do two presentations per day (might need to increase group size, but this might not be a bad idea since my group was 2 people); start individual project earlier and provide examples-- to make this not as overwhelming, could perhaps try to link into the case study project; really take the time to prep each speaker that was coming-- we usually wasted ~20-40 minutes just going over our names\/projects\/study areas, when I just wanted to chat! perhaps structure it better in terms of 20 min to present\/1 hour for discussion (and have us read their papers so we can actually discuss with them!) i.e. maybe for next year, you can get Libby to chat with the class on the day that we have read her papers. would really add to the richness of the course!",
    "It was an interesting topic, but there was no real direction in the course--which may have been because the course is new. However, there was a lot of expectations of self-learning and questions were not directly answered. Even upon completing the course, I still have very little knowledge on Syria and research methods."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh is great and has done a lot of amazing work in public health. As a professor, he is willing to meet with students to discuss their projects. However, he's still learning about Syria and conflict affected settings. I do feel that the information Kaveh wants to teach about is important, but he needed to have flushed out the details more before trying to teach this course. It started off seeming very promising (i.e. we would be able to work with organizations) but that fell through. It also seemed as if he would change his mind about deadlines and what he wanted from students. He did admit that he is learning too, and that is fine, but he didn't necessarily take students' feedback into account. The majority of the class was guest lectures that weren't really relevant and even though the majority of the students said it was too much work (either to the TF or through the course evaluation) the amount of work never subsided.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Great use of different learning styles to engage students, responsive to students and extremely enthusiastic.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0It's clear that Kaveh is very passionate about this subject, and has a keen interest in integrating academic research with humanitarian aid. At times, I felt that he was learning with us, and that the course was very disorganized. Sometimes his feedback would contradict itself, and it was impossible to find some of the answers to the questions he would ask, and although he encourages contacting outside resources, the answers were not always there.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Kaveh was very enthusiastic and brought lots of good ideas to the course. His insight was appreciated and I think the course will get more organized over time. He did a good job facilitating discussion and brought up great questions for students to consider, which was a major strength.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0I am sure that several students will say that Kaveh is not an expert in this field and really should not be teaching this course. I disagree. Although I agree that this is not Kaveh's area of expertise, being a great teacher is not about knowing the material very well. I would much prefer having someone who is great at facilitating discussion, like Kaveh, than have someone give a lecture. In the first half the course, I was in love with this class because of the amazing discussions we would have as a class. I think a better model for incorporating expertise would be what I described above, but I think also having the guest speakers facilitate discussion rather than just talking would be excellent as well.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0He was inviting guests including refugees and people engaged in humanitarian activities which helped us learn from their own experiences. Also, in addition to the classroom activities, he was providing us with helpful links and resources relevant to the course. Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Absolutely phenomenal. While not his first area of expertise, Kaveh showed such a passion for the subject and managed to intertwine his knowledge and experience into the subject as a supplement to all of the amazing speakers (friends!) that he got to come to class. Aside from his teaching, Kaveh was an amazing mentor over the course of the semester, specifically emailing me opportunities to get further engaged and involved. It is clear that he truly cares about all of his students, about getting us to actually learn AND APPLY our knowledge, and I can honestly say that he is my favorite professor at YSPH so far.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Very nice and open to meeting with students."

    "In five-years I think it will be great. Until then, you need to be prepared for a lot of work. It is also very hypothetical. Looking back I would have taken a different class. I just dont feel like I learned enough to make the work-load warranted.",
    "I'm excited that this class was offered this semester and hope that it is offered again in the future, as there really isn't anything else like it at YSPH. It was a more demanding class than I expected because it covered such a wide range of topics, but I personally found it to be worthwhile. Still, I would recommend that the assignments be altered a bit (either the subject, timelines or both) because I believe it was probably a lot more effort than the professor had intended, especially for people new to the subject.",

    "Overall, one of the top 5 courses I have taken in college\/graduate school. Highly recommend.",
