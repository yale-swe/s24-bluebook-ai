    "This is, quite naturally, the point to look into methods and research.",
    "Yes. Course was a good introductory into research methods.",
    "I believe the course was very useful at this time of the educational curriculum (MED curriculum). However, I think that a more clear distinction between this course and the main MED thesis is needed, at least at the beginning of the semester.",

    "Considering the varying interests of all the students I thought the class did a good job in weaving together a common narrative. The assignments were meaningful for my individual research - although I was not able to keep up with the exact pace that the asignments were setting for the research work. Focusing on Venturis' work was an exciting extra spice by the side of the individual research projects.",
    "Readings were helpful. Assignments could be more varied, allowing students to explore different techniques and styles of writing and research to find the voice that is most appropriate for their topic.",
    "The course was very interesting firstly because it was very flexible and managed to accept changes and opinions to the syllabus during the semester, and secondly because it was a chance to share and discuss the material raised by everyone through the research projects; the latter characterizes more design studios than theory classes, and therefore it was very helpful. The course was also exciting because of the guests involved during the semester, from dolores hayden to denize scott brown.However, I think that there was not a clear statement on the format and the structuring of the content for the final assignement. The papers assigned during the semester didn't help for the formulation of a statement for the final research, because forced the student to work on topics which wouldn't necessarily inform the broader project.I think a combination of more project-focused assignements with a more intense discussion on the research project with the instructor and the class would have been a more helpful strategy.Furthermore, since the course was about methodologies of research, I think that a more clear distinction and understanding of case-studies of these different methods applied to architecture would have been applied. I had the feeling that the discussion on methods was more generic than focused on disciplinary or interdisciplinary work.It would have been useful to understand the distinction of qualitative and quantitative research in architecture. The usage of anthropology, ethnography or at the other hand of statistics and geographical mapping.",
    "good",
    "Although the course is predicated on being self-directed by the student as a way to research areas of interest, some of the proposed assignments seemed to be rather extraneous to these efforts. The course used the Venturi's a model for their methods of research, which I found valuable. It also great to be very invested in each fellow student's area of research. Prof. Britton structured the class as an open forum in which great dialogue between the various students was fostered. The class brought together MArch's and MED's which made for a interesting dynamic.",
    "I think it was a great idea to bring in guests and look to the Venturi's as \"case study\" for methods and research. I think that although it was a great experience to look to things outside our individual projects, in some ways the time spent took away from our progress with our own projects. In many ways this could be a course load issue that might just apply to the M Arch students."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to learn about research methods and get help in pushing my own research forward. I thought there could have been even more discussion on specific methods. At the same time, the class definitely helped me focus on my reserach.",
    "I expected to get regular feedback on my research topic and refine it over the course of the semester. The course lived up to these expectations.",
    "This course helped me to see my research from different perspectives, and therefore I'm very satisfied with the work done.",
    "My expectations were met for the most part. I had slightly different ambitions coming into the class which often resulted in Prof. Britton and I not necessarily \"seeing eye to eye\" but ultimately we were both flexible enough to meet both of our expectations. I very much approached the class as a way to pursue some introductory research into several topics that tended to be evident in much of my studio work, but ultimately chose to focus on developing just one of the areas of interest.",
    "Because this course was about individual projects, I had a lot of expectations for my own individual project that I don't feel I reached. In terms of the course though, in many ways it exceeded my expectations. The discussions we had about all our individual projects were great and visiting the Venturi's was a great experience. The \"pin-ups\" were great with very insightful guest critics."

   "comments": [
    "This course better helped me understand my position in regards to my research topic.",
    "This course was highly valuable because of the engaging and helpful dialogue between the students of the seminar. The seminar was small enough to establish a familiarity with each other which allowed us to be quite candid and critical, ultimately yielding more focused, succinct, and intelligently informed topics of research. Prof. Britton was definitely responsible for allowing such a productive dialogue to evolve because she was constantly re-calibrating the syllabus and was flexible enough to accommodate the heavy course load of the MArch students in the seminar.",
    "This course was incredibly valuable to me."

   "comments": [
    "Both the teacher and the TA did a great job in keeping the discussions lively. Moderation (and setting time limits for presentations etc.) during discussions could have been more effective.",
    "Great discussions. More feedback on written assignments would be very helpful. TA was very helpful.",
    "Especially the instructor was very available and helpful. The TA was very much present in the organization of the course and his work has been remarkable.",
    "Both the instructor and the TA were helpful in provoking conversation and question regarding student topics. They were critical in trying to hone and focus the topics to be grounded in historical, material evidence. At times I think it would have been more helpful if the instructor were a bit more open and helpful at directly students to related or affiliated topics or sources.",
    "I think that in many ways we all had the same problem - students and teacher alike - I think we all bit off more than we could chew. I thought the course would be more focused on individual research than on the discussions, interviews, exhibitions and visitors. That said, I learned a lot."

   "comments": [
    "The course could be accelerated so that both MED students and non-MED students were given an equal chance to develop their topic. The course seemed targeted toward the slower pace of the MED program instead of to the single semester that non-MED students were dedicating to their research topic.Guest speakers from other, non-architetural programs might give insight into alternate research methodologies.",
    "1. suggest a more time-focused and cutting-edge researchable question already from the beginning.2. suggest a more clear information on different methodologies applicable to research on architecture and the built environment.3. suggest the delivery of the final assignmente at least two weeks before the final deadline, so to have discussions in class and more time and availability to understand every singular project in deep.",
    "I think that the course should always have a mixture of MED and MArch students because I often feel that the MED's are marginalized and aren't nearly as involved as they could be with the other degree programs. This seminar afforded me the opportunity to not only understand their specific interests, but also to become good friends with each of them to the degree that they have become helpful confidants when confronted with questions relating to their areas of expertise.",
    "I think it is amazing that we were introduced to so many things, but maybe if it was just about exposure on that end rather than assignments for those meetings with guests. Maybe if each meeting we met for the first half to introduce to these other things and the second half discussed our own projects."
