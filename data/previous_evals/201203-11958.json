    "#1 impression: Madame Sherak is AMAZING. She is veritable force of nature -- always brimming with humor, enthusiasm, energy, encouragement, and kindness. Not a second is wasted in her class -- everything is aimed at improving your French. Yet she makes this otherwise laborious course immensely fun. She is one of, if not the, most talented teacher I have ever had the privilege to have.So, if you want to learn French, take it! And take it with her! That said, it's no easy A. To get an A- or B+, you're still going to have to do a LOT of work, at least if you haven't had French before. This is especially true since there are people in the class (annoyingly) who have studied French for multiple years in high school so true novices start at a disadvantage.Suggestions for success:-- Pay close attention to the test outlines she sends out each week. Study the stuff that is on the outlines intensely and don't waste time studying everything else.-- Go to her office hours every week. She will practice grammar, oral production, etc. with you one-on-one. I can not recommend this highly enough, even if you are acing the class.-- Bond with your classmates.-- Set a schedule early in the semester for when you will do each activity. For example, decide that you will watch each new lesson before every M\/W\/F class.-- DO NOT FALL BEHIND!!!!",
    "French 125 is a lot of work, but it's not unmanageable. We do three chapters per week, and are tested on those chapters once a week. It is a lot easier if you've taken another language before, but I think anyone could do it. If you don't want to spend a longer time doing the same thing, then this class is definitely the right choice. Also, Madame says that you should only take two other classes, but if you want to you can manage four classes",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who is interested in learning French.A great introduction to French. The French-in-Action method is really fun and really effective. You leave this course feeling comfortable with intermediate-ish conversational French.",
    "French 125 is simply incredible. Back in August, I never would have believe that I would be as comfortable with French as I am now. The completely oral Capretz method, although somewhat trying at first, has allowed my speaking and listening skills to take off, and reading and writing naturally follow (and are emphasized through weekly essay writing). It's a definite sacrifice of time, but if you're interested in really learning French, I highly recommend it."
