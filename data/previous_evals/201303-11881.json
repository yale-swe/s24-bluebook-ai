    "I would. I learned a lot and found that it was a great balance between challenging and possible. Professor Edwards had some drawbacks as a teacher, however I felt that she made up for it in her strengths.",
    "Astronomy 220 is a fun, engaging entry into all of the astro disciplines, and it's a very manageable work load and none of the math is difficult, so even non-majors should not have any nervousness about enrolling in this class rather than any of the lower-numbered courses. The first two units of this course are about stars, galaxies, evolution of those, etc. and everything is very straightforward and relatable and intriguing. The third unit, cosmology, is very abstract, and we were asked to just accept a lot of things as fact without having the mathematical ability to justify cosmologists' conclusions for ourselves, so the third unit was frustrating to most of our class.I would recommend this class to other students, but be prepared that while lectures are fun and energetic, the lecture slides themselves are very disorganized and very haphazadardly put together (think: image posted on top of text, unreadable colors, etc.). Also, Professor Edwards is a much better teacher and explainer of concepts in a one-on-one setting (questions after class, office hours, etc.) than necessarily in class.",
    "Yes. Learning about Galaxies and Cosmology and the physical processes that govern the universe is something I would highly recommend to anyone. There are frequent in-class discussions and the lectures are interesting.",
    "Astronomy 220 01 is a fascinating class, especially if you have never taken astronomy. I would definitely recommend it. I came in to the class trying to fill a distributional requirement, but it became one of my favorite classes. It has very much changed the way I view the universe as well. There were times I was frustrated with the lack of organization from the teacher in the form of poor instructions, bugs in the programs we used, etc., but overall I enjoyed the course and recommend it.",
    "Astronomy 220 covered astronomical measurements, special relativity, properties of stars and galaxies, stellar and galactic formation, and up to the most recent cosmological theories. I would certainly recommend this class to another student; the material was intriguing and taught in an exciting, understandable way.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale! Dr. Edwards is an excellentlecturer and really cares about her students. The workload was manageable, and the observation project was really cool. If you have a decent physics and calculus background, the quantitative reasoning aspect shouldn't be too bad. A lot of big concepts are explained mathematically, though, so if you don't like math, this class might be a bit challenging."
