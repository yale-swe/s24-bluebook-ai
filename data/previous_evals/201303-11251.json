    "Only for arch majors",
    "Overall, this has been my favorite studio as an architecture major. The projects progress from abstract to concrete while emphasizing actually building things.",
    "Probably the best studio you'll take. There's a lot more freedom, and Turner's the absolute best. The workload is also less than past semesters, however we still had much more developed projects because our work wasn't being trashed every week (unlike, say, junior spring). Listen to Turner and Adam, because they really want to help you further your own idea.",
    "This course is mandatory but definitely one should feel lucky to have the oportunity to take.",
    "Best studio you'll have.They genuinely care about you. Appreciate it.",
    "Best architecture studio yet. The assignments were excellent and fun, and never seemed pointless like in other studios I could name (**cough junior spring cough**). Turner and Adam are fantastic - their criticisms are clear and thoughtful, and they never try to impress their styles on you. It does get a bit overwhelming to produce three things a week; a lot of stuff is self-driven, don't let yourself slip. But overall, a lovely experience.",
    "Well, you have to take it if you're in the Design track. It's a fun studio, more chill, more sleep. But no computers allowed.",
    "Turner and Adam are BOMB. They challenge your assumptions about architecture and encourage you to develop your own crazy ideas. I enjoyed this class. It's easy to put things off since Turner and Adam are so easygoing, but you'll be happiest with your work if you continue putting in the time and energy to develop and produce."
