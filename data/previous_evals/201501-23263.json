    "I would recommend the class to people who have never taken the class if they need the requirement. It is a lot harder than Span 110",
    "Highly recommend SPAN 120. It's an excellent course and gets students a very good foundation. I was particularly impressed by the level of conversation and understanding I achieved by the end of this course; understanding Spanish conversations in English-speaking TV shows was actually normal for me.",
    "Tedious and intensive but worth it to improve Spanish speaking skills",
    "Spanish is a really fun language to take, and L2 although it does focus on grammar is still really fun. Maripaz is a wonderful teacher and you'll learn a lot if you take L2 with her!",
    "Quick jump from L1. Need to review your own material constantly to build on what you know & learn more. Become independent. Rewarding to see Spanish improve. Would recommend to those interested in learning the language regardless of how easy or difficult it is"
