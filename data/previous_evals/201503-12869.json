   "comments": [
    "Essentially only first year physics graduate students take the course. Would not recommend otherwise, unless one has an intrinsic interest in classical mechanics.",
    "1st year graduate students have to take it. If you are a senior undergraduate planning to go to graduate school, this is a great course to get a potential requirement out of the way.",
    "PHYS 500 is an intermediate walk through of the basis for all of physics. It makes many connections to quantum mechanics and allows you to directly use the tools learned in the math methods course. Unless you already know all of the material very well, it is a necessity. Highly recommended for both its breadth and depth.",
    "I would say that as far as the material is concerned, there is nothing that exciting in the course, but that there are a lot of valuable techniques that apply to later courses.",
    "This course is an overview of the standard areas of advanced mechanics, with a smattering of extra tropics. I found it useful and worth my while; the problem sets in particular were interesting and challenging when they might not have been.",
    "It was primarily a review of advanced undergraduate classical mechanics, but good to help prepare for the Qualifying Exam. It's a necessary graduate course, so my recommendation would not be too helpful.",
    "Definitely recommended! Gives the rigorous groundwork to classical mechanics at the graduate level. Important to know regardless of your field.",
    "Definitely, I recommend it to my fellow students. I think astro students should take more physics courses in general.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "It is a comprehensive classical mechanics course. You need computer power for some homework problems, do not hesitate to use it. You should take this class so you can learn how much effort went into understanding and solving a classical problem, and see the concepts' extensions to modern physics."

   "comments": [
    "It introduced me to topics in classical dynamics that I had not previously seen.",
    "This is the basis for all of physics, so it hasn't directly contributed to my research, but it certainly will.",
    "This was a required course, but being classical mechanics it had little direct influence on my research. I will note that often the problem sets seemed to be more algebra heavy than conceptually interesting. Often homework assignments were ~5% setting up the problem and 95% grinding through algebra (not even calculus).",
    "I loved investigating Lagrangians, normal modes, orbits, and dynamical systems more rigorously. I was able to see the connections between these primary topics with my own research.",
    "PHY500 Dynamics help to refresh my memory from undergrad school the knowledge of classical mechanics. The content it covers currently has little to do with my research, but will hopefully become useful when I dive more into the dynamics of dark matter subhaloes in my future research.",
    "It showed me the fine details of classical mechanics, and their cost as heavy calculation. I feel somewhat more open to connections to modern physics on conceptual level."
