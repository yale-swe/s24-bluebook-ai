    "it was the best organized field trip i've ever been on. Great balance of meetings with folks and time for ourselves to decompress and think about what we learned, and also to get to know one another.",
    "I really enjoyed our day with the USFS and the prescribed burn. Our \"cultural immersion\" with BBQ, the civil rights museum, and skeet shooting was also great.",
    "The course was extremely well organized. The instructor and TA did an incredible job of finding relevant site visits and covering material relevant and interesting to all students on the trip.",

Obviously this is more of a logistical challenge, it was just a shame to not be walking through the woods more while we were in such fantastic environments.",

These opportunities are a huge part of why I chose to do an MESc at Yale rather than a research university, and hope that this type of cross-disciplinary project is always possible. Thank you!!!",

The course provides exposure to a completely different means of managing forests than is implemented here in the northeast, an important thing for anyone interested in the field of large scale land conservation, forest finance, green energy, sustainable investment, and any related realms.",
    "Make sure you know who you will be visiting and with who you might want to network.",
    "write up notes after each day of who you met with, what your thoughts were, etc. Is a great resource down the road.",

    "This course is a great way to learn about the American South and to see a whole different world of forestry."
