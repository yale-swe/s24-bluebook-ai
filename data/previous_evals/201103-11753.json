    "If you want to learn French and become fluent, this is a great place to start. If you are just looking to fill a requirement, I suggest an easier language.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, especially with Professor Ngame! He is awesome and extremely helpful, and the class is interactive and fun.",
    "Yes! This is a great and very organized course that really helps you learn French quickly.",
    "I would recommend French 110 to another student 110%. It was my favorite class! This is also coming from someone who is not very good at it. I had fun in every class and everyone (the students and the professors) were amazing! The tests every week could be frightening, but Professor Ngame made sure you knew your stuff so you didn't fail all of them.",
    "The course is designed for students with no knowledge of french at all. The class is a bit fast paced but by the end of the course, you will be amazed by the amount of french you know.",
    "Yes, I would recommend French 110. Although it is very intensive and difficult, the course is worth the work and you will learn how to speak French much more quickly than you would expect."
