   "comments": [
    "The progress and depth my Chinese ability has gained in this class and year of Chinese is incomparable. The teachers are incredible and the topics very interesting with relevant vocabulary to the fields I want to use my Chinese in. It is hard work, but you honestly become used to it, and you know all along that it's making you improve. The class is also comprised of so many small assessments that any one assignment is never overwhelmingly stressful. I definitely recommend this to people who want to continue their Chinese learning.",
    "would recommend to anyone who is serious about continuing Chinese at Yale",
    "If you're thinking about taking this course you're either coming from L3-L4 or you're coming back from Light. I did Light, and I can assure you, you will be disappointed with this course. It's a cool course and you learn a lot of new vocabulary and grammar but it definitely won't help you with your speaking ability. YOUR SPEAKING WILL REGRESS. You literally just listen to them lecture for like 40 minutes and you'll get like 5 seconds of speaking practice when they stop and ask you a question. It's also really suited for econ or journalist majors, all of the course material is about economics and media relations. I'm an engineering major who really wants to work in China some day and I didn't find anything we learned to be super helpful. It's also an ABSURD AMOUNT OF WORK. I'm talking quizzes everyday, presentations every week on top of test and oral test. So if you're an Econ or global affairs major that wants to work in China some day, this class is definitely worth it, otherwise try taking another language.",
    "Great teachers and pretty much what you'd expect as continuation of the CHNS sequence.",
    "A time-intensive, more interesting level of Chinese. You will only continue getting better, so I would definitely recommend it to those with a firm interest in building their language skills.",
    "Overall, CHNS 151 was a surprising jump fro CHNS 150, in terms of difficulty and workload. I would still say that both CHNS 150 and 151 are not nearly as intense as 110 and 120 (which have the same number of credits: 1.5). However, 151 wasnt the same old. An example is the True and False parts of pre-class quizzes - for once, many people were getting 7s and 8s on the quizzes rather than the perpetual 10s. A few of the online quizzes became very arbitrary, subjective and challenging. The skit at the end is fun and a good idea but maybe shouldnt be 2.5% of the grade, which is much more than most other course elements. The course definitely needs to rethink its grading scheme especially in the written exams where there is a very high penalty for getting a few small things wrong. Strengths: -CHNS 151 is intense and involves a lot of active interaction and discussion in class -The grading is distributed across many, many different components so it is always possible to recover and do well -The topics are more mature and interesting than CHNS150 and the skill displayed during class presentations is very high -Slides and presentations were used more effectively in 151 than 150 Weaknesses: -The class often feels like memorizing a lot of vocabulary words without actually learning how to use them or engage in useful discussions -Class discussions often spend too much time on the books boring content than on our own opinions and beliefs. Outside the class, the book content is useless. Less time should be wasted memorizing phrases from the book in class -The exams actively use characters we cant recognize and words we dont understand. This is part of the immersion but is ultimately counter-productive in an exam. There is enough material to test - stick to what we have studied. -The book is very poorly written and does not explain any major grammatical points or word usage differences. These are often discussed in class but the book should contain them as well; the book is pretty useless for preparation otherwise -The pre-class quizzes are sometimes unfair because they expect you to have mastered things that have not been taught in class yet -The scoring is generally very generous but can often be arbitrary and unexplained, especially on the essays -The workload for CHNS151 is significantly higher than 150. The increase was not made clear at the beginning of the semester and new tests and assignments were added arbitrarily even though it was still a 1.5 credits course"
