    "I would say the class is a great class for anyone interested in themes of the title: History, Photography, and Memory. It's very interdisciplinary and changes the way you see the world, particularly visual culture. Laura is an AMAZING instructor and if you're thinking of working with her, she definitely does not disappoint! She's a great discussion facilitator and very sharp. You also get a great survey of some of the arts and visual culture resources at YUAG and Yale in general. I would definitely recommend the class to another student but with the warning about the size and mix of grads and undergrads. I would probably also say that some classes are a just taken over by undergrads which is kind of a waste of time and you don't really talk about the readings each week. That's both good and bad because you don't really have to worry that much if you didn't get to the reading but also leaves less accountability for actually doing the readings which is probably one of the best parts of the class (in addition to Laura)."

    "This class was so valuable to me and my future studies. I hope to work with Laura again in the future. Firstly, the course readings were incredibly helpful in providing survey of the fields and showing some of the intellectual work coming out about photography and visual culture and memory. This is very useful as I hope to continue working in visual culture for my research. Secondly, the use of multi-media and different forms of intellectual\/artistic\/personal expression (besides just readings) was really exciting and helpful to me because it got me out of thinking about my own work (and the field) as only reading and writing. And finally, I think the most valuable part of the course was that it provided me with intellectual material and space to consider my own place in my own work. A lot of the readings we read were about the convergence of the personal and political, the social\/cultural\/historical with the individual, and it helped me develop a more personal, more introspective view of my own work.",
    "This course was incredibly helpful in developing a chapter in my thesis project. The readings and lessons learned in the course has deepened my appreciation for photography, as well as encouraged a critical analysis in historical, and contemporary, photography."
