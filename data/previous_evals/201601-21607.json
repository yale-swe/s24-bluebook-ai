    "Basically 132 with longer essays. Keep with it, you'll appreciate how much Chinese you've learned.",
    "Continuation of CHNS 132. It's a good course and builds on the foundation you get from the first semester. It'll be a faster pace and more stuff to keep up with, but having already gone through the first semester I felt that I already had a good sense of how to best study for this class.",
    "A solid class for improving reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. Liu Laoshi is great and Chan Laoshi, while new, fits right into the course. While the course is pretty time-consuming, it's manageable once you actually put the time into it. For those who were placed into L5 and want to take L4: it's not easy switching placements. You really really need to pester both the teachers and the administrators involved in Chinese language placement (it took about a week of frantic emailing for me). Of course, you need an actual reason for L4 placement - just wanting an easier courseload isn't enough. You need to demonstrate that you don't have a strong enough Chinese language background for L5 in some concrete manner.",
    "Take it! It's so good. Your chinese will improve so much and the teachers are so nice! I would say most people don't have a problem getting an A in the class. If your chinese background is not as strong, it will not be easy to get a good grade. I would expect around the same grade that you got in 132.",
    "It's a great, rigorous way to learn a lot of Chinese quickly. The pace is fast, and I often spend an hour or more per day studying for this class, but there are ample resources for you to succeed. It remains one of the most rewarding classes I've taken.",
    "A good continuation of Chinese for those with a strong speaking background already.",
    "This class has confirmed my suspicion that Yale's Chinese language program is one of the best in the nation."
