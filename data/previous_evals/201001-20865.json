    "This class would be appropriate for a wide range of students - it covered less known works of great Russian writers, so worked as both a deepening of knowledge for those already familiar with the famous works and as an introduction for those as yet unfamiliar. It covered a broad range of genres and media. The instruction was fantastic. I would certainly recommend this class to any student.",
    "would definitely recommend russian 603.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students both as a survey class on Russian realism and as a more specific course on cross-arts research. It was a well-balanced and well-organized seminar."

   "comments": [
    "The course was very helpful in deepening my knowledge of my interests - it taught me to work across different media, how to engage with both canonical and more obscure texts; the professors encouragement allowed me to better and more confidently express myself in front of a group of students. I am sure I will use some of what I have learned during my dissertation years.",
    "The course did deepen my knowledge about Russian realism, and was also useful as Professor Brunson brought up a lot of meta commentary on the discipline. The last seminar was a mini-conference with in-class presentations, which was a useful exercise."
