   "comments": [
    "If you're in freshman orgo, you need to take the lab. It was a lot of work for half a credit, and because everyone in freshman orgo lab is extremely driven, so you need to be perfect on lab reports. That being said, it was pretty fun, if a little tedious at times.",
    "It's not exactly mind blowing, but it wasn't terrible. The days before lab are stressful though! Lots of work.",
    "Fun! Take if you love chemistry! Be prepared for a lot of lab write-ups, and don't hesitate to ask questions.",
    "Not a hard lab.",
    "The workload is heavy and you only get half a credit, but the time you spend in lab is enjoyable. It provides a critical introduction to fundamental organic laboratory techniques, and I'm sure will provide a useful base of knowledge going forward. That said, your grade is VERY dependent on the TA you get. If you care about that sort of thing, shop around.",
    "If you're taking Freshman Orgo it's a co-req anyways. That aside, I think it's a good course. I thought this class was kind of fun. The lab reports involve work, and are graded very thoroughly, so pay attention to details outlined in your course packet!!! You will be docked points even for not putting your name and page number on EVERY page. Overall, Dr. DiMeglio is very nice, and I had a great TA.",
    "It's required, so just take it. It's not a particularly difficult class, but very time-consuming. Plan out your work in advance.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who does not have to take it. I didn't get much out of it and it's really a lot more work than a half credit class should be.",
    "CHEM 126L is compulsory for any student taking CHEM 124. I had no choice but to take it. The contents of this course have little to do with CHEM 124 and the lab reports are extremely time-consuming. It seems unfair to me that the course is only worth 0.5 credits, considering that we have to work for 4 hours a week in a lab. Every TA has different standards when it comes to grading, and each demonstrates different levels of knowledge of the subject, which makes the course even harder. It would have made more sense to take CHEM 126L with sophomore orgo.",
    "You learn several key chem lab techinques - extraction, distillation, infrared spectroscopy and thin layer chromatography. Then you do a couple of synthesis labs. The class work not that hard conceptually but it is very time consuming - I probably spent at least four hours on the longer lab reports.I recommend Chem 126 01 if you want a solid lab course to prepare you for future classes later on.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for all students interested in chemistry. Certainly there is no sense of taking organic chemistry without labs which allow students to experience the practical side.",
    "If you gotta take lab, you gotta take lab. Intro lab courses are never exactly thrilling, and your grade in this class is very much based on the organization of your lab reports, so make sure you number your charts and all that. It's frustrating, but it has to be learned at some point. Get it done.",
    "Unfortunately, the work you have to do for lab takes up just as much time, if not more, than the studying you would have to do for lecture. The last few labs you do for Freshman Orgo Lab will involve reaction mechanisms with which you are likely unfamiliar, since they will not have been covered in the lecture (yet). Lab may very well be your least favorite component of Organic Chemistry, but don't let it determine whether or not you take the class.",
    "I would certainly recommend Chem 126L. Dr. DiMeglio is extremely helpful and bright, and will help you groom your organic chemistry lab techniques. Though she makes few rounds through the lab, do not hesitate to ask her anything that may help you. The TAs are also very good in organic chemistry lab, as they are helpful and capable of explaining theory in terms you will understand. Don't hesitate to ask them questions to improve your laboratory technique.The workload is manageable for the most part. You will undoubtedly emerge from the course with a better understanding of organic chemistry lab techniques and theory.",
    "A good class but a lot of work. Take it if you love chemistry or you need to. Don't take it only to satisfy a lab requirement.",
    "Chemistry 126L is a supplement to freshman organic lecture. I found that sometimes the material in the two courses did not line up, which sometimes made lab class conceptually confusing. However, the procedures were not all that difficult and tended to give good results, which was rewarding.",
    "I definitely recommend this course because it goes so well with Freshman Organic Chemistry!",
    "This is a required class if you want to take Freshman Orgo so... Still though, it is a useful overview of techniques.",
    "Even though one has no real choice in whether to take this course or not along with freshman organic chemistry, I would still definitely recommend this course because it teaches many of the basic lab techniques necessary for scientific research. This course also provides you with deeper insight into the material taught in the lecture course.That said, the lab reports are time consuming and the grading is often incredibly nit-picky. I would recommend reading the guidelines available in the lab packet on how to write up assignments over and over again in order to receive full credit on assignments.",
    "It's not really a choice, you have to take this lab if you're taking Freshman Orgo, so yeah.",
    "The lab is a lot of work but a good introduction to college labs. It should be worth more than 1\/2 a credit, and hopefully this will change soon. It goes a bit ahead of Freshman Organic Chemistry, so it seems to have little in common with that course until the semester nears its end.",
    "Yes, its a very interesting and well paced lab.",
    "I personally loved orgo lab because I'm into the practical, hands-on kind of stuff. Most of the first semester labs introduced us to the standard orgo lab procedures and ways to characterize compounds. We applied these techniques in synthesis labs during the last three weeks, which were fun. Post-lab assignments \/ reports are not bad at all. Helpfulness of TA depends on who you get, but none of them are terrible (at least this semester). Also, lab is a 4 hour block but toward the end they take less than 3.",
    "If you're taking Orgo, then you might as well take lab.",
    "OrgoLab was my very first experience in a lab. And many kids that take this class already took lab in high school and they were much more prepared than I was. I didn't like the course because it is too much work. At the beginning, we just do the Experimental Procedures, which take, say, 1 hour when you are still learning how to do it. Then, you also have to submit the lab notes and mine were always sloppy. So, I usually rewrote them. And more close to the middle\/end of the semester, we also have to submit the Post-Lab, which are a very big part of our grade. It may take more than 3 hours. So, adding up everything, we have 4 hours of class + 1 hour of EP + 3 or more hours of Post Labs + Personal Study = over 10 hours\/week worth 0.5 credit --->totally unfair!!! It is too much stress for just 0.5. I know it is required, but if you cannot take it, dont. Dont be afraid to drop. Shop it and try to get the feeling if you are gonna like or not. I f you dont like the first class, it is NOT gonna get better. I almost cried of happiness after the final test. I am never going back to Science Hill again and I came to Yale to be a Chemistry Major... My TA did not speak English very well... if you dont like your TA, change your day. the TA is gonna be responsible for over 80% of your grade!",
    "Chem 126 was a lot of fun for me. Although it was a lot of work sometimes, overall, it was a good experience. It may be a little difficult for those in freshman organic chemistry students, because freshman organic chemistry introduces the mechanics of many of the reactions in the secondsemester. Unfortunately though, there seems to be no choice for those in freshman organic chemistry students regarding whether to take this course or not.",
    "I would definitely recommend recommend this course to a science student, but to others I would not because it is a lot of work for .5 credits and it is not worth it if you will not use what you learn. But I definitely liked it.",
    "Chem 126 lab was good. Depending on your TA, the grading may be easier or difficult. But the labs are fairly straight forward and easy to understand. We only have one full lab report over the semester plus other shorter lab writeups, so the work is definitely manageable. Take it with freshmen orgo.",
    "This is a tough course, especially for those taking freshman orgo with McBride, since we had not yet learned reaction mechanisms or substitution and elimination reactions by the time we covered them in lab. However, I found this course to be rewarding, and pretty fun if you're into the feeling-cool-because-you're-wearing-a-labcoat-and-setting-up-complicated-equipment kind of thing. The assignments take time, especially the post-labs, and they aregraded meticulously, but it's a pretty good course overall.",
    "Not gonna lie, this course will probably make you hate chemistry. CHEM 124a is great, but this lab class is full of pedantry and rubbish. The labs themselves are chemically interesting and pedagogically valuable, but the assignments for lab are a hell unto themselves (I rated this class as \"below average\"). Infuriatingly enough, on a five-credit schedule, this 0.5-credit class took up well over a third of the time I spent on assignments. That's absolutely ridiculous, in my humble opinion, and absolutely warranting of an indication that it requires \"much greater\" work than other classes. All that said, do not let this stop you from taking CHEM 124a (freshman o-chem lecture), because that course is sufficiently excellent as to allow one to overlook the severe flaws of this lab course.",
    "As you probably are aware, you have no choice in whether or not to take this course - it must be taken in conjunction with Freshmen Orgo. In addition, the course follows a virtually identical syllabus as that used in the Sophomore Orgo lab (with the exception of about two additional techniques not learned in 126L). So, like it or not, this lab is a must.However, DiMeglio (with Professor McBride who often pops in to check on the Freshman Orgo Lab groups), boasting a friendly and open presence in the lab room, makes this an enjoyable experience (the videos that she produced going over the basic techniques are often extremely helpful, and can often replace the required reading in the lab \"textbook\"). The TAs, though, are quite a different matter, and can range from one who gives mainly Bs and Cs on lab reports to one that almost exclusively gives As. Thankfully, the grading is solely based on completion of the lab reports and other assignments rather than actual results. Other than grading, some of the TAs have different backgrounds in chemistry, with mine being a Masters degree candidate in Womens, Gender and Sexuality Studies - forcing his students to virtually teach themselves.That being said, the workload for the course - once you become acquainted with how to prepare the Experimental Protocols and Lab Reports - is low. This lab is excellent in its design and provides a nice opportunity to meet other classmates, but quality will vary with the TA.",
    "This is an organic chemistry lab that helps students get used to the skills and build the foundations for synthesizing lab. I definitely recommend this lab, although the workload is quite tough.",
    "This is a good beginning lab course to take without having to relive the really boring labs of high school chemistry (i.e. calorimetry, titration). I learned a lot of new lab techniques and the nuances of writing lab reports. The lab was a lot of work, especially outside of lab, but overall not a bad lab to take if required. I enjoyed the experiments performed in the lab.",
    "The pace of this course is steady but not overwhelming and by the end of it you feel like you've accomplished a lot and you've become comfortable with some new lab techniques. Be prepared to spend fair bit of time (read as, four to eight hours) preparing for each session. I feel like this was an accurate reflection of the material covered in class, although perhaps not an accurate reflection of the course's half credit! It feels good when you're completely done with this class before reading week even starts. My only piece of advice is to read the course packet carefully when writing up your post labs!",
    "If you're taking freshman orgo, you have to take this lab. As with labs in general, it's something of a chore, but it is worthwhile and even enjoyable at times.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, although if taking Freshman Organic Chemistry, it's required.",
    "A great intro to lab work at Yale; a little hard at times but the techniques and written assignments start out easy and then build to form a real lab report. Anyway, if you take the freshman orgo lecture, Professor McBride will make you take the lab, so best enjoy it!",
    "You have to do it.",
    "This lab is usually mandatory for student taking Freshman and Sophomore Orgo, however I did find the experience educational and would recommend it.",
    "It is an effective survey course, outlining basic methods used in organic chemistry lab. I would recommend it, as I learned a lot.",
    "It's fine as long as you check over your reports to make sure you didn't make a stupid little mistake that'll cost you dearly. It is kind of cheap that on lab notes and other work you end up writing the same thing over and over sometimes. It's generally not a hard lab to understand, though be sure to look for pointers when things are a little hazy. Then you'll find it easy, though at first you'll be annoyed by the unnecessary repetition in writing the procedure in three different documents."
