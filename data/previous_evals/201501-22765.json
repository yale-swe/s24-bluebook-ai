    "A highly recommended course for anyone looking to learn more about the Middle East. I would definitely encourage one to have background knowledge on the region before taking this class (it is not an intro course and discussion can tend to be high-level and draw on previous knowledge) but for those of you that are familiar with the Middle East, I found that this course provided me with an altogether new--and worthwhile--perspective on the region.",
    "It's a solid course. Very interesting material, and it offers a varied view at imperialism and imperialist state building. That said, you will come out of this course with more questions than answers. You will gain a lot of knowledge about the history behind a lot of present day conflicts, but will be very confused as to what to believe at the end.",
    "A good overview, though I wish we spent less time on ISIS at the end. Though they're the most exciting news topic lately, state building in the ME is an ambitious topic that covers thousands of years of history, and while devoting so much time to contemporary topics was on trend, it's not necessarily the greatest use of time. However, well facilitated discussion and overall excellent course. The emphasis on maps in the course allowed students to piece together the geographic context in which events were unfolding.",
    "This class sounds cool, and the readings are interesting, but it lacks structure. It started out being fairly evenly undergraduate and graduate students but quite a number of undergraduates dropped the class and it was became dominated by graduate students. Felt more like a lecture at times than a seminar and the grading was erratic and confusing. Discussions were quite purposeless at times."
