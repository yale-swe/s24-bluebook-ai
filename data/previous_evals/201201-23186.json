    "Take this class! English 114 really forces you to write with clarity and purpose and it's amazing if you get the right instructor.",
    "Yes, I learned some new skills and ways of thinking and writing. Pick a section that you're interested in. 4 essays was not actually as big a time commitment as I had expected. It's not easy to get an A.",
    "Yes, to get a writing credit. I didn't feel like i became a \"Better\" writer, I just got more practice.",
    "I don't recommend it that much, take another writing credit",
    "Yeah definitely, its a good way to get a writing credit.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. IT WILL HELP YOUR WRITING.",
    "This is basically an intro to college writing class with a focus on a certain subject, in this case Madness and Civilization. The class is structured in way that eases us into writing essays for college. We had four major papers throughout the semester: three 4-5 page papers and one 9-10 research paper. At first it was difficult writing the papersbut by the end of the class I had a much better understanding of what it takes to write a successful paper. The research paper is on any subject you want relating to madness and generally Julia wasn't very restrictive. For example, I wrote my paper on the Hillsborough disaster involving two English soccer teams. Overall, I really enjoyed the class and I would recommend everyone to take a 114. My only advice is to choose a class focuses on a topic that really interests you since it is much easier to write about a subject that you find interesting.",
    "I liked my English 114 course but would only recommend it to another student if they really liked the topic. After a few months, you really beat the topic dead."
