    "Yes, I would recommend the class.",
    "The course will deepen your knowledge of economics theory and is the basis for other economics courses. It definitely worths taking.",

    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "Good, challenging, great material.",
    "Yes, definetly I recommend this course to others. The course is different from any of the textbook I know and quite unique in the sense that every topic in the lecture is closely connected with Michal Boozer's thinking style. I really liked the expansion\/applicatioin of consumer theory to the saving decision and labor market issues.",
    "Master level microeconomics. No surprises. Recommended!",
    "i would recommend it to a student that he hasnt done economics and macroeconomics before.",
    "Economics 545 not only solidifies the foundations of microeconomics, but also allowed one to appreciate some of those concepts via applications.Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches microeconomic concepts so that one could apply them and further appreciate them."
