    "I did not learn too much from this course.",
    "This course offered insight into the ethics of research and how unethical conducts could occur in the lab.",
    "I learned about ethics in the scientific community in more detail than I had previously studied it. I learned about specific case studies where scientists had behaved unethically.",
    "We learned about a lot of questionable ethical scenarios and some of the consequences for these people. It was useful to go over some of these scenarios to think about before beginning our own research.",
    "I think it was marginally helpful for thinking critically about ethics in research. There was little to no room for discussion, as the professor had all the right answers and was trying to fish them out of us. It would have been better if he were honest, and just said: this is how NSF wants you to think about this issue.",

    "Discussing various scenario's was very useful, and improved my understanding of ethics in science.",

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The only strength that this course has is that it provides a lot of trivia question answers at a bar. This course can be improved by actually discussing ethics in a philosophical manner, instead of the instructor shutting down every single answer that does not align with his own opinions. The pacing of the course is also extremely slow; we would be given reading assignments for a particular week and not discuss them until two sessions later.",
    "The course did well in offering real examples of research misconduct. The class often went past its end time.",
    "This course was best when it stuck to real life ethical scenarios. Sometimes hypothetical situations discussed seemed unrealistic.",
    "The course material was very good. Professor Parr was very engaging. Professor Parr claimed that he was going to structure this course as a discussion where everybody would participate. However, when people would make comments, he would usually hear them out, ask some questions, then say that they were wrong and proceed to explain to us the way things really were. I felt that it would have been more appropriate to structure this course as a traditional lecture with less discussion, and not to invite people's opinions only to shoot them down.",
    "It seemed like a lot of the cases by the end were very similar. I think it could be streamlined and finish quicker. The Title IX section we had was the exact same as training graduate students had to do in the beginning of the year, so many of us did not benefit from the long training again.",
    "It could be improved by actually forming small discussion sections. Then the students in the room would have real conversations instead of the fabricated ones made up by the lecturer.",
    "not encouraging to participate in such a large room, smaller setting would feel more discussion based",
    "Fine as is.",
    "Every class was supposed to be a discussion. Except if you disagreed with John Parr, you were shot down. He had a pre-set discussion he wanted the class to have, and anything else was incorrect.",
    "John Parr is a great teacher and makes the course interesting",
    "I thought this course was actually much more interesting than I expected it to be. The topics were laid out in a clear and thought-provoking way",
    "I liked that the course was pass\/fail.",
    "I felt that this class could be improved upon. It seemed like even though the professor said discussion was encouraged, he was not very willing to entertain other thoughts and ideas. Additionally, the class ended at 6, but we were consistently held until 6:15 which I don't think is very respectful of everyone's time.",
    "John Parr is a jerk. He discourages anyone from answering by being an ass to anyone who answers. Does not facilitate good discussion.",
    "Upload powerpoints! Or make some syllabus for reference. I wanted to look at the material again, but there was nowhere to find it.",
    "Strengths: It brings a lot of resources and cases to the table. Weaknesses: The course is very one sided. Where it is initially treated as a discussion it quickly seems more lecturing under a guise of discussion. Also, the case studies brought are all in the same veins of misconduct without expanding into cases that do not involve publication and blatant idea stealing."
