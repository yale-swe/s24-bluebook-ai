    "I find it hard to believe that the school of public health can not put this class together!. There is lack of communication between instructors. Basic concepts were not clearly explained, the reference books recommended were useless and the students spent most their time trying to figure out concepts that were neither explained during class nor in the hand\/slides from the class nor in the recommended lectures but were asked during homework assignments.The lab session were a waste of time since the TA was not invested on teaching!!",
    "Not enough structure, not enough continuity, and difficult to do assignments with lack of structure.",
    "It's not specified in the syllabus but a strong background in genetic and or molecular biology is required to try to follow the class. If you expected to learn the very basics of genetic epidemiology this is not the right class for you.The class lacks some kind of general goal. It's difficult to know what you're suppose to learn from it. The instructors do not seem to communicate with each other.It would help if the TA could have a strong background in genetic and\/or would communicate with the professor as to how to solve the problem sets.The only positive aspect of this class is that Professor Kidd is an excellent lecturer. I learned a lot from his lectures. Unfortunately, he only gave three of them.",
    "The strong attempts to cover genetic epidemiology. However because it is taught by 3 different professors that do not really coordinate with each other it feels like a collection of separate lectures. If you are not familiar with the material it becomes very difficult to pick up because there is no continuity.Also, instead of small homeworks every week so that students learn the material piece by piece there are 3 large homework assignments. Also, the spacing of the homeworks was very odd. We had the first homework just before thanksgiving, the 2nd during the last week of class and the third during finals week.It might be better if a rigorous syllabus was adopted (it was changed countless times at the start of the semester) along with a textbook. Many times, articles were posted that the night before the lecture and needed to be read by tomorrow which was impossible. Furthermore, small sample problems worked out with solutions should be provided.",
    "This course should be one of the most important course in Biostat division. Unfortunately it failed to be such one. The materials were not organized very well. The way to assign homework were truly bad.EPH should offer more than one course related to genetic epi. One is lower level and another is more advance. Or thinking about to have only one instructor take responsibility. We are taking course rather than seminar.Professors should spend more time to prepare. Lecture should be twice per week. We need more homework assignments which should be coincided with lectures.",
    "Terrible class. The organization was almost nonexistent, the lectures was soporific, and the homework assignments were a completely mess (when the answer key to the first problem set was posted, there were quite a few blatant contradictions between the answer key and the lecture slides that everybody immediately noticed). Material had the potential to be interesting, but the lecturers didn't help.",
    "the course needed a lot of basic understanding of genetics and most people who did not have it were lost in the class. this course should have some prerequisites or should have some introductory sessions to genetic epidemiology.",
    "Strengths: fascinating topic, three expert perspectivesWeaknesses: Lectures seemed uncoordinated between the three professors, the syllabus changed too much and the homeworks did not seem to be organized well from the lectures or even spaced correctly throughout the semester, and the lab sessions really were mostly a waste of time - there has to be a better way to explain the unique computer programs and technologies currently available! even a lecture format without computers might have been better.",
    "Very interesting and fascinating topics. The class is somewhat disorganized, with exercises on the homework seeming distant to the lectures.Strengths are that the class is taught by very knowledgeable people.Class is not micromanaged.Weaknesses are that it was difficult to gather the main points and lessons of each lecture. Homework relatively difficult. Power point presentations became tiresome.Ways to improve the class would be to streamline the lectures with more detailed class outlines. Provide core concepts and key messages in the beginning of the lecture perhaps in a handout. Also provide similar exercises with solutions to the homeworks as examples, perhaps from past years. It would be wonderful to have Dr.Claus work out the reasoning behind some of them altogether in class with an overhead or on the board.",
    "the course is not consistent because of it's teaching by serveral teahcer",
    "I thought this course was too difficult for me, the topics were too advanced. I thought the course would be more focused on public health and medicine and less on statistics.",
    "The professors vary a lot in terms of how they lecture and how available they are to answer questions. I did not find the professors particularly accessible, although the TA tried to be. However, the TA did not write the homeworks and did not usually know the answers so he often had trouble answering questions. Also, the only professor I could really follow was Dr. Claus, one of the professors was difficult to understand, and the third only lectured two or three times. It might have been helpful if the professors had followed a textbook more closely or discussed the readings in class because I felt like I needed more guidance outside of what we discussed in class. The computer labs were abysmal, poorly planned, and poorly explained, and we never used the programs to do our assignments so I didn't see the point. I would not recommend this course unless it is absolutely necessary or unless the professors make some serious adjustments."

Her answer key to the first homework assignment (which she made) completely contradicted her own lectures at several points.3rd instructor: Professor KiddNot a particularly good lecturer - talks very slowly. Though at least, he was helpful when we asked him about his homework assignment.",

    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Professor Zhao's lecture were hard to follow. He referred to lots of molecular biology concepts that are not familiar to everyone. But he puts a lot of effort to make you understand the quantitative aspect of his lectures though.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Extremely boring lectures. Completely unengaging and uninformative - we would probably gain more from just reading the lecture slides on our own time.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0took time in trying to make us understand the biostatistical part of the course but i had a very hard time grasping the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0the text provided by Hongyu Zhao is too deep",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Too difficult lectures, teacher assumed student had advanced level of knowledge in genetics.",

    "Extremely bad!! Not invested on teaching any one and sometimes he did not have the knowledge or understanding of genetics to explain it to anyone!",

    "The TA tried to be helpful but was not always successful. At one point he provided solutions that directly contradicted what was posted by the professor later.",
    "Jia Kang taught a few of the computer labs, which to be honest seemed somewhat irrelevant to the course material other than the class on Merlin, as the other programs were not used at all whatsoever for the rest of the class.Somewhat helpful when we had questions about the homework assignment although to be honest, as some of my friends remarked, he sometimes didn't seem to know the material any better than we did (though to be fair, he was just as in the dark as we were, considering that he didn't have access to the answer keys at all and the homework assignments tended to be terribly written in the first place)",
    "lab sessions were not very good and the TA sessions were not very helpful.",
    "TA could've been way more on top of things or maybe that was the fault of professor-TA communications, communicative to the class, and better with the Labs - when half of class time is spent helping half the class with their computers something is wrong either with the class design or the lab lecture.",
    "good",
    "Jia: good TA, but can explain things more understandable",
    "The labs were horrible. Didn't have much experience with him outside of class."

    "Interesting topic, but not a great class. maybe will be better organized next year",
    "A disorganized class, but dealing with complex and emerging information. Important to anyone interested in genetics or modern research.I would recommend it to other students, but hopefully the class could be better structured and improved.",
    "I would only recommend it if you have a very strong background in either genetics or statistics and you're interested in research in genetic epidemiology."
