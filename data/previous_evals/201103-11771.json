   "comments": [
    "French 140 is a great continuation of 130. The focus here is really on speaking and writing, as well as understanding other Francophone culture. Take with Madame Koundi if you can! She is hard, but in a good way!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who feels like they need grammatical assistance. It is also helpful in learning how to talk comfortably in french, because each student is required to do a 10-minute presentation on a topic of their choice.",
    "FREN 140 is a lot of work, but if you really want tolearn the language and are not just doing this to fulfill a language requirement, you should be prepared to put in some time for this class. It gets to be part of your routine, though, and you'll get used to it. Also, I took last year off from French, and the last French class I took in high school two years ago was this absolutely stupid online \"virtual high school\" nonsense which actually just destroyed my French. So I essentially had a two year gap between my last legit French class and this one, and I had never had to communicate entirely in French either, but it turned out to be fine. So if you're coming into this class with any sort of reservations like the ones I had, just know that you'll be okay as long as you put in the work. Also Mme Koundi is awesome, she's super nice and super helpful but she has clear expectations for you so make sure you do the work.",
    "Mme Koundi is great! The French department is no joke. Expect to put in a lot of work in this is class, but by doing so you make a lot of progress in French in just one semester.",
    "French 140 is a logical continuation of 130. The readings are sometimes depressing, but manageable and interesting. The class focuses more on discussion, and greatly helped with my progression in the language.Madame Koundi is enthusiastic and genuine. Although she sometimes is not entirely clear with her expectations, she genuinely cares about the learning and progress of her students.I would recommend this class for those looking to continue with their french studies.",
    "Take it to continue French!",
    "yes i would definitely recommend taking this class, the workload is actually less than L3",
    "French 140 is a straightforward language class. You go to class every day, learn grammar and read a little. Definitely not my favorite course at Yale so far, as it was much more like a high school class with nightly, routine assignments, but not too bad overall. Definitely take it with Madame Koundi if you can, she is so nice and makes class great and entertaining.",
    "I highly recommend it to any student who is qualified for this level."
