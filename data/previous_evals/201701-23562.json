I also had the chance to work with Professor Mendelsohn on my own research project in environmental valuation. Professor Mendelsohn's guidance all semester helped me craft a research proposal with strong theoretical grounding. More importantly, Professor Mendelsohn gave me an introduction of what research into valuation techniques is like."
