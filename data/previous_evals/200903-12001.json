   "comments": [
    "course about French Canada, covering topics like quebecois culture, french secession, and language disputes in canada. I would recommend this class--it's a great way to get a north american junior seminar credit.",
    "Take this course!!",
    "very interesting , great seminar on Canada!",
    "YES. TAKE IT. but be aware that Prof G. is not the most organized person. still, absolutely wonderful course, not to be missed.",
    "Professor Gitlin is the man - approachable, funny, up-beat, and really loves teaching and to help his students. That said, the class is Quebec and some French North America, and take that as a warning--I would not necessarily recommend taking the class without some general interest in the subject. The class itself, though, is a good atmosphere, for a seminar the work is manageable-weekly reading (with groups of 2-4 being responsible for the bulk each week), a short essay 2-3 pages, and a 15 page paper at the end.",
    "If you're a Canadian or have always wandered about what's up with Canada, then this class is fo you. It's focused mainly on French Canada and even though there's a lot of reading, Prof Gitlin tells you each week what to read and what to skim, donuts very manageable and fair. I'd be careful of the final research paper-- it was the first history research paper I've ever had to write because I'm not a history major. But with Prof Gitlin's help and copious hand holding (he basically walked me through everything), i felt like I did a good job.",
    "HIST 168j covers the history of Quebec and French-speaking North America from the arrival of French explorers in the 1500s to the modern-day political and cultural situation in Canada. I would definitely recommend the course: it is fun, and you learn a lot about Canada and Quebec, as well as some interesting facts about the U.S., such as how prevalent French was in some regions, even relatively recently.",
    "The best part about this course is that you can't help but learn something about Canadian history. Jay Gitlin is an engaging professor who makes each session a delight to sit through. I'd definitely recommend this class to other Yalies.",
    "Yes if for no other reason than to take a class with Gitlin - such an approachable and cool professor. The class is what you make of it; it can be a great opportunity to learn from a respected historian, write a real history research paper, and learn about a subject you probably won't come across in any other class. Sometimes class gets off track but the course itself is something of an experience that I'm glad I was able to have. The class is a goodexample of how you can have a combination of fun (I never dreaded going to class) and work (the 20 page final paper required a lot of research)."
