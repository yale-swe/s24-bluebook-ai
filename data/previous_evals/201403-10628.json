    "This is a great class for a first year grad student who wants to build a background in evolutionary theory, history, and important concepts. We discussed a lot of \"big\" papers in the study of evolution and modern synthesis, and the debates on species concepts have informed my outlook greatly.",
    "ANTH 857 leads your through major topics in evolutionary theory and discussess papers from a concept's inception to current times. I would fully recommend this class to any graduate student in the biological sciences.",
    "ANTH 857 is an excellent introduction to the topics of evolutionary biology and anthropology. The readings are sometimes dense, especially since many of them were written in prior eras. I would recommend this course for anyone interested in geology, paleontology, or biological anthropology.",
    "I would say that it is beneficial to all Anthropology students, and anyone interested in human evolution. It is a seminar class that reviews the foundations and major components of the discipline.",
    "This course provides a great review of topics in evolutionary theory and encourages students to think critically about these concepts. I would definitely recommend this class to other students in various departments (anthropology, EEB, geology, etc.)"

   "comments": [
    "I will need to understand these concepts and be able to debate them for my qualifying exam. For me, this class was a needed introduction to graduate-level thought and debate.",
    "I had certainly had exposure to all these topics during my undergraduate courses. However, I have never read the literature this thoroughly on these topics. I feel that I can put a lot of my biological understanding against a big theoretical backdrop now. My own work doesn't particularly delve into the concepts discussed in this course but it certainly is a helpful biological framework to work from during my career.",
    "This course helped me grow more familiar with evolutionary theory, the various perspectives in the field, and the areas of ongoing contention. This course has given me some ideas for ways to incorporate evolutionary theory into my data analysis; though I think instruction on life-history theory might have benefited me more.",
    "This course helped me to review concepts of evolutionary theory that underly my research interests."
