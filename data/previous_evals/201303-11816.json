   "comments": [
    "I would reccomend this class if and only if you are truly committed to spending at least 2-3 hours on a drawing homework assignment.",
    "Absolutely, it's fun, easy, and very very engaging.",
    "Absolutely. It is a fun class whether or not you've taken figure drawing or any drawing class before",
    "It's good if you want to improve your skills when it comes to drawing the human form, materials, and environment from life. Not an absurd amount of work.",
    "yes! it'll change the way you draw.",
    "It's not a gut, you should want to learn how to be proficient at drawing people, and not be lazy about practicing on your own time. for example I didn't put that much effort into my sketchbook assignments and I always felt bad about that, and whenever I turned in a half-done drawing I also felt bad about it because I was not working to improve my skills and Will can obviously tell when you haven't done what you were capable of, and he will probably say so.Also the class itself is pretty rigorous. You have to focus HARD for two hours if you want to produce a good drawing, and you learn exponentially every class. Some days it can be so, so hard because you might in a bad mood for some other reason but you have to drop everything and draw as hard as you can, and stop thinking about whatever else was going on.Overall not easy",
    "It's an overview of the human body and how to depict it in art. As long as you work hard you don't need to be an amazingly talented artist; the class is more about progress and learning to express the human body in new and different ways, so don't worry if you're intimidated by not being an art major. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in drawing.",
    "If you're interested in working from the figure, this class is a great opportunity. Be prepared to work if you want to improve.",
    "I had little experience with drawing which gave me some trouble at first, but Villalongo helped me improve greatly and I ended up with some drawings that I am really proud of and never could have done before this semester. Although physics major, I'm happy I took this course.The class comes with a naked model on a spotlighted podium around which everybody is circled up, measuring every inch of her body."
