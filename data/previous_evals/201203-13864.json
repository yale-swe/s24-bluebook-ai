   "comments": [
    "This is an AMAZING course. Such interesting topics and insightful assignments, and wonderful discussions",
    "I did not understand why debating was part of our grading requirement. This was not a policy course.Pop quizzes are also a great method of ensuring attendance.",
    "The instructor was engaging and provided interesting lectures. However, the outside readings, discussion sections, debate topics and writing assignments did not align well with the lecture. The readings assigned for classes were not interesting and did not lend themselves well to discussion. The final literature review paper was long and time-consuming at 15-20 pages, but was not intellectually challenging.",
    "Strengths:Debates in section were good.Topics were interesting.Final assignment was useful.Weaknesses:Sections where we discussed the readings were pointless.Class was not at all interactive.Personal health improvement project was too simple for a Masters class.Little incentive to do readings each week.",
    "I think that it was a great overview. My only suggestion is that she try to cover less ground - a little too much reliance on the powerpoint slides.",
    "Good introductory course. The assignments seemed relevant and were interesting.",
    "I was really excited to take this course. Social and behavioral sciences are incredibly important in every aspects of public health. However, I felt that I really did not learn anything new with the course.We should have spent more time studying actual theories of behavioral change and how to apply them to the real world scenario. For example, our discussion sessions could have been put to better use by actually discussing the applicability of everything learned in lecture.The readings were interesting and so were the lectures, but overall, the course lacked depth. Our time could have been of better use if one of our projects in class was designing a better behavioral intervention. Our self improvement project was along those lines but it required more structure. I think that a group project would be a better alternative than an individual project.Oh and my TA Isabel was wonderful!",
    "Strengths: Opportunity to hear outside speakers, discussions that relate to lecturesWeaknesses: Discuss lecture a full week after it's given",
    "Overall, I think the course materials are very interesting.",
    "Lectures were great! I always looked forward to going to class; both Dr. White and guest lecturers were wonderful.",
    "Overall, I thought the course was a good overview of topics in SBS. I really enjoyed the lecture material, especially the lectures Marney was really passionate about (advertising, eating disorders) and the ones from the Rudd Center. I liked the discussion session format to the class that allowed for more discussion of topics.However, I though the general scope of the course was really basic for a graduate level class - I learned very little new material for the course. Perhaps for students in the SBS concentration, we could opt out of the course and take a more topic-specific course instead? Or, the course could be changed to include more tangible skills for the field - learning theories from within SBS, seminal literature in the field, etc. Something so that it felt like I walked away from the course with new skills. As is, it seemed like kind of a lot of talk, a lot of statistics, and not much that I gained from the experiences.As far as assignments go: the blog quizzes were kind of a fun way to gauge participation and attendance. The discussion sections were a great way to keep up with readings. The personal health improvement paper was just ok - the project was need, but the paper itself felt like a sham. It seemed absurd to be writing a research paper with just one subject - the format as a journal article seemed very forced and fake. Perhaps a reflective essay would have been more beneficial. The literature review similarly seemed a bit of a sham, but with more tangible content. As we had no training in literature reviews or systematic reviews, there could be no great expectations as to our performance on the paper. Yet somehow we were still supposed to figure out how to sort through a body of literature and compose it into a piece. It felt like a very confusing assignment that I couldn't have done well on give the training I have to this point and the tools and prompt I was given. I would have appreciated much more guidance on that topic. I know the writing lecture was an attempt at that - but it was in September, and it was not particularly helpful at all. It gave too much information on writing a real journal article (which we never had to do, and won't for some time), with no context for that. And no information on writing the assignments she had assigned for the course. moving that lecture to the last third of the course and focusing it on literature reviews would have been more helpful. On the other hand, assigning a literature review in a class that doesn't teach literature reviews might just be too ambitious. A regular 15 page research paper would have been a more appropriate assignment.",
    "The lecture is too detached from the rest of the class. There's really no incentive to go\/pay attention other than being present for a \"pop blog\" quiz. I thought the debates and assignments in the course were very valuable, though.",
    "strengths: the discussion session added a valuable component, I liked that we covered very diverse topics each week, good speakersweaknesses: some lectures were a little dry (hard not to be in a 2 hour lecture)",
    "Lectures were very interesting. Discussion section was not as interesting. Too many debates, readings sometimes uninteresting. Writing assignments were very good. They went at a good pace with increasing difficulty that made it very manageable. A lot of good feedback was given and much help was available. EXCELLENT guest lecturers, so great.",
    "Give training on writing and literature review. More available TA hours.",
    "Strenghts: Subject cover wide range of socio behavioural factors affecting outcome of health of the individual.Weakness: No weakness I found.",
    "Strengths are course content and the way Marney teaches. Assignments could be revised. Debates should be worth more than 5% if we are doing two. Maybe make media analysis less. Behavior change project was interesting and a good learning experience. Final paper may need more direction earlier on to better plan for ties between those two papers. Lectures were amazing.",
    "Discussion sections very useful for synthesizing material and \"recapping.\" The course gives a wonderful overview of topics.",
    "Such a broad overview and the lectures were facts about previous studies and different rates of social& behavioral science - I don't feel like I took much away from the course. The sections and outside assignments were pretty enjoyable and not that bad of a workload. Better structure and explanation of these assignments would be good - though it was actually nice that we could basically take them wherever we wanted and not have points taken off for not following a certain format.",
    "Very interesting information that I enjoyed. Presentation is a little dull, but I find Marney's personality hysterical so I enjoyed the lectures.",
    "This class was very broad and I don't feel like I actually got much out of it. I understand that the course is an introductory course for social and behavioral sciences, but I gained very little from the class other than \"social factors influence health,\" which is something that doesn't take an entire semester to learn. That said, the course wasn't bad either, not too stressful of a course, topics were interesting, but seemed to go nowhere.",
    "The structure of the course needs improvement. Especially since it's a foundations course, it should outline critical points and a way of thinking of health issues with a social\/behavioral framework (not only psychological), rather than covering different topics(often unrelated) each week. The course would benefit from an outline at the beginning so students know where it's going",
    "My impression of the course was that there was no thread that tied the topics together; it felt like each topic was independent of other topics. While I found much of the information interesting, I would have liked to see the lectures more integrated.I also felt that the assignments did not facilitate my learning, nor did they feel closely tied to the lecture material. The Personal Health Improvement Project felt like an undergrad assignment; I think for a graduate course, it was not challenging or informative. I think for anyone with a background in social sciences especially, it felt like a giveaway course.",
    "The strengths is that is provided a good overview of topics of SBS but unfortunately this is also a weakness because we did not discuss any topic at length.",
    "I really enjoyed the debates for this class and the small group discussions within our sections. I also liked the creativity in having to craft and carry out our personal health improvement projects. However, I would have liked more time to complete our final research paper, as this was due the first day after classes finished, and only a few days following our last debate.",
    "Great course! It was organized very well, between the regular lectures, discussion sections and guest lectures. I'm very glad I took this class.",
    "Strengths-Breadth of content coveredFunny professorWeaknesses-Busy work\/pointless assignmentsDisproportionate weighting of assignments (i.e. debates work 10% of grade, but need a lot of time to prepare, should be worth more)",
    "Weakness: too little instruction for final. Final seemed a bit irrelevant",
    "Provided us a lot of topics in public health;involved a lot of reading and writing",
    "Weakness: The final paper was confusing. I wish the professor had gone over it in lecture more as really none of us knew how to do a lit review. I was very frustrated by the assignment. The lecture at the beginning of the course on paper writing was very dry and not very helpful. A lot of the lectures at the end seemed sort of random and I wasn't quite sure how they related to public health.Strength: Professor White was very personable. The workload was also reasonable. I liked the media assignment and the personal health improvement project was interesting. I also like that she focused on our need for self-care in graduate school as I think this is important and often over-looked.",
    "This was an exceptional course, one that really came together at the end. The beginning of the class is spent laying down the framework for what is to come. Than the really interesting portion of the class begins about a third of the way through once students are allowed to apply what is learned during the first third, whether it is in debates, papers, or section discussions. Overall, I highly recommend you take this course.",
    "Strengths: Great professor who has able to keep us engaged.Weaknesses: Wish there was a more cohesive theme running through the course.",
    "disorganized, material presented in lecture was not reflected in assignments, practical public health knowledge gained from the course was minimal",
    "The professor is very approachable and encourages students to brainstorm and think critically. The content of the course is interesting if you're a psychology major, but I felt that the material did not apply to our projects\/papers. Thus, it felt unrewarding to since the material did not clearly have an association.",
    "Sections were great, readings were interesting. It was a little hard to tell how most of the lectures related to the readings\/goal of the course, but they were interesting regardless.The anti-violence Dean's Lecture we had in place of one class was possibly the best lecture I've ever attended.One gripe is the final paper. I have no problems with final papers, but having it be a lit review is sort of ambitious. They take an incredible amount of time just to prep for, let alone to write 15-20 pages on. Having all of that work fall during finals week was a little crazy. I'd change it to a straight up research paper or move it up earlier in the semester.",
    "Course requirement was waived, did not take class",
    "I liked this class. To be honest I was not looking forward to this course. I viewed it as a requirement to get out of the way. By the end of the course I had learned a great deal and the course provided me a glimpse into the complexities of behaviorally based public health endeavors. All in all I am very glad that enrolled in this course.One area for improvement would be the debates. I think that the topics were lopsided, especially the vaccination debate. The topics don't have to significantly change, but when a pro side is provided with sources from the CDC and the opposing side is given a source from www.iamawhackjob.com it might suggest that the debate is unbalanced.If you also continue the debates the structure needs to also be altered to:Pro: IntroCon: IntroCon: RebuttalPro: RebuttalQuestionsPro: ConcCon: ConcIt is not a big deal, but theprevious format provide the Con side with more time to form rebuttal arguments",
    "Great. Marney is a wonderful, enthusiastic professor, and the material was very interesting.",
    "The discussion section of this course was its strength. In section we could discuss the concepts. The lectures were interesting, but not always well organized. Also, the course website often did not have the reading material posted ahead of time, which made it hard to be prepared for lecture.",
    "Really interesting lectures. Not too heavy workload. Large final paper at the end, but plenty of guidance throughout the class for it to be done.",
    "This course had the advantage of an accurate syllabus and a small discussions section that tied in well with each lecture. The use of debates during the semester was also compelling.",
    "The course explores a really interesting area and is definitely recommended for anyone in public health. There's a lot of breadth and complexity in social and behavioral health and this course does a pretty good job assessing all of it. That said, I think it could be taught at a much higher level with some tweaking.I found the way that the readings tied into the course was counterintuitive and confusing. Typically, courses assign readings in advance of the lecture, so that the lecture can be more advanced and interactive, and sections are used to augment the learning or review assignments. Assigning readings after a lecture to be read for discussion in section took some getting used to and also meant that lectures were more simplistic than I'd like, and discussion section usually failed to deliver in-depth discussion of the reading.Debates were also a pretty ineffective use of section time. A prepared discussion or loose debate that allowed everyone to participate would have been much more efficient; debates usually devolved into off-topic semantic discussions, people throwing conflicting research studies at each other, or people talking at cross-purposes and rarely engaging over the meat of a matter -- for debates to be a better use of section than a discussion would require experienced debaters, stricter moderation, more time, and much, much tighter debate topics (for example, the infant well visit\/vaccine one was notable because each topic is worthy of its own debate and having to debate both at the same time ended up being fairly vague on all fronts).",
    "This was one of my favorite courses. The topics covered were very interesting. We were given the opportunity to apply topics covered in class to in-lab debates.",
    "Strengths: I enjoyed the range of topics that were covered and learned a lot about a range of public health topics relating to social environments, etc. and behavior.Weaknesses: The course had a good range of topics, but it felt rather disjointed. It would have helped to have a better flow between lectures. I learned a good amount from the papers that were required in the course, however, I felt that I only learned in-depth about the one specific topic that I wrote about. While I enjoyed not having a final, I think that having one would makes students feel more invested in the course and would encourage people to take the readings and lectures more seriously.",
    "great.",
    "The course is lacking a roadmap. Lectures cover random social behavioral topics. They are definitely interesting but seem disconnected from the key graded components of the class. I still liked it a lot though because of my interest in SBS.",
    "The course is very interesting. However, lectures are very long and the information covered in lecture did not factor into grading at all."

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a good professor - she has a great sense of humor and seems very responsive to students needs. She was a great lecturer when she was passionate about the material, but not as engaging when she didn't like the content. Perhaps, especially on days when she wasn't so interested in the content, the class could take a different format - morediscussion or something else.

I would have preferred more discussion or exploration into certain studies and their implications, rather than facts and statistics that we probably know - even if we don't know certain numbers, we knew about SES and ethnic disparities.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White is a great lecturer. Her lectures are funny, she's easy to listen to. I didn't have much interaction with her outside of the classroom, but she did seem receptive to student concerns. I also sensed that Professor White may not have been the best suited to be teaching this course. She seems like a very good clinical psychologist, but perhaps this course would be better taught by a sociologist or social epidemiologist. That said, Professor White did take the class seriously and you could tell she put a lot of time and effort into putting together her lectures.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The instructor is extremely passionate about the topics she was lecturing (this was particularly true toward the end of the semester).

I did like that we also had guest lecturers, however, there were too many in a row, which made me feel like we hadn't had our primary lecturer in a while.I think she covered a ton of topics in this survey course, but would have liked to see her go more in depth with some topics of interest, perhaps even with break out groups during lecture.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She was very personable and very funny. An engaging speaker. Sometimes she tried to put too many things into the lecture (e.g. the mental health lecture) and it seemed very rushed and full of detail that wasn't that important for what we needed to know.As noted above, would have been helpful to explain the final paper better.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is knowledgable, personable, and very approachable. She keeps her lectures fun by engaging in a dialogue with the class - I often forgot this class was a lecture. She has a lot of energy, and is always willing to spend an extra minute or two brining a point home if one of the students has a question regarding the topic. Furthermore, I recommend going to her office hours. She routinely provided me with papers on subjects I was interested in, and was always willing to engage in debate or discussion on topics related to the class, or even topics somewhat outside the realm of the course. Overall, Marney was an exceptional Professor.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White was a great teacher. Every course I learned something new, and I enjoyed her dark humor. I also liked her dated cultural references as they were jabbing reminder of how old I am compared to my peers.Dr. White was also responsive to emails. In academia, I find that many professors are horrible at responding to timely notes. I really appreciate her promptness.I came into this class not looking forward to it, but Dr. White is a huge part of why I found this course so enjoyable.",

    "My TA is amazing! Isabel is amazing! I just wish discussion sessions were a better use of our time.",
    "Jackie is awesome!",
    "Rebecca was very good. She was kind and understanding, and wanted to help us as much as she could. I also felt like she gave good feedback on my papers.",
    "Katie was a good TA - she was responsive to student's questions and had interesting questions for us to discuss in section. She was also a careful grader. The only suggestion I have would be to give more feedback geared at how students could improve instead of just what was wrong or missing.",
    "Katie led a great section and was very accessible.",
    "katie eagan: very helpful, always available to answer questions",
    "Katie was good. She was very good at editing papers and giving constructive feedback. Extremely fast turnaround on all assignments, which is always appreciated.",

    "All TAs were very helpful and supportive.",
    "Jackie was my TA. she did a great job in sections and with feedback.",
    "Stacey was a wonderful TA, very nice and made section enjoyable. She was always very helpful and willing to answer any questions we had. Improvements would just be to be a bit stronger\/more confident in how she led section and moderating our discussion. She brought different activities in to section which I liked and thought they woke us up in the morning.",
    "TA also very knowledgable- lead a very informative discussion section. And was VERY helpful with writing the large research papers for the course.",
    "Jackie: Good TA, very calm, relaxed. She was a good discussion leader and would actively try to steer discussion in a direction that relates to what we learned in class if things went too much on a tangent. I did sometimes wish that she pulled more from her social psych background to bring in more theory to discussion session, but otherwise I was happy to have her as a TA. Thank you, Jackie!",
    "Katie was great in the discussion.",
    "Katie Egan was a good TA.",
    "Rebecca Pearl was great. She was always very willing to help with the class assignments and was extremely knowledgeable about the material presented during discussion sections. One weakness is that she was a little shy at the beginning of the semester and this took away from could have been potentially very informative and interactive sections.",
    "I really liked our TA, Jackie. She was excellent at facilitating discussion within our group section and always provided good and timely advice related to our assignments.",
    "Rebecca was great. Always prepared during discussion and lead us to insightful conversation. She was also very helpful when it came to our assignments and helping to clear up any confusion.",
    "TA: Katie EganGood to facilitate discussions. An overly-tough grader.",
    "JackieSensitive to studnts, good feedbacks",
    "Good",
    "Kathryn Egan: She was a good TA. She graded the first paper unfairly, but seemed to grade more fairly for the second paper. Her grading on the first paper seemed really subjective and not consistent with the other TA's.",
    "Jacqueline SmithGreat! I learned a lot form our TA.Strengths: Did a great job listening to all the students and providing feedback.",
    "Jackie Smith- section was organized, had activities that engaged us in course material, accessible",
    "Isabel was a fantastic TA. She made sections really interesting!",
    "My TA was switched in the middle of the semester, and it was a shame since I had already grown accustomed to the first one. The new TA had a different teaching style, and I found her to be less approachable.",
    "Rebecca was great. Very fair, had interesting\/thought-provoking comments in section. Nice job.",
    "Pretty good. There could have been more structure.",

    "Isabel was an extremely helpful and useful resource. Very quick to help students.",
    "My TA was Isabel. She did a great job of handling section. We had good discussions and debates in class. She gave good advice about the papers and projects for the class.",
    "Jacqueline Smith was a great TA. She was excellent in moderating the conversations and really tries her best to answer every student's questions.",
    "Stacey was an excellent teaching assistant. Extremely knowledgeable and well prepared.May consider challenging students opinions more for sake of discussion and to provide different points of view.",
    "Isabel was a great TA. She kept section fun and ran the debates effectively. I would have liked more in-depth discussion of the reading.",
    "Stacey mostly facilitated discussion. She did a great job.",
    "Rebecca Pearl did an excellent job as our TA. For the first few weeks we didn't have the most smooth-flowing conversations in discussion but as we all became familiar with each other and better at understanding the readings, I think we got more and more out of our discussions. Rebecca did a great job moderating our debates and was always very diplomatic in addressing out comments and excellent at asking our questions.",
    "TA was great.",
    "Jackie was very helpful especially with the personal health improvement project and review, which made up the majority of our grade. In this way, discussion seemed much more essential than lecture.",

   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT! It's one of the most enlightening classes and one of the best professors you'll come across!!! It's a lot of hard work, but definitely worth the effort, you learn so much.",
    "The class is okay. I learned a little, though honestly not as much as I would have hoped. Really I learned how to structure a systematic literature review, which I did not need an entire class to do. There should probably be a class project instead of the personal health improvement project, which I really didn't think added much value. The debates in section were great, and were probably the most interesting and educational part of the class.",
    "It's a great overview of the social and behavioral foundations of health - it provides a nice survey of the relevant topics and good historical background.",
    "It's better than I expected.",
    "It is required. They have to take it, but I think compared to last year, this year is much better.",
    "This course is basically what the title is: Social and Behavioral Foundations of Health. Very broad but shallow delving into many different topics (obesity, perceptions of beauty, advertising, bullying, etc..) However, you can look deeper into your specific interests by doing the literature review, where you will basically learn everything there is to know about a specific topic.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student if he\/she is interested at the social behavior aspects of public health and who does not mind writing long papers.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This class gets you thinking about issues you might not otherwise.",
    "The course is a basic overview of topics in SBS. There is a lot of flexibility in the assignments, which is nice. However, they are not necessarily the most beneficial set of assignments I have gotten from a course. I would not recommend the course to students with previous knowledge of issues in SBS, but I would recommend it for someone completely new to the topic. (Unfortunately, in an MPH program, there are few people completely new to the topic.)",
    "This is an introduction to the intersection of social and behavioral sciences with public health. Much of it is intuitive, but still very interesting. You can work on whateveryou want during the lectures, and the assignments\/debates are pretty enlightening. There are a number of assignments, but none of them are very difficult.",
    "interesting topics and a good selection of assignments to cover the coursework",
    "Definitely take this course! This is the most interesting course I have taken so far at YSPH! Marney is an amazing lecturer, so not only will you learn a lot, you will be entertained.",
    "I would recommend to people who are working in Public Health Planning and Programming for improvement of health of the general Public. People working in Administration, Public Policy making are also important besides general Public health workers.",
    "Course goes over different psychological aspects of public health and the impact behavior has on health. I would highly recommend this course to other students, especially with Marney as the professor.",
    "Really, really broad overview of social& behavioral health. Professor basically reads off facts in lecture, but she's a good professor and has a good sense of humor. Workload is not bad at all, just prepare for weekly sections and then short papers that are spaced out throughout the semester.",
    "Great class- definitely would recommend.",
    "It needs improvement but has the potential to be a great course. As a foundations class, it should be paid some attentionto and restructuring",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course for anyone with a social sciences background.",
    "I would recommend this to a student if they want to have a general overview of several topics of SBS; however, if they are looking for a course that really focuses a few topics I would not recommend it. The instructor is very passionate as I stated before and this really added to the lectures as well as encouraging students to be passionate about the topics presented.",
    "As an member of the SBS concentration, I really enjoyed the topics covered in the course, as well as the creative approaches that Dr. White utilized to having us better understand contentious topics, behavior change, and academic paper writing. I would recommend more evenly spaced guest lecturers and a more organized timeline for assignment submission.",
    "Really great course, well organized and planned, interesting assignments, great professor and TA",
    "It's ok, not too much work, bust a lot of busy work. There's not too much reading. If you have a social science undergrad background, it is somewhat redundant.",
    "Yes",
    "While I really liked Professor White, not sure I would recommend it unless you need it for a requirement (which I'm guessing is the main reason people take this course). The subject area is very broad and it's hard to realize what I learned after taking the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It was a great experience, and I learned so much more than I had expected going in. It was fun, thought provoking, and really interesting. Regardless of which department you're in, I would recommend you take this course because it provides useful tools that will be necessary for anyone interested in a career in public health.",
    "A great course. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Very boring at times, it's a core option so you may have to take it",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "This course is necessary to take to graduate. Although necessary, it does teach you a few new tools such as how to write papers.",
    "It's a good course.START THE LIT REVIEW PAPER EARLY. Do not wait until finals week, you will regret it.",
    "I would tell fellow epidemiologists to keep an open mind before joining this class. I didn't and really enjoyed it.",
    "I would highly recommend it for the material and professor.",
    "This course teaches about the social and behavioral determinants of health. There is one project, one short and one longer paper. I can't say that I would recommend this course. The course was interesting, but I don't feel that I learned much that could be applied to public health research.",
    "Yes. Interesting subject material and good discussion section. Covers a variety of material with an interesting professor.",
    "Overall a fairly light course that presents a lot of interesting material. It would be nice to follow up with a more advanced course but I don't think there is one.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The instructor is great. The class topics are very interesting.",
    "I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend it just because of the topics. Lectures are random but pretty interesting. The papers are graded pretty tough so be sure to include each component listed on the rubrics. Also, utilize your TA.",
    "Weekly lectures (very long, tend to drag a bit), section in which there are debates and discussions about lecture topics, no midterm or final. Personal health improvement project essay, media review essay, final general health literature review paper. I would recommend the class."
