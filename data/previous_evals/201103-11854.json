   "comments": [
    "Learn abt why metal and polymer and ceramic materials behave as we know.",
    "Mat sci is a good course. I definitely recommend this class to MechEs who have the option to not take it and also to people in other majors looking for an elective. The course is rather qualitative andis all heavily based in chemistry and statics. The concepts are really easy to understand and the workload is never too much. Udo is a decent lecturer, but attending lecture isn't even necessary to understand the material. Exams aren't too bad either.",
    "Material Science is very relaxing course. There are weekly problem sets which are very easy and can be done without a whole lot of time spent. The exam however is weighted heavily. There is only one midterm, so be aware, you have only one chance at doing well before the final. The final is also very challenging and will require you to study a whole lot of material that we have covered through the course of the semester in a very short period of time and apply it to new situations. I would recommend this course to any student in the mechanical and chemical engineering ABET program because it is by far the most relevant topic in today's global conversation. Rare earth metals, semiconductors, and now new particles discovered at CERN are becoming the foundation for new technologies. An understanding of the fundamentals of why things are magnetic, how you make concrete, or why is it a joining between spacecraft tiles don't melt, are important to a wide spectrum of fields.",
    "If you're a physics person (i.e. you like concepts and general principles rather than descriptive \"fuzzy\" science and details that you have to memorize), don't take this class. This class is like the biology of the physical sciences: tons of memorization and description rather than prediction. I hated the material--thought it was terribly boring. The equations that we do use are, as Professor Schwarz says, \"faked\" equations (i.e. empirically based rather than founded in deep physics), but we have to use them a lot, and they are cumbersome. Also, the grading in this class is extraordinarily nitpicky, and we are tested on the most obscure details sometimes.Materials science is a very useful subject to know about, I'll admit, but with Professor Schwarz teaching it, it's not worthwhile. Do not take this class if he's teaching it. Do not take this class if you're a concept person rather than a details person.",
    "Yale engineering needs to do a better job making classes relevant and interesting. Lecture was incredibly boring, despite the potential of the material to be very interesting.",
    "If you are looking for a good introduction to materials science, this is a good course, but you should be prepared to either learn a bit of chemistry on your own, or brush up on any past chemistry coursework. Additionally, problem sets are very tedious and time consuming, mostly feeling like busy work rather than important problem-solving.",
    "You will learn most material from the book, and there are often questions on material that wasnt covered in class\/in the book, however the class could be pretty interesting at times.",
    "Not a very interesting class...I don't really recommend taking it for the subject matter. However it doesn't require a ton of work to do well on the homework so if that is appealing, then take it. The final is TOUGH...memorize the book!",
    "Materials science is interesting. That said, this class does have some work, and it's difficult to maintain a cursory interest throughout the whole semester. You probably have to take this class, but even if not, I would recommend it on the whole.",
    "THe course proceeds fairly rapidly through a large syllabus. You need to read the textbook and keep up with the homework, since the class does not cover everything.",
    "The class is about what things are made of chemically and how this explains their mechanical, electrical, thermal, etc. properties. It's a really interesting course because you learn about the composition of materials that you are familiar with and then have a greater understanding about why they behave the way they do.",
    "Don't take this class with Udo. Worst mechanical engineering class I've taken. And that's saying something.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are interested in the subject. if not, this can be a drag. Also try to pay attention and ask questions - the tests expect you to know things that are not clearly spelt out in any book or notes. to do well, you need to develop a genuine understanding."
