   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to those major in genetics and statistics.",
    "Great",
    "yes i will.",
    "This course discusses some very useful statistical methods mainly in application in genetics and Bioinformatics. If you are interested work in this area, I think this course is very helpful. If not, I think these methods or the ideas in these method could also potentially be applied in other areas.",
    "I would definitely recommend, but it may take extra effort to learn about basic probability theory as a biology background student.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who want to get a feeling about the field of bioinformatics.",
    "I would recommend it without a problem to students who already have experience with R and advanced stats. For others, I would say that it is feasible to learn a lot during this class, but one has to be prepared to work a lot to do so... The learning curve for R scripting is rather steep but it turned out to be worthwhile for me, no question.",
    "I will strongly recommend this course to other students. It was very interesting topic and I could contribute this course with my programming skills. Bioinformatics is very combined subject that needs talented people from several departments such as Mathematics, Statistics, Biology, and Computer Science. Although you are very beginner in this subject, I think you can learn a lot from Prof. Zhang.",
    "Sure. It is absolutely a good course.",
    "Yes, it is a great course . You learn a lot on statistical genetics.",
    "Yes, definitely I will recommend this class to other students. It is very useful in bioinformatics field.",
    "If you want an easy grade, good class to take. If you want to do some genetics problems and don't know where to start, also good, but class is hard to learn something new.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to students who want to do research related with bioinfomatics. The course is interesting, practical and useful.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Almost no work outside of a final project which is great. You can really put time into the project and have a nice result at the end of the semester.",
    "Bioinformatics is a course that is useful for both biology and statistics majors. It teaches how to use statistics, as well as computer programming to successfully answer questions about biology, especially genetics.",
    "Great class. If you have taken \"Data Analysis\" class, this would be a very good continuation. Topics are very interesting and engaging. Also, start working on your project in advance so that you have enough time to enjoy it. If you do not have any previous bio or genetics experience but have statistics and data analysis experience (and R programming) you should be good and will learn a lot from this class.",
    "Yes, it's a great intro course to biostatistics",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I will recommend this course to other students, esp. CBB students."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me an overview of this field.",
    "Great",
    "As a CBB student, this course matches my research area very help. What have been discussed in this course could be used in my future research towards my dissertation.",
    "I am really lucky to get skillful and practical instructions from my TA and fellow classmates on R programming, which is more than beneficial for my future work.",
    "this course has broaden my view and let me apply the computer science background in the bioinformatics.",
    "I now have a much better understanding of advanced statistical genomics and I am able to write my own R scripts - a definite bonus for me.",
    "This course really helped me to deepen my knowledge about bioinformatics. Although I don't have to write my dissertation because I'm in terminal M.S. degree, the subjects really attracted me and I spent a lot of time to investigate the topics.",
    "it will help me to understand other people's work, which might be used for mine.",
    "I learned a lot on statistics.",
    "This course would help a little bit if I am interested in biology, but since my research area is theory, I don't think it is helpful.",
    "The course attracts me to the field of bioinformatics and it is extremely helpful for my future research. Methods introduced in class can be directly applied to real research projects.",
    "I'm an undergraduate. So I guess the best thing about the class was the ability to jump into a real research project. Which was very gratifying and a really good learning experience. I think this class is good in combination with more traditional classes that build theoretical knowledge.",
    "I am not doing research.",
    "Introduced me to a variety of statistical methods to analyze biological and genetic data.",
    "It's a bit too technical to my own research but it may help in the long run",
    "Very helpful.",
    "This course broadened my knowledge of my discipline. For contribution to my dissertation, I don't know yet."
