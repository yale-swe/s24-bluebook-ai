    "Yale and America was a nice history seminar. Professor Gitlin was very enthusiastic and Sam Chauncey was a pleasure. My only criticism is that I found many of the other students to be pretty disengaged seniors who were taking the course Credit\/D\/Fail. I would recommend the course, though.",
    "Must take",
    "Yes! But please be interested in Yale history. Otherwise this will be a very boring class. I am super interested, so I loved going to ever lecture.",
    "Don't listen to the haters (if any of them left a review). One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale, and it's hard to get into for a reason, but just don't expect some kind of intense structured seminar. This is Jay Gitlin's show mainly because he's really entertaining and knows his Yale history incredibly well; you'll have assignments that give you a chance to start discussions, but for the most part you'll just want to sit back and enjoy his many, many great stories. This class is a rockin' 5th credit, and the final paper is super fun. Overall, will give you a new appreciation for the school you attend and the people around you.",
    "Take this class if you love Yale, and if you're feeling nostalgic about leaving this place!"
