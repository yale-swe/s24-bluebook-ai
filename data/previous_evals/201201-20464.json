   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "1) Lots of reading but not much written work2) Not forced to contribute, but the course is only worthwhile if you put in the time and effort3) Focuses more on aesthetics and historical context than theoretical content; fill this gap on your own time or lead the discussion that way4) There is a lot of flexibility in where to take the discussion, and if you do the readings, you'll likely be able to steer it in the directions you wantI would recommend the course for two reasons:1) The content is essential to any serious theorist2) Holzer's perspective is worth hearing",
    "The course seems to be a relatively thorough reading of history of theory issues during the period considered. The reading itself is the real prize, since Holzer has managed to select important examples from major treatises, saving the student the work of deciding what to read and what to skip. If you're interested in getting acquainted with history of theory, go for it; if you're looking to build usable theoretical tools, look elsewhere, but that's in the nature of theory\/aesthetics courses in general.",
    "The course covers theory and aesthetics of the baroque and classical periods, with an emphasis on Italian aesthetics around 1600 and French and German theory of the 1700s. The course also introduces or continues student involvement in research into the history of theory. I would recommend this course to a student with an interest in this material, especially if it was necessary to learn for the comprehensive exam in music theory or if the student wanted an opportunity to do a research paper on the history of theory of this era."

    "This is self-evident.",
    "The course helped to flesh out my understanding of the history of theory, which is not only useful preparation for the comprehensive exam, but also important background for any theorist's understanding of the field."
