   "comments": [
    "As a physics grad student, I came in knowing matlab and the mathematics fairly well. It was most interesting learning the different models that have been used in biology, rather than getting caught up in the details of the math\/programming.",
    "Matlab How to set up differential equations for dynamical systems Specialized topic in cellular oscillation during cell cycles and neuronal spiking\/network.",
    "I enjoyed the fact that this class applied a lot of differential equations and linear algebra concepts to biology. In previous engineering math classes, these concepts were discussed in the abstract, so it was nice to have tangible applications. I learned how to interpret phase-space plots and how to publish in MATLAB.",
    "I developed a better understanding of mathematical models and motifs that exist in biology. I also better understand the development of those models and the literature supporting them.",
    "Dynamical System Analysis. Physical approaches to complex systems. Paper-reading skills.",
    "as a beginner with matlab I got WAY more confident in coding!",
    "I learned a lot of MatLab, and how to think about, in broad strokes, systems biology computations and dynamical models.",
    "Basic nonlinear dynamic analyses."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good training in using matlab to do simulations. I personally feel that switching the course to python would be good, as Jupyter notebooks accomplish what matlab publish does, but with nicer results. Plus, python is the language used most outside of academia (mostly due to it being free), so it would be the most useful to students in general. Additionally, perhaps delving deeper into the mathematics of dynamical systems in general would be helpful (a la Strogatz's book). I though the intro was superficial and I would have struggled had I not seen the material before.",
    "A lot of time I realize that I learn more with Hackathon and homework than the class lecture.",
    "I enjoyed the mathematical nature of this course, but wished that it got a little more detailed in the math also. Having to solve differential equations and then use at the time-series solutions to find the phase plot would have been more insightful then simply plotting null clines and qualitatively understanding the trajectory of a system.",
    "Strengths of the course: The group paper projects were well done and I felt I learned the most from this. I liked the structure\/length of the homeworks and exercises and felt they reflected what I was learning in class and encouraged me to go deeper. Weakness: I wasn't a fan of the hair cell section.",
    "A hybrid class for both experimental and theoretical people is always hard to balance. How to allocate the time for the basic concepts and the more advanced, on-going research is always an issue.",
    "I would have liked to gain a finer understanding of biological consequence to the models -- a closer insistence that we only study models where the mathematical forms used correlate to known or strongly hypothesized existing binding coefficients, cooperative interactions, etc. There were some models included in this class that I think should be eliminated from the curriculum because they do not have the strongest biological relevance, though might be mathematically beautiful.",
    "Better if there is more mathematical derivation."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, good intro to models used in biology. Not the most rigorous",
    "Probably not as a experimentalist because most of what's learn is not as applicable.",
    "Yes, I think I have a better understanding of mathematical models than before.",
    "Dynamical System analysis is an important concept to learn for anyone interested in complex systems, especially biology. This is in general a well-taught class with many examples of different research which utilizes dynamical system approaches. More physics\/math oriented people can probably learn by themselves however.",
    "Yes. I very much liked this class, and I think that it will likely improve over time as the material is refined and the structure solidified. The subject matter is profound and beautiful and I loved learning about it. The structure of assignments was reasonable though sometimes a little chaotic. Strongly recommend for anyone studying any biological field."
