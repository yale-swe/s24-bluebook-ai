   "comments": [
    "If you're looking at this class, you probably have to take it - but don't worry about it. It's just like CHEM 222L, except you already know all the techniques and there are slightly fewer post-lab assignments. You get out of lab even early than first semester too - I was out by 3 several times.",
    "Definitely take it",
    "Like every lab class at Yale, I would summarize this with the phrase: \"read the procedure, follow the procedure, copy down the procedure, type up the procedure.\" Put explicitly, THIS CLASS WAS AN AWFUL WASTE OF TIME. (But if you're reading this review right now, you probably already know that, because all of premed at Yale feels like this.) Christine DiMeglio and Kate Otley were both absolutely lovely, and did their best to make the time spent in CHEM223L bearable, but it wasn't. Labs were dull and repetitive; each one consisted of 1 hour of basic synthesis stuff and then 2 hours of the same laboratory tests to \"confirm the identity of the product\" (which we already knew...). It felt like we were performing the same experiment every day, and it was an experiment that no one seemed to actually enjoy performing. SUGGESTION: MAKE THIS CLASS INTO A REAL 0.5 CREDIT COURSE BY ELIMINATING SOME OF THE LABS, ALL OF THE DUMB EPS, AND SOME OF THE LAME POST-LAB ASSIGNMENTS.",
    "Chem 222L is the natural continuation of Chem 223L and is just as awesome. Great, laid back class, with the weekly EP assignments and the regular post-labs, which usually do not require that much work since you've got the general structure already laid out from the previous post-labs you've written. This is a class you will definitely enjoy if you're majoring in chemistry or in a related field, but I would recommend to anybody to be honest, since it is engaging and does not require that much work.",
    "Take this if it's required. It's miles better than gen. chem. lab and you'll actually learn something in doing the lab reports",
    "Very nice, laid-back class. Definitely a good balance of workload for the half credit.",
    "Orgo II lab is what you would expect after Orgo I lab, its laid back, low stress, Dr DiMeglio is wonderful, the TFs are prepared, the course material is presented clearly, and the material is structured in such a way that you will learn the material well. There are only a handful of write ups that are graded fairly so long as you do them well. I actually looked forward to my lab section each week! This is not a pre-med requirement that you should dread in the least.",
    "This course really is fun! You get to perform all the reactions that you hear about in orgo lecture and in the process get the opportunity to synthesize materials that aren't even industrially manufactured. The work is about the same as first semester lab, but since you already are familiar with the format of EP's and PL's, it seems to be a lot less. Additionally, your grade isn't depended upon the outcome of each lab, so that really takes the pressure off.",
    "Similar to CHEM 222L; would definitely recommend. Workload wasn't too bad aside from a couple of post-labs, which were manageable.",
    "Much better than gen chem lab. Very similar to Chem 222L, but instead of learning how to do TLC, IR, etc., you do these techniques for every lab. Lab exam format is basically the same.",
    "Organic chemistry lab is one of the easiest labs at Yale. The workload is very manageable and the actual lab times are not bad at all. The reactions mainly make use of previously learned techniques.",
    "Should be worth a full credit with the amount of work, but only half of one.",
    "Good lab, don't know why you would take it unless you need it though.",
    "Very similar to first semester. Relaxed and not a lot of work.",
    "Yes. Easy, pretty fun lab course. Just like first semester.",
    "Great lab; not a lot of work, and the experiments were useful for anyone interested in research.",
    "This was a good lab. Mostly synthesis with some NMR. A good orgo lab course and fairly low key for a lab class.",
    "Relatively easy lab for pre-meds! Its way better than gen-chem lab, that has a considerable but manageable work load.",
    "it's a lab for organic, so expect to be doing organic. It's very hands-on though and does get you very used to synthesis labs! Much preferred in my opinion to gen chem lab, it feels a lot more interesting and applied, even more than first semester lab",
    "You most likely have to take this class anyway, but it is well taught. It's not too much work, and it's more relaxed than the first semester.",
    "it's a rather fun lab, and kind of even felt like a 0.5 credit class. There were only a couple lab reports to write up, and the rest of the postlabs were short.",
    "Not bad",
    "A pretty good class. Certainly a more engaging lab than gen. chem. lab, though still a lot of work for just half a credit. There are a lot of people in the lab so you don't see a whole lot of Professor DiMeglio, but she usually makes her rounds around the lab and is very nice.",
    "Definitely. You're taking it because you have to, but it's not a painful experience at all.",
    "It is a very good lab course. There is quite of busy work, but it's expected.",
    "This lab is a lot more interesting than the previous semester because of you get to apply the techniques you've already learned. Professor DiMeglio is amazing! She's really friendly and helpful, and always checks in individually with each student during lab.",
    "Exactly like Chem 222, and experiments take a little less time because you're familiar with the techniques.",
    "It is a solid class for organic chemistry lab techniques. You will be very skillful in lab after taking this class.",
    "Take it. Second semester is great. You do a lot of synthesis reactions and labs can get kind of long, but if you take it, you probably have to anyways.",
    "Yes",
    "Overall, a good and fun lab especially with Professor DiMeglio!",
    "Super chill lab. Same experimental techniques over and over again. Easiest lab I've taken.",
    "Interesting and nice change from other classes in that you get to do things that are applicable to organic chemistry.",
    "Great continuation of 222L. DiMeglio rocks.",
    "Typical organic chemistry lab. The labs are for the most part short. You only have to do 2 full lab reports and 5 or 6 post-lab assignments. You are probably taking this because you're pre-med, so you'll do the work because you have to.",
    "This lab is great. Prof DiMeglio understands that it's a 1\/2 credit class. Only had like 5 assignments, only 2 of which were full lab reports, and had 2 weeks to do each of them.",
    "Orgo lab was really fun compared to the class, and it was not stressful either. I had a really fun and nice TA, so I had a great learning experience. Most of the labs were synthesis labs as compared to the techniques labs during first semester. I highly recommend taking this lab because you learn a lot of lab procedures and you also make some cool-looking products.",
    "Yes. Good lab. Way better than gen chem.",
    "A natural continuation of CHEM 222L with more focus on organic synthesis. It's a really great way to improve your confidence with the lab techniques you learned in the fall, and the instructors in this class are all very supportive.",
    "It is a required class for many areas (premed, chem, MBB, etc..). But it is definitely not difficult. As long as you do all the assignments you will be fine.",
    "Very similar to first semester orgo lab.",
    "Not much work, only 2 full write ups. Take it.",
    "Lab is lab. I am a potential chem major who loves orgo and this semester was definitely more interesting than first semester, but also more time-intensive. Reports are long and annoying to write.",
    "Orgo lab 2 is an awesome course. Definitely would recommend.",
    "This course was one of my favorite labs so far. The experiments were interesting and pertinent to what we were learning in lecture. However, this lab suits freshman orgo much better than the sophomore equivalent. That said, this lab helped fill in the gaps that freshmen learned that sophomores won't, such as Diels-Alder reactions.",
    "Low stress if you have a chill TA. Much more synthesis, but DiMeglio doesn't make it too much work.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this lab to anyone with an interest in chemistry; I absolutely loved it. As great as CHEM 222L was, I found 223L to be even better. Once you have the basic techniques and concepts down from the first semester portion of the sequence, the second semester allows you to apply them to full synthesis and characterization labs, which I found to be so much fun (the peach oil especially!). Dr. DiMeglio is moreover a terrific instructor and a great deal of the reason why the lab is so much fun. She is very kind and accommodating and often offered helpful guidance as she walked around to check in on students during lab. (Plus, they play good music while you work, which makes the environment particularly relaxing and enjoyable.) The course provides a very good grounding in organic chemistry laboratory techniques, application of organic chemistry concepts to the laboratory setting, and skills of general importance to scientists, including scientific writing, record keeping, and organization. It was a great experience, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend it.",
    "Pretty much exactly like the first semester of lab, except a little better because you are now familiar with the assignments and the grading. The lab final was also a little better because I knew what to study. Since I was in sophomore orgo, the biological pathways one, the lab course does not completely correspond to what I was learning in lecture. Overall, one of the better labs I have taken, and I assume anyone considering taking this class has to take it anyway.",
    "You're taking it because you have to, clearly. It's a pretty good lab, but it can get a little boring. Basically you do a bunch of synthesis reactions, learn a little more about instrumentation such as NMR. More work than last semester in terms of post labs and lab reports. Professor DiMeglio is lovely as always.",
    "This is a great class that is a lot of work (for a 0.5 credit course). However, it is very worthwhile, and it complements Organic Chemistry II very effectively. Definitely recommended!",
    "This is one of the better labs I have taken, but if you're taking it it's most likely because you have to.",
    "This class is good practice of the lab techniques taught in Chem 222L.",
    "Good Chem course, much more fun that gen chem.",
    "Take it! Why not!",
    "Orgo lab is fun, doesn't take nearly as long as the time allotted to it, and you don't have many post lab assignments (only two full lab reports!)",
    "2 lab reports. An EP every week. You carry out similar procedures every week so it gets a bit repetitive, but the work load is manageable. Just like CHEM 222, but you get out of lab a lot earlier every week. Usually around 3:30 or 4.",
    "This course makes orgo lab accessible and interesting.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably don't have a choice. That being said, I have heard that compared to the other lab courses at Yale, this is probably one of the better ones. Depending on your TA, your grades might be screwed, but it is very straightforward. exactly like orgo I lab",
    "Even though I hadn't taken organic chemistry since my sophomore year, I was able to get through this fun lab. Each lab is short (~2.5 hours), and you make the smell of peaches! One of the better lab courses offered at Yale.",
    "Overall, a very good lab. My only complaint is that lab reports are graded very arbitrarily-- one loses tons of points on formatting and miscellaneous things that have no scientific-basis.",
    "Continuation of Orgo Lab I. Techniques from Orgo Lab I will be combined in labs that demonstrate reactions that are studied in lecture. The course was interesting but got repetitive.",
    "After the first semester of orgo lab, this is a lot easier. The procedures and write-ups are exactly what you're used to, and you get to do many more fun experiments. Labs are shorter, taking about two hours each, and although you have two full lab reports, there isn't really a lot of work to do every week. The reactions complemented freshman orgo nicely too. Don't be afraid of this lab!",
    "Great lab!",
    "I took the class because I had to, and chances are if you're even considering this course it's because you have to too! No worries, it's one of the more easy-going labs that you'll have to take.",
    "The labs are short, not too difficult. You'll be out after 2.5 hours on most days. Only a few full write ups, which take a good amount of time, but not really that many.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "CHEM 223L is as good a lab class as you're going to find. Prof. DiMeglio is great, and the lab is fun to be in, with music playing and many partner labs. You learn a lot, and really cement the basic skills necessary for a chemistry lab. I definitely recommend this class if you need to take a chem lab for your major\/premed.",
    "The epitome of what a lab course should be. Clearly taught, a nice balance of preparation and in class learning, and not disastrously difficult to keep up work wise.",
    "Take it if you have to, and don't take it if you don't have to. If you do, it'll be fun, but nonetheless it is more work on your schedule, and it takes up a good chunk of an afternoon every week.",
    "This lab is a lot more fun than first semester's; now that you know all the techniques, you get to do syntheses! This also means that some labs are shorter.",
    "This is your standard organic chemistry lab. It is a good continuation from last semester, and it meshes well with the lecture content. I do wish that the TAs and the students were better appraised of the grading distributions throughout the course. Overall, it is a fun class; though labs sometimes run longer than anticipated, they often finish early.",
    "I genuinely liked this Organic II Chemistry Lab. I learned a lot about the application of the reactions we learned in class and felt more comfortable with the background information. The general atmosphere was nice, music and teachers\/TAs were always helpful. Definitely if you can have the TA Eric get him. He was super helpful during lab and genuinely loved chemistry.",
    "You are most likely taking this class because you have to. It's essentially a repeat of first semester, so it's pretty boring.",
    "This lab class is a good continuation of first semester orgo chem lab, and basically teaches you more techniques and reviews old techniques learned in the last semester. It also covers new reactions and NMR, which is always useful to know. I would recommend this class to everyone who is interested in Orgo, since for me it was a really fun class!",
    "I mean, this is probably necessary. It's really boring and you don't really learn anything but I guess you get to apply what you learn in orgo to lab.",
    "I would recommend this course. Out of all the Chem labs you will have to take as a pre med, this will be the best one.",
    "It's a good and organized course. Nothing especially special, but nevertheless, good. It teaches you the basics and reinforces concepts you're supposed to learn in class. We also learned NMR since we didn't get to it in the lecture course. If you're thinking about taking the course, then it's probably a requirement for you. It's a low stress class--much less tedious than General Chem Lab. The radio is on and the lab people are friendly. Dr. DiMeglio was very enthusiastic and caring. She always smiles and makes lab a nice experience.",
    "It's harder than the first semester of lab, but definitely a must. Take it.",
    "Experiments representative of the mechanisms learned in Orgo 2.",
    "This course was an awesome lab course. Professor DiMeglio clearly cares a lot about her students and does whatever it takes to make all of them proficient in the lab, regardless of their prior experience\/ability. My TA was also great, answering questions well, often beyond what we needed to know, grading in a timely manner, and making himself very accessible for questions outside of lab. The music during lab was also nice.",
    "It was a good course, very much like the first semester of orgo lab. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "The course is a lot like 222L but with a few more reports and without the hassle of learning new techniques. If you remember anything from 222L, this class should not be hard. Put in a few quality hours a week and you should do fine. In summary, it was a pretty chill course that took some effort but not much time.",
    "Probably one of the better lab experiences you will have!",
    "Great class! Not too much work, the labs are fun (especially since you're already comfortable with the techniques learned in 222L).",
    "As per usual, one of those required courses. But do not despair! 223L is tolerable. As you'll know from 222L, the course is really organized and the TA's are helpful. Professor DiMeglio is really sweet and incredibly helpful. You might even get lucky and have the same TA as the previous semester. Not much harder than 222L and there is definitely less inane stuff. The labs usually get out around 3:30, btu expect to stay later on 1\/2 of them this semester. There are also some that are really short, where you'll be out by 2:30\/3.",
    "Pretty much like first semester, still a great class.",
    "A good lab credit. Not much relevance to chem230 but it is fun.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. The class was very fair, interactive, and the concepts built upon one another very nicely!",
    "Chem 223 is a continuation of first semester. Some of the reactions are more complicated and build on things learned in the previous semester, but the workload is largely the same. Very laid back atmosphere.",
    "This is a great course. Every week you get to synthesize a new compound, which is very exciting.",
    "Second semester orgo lab is more of the same from first semester, usually synthesis labs every week, two big lab reports with several smaller ones scattered throughout. You learn a lot and I found it interesting.",
    "This lab is fun and straightforward. Just be diligent with formatting and following the course packet. Hopefully, you'll get a good TA.",
    "CHEM 223L is a standard laboratory class following CHEM 222L that is best taken in conjunction to the second semester of organic chemistry because it reinforces many of the concepts (i.e. reactions, mechanisms, compounds, etc.) learned. It is a class that is standard for chemistry\/biology\/pre-medical studies. As long as you review all of the experiments before performing them in lab and answer all of the exam review questions for the final, you will have a firm grasp of the concepts learned in this class!",
    "This course can be a great experience (because Dr. DiMeglio is amazing), but it REALLY depends on the TA. Make sure you don't get a section with Angela if you're not looking to get points off for every agonizing detail like word choice or \"size\" of structures."
