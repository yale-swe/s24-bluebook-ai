    "Absolutely take this course with Professor Singh. The time you put into preparing for discussion is always worth it. One of the best seminars that I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommmend this course to other students. Seminars are interesting and the readings are not only interesting, but also definitely very worthwhile material for discussion.",
    "Professor did a great job of encouraging discussion, but I wish he shared more of his own analyses. As a result, a lot of the analysis done in class was not very deep. Learned a lot, but did not learn as much as I hoped about the relationship between religion and politics."
