   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic course for those interested in the discourse about science and religion. Not only are Professors Bailyn and Viefhues-Baiely great as individual teachers, but they work as a dynamite team, too. The readings for this course vary greatly, and sometimes it really helps to read ahead in order not to fall behind. You also get free food and have conversations with brilliant guest professors.",
    "Awesome class, highly philosophical so be prepared for something that's not really a standard science or religious studies class",
    "Yes, I would. It is a great way to approach the issues of science and religion free from popular conception. Both of the professors are simply wonderful and you walk away feeling truly enlightened.",
    "If you can, take this class. If you're already thinking about it, it's for you. This was the best course I took at Yale because it dealt with questions I had been grappling with for a long time. I feel that now I have the tools I need to begin asking the right questions in the science\/religion debate. A great experience!",
    "If you're interested in the relationship between science and religion, there is no better environment for exploring it than this class. At the end of the semester you will be able to form an intelligent and educated opinion about various sides of the religion\/science question. The readingis fun and not too lengthy, but the papers are difficult because you really have to think about what you're saying. Both professors are awesome.",
    "An attempt to complicate the duality of science and religion, see how the two might be more similar than we think, how the biases we bring when approaching each one affect the exploration that we do.",
    "Take if you are interested in the science-religion relationship, especially when it concerns cosmology. One of the strengths of the course is the diversity of its perspectives, both in its instruction (joint-taught by an astronomy professor and a religious studies professor) and in the authors read. Seminar discussion ranges from the cultural roots and impact of the science-religion tension to philosophical examinations of specific arguments. A rewarding class where you come away with greater perspective no matter where you come from."
