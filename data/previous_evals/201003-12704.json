   "comments": [
    "It's a disorganized lecture course that could have been interesting but never reached present day topics, and had one of the worst TAs I've ever had at Yale. A lot of potential and a huge disappointment.",
    "Take this class. I hate lectures and I'm not much of a history person, but I absolutely loved this class. Master Pitti is an amazing speaker and the material was extremely interesting. Not only did we trace the history of the borderland region, but we were able to connect it to the very relevant immigration debate occurring now.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class and recommend that it be followed up with Professor Joseph's Mexico: 19th century to present lecture. Both lectures, in my opinion, complement each other quite nicely and provide students with an in depth knowledge of the US's relationship to its southern neighbor.",
    "Yes, I think that the information is important and extremely relevant. The work is not overwhelming and if you are interested in the subject the class will be a great and worthwhile experience.",
    "This class is a really excellent way to look at a culture that is not well known to people on the East Coast. The Chicano movement and the presence of Latinos in this country is becoming increasingly important to what we eat, how we speak, the way that elections turn out and a number of other things. Pitti is an excellent professor and he teaches this class in a less traditional way (in terms of sources etc.) that makes it really enjoyable.",
    "It's a great course that really gives you a history of the border region. It is however, a HISTORY class. I was kind of hoping for more modern info, and while that was touched upon, it was definitely not the main topic. The work isn't that bad, and the material is very interesting.",
    "i would NOT recommend this course. the lectures were not that exciting and the readings were dull.",
    "U.S. Mexico Borderlands is a great class if you have any interest at all in the subject. Pitti's lectures are always informative and interesting, and he gives you an outline before lecture so it's not difficult to follow the important points. The reading can get a little heavy at times, but as long as you do it the tests aren't incredibly difficult. I had never taken a class in any of these departments before, and I feel like this was a really good way to start.",
    "Very good overview of history of this region - definitely a survey course - doesnt get TOO in depth with any one topic but take it for sure if you want to learn about this stuff",
    "It has a lot of interesting readings, a great teacher who gives awesome lectures, and is very thought provoking. There's a lot we don't know about the history of the Southwest and it is relevant to more places than Arizona and Texas. Take this class!You will not regret it!",
    "I would say that this is a great HISTORY course on the border region. If you're looking for current events, this is not the place to go, although it will give you the historical context FOR those current events. An engaging, fun course with an engaging, beautiful professor. Overall, I am DEFINITELY glad that I took this course.",
    "I recommend the class. It's a lot of work but it'll be worth it if you're interested in the topic.",
    "Survey of Mexican-American history over the last 160 principally from the labor and social and cultural sides, not so much the hard politics side. You talk about strikes,about exploitation, about labor, about women leaders - in this way it's a very progressive history class, breaking away from the political realm that normally dominates.",
    "Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the Borderlands taught by Professor Pitti is a great class. Very interesting. The lectures went beyond the hard facts to really focus on the cultural and social issues that shaped the Mexican-American experience in the Borderlands since the Mexican-American War. Professor Pitti used a wide medium of sources \u0096 weekly PowerPoint, songs, short movie clips, documentary, and primary documents. Workload was not bad: weekly readings and online reading response, midterm, final, and two papers. The readings are all online \u0096 no textbook or course packet\u0097which is nice.Take this class! It's very interesting, Professor Pitti is great, and the course fulfills distribution requirements (WR and HU).",
    "i would definitely recommend this class to anyone!",
    "This is a great class that teaches all about the US-Mexico border problem, focusing more on the history of the border. I wish that the class had talked a bit more about contemporary issues. I still loved the class though.",
    "Excellent class, take it. The course load is not too demanding, in fact the course assignments give you so much free range than you can write about most anything that interests you from the course. The lecture material contains some very interesting history, especially towards the more modern second half of the course.",
    "AMST 213 is a strong introduction to the history of the US Borderlands. The class covers a lot of interesting and surprising material and Professor Pitti does a great job of sketching out some of the major changes in the region in the last century and a half. The workload is reasonable and the two papers are actually fun to write. The class is not focused on contemporary politics (although learning about the history of places like California and Texas certainly helped inform my understanding of news on the area) so if you're looking for a contemporary course this isn't for you. But if you'd like to learn about missions, squatters, folk healers, the Zoot Suit Riots, labor politics and the Bracero program, take it!",
    "I highly recommend this course. The lectures were always interesting and comprehensive. The amount of reading assigned each week was not overwhelming and it was nice that all of the course materials were on the class website. The mid-term and final were essentially the same structure with the same amount of questions, and the final only covered the material after the midterm."
