    "LING 180 is a course that deals with various concepts and problems in morphology, with reference to both syntax and phonology. I would recommend it to another student; I found it useful and interesting.",
    "Morphology is fun! I can't say how it will be once Dasha's gone.",
    "It's a shame Dasha's leaving next year because Morphology with her is awesome. You get a lot of interesting data and questions, although oftentimes you may be frustrated with the lack of a clear answer for many of them. As with much theoretical linguistics, sometimes it gets very abstract. It's a good synthesis of your knowledge of phonology and morphology though. Also, the paper is a lot of fun to write if you pick a good topic!",
    "I would, though the professor who taught it my year will no longer be teaching it. It's a class that only attracts ling majors, so it's a small group that gets to know each other well. You'll learn a lot.",
    "Yes! Whether or not you are a linguistics major - this is an exciting class and the workload is as big as you make it!I know the class says that Phonology and Syntax are pre-requisites, but there were definitely a couple of kids who haven't taken one of them and at least one kids who has not taken either, and they both seemed to be doing okay!In terms of workload, 5\/6 homework assignments are \"go write about something interesting,\" which can take 2 hours if you're lazy and ANY NUMBER of hours if you feel like putting more work into it."
