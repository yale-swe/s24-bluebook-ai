    "Good class.",
    "This is everything that is wrong with Yale engineering. A boring lecturer teaching boring material in a dungeon at 9 AM. No effort was made by the professor to bring the material to life, and everything he taught was posted in slides on classesV2. CENG people, do not take. ENVE, you have to and hopefully whoever teaches it next year presents the material in a palatable form.",
    "EnvE 377 is a good balance between qualitative and quantitative information on water quality control. It gets a little confusing toward the end of the course as wastewater treatment was taught at a fairly fast pace. Overall, not very painful of a course.",
    "I would recommend Environmental Engineering 377 to a fellow student. Prof. Mitch won't be the professor though, so I'm not sure how the class will be taught.",
    "If you are an env. eng. you have to take this. If you don't, take it if you are interested in water and may pursue it as a career path. The material is manageable if you put enough time into studying and practicing problems. It's not a bad class but it's not great"
