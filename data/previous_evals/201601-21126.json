   "comments": [
    "PLSC 148 was the worst class I have taken at Yale. It is a disjointed, low-level overview to a variety of topics within the realm of human rights. This was the second year that the course was offered, yet it seemed at though the instructors had not learned anything from the prior year. While we were assigned readings from a law school textbook, discussion was generally surface level and not nuanced. The days when I learned the most were the times when we had guest lecturers come to class.",
    "This course was the worst class I have taken at Yale. The lectures were disorganized and hard to follow. The reading did not always seem relevant. I feel very unsatisfied.",
    "This class has some interesting material, but it is not organized well. The two teacher method really doesn't work, and the readings were often dense. I wouldn't recommend it under the current instructors.",
    "Human rights theory and politics is a survey course of various human rights issues and institutions and how they interact with the law and culture. Until the course is reformatted, I would not recommend it though the subject matter and guest lectures are really interesting.",
    "I absolutely loved the material in this course, but the teaching was very strange and disorganized. Professors Simon and Miller were constantly interrupting each other or going off on tangents just between the two of them that were unrelated to class material. Whoever was not lecturing that day would sit on the side and periodically interrupt, and it felt like there was a visible tension between them for the entire semester. I would gladly take another course with either of them separately (when they were teaching, they were great) but never again a jointly taught course.",
    "Ehhh I think this course is better than earlier iterations but it still needs a lot of work. Cant recommend it at the moment, exams were kinda crappy as were about 50% of the readings. Section was weak, professors at times were disorganized. Now that I think about it, other than a handful of lectures and some of the readings, I dint think I really learned anything useful in this course.",
    "Don't take it in its current form, you'll waste a class imo. unless you are looking for an easy fifth class",
    "A disaster of a class. The professors do not get along, the syllabus is a mess, the examinations were poorly written-- the only redeeming factors were the good TA and the guest lecturers. This class is truly a mess and needs massive reorganization before it can be anything worth taking.",
    "PLSC 148 is a good starting point for at least being introduced to all kinds of human rights issues, but it takes a great deal of energy investment to walk away from the course feeling like you've really assimilated the frameworks for thinking about rights in a rigorous way. In a roundabout way, that may be one of the course's strengths, actually, in presenting rights as a complicated regime and in raising far more questions than answers. I think it communicated something very true about rights discourse in so doing. That said, I would certainly recommend this course.",
    "This class is in need of serious restructuring. It's a small class but conducted as a lecture with limited student engagement. Professor Ali Miller is brilliant, but Professor David Simon is a poor lecturer and hard to engage with in class. The readings are extensive, and while some are interesting, it's hard to stay on track with even looking at everything that's been assigned. I did not enjoy this class and would not recommend it unless you are a student in the human rights program who is required to take it, or until the class undergoes extensive restructuring.",
    "This class is a great intro to human rights. Most of the class is in the Human Rights Scholars program (I was not) although that didn't come up very often. It was nice that everyone was passionate about these issues and already very knowledgeable for the most part. The set up of the class it a bit peculiar - two professors, lots of scattered readings, some guest lecturers (of varying quality), extra readings and material covered in section. The actual grading was not overly difficult but the class really tried to cram a lot in. I actually loved this class although I know some students found it to be very dry because there was a focus on the legal tools, bureaucratic structures and such.",
    "It really teaches you a lot about human rights",
    "The course is useful to understand a broad review of aspects of \"human rights\" and associated methods. If you are in the Human Rights Program, you'll have to take it. The class provides a good starting point to be able to attend Schell Center events and converse somewhat intelligently with attendees. Beware of overeager kids trying to get into law school!",
    "Don't take this course unless you're in the Human Rights Program and have to take it. If you're in the program, petition to change it. There are far better courses, mainly seminars, on human rights at Yale, that explore a less scattered array of issues in more depth and with a more clear theme to the semester.",
    "It is a survey course, with varied levels of depth in each theme of Human Rights.",
    "Overall, the course has very weak instructors and grading standards, and should be advertised as a class for people interested in THINKING about human rights, not for people doing human rights work. I would not recommend unless you are REALLY passionate about human rights theory and politics (not necessarily practice) and ready to sit through many incoherent lectures and accept arbitrarily graded assignments.",
    "PLSC 148 will force you to reexamine your notion of human rights and empower you with knowledge due its fundamental universality. I would recommend the class to a fellow student."
