   "comments": [
    "It was an excellent course.Strenghts: Provided important tools for understanding markets.-was taught in a very clear and engaging way-had an appropriate courseload\/difficulty-exams tested indepth knowledge of the materialWeaknesses:-transitions from topic to topic was at times weak",
    "Good classMy first intro to economics.. loved itconcepts explained in a terse and practical examples given to aid understanding",
    "Great! I love this course",
    "This course would be better suited for twice a week and taught more as a true introductory class and leave more time to discuss actual economic issues affecting health care. The instructor was very responsive to feed back but he has a hard time teaching economics at an introductory level.",
    "Interesting subject matter, instructor improved a lot and the subject got easier over the course of the semester.",
    "Strength: The material gives a good understanding of the core concepts of microeconomics.",
    "Very interesting, especially for those with no background in econ. However, the first half of the course is also a bit challenging for those with no background in economics. It would be helpful to have a textbook and fewer \"fun\" articles the first few weeks to gain a solid basis before moving forward.",
    "It is a great course. It gives a good presentation of the basics of microeconomics and applies the principles to health care. We got all of the tools we needed to assess healthcare from an economic perspective. The weekly homework assignments were challenging, and helped to clarify what you know and what yo don't know. I think it gave me skills that I will use throughout my career.",
    "The material is a bit hard to comprehend if you have not taken economics.",
    "Weakness- Doesn't always progress in logical order and lecture can be a bit disconnected. It also assumes that everyone has an economics background. There could be more time spent on the application of economic to health care.",
    "Exempted from this class",
    "Strengths:Covers a wide range of economic concepts.Places concepts into the health care context.Real life examples were able to highlight the practical relevance.Weaknesses:It might be helpful to provide more mathematical context.Suggestions:That said, students might not be equally prepared to take advantage from a more mathematical presentation. Thus, a general improvement opportunity is to provide a mathematical compendium prior to starting the MPH so that everyone is somewhat on the same level. Complaints about not having been prepared mathematically are a recurring theme among students from biostats to economics. So this might be helpful as a general comment.",
    "The course and instructor were excellent. Particular strengths include his accessability for answering questions and his patience, both of which show he really cares whether his students are learning or not.",
    "Great introduction course. Relevant to Health Care practitioners.",
    "The course is critical for the students and should be spread out to having class twice a week instead of once. There is a lot of material to cover, and I feel that I didn't take away as much as I would like to. Professor McKee was very perceptive to the students' concerns but sometimes had a hard time explaining simple points. Nonetheless, he spent extra time with the students to fully gather his thoughts and made sure to answer any questions.",
    "This is a well designed course that move at an appropriate pace.",
    "N\/A - technically not enrolled in this course. Passed out.",
    "strength: good for econ beginners, very basic principles taughtweakness: the instructor cannot make himself clear lots of times, he will get confused himself in the middle of explanation of a concept, which is quite disturbing for students.",
    "The course provided a great overview of economics for healthcare professionals. Great examples were used, and the lectures were very interesting and helpful.",
    "useful and easy to catch"

    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0The instructor was lively, engaging, clear and understanding. One of the best taught classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Good instructorhas a lot of knowledge on the subject, probably is time constrained in class... But if approached in office hours with questions, provides depth of insights.Facilitates learning, with examples both in class and on HW..",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0He's great! details oriented and very nice to students",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0The instructor is very responsive to feedback and he is enthusiastic and interested in his students. He also improved as the semester went on. He tries very hard to be helpful. He isn't the greatest at explaining basic economics concepts in class though.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Very knowledgeable, friendly and approachable. Initially difficult to follow because he presented too much material, but that got easier and he restructured the class to cut down on the excess information. Very receptive to feedback, and willing to accomodate students' requests.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Very enthusiastic and fair istructor.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Prof. McKee is great- very sensitive to the level of econ background for everyone in the course, and wonderful lectures second half of the course (first half some of the lectures were a little overwhelming...) Would be ideal to have the course twice a week- a few more hours at the beginning of the semester would have been great. Loved the course!",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug gives great presentations, and uses a lot of examples, which is exceptionally helpful to understanding the information. He was easily approachable and answered questions well.",

    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Best instructor of the semester, hands down. great",

    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0I wish he could make himself more clear, thinking of good examples prior to class rather than struglling with coming up with one in the middle of a class. Be more prepared, especially with the quesitons students may pop up.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0The instructor was interactive with students and provided a great overview of economic analysis on market supply\/demand within US healthcare system. His powerpoint slides were very informative and thorough. More examples and problem sets are recommended;however, weekly problem sets were very helpful.",

    "TA is nice!",
    "Kimi was very accessible and accomodating--more so than most of the TAs this semester. My suggestion for the future would be for the TA to actually do the problem sets before office hours because more than once, she guided us through things the wrong way and then realized it was wrong and started over. It made things confusing and wasted time. However, even more so than that, I would recommend that an actual economics grad student be the TA because they can help with basic questions and concepts that Doug isn't always equipped to explain. Then students are hearing the same information in a different way.",

    "Kimi Kushner - Excellent: friendly, approachable, knowledgeable on the subject matter and very helpful. A+!",
    "TA was excellent, provided good feedback.",

    "Kimi is absolutely wonderful. Definite teaching talent! Found TA sessions very helpful in my studies.",
    "The TA was excellent for this course. She really understood the material and created a reference base of notes just in case she stumbled upon a tough concept. She provided guidance through the course and allowed the students to talk out problems during office hours. By far, she really helped clarify a lot of the confusing topics.",

    "This course provide basic economic knowledge and prepare you for advanced electives. It's great! have a nice connection between econ and healthcare.",
    "It is a very quick intro to economics where you learn an abbreviated version of the basics. You would probably get more out of a true intro to microeconomics class.",
    "Yes - material is very useful for students of health policy and those interested in health economics in general.",
    "A good course that has the purpose of providing you with a solid foundation in terms of microeconomics.",
    "A little dense in the beginning, especially for those with no microeconomics background, but overall great. Second half of the course very interesting (and second to last lecture is fabulous!).",

    "The syllabus addressed a wide range of economic techniques and principals and placed them in a helpful manner into the context of health care. Overall a very interesting course.",
    "Very good introductory course. Would like to learn more about the subject.",
    "I would say this course is rigorous but doable. The content is a lot and the information is very applicable to everyday life. Overall, I would highly recommend this course, but just be aware that the extra TA office hours will be very helpful!",
    "This was an excellent overview of the basic principles of microeconomics. The course gives you the tools necessary to think and evaluate problems like an economist. The course is engaging and the professor is excellent. I would recommend this course even for non-HPA\/HMP students.",
