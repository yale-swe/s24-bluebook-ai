    "This is required for the environmental engineering major but I recommend talking to the DUS and taking the analogous course in the school of forestry instead.",
    "Since Professor Wallis is retiring it\u0092s hard to give useful adviceto future students. The material is challenging enough that I would advise at least some caution regardless of who is teaching it. But other than that the course has a blank slate now."
