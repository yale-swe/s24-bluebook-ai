   "comments": [
    "super interesting. the readings are great and informative, probably more so than class time. though there is way too much reading. it is unnecessarily excessive considering we just go over the exact same stuff in class.",
    "It's a decent amount of reading but it's important material to know and you learn a lot about the healthcare system.",
    "It's an ok class. A bit stressful since the final is 50% of your grade and the essay questions really just can't be answered properly in that time frame. Lectures aren't the most engaging, and overall the class lacks structure, but the material taught is good.",
    "The information and readings were very interesting, and I would recommend the course if you plan on doing the readings, but not necessarily otherwise. The workload is extremely light, so if you are looking for a gut, this could be a good class.",
    "yeah, I'd recommend the course. It was interesting and is important stuff to know, even if you're not going into the health professions or into politics."
