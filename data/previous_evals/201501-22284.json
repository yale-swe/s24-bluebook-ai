   "comments": [
    "A cool class for anybody that likes manuscripts and the idea of spending a few hours a week looking at them in the Beinecke. We saw tons of amazing stuff that I wouldn't have known to look for otherwise, and it was a once in a lifetime kind of opportunity because of that. That's the great strength of this course; beyond the manuscripts, it's actually pretty dull... I'm surprised by how uninteresting the class managed to be given the seemingly exciting concept. If you do take it with Katherine and Agnieszka, make sure to hound them for consistent feedback, because the advice they gave me changed so much from paper to paper than I was unable to make heads or tails of it.",
    "Absolutely recommend! Katherine and Agnieszka led one of my favorite classes at Yale. Assignments were perfectly spaced out, readings were doable, and class discussion was fascinating. They are both willing to go the extra mile to help with research. The history department should okay any class that they suggest. I would take this class again if I were able -- definitely one of the best at Yale. They are also so knowledgeable on the subject. I would recommend this course and Katherine and Agnieszka without any reservations.",
    "Some of the historical medical practices we discussed were entertaining to learn about, so I think most students would be interested in part of this class, though it is better when a student is familiar with modern medicine so they can make the comparison. The main reason why I would recommend this class to another student is the Beinecke aspect. So many students don't make use of the manuscripts and books here and the class was great for adding context to the Beinecke's holdings. Also, the final paper was really whatever we wanted it to be. Students were allowed to study something that really interested them, and that is always a plus.",
    "This was a great class. You learn a lot about everything in the class name (magic, science, and medicine), and you get to work with texts from the Beinecke. If it's ever offered again, definitely try to take it.",
    "This is a VERY unique learning opportunity. If you have the chance to take it, then you absolutely should. The quantity of manuscripts from the Beinecke that you get to access and examine and learn about is unparalleled at any university in the country (at least to my knowledge.) Katherine and Agnieszka were great and always helpful. A couple things to think about-the readings are generally boring and extremely dense. This is the nature of the topic and the historical period, but unfortunate nonetheless. Also, knowing Latin would give you an advantage for the final paper if you are planning on examining lesser known primary sources. Also, while the title of the course might make it seem as though this class is comical-that is very very false. Medieval magic is a rigorous academic discipline and was thought to be in tune with science and medicine 500 years ago. Just because magic is a marginalized part of our society today does not mean that was the case in the Middle Ages. You will learn about demons and necromancers and witches, but also study the rationality of such subjects. Good course and highly recommended.",
    "A very interesting class. You will learn about things you would have never looked into otherwise. Take it. It's good. OLD BOOKS. YES.",
    "I would recommend it. It was a fun course, but definitely challenging if you don't know about the material. Your writing will improve but only with a good deal of hard work. The material itself was interesting, but I don't think it will be something applicable in the rest of my academic career. That being said - it was cool to learn about something so different and to explore Beinecke!",
    "Medieval Magic Science and Medicine is a great course that exposes you to a variety of the beinecke's resources, as well as provides an interesting look at scientific practices in medieval europe. Katherine and Agnieszka made the course due to their enthusiasm and knowledge. Every class was exciting and fun. Must take!"
