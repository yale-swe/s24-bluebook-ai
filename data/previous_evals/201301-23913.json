    "This was truly an amazing studio. I was intrigued by the brief but did not know what to expect from Zaha and Patrik as teachers. They turned out to be amazing.Zaha and Patrik and Simon and Lasha provided the resources that we needed (particularly the intensive four day workshop with Shajay Booshan from ZHA) to adopt a methodology that was foreign to most of the students before starting this semester. This studio embodied the strengths of the atelier model that is so prevalent for the advanced studios at Yale, namely that students fully adopt the working methodology and ideology of the critics for a semester. It was very challenging and also rewarding. I know that they have taught the shell structures studio in Vienna as well, and I think that the three week exercise of physical form finding models was quite useful for this version.I hope that Zaha and Patrik teach at Yale again in the near future.",
    "The overall experience of Zaha's studio this semester has yielded one of the most incredible semesters that I've had. I deeply appreciate the dedication of Zaha and Simon, and further, the contributions of Patrick and Lasha as well. My expectations for the studio were far exceeded in every way. I feel very fortunate to have had this opportunity to learn from Zaha. Also, if at all possible, Yale should do its best to provide further opportunities to both Simon Kim and Lasha Brown. Both instructors were immensely knowledgeable and helpful over the course of the semester. Please invite Zaha and Patrick back- the studio was a highlight of my time at Yale."
