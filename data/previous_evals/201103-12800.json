    "A comprehensive look at the peacemaking attempts between 1916 and 1919; how fate, political actions, and surprise upsets resulted in the Versailles Peace Treaty.",
    "take this class, it is phenomenalEach week you have a different topic starting during WWI and the moving through the peace process. This is as study of the diplomacy around WWI not actual war, so even when studying 1916 and 1917 you learn things like what Wilson was doing, about Russian Revolution,Brest Litovsk, the internal German political struggles.Then after the war about the economic settlement, Treaty negotiations, and League of Nations NegotiationsThere is not an excessive amount of reading, you write around two 4-6 page responses that are used in class but not officially graded. One final paper 15 pages pick your own topic.Tooze is an amazing professor",
    "Really good course, probably best for people who really love this period (like me!). Professor Tooze is so, so, so smart, and you would learn a lot from him in any class he teaches. You'll get as much out of it as you put into it, and if you're interested in World War I (as you should be!) then take it!",
    "Democracy& Peacemaking 1916-1919 with Professor Tooze is an incredible history seminar giving a revisionist reading of the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles. Professor Tooze does an excellent job highlighting thought-provoking moments of the war such Wilson's Peace Without Victory speech, the February Revolution, the German Revolution, and the May Fourth Movement. The class totally changed my understanding of the First World War. Professor Tooze is an great seminar leader and does a particularly good job tying together economic and political aspects of the peace while providing some of the clearest explanations of economic issues I have ever heard from a history professor."
