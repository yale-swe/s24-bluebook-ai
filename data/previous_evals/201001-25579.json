   "comments": [
    "If you've made it through L1, L2, or L3, you probably know the drill for this class. Small seminar, meets every day (including reading period), LOTS of work each evening, test every two-three weeks (complete with dreadfully difficult listening assessments). You'll read 8-9 short stories and two novels (along with about four films). Also new: a fifteen-twenty minute presentation on some aspect of World War II. Take this class if you're dedicated to learning the language as an intellectual pursuit or if you need it for Yale College distribution requirements. It's really not worth the work for anything else. Madame Burton is wonderful--she truly cares about her students and does everything she can to ensure they are prepared for the exams.",
    "This is a great class which follows the basic style of French 130, but since it's not required for the language credit my class had many fewer people in it. I enjoyed most of what we read and I learned a lot. Mme Burton especially was a lot of fun and a great teacher.",
    "Very good course, I feel better prepared for a trip to France",
    "It's an enjoyable class and definitely better than 130.",
    "French 140 helps you learn to speak and write French more correctly and more easily. It's a good class, particularly if you're filling a language requirement. I'd recommend Dr. Burton's section, especially if you're willing to put in extra time out of class."
