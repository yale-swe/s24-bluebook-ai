    "Religious Studies rocks!! You can do it! It's awesome to have the support of your classmates and the DUS. I loved hearing about what everyone is researching!",
    "If you're a senior, you gotta take it anyways, right? Might as well make the most of it, and bring cake and cookies for your fellow classmates!",
    "As a major you obviously have to take this class (and with Professor Davis as DUS it is awesome + cookies + milk, etc etc!!), but if you are reading this as an undecided underclassman, just let me say...MAJOR IN RLST!! I sincerely mean it when I say this has been one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. The field is so fascinating, the professors so nice, and the fellow majors so awesome that I cannot imagine having done anything else. You will truly grow close with those around you (you should read our private panlist conversations... hilarious!).Finishing Yale with a research paper of this magnitude leaves you feeling nothing short of fulfilled. A wonderful, defining experience.",
    "Yes! In this class you write your senior essay, give a presentation on it, and hear your fellow classmates present on theirs. The RLST Dept provides a lot support for your essay so you can really develop an in depth knowledge of the topic of your choice. The RLST senior essay is a pretty monumental task but you will be amazed\/be proud when you finish your thesis.",
    "i would recommend this class. make sure you stay on the ball otherwise its hard to catch up.",
    "You have to...but it's awesome.",
    "DUH.",
    "If you're reading this, you're already a RLST major, and you have to take this course.Enjoy it - it really helps your essay.",
    "You have to take it if you're a religious studies major.",
    "It's the required senior essay seminar, but it's less of a class and more a support group for those of us embarking on the daunting and stressful but ultimately very rewarding adventure of the Religious Studies senior essay. It was by far the most fulfilling academic venture I did at Yale and the one that brought me closest to my fellow classmates and professors. If you're thinking of religious studies as a major, this class is the best experience of the major!"
