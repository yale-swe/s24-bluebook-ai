    "I highly recommend this seminar.",
    "It's a good class and you get to look at a lot of pretty objects in Yale's collection, which is nice. But the quality of the class rides greatly on who else takes it with you; the professor's role in this class is somewhat diminished.",
    "Painting and Poetry in Islamic art takes a case study approach to Islamic arts of the book and related material across several centuries. The course takes full advantage of the resources at Yale and every week involves first-hand object study at the Beinecke, YUAG, Haas special collections, etc. I would definitely recommend the class to other students, especially for a chance to engage so closely with little studied works of art on a weekly basis."
