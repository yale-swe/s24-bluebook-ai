   "comments": [
    "I wish the library let us check books out for more than one day and for one day at a time. how bout 2?",
    "The library policy (one book\/day) makes research extremely difficult (and expensive). Having to wait for an open scanner, to scan pages of book you can't check out wastes a lot of time. Access to these books should not be so painstaking.",
    "Our library sucks! One book for one day? How am I supposed to do research for a paper with those constraints? The library is absolutely unacceptable. The minimum should be 3 books for 3 days. Please do anything in your power to make these changes.",
    "Yes the resources were available.",
    "Yes.",
    "The only concern I might express would concern library hours. Especially during the last two weeks of the semester before papers were due, the limited hours of the library (especially on weekends) more than hindered my ability to do the work I wished. I found myself reorganizing my schedule more often than my written work, in order to fit in the limited hours. Especially in light of the checkout policy (one book per day), which necessitates in-library work (reading, note-taking, writing, etc.), extended hours would be very much appreciated.",
    "Being able to check out only one book for a class like theory (as well as our other classes) is really disappointing. To be able to do the research and readings for the paper involves so much more than one book. I understand it is a library policy but something needs to change with this system. We are all Graduate students at YALE and for us to not have access to more than one book is really unfortunate.",
    "Please change the library policy of one day check-outs. It's the most frustrating system. Also the one book check-out system, but that's more tolerable.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, they were great.",
    "I think having this class immediately after Garvin's Intro to Planning course is detrimental to our learning. Two lecture classes back to back without any bit of a break in the middle for lunch either reduces our attentiveness or causes delays for Emmanuel's lectures.",
    "All resource requirements were met.",
    "Making lecture slideshows available on the course server would be helpful.",
    "yes",
    "The library circulation policy proved to be a huge issue for this class. Because of the 1-day 1-book policy it was extremely difficult to do good research in preparation for the paper. I ended up spending huge amounts of money photo-copying and scanning and buying books so that I could have enough resources around me when I wrote the paper. This limited circulation policy is a real hindrance and often discouraged me from using the library at all as a resource, which is incredible disappointing given the wealth of the collection."
