   "comments": [
    "Observing and analyzing skills. Opening up to differing viewpoints more easily.",
    "general view of anthropology and also feel excited to apply anthropology methodology to other fields.",
    "I developed a new way of looking at the world; this course provided me with a new lens through which to view the world.",
    "a basic survey of anthropology as a field -- its origins, development and current state, as well as the questions that it asks.",
    "I gained a knowledge of the history of anthropology and its development as a discipline, as well as what current anthropologists are working on today. I developed skills in anthropological fieldwork, as many of our assignments were ethnographic assignments. This course is a really good introduction to anthropology, as it discusses major themes and theories that have been developed in anthropology to date and grounds them in examples from fieldwork.",
    "This class teaches you how to think like an anthropologist. An invaluable skill.",
    "The course gives a general idea on the subject, the tools, and the evolution of anthropology. I learned a lot about the discipline. An interesting introduction.",
    "I learned a new way to think about the world and what we had been taught in it.",
    "I learned how to think as an anthropologist and how to see a societal phenomenon as a result of a multiplicity of factors",
    "I learned how to approach and appreciate different cultures without imposing my own standards on them. Also I realized that I took for granted my own culture",
    "The course was about the anthropological way of looking at society, and I think it was very successful in doing that. The ethnographic assignments were very challenging yet rewarding, and I learned a lot through doing actual observations. The anthropological lens we were demanded to master will always be useful in the future for me.",
    "This class was a compelling intro survey course to cultural anthropology. I was able to learn a lot about the development of the discipline and some of the key figures who have influenced the way we examine culture academically. The class also introduced me to the kinds of methods and terminology that come up in higher level anthropology courses. Overall a great intro class.",
    "Amazing class!! I developed such great insight into anthropology, especially paying attention to cultures and asking questions I did not know how to articulate before. In my public health classes, I have found myself utilizing ethnographic methods, and have developed such interest in anthropology I am seriously considering it as my major.",
    "A student in previous course evaluations said that Anthropology teaches you an attitude, and I agree. It very much changes the way you engage with the world around you, pushing you to actually see it instead of taking it for granted. It's an enormously useful and self-enriching skill that far transcends simply acquiring facts. Knowing how to be more observant, and processing your observations in and insightful ways using analytical frameworks you might not have previously considered, is ultimately what this class attempts to do, and it largely succeeds.",
    "Broad ethnographic methods, perspectives on studying humans, creativity in writing, field work\/observations, insight to smaller parts of cultures around the world",
    "The main point of the course was to learn about the history of anthropology, as well as about the ways anthropologists collect their data in the present time. It was interesting to have both the historical and modern perspectives on such topics as the ethnographic method, which was first invented over 100 years ago but is still used to this day. I additionally learned a lot about my friends whom I interviewed for several of the homework assignments.",
    "How cultural anthropology is done, interesting facts about different cultures, new ways to think about culture",
    "I developed a better understanding of the world around me. This class taught me to appreciate other cultures and be able to look beyond the good qualities that I only see in my own culture. It also gave me insight into how anthropologists work and their utility in both conservation of cultures, business and economics, activism etc.",
    "I am a stem major so this class was just me wanting to try something different. I feel like the stuff I learned in this class I would not have learned anywhere else. The topics were really interesting and made me think about my life in a new perspective. Also the assignments were not hard and you really analyze yale culture through them.",
    "I learned a lot about what the discipline of anthropology is, and how it can impact the world. I learned a good history of anthropology and ethnographic method. I learned about different cultures in many parts of the world.",
    "I got to read and learn about some of the key anthropologists and learn more broadly about the discipline as a whole and how it has evolved and developed. I learned about the politics and ethics behind anthropology and about the different methods used by anthropologists.",
    "Analytical skills Knowledge of other cultures Appreciation of anthropology as a social science"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Well-structured. Easy to follow. Assignments match up well and are nicely spread out.",
    "rich coverage. useful readings. guide from the professor and TA with detailed instructions.",
    "Strength: Prof is great",
    "strength - solid survey course, interesting assignments, good readings weakness - too many films shown in class (when they could be homework), class shouldn't primarily be going over readings (what section should be)",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this course. I found both the lectures and the readings interesting and they worked together to explore the themes that we discussed. Professor Lombard used many real-world examples which helped my learning. I really enjoyed the assignments, as I felt they gave me an opportunity to experience what anthropological work is really like and gave me experience. I also really liked how Professor Lombard didn't focus solely on anthropology in academia, but showed how some anthropologists use their skills in the business world, as well as how anthropology relates to other fields. I did feel that we watched a lot of movies in class, which I don't think is the most productive use of class time. I would rather have had a film assigned for outside of class, much like a reading, and then have the class period to more fully explore the ideas that the films brought up. I sometimes felt that my class time was somewhat wasted if all we did was watch a film, especially if it was one I could find and watch on my own time.",
    "This class should be its own distributional requirement.",
    "This course is fairly low workload, but gives a broad overview of cultural anthropology. For a survey course, it does a fantastic job.",
    "I believe that the course was a great introduction course. Professor Lombard is a great lecturer and I enjoyed coming to class every single day. The readings were very interesting and I found that I didn't have to prepare particularly hard for the class because the material by its very nature was interesting.",
    "I think the readings were too much and too long most of the time. I feel like it could be narrowed down so that everyone reads every reading assignment instead of choosing one or two of them",
    "The lectures were very interesting. We covered a lot of material, but the lecture made it easy to understand those concepts. The TFs also helped a lot in digesting the readings. The ethnographic assignments were also very intriguing, challenging, and rewarding. What I didn't quite understand was the mid-term we had. I don't think the things they asked in the exam reflected what was really important in the lecture. It was not designed well to ask the kind of knowledge that we were asked to master. Other than that, I think it is a very good class.",
    "Professor Lombard is a great professor and puts together interesting lectures. If you are interested in anthropology, the readings are also pretty interesting (although they can get heavy sometimes). The biggest weakness of the course is that different people in the class put in different amounts of work. It was often frustrating for me when I would be in section and realize that many other students hadn't done the reading.",
    "The strengths were the quality of the texts, the interest and knowledge of the professor, and the way we looked at anthropology in the real world (Ezra's guest lecture and the TF's presentations). A great weakness, I felt, was that we rushed through the readings in the latter part of the course. I also loved our group discussions and would have liked to have more of them, as well as more interactive class activities. Overall, I feel the strengths outweigh the weaknesses and the course was amazing!",
    "strengths: well organized, helpful teacher\/tfs, interesting readings, engaging lectures weaknesses: none",
    "Strengths- reasonable workload, intersting matertial, gret professor\/ TFs Weaknesses- lecture course format",
    "Strength: Teachers and TAs are readily available for students and willing to help. Weakness: It doesn't really have a defined structure for notes and other academic resources so reading for the midterm was very difficult because we didn't know where precisely the material was coming from.",
    "I think the structure is pretty good and wouldn't change it.",
    "The assignments were very fun to complete and taught me a lot about the environment around me. The lectures were interesting, particularly the ones that had lots of story.",
    "too focused on methods of anthropology and abstract concepts, more real world analysis (in second half) was much more interesting",
    "This course did a great job on introducing the subject of anthropology and teaching the basics of the fields of anthropology and the ways in which they are studied. It did not go very in depth into providing a great understanding of other cultures as a whole outside of some unique aspects within different cultures.",
    "Strengths - very structured and organised, professor uses many stories to teach, which makes it easier to remember things. Weaknesses -sometimes reading is really a lot and it is a struggle to finish in given time frame."

   "comments": [
    "Loved this class! Incredible introduction to the field of Anthropology. The course covers a lot of different topics and gives you a wholistic view of the history of anthropology, the modern applications of anthropology, and everything in between.",
    "Offers valuable insight into one's own culture. Really makes you think about your place in society.",
    "Yes, it's useful to understand anthropology",
    "Absolutely. Super interesting with not an enormous amount of work",
    "Definitely would recommend. This course is an interesting and practical introduction to anthropology. Even if you aren't majoring in anthropology or a related field, this course can help open your eyes and broaden your worldview. I can't help but see things now through somewhat of an anthropological lens, and I feel that allows me to better understand peoples' actions and interactions. It isn't a huge workload - reading every week but most of it is really interesting, a few ethnographic assignments that help you to experience fieldwork, and a midterm and final.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who was interested in learning about the history and field of anthropology in a kind of broad, survey format. The course is not especially demanding, and the ethnographic assignments are quite fun and a neat complement to the class. Lecture is usually very interesting, although sometimes feels slightly discontinuous (there are many different topics covered and not all of them completely connect). The course readings are also generally engaging, although some are slightly long and dry (but that's true of any class). Overall it was and enjoyable experience and worth taking!",
    "Absolutely. Most people don't know what anthropology is anyways.",
    "If one is interested in anthropology but they are not sure whether to pursue it you should take this course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in anthropology.",
    "Glady.",
    "YES! It's a great introduction to anthropology, so if you're interested at all in learning about culture and how people form groups in society, this course gives you a good introductory look into it. The workload isn't too demanding, but you'll get more out of the class if you actually do the readings. Professor Lombard is a really kind person and a great lecturer, and taking the class makes me want to take more classes in anthropology.",
    "Yes I would definitely. It was an eye opening experience overall.",
    "I definitely recommend the class to other students. The coursework is slightly heavier than other intro courses, but the interesting material definitely was worth it. It's a very intriguing course and you will come out with good knowledge and skills. Take it if it sounds interesting, especially freshmen. I'm sure you'll consider Anthro major when you take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in anthropology and wants to dip their toes in the water. The workload is VERY doable and generally pretty interesting. It is probably not as engaging as an anthropology seminar, but at the same time, this is a nice way to figure out if anthropology interests you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a great survey of anthropology, the professor is amazing, and (no matter what your major) it will help you think about and interact with people differently.",
    "This is a fun class with benefits that far exceed its average (not too easy, not too hard) workload. I'm not sure I could have gotten a better introduction to Anthropology, what with how the class at once teaches you the history of the field, the prominent methodologies and theories it has developed, and the application of those theories to your everyday life here at Yale. Professor Lombard is a fun lecturer who is clearly excited by the material, and the TAs are great. The readings are genuinely fascinated (I actually enjoyed and looked forward to doing them, for the most part). The best part, though, is probably the assignments. You basically do studies of the Yale campus and its culture. If you really commit to the assignments, they can provide you with genuine insights into Yale's cultural landscape, things that you've always taken for granted. So yeah, the class has the theory and the application down, and it's great. The only real drawbacks is that lecture can be a little dry sometimes and this time around, it kind of felt like a lot of the students in the class weren't very excited to be there, which dragged down its energy a bit. But I think the pros far outweigh the cons. Definitely recommend!",
    "yes, it is very interesting and a good intro for anthro",
    "Yes! great class, manageable workload and interesting readings\/material",
    "Its a really great class to eliminate our arrogance and ethnocentrism. It teaches us more than just culture, but methods to critique and value other cultures in respectful, ethical and valuable ways. I'd definitely recommend the class to a friend.",
    "Yeah take it. It's a good fifth class and it's interesting at the same time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in culture and humans in different parts of the world.",
    "only if you plan on being an anthro major",
    "Yes, this is a fun course where you can gain some insight into what it actually makes to conduct anthropological research, and it's an easy distributional requirement if that's what you're looking for.",
    "I strongly recommend this class. It is a good intro class that helps introduce the ideas of anthropology. I felt like I learned a great deal from this class, and it did not take too much work. It also is useful in understanding culture and people in general, so it is was important for me to take even though I'm a STEM major.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has never taken anthroplogy and is curious what it's all about. It's a great introduction to the discipline and you learn a lot about really interesting aspects of the world and culture and people.",
    "Yes, a very nice intro course to anthropology. Many cultures from all over the world are explored. Assignments are interesting and engaging."
