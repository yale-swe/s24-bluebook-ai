   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a phenomenal way to learn how to think about science because it is based on learning how to interpret data and draw conclusions from science experiments. It is not solely about memorizing a bunch of facts that you're going to forget and could always look up anyways. It was also the most talented class I have been in regarding my peers, and the fact that the class is not graded on a curve and is based on discussing problems is truly fantastic.",
    "This is a good overview of biochemistry related to DNA, etc. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in going into medicine or research.",
    "Great class. One of the best-taught science classes I've taken. Professor Strobel does a great job keeping you engaged. Makes it funny. Professor Sung was funny but it was his first time teaching the course so he wasn't totally at ease. Lots of fun, looked forward to class every time.",
    "A mess.",
    "This course, while it covers the second half of the biochemistry curriculum, is mostly about teaching students how biochemical research is conducted in practice, and how to interpret data for themselves. The emphasis is more on how conclusions were reached than on memorizing facts (though there is a good amount of that too). This makes many studentsnervous, as the expectations are quite different from those in other science courses, but it seems that such skills are among the most valuable aspiring scientists and physicians (who should want to understand the science behind their practice!) can learn. The class is advertised as not being graded on a curve: there are cut-off scores for each grade. However, it should be known that while these are actually upper bounds: if overall performance is poorer in a given year, the cut-offs can be lowered. Thus there is a sort of a curve; students just won't be curved down.",
    "I would only take this class if you are an MB&B major. Don't suffer through it for an extra science. It is definitely not as good as the first semester. It is very different from any other science class at yale - it is more about experimental methods than about learning the information. Because I didn't take the lab with the class, I felt that the experiments were harder to grasp - but maybe that is just me.",
    "Most people taking MB&B 301 probably took the first semester of biochemistry and are continuing it as a requirement. The course is more difficult than the first semester, as there is a heavy emphasis on analyzing experimental data instead of simply memorizing facts. The key to doing well is to become accustomed to thinking critically about data.",
    "Take this class! If there's one class at Yale where I can say \"I learned how to think like a scientist,\" this was it!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is challenging but well worth it.",
    "It is a fantastic course. I feel like i learned so much.",
    "Take it!! One of the best science classes at Yale. You'll learn how to really think like a scientist and analyze real data. If you've ever felt nervous about interpreting papers, this class will help you to conquer that fear.",
    "Very challenging course that teaches you not to just rote memorize but to interpret data. VERY DIFFERENT from the first semester. I don't know if I did well on the final but man, this was crazy challenging.",
    "MB&B 301 is an amazing course! The professors are really great, and the material is very interesting and useful. This course teaches you a good about of material, but it also teaches you a lot about how to think about biochemistry, both because the professors encourage students to think critically and because the lectures are often taught from a historical perspective, going through how something was discovered and what experiments led to what conclusions.There are problem sets once a week, two midterm exams, and a final. The problem sets aren't really graded based on whether you get the material right or not, and they're not worth much anyway, but you should take them seriously and really think about them because they are a often pretty interesting questions and because they are a good model for the type of question that will be on the exam. The exams are more about problem solving than about memorization (though memorization is of course necessary to be able to understand and solve the problems).",
    "I enjoyed this class, though i liked first semester better. It is interesting material that you learn by looking directly at data from experiments. This means that you really need to try to figure out what each experiment was doing, which can be confusing at times. It helps if you have worked in a lab\/ take biochem lab so that you know what different techniques mean. While they are explained in class, it makes much more sense when you've actually seen it done.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in becoming a scientist",
    "It's really an awesome class, but be prepared for some long nights. You can really love the class and really not love the exams. Really values concepts over minutia.",
    "The course is the best science course I've taken so far. Materials are very intriguing, and you get exposure to a variety of topics covering the DNA and RNA field. The lecture format is great and you learn the ways of reading and interpreting primary data. Some materials are challenging, and you may need to spend some time on them. If you really want to learn something about biochemistry, take it.",
    "MB&B 301 is a tough course that focuses more on experimental methods and logic than the first semester. Some people liked it, some people didn't. Make sure that the approach Strobel takes to biochemistry works for you before committing (though most people, ie, MB&B majors will not have a choice.)",
    "Great class. Well taught, weekly problem sets are not time-consuming, and the professors teach you how to interpret actual experimental results and understand the logic behind the experiments instead of just memorizing facts. I did spend a lot of time studying for the tests, though.",
    "Biochemistry has been one of my favorite classes all year. I especially liked 301 because it requires more thinking\/ application of the material and less memorization. Definitely a worthwhile course - it has helped reshape the way I think about science.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in. In particular, Strobel's half of the course exposes you to a lot of the logic behind the design of molecular biology experiments -- how scientists historically framed questions about biological systems they were unable to see and instead had to observe indirectly. Understanding the intricacies of the macromolecules covered really gives you an appreciation and sense of wonder of how all of this stuff actually works and how life is even possible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who enjoys biochemistry in general. It is quite different from MB&B 301 in that it focuses more on understanding the experimental basis of the material learned. It is an enjoyable class, with very enthusiastic teachers who are great to learn from.",
    "This class made me think much more critically, in a scientific manner, than I ever have before. At first I was scared, because I found the daily quizzes hard, but after a while I got better at the quizzes. If things don't click during lecture, don't worry; mull hem over a little and you will eventually understand them. I really recommend this class; it is challenging, but rewarding.",
    "I would recommend it, especially if you are interested in research, as this is the focus. For the pure pre-med, if you can tolerate the research focus, take it, if not, look elsewhere (but you'll be missing out).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It's a little more difficult than first semester in that you will be looking at data and interpreting results, rather than just memorizing contextualizing material. You spend all semester on DNA, RNA, gene regulation, and protein expression. I feel like I've learned a lot, so the class was definitely worthwhile.",
    "This class was FANTASTIC. There is a focus on analyzing primary experimental data (gels, etc.) to understand biochemical phenomena, rather than being directly given all the information and told to memorize it. I believe that this course taught me to think about science in a more analytical and engaged way, which will come in handy in future independent research. Professors Strobel and Sung were dynamic lecturers, passionate about biochemistry, and interested in the students. They made it feel like a large seminar, rather than a small-ish lecture. There are in-class \"quizzes\" every day, and problem sets each week, but neither is graded harshly at all -- they're worth 1 and 2 points, respectively, and they exist simply to make you think about biochemistry, not to put pressure on you or to seriously impact your grade. Whether you have to take this course for your major, or are looking for a course for medical school, or you just like biochemistry, I definitely, definitely, recommend this class.",
    "Take it if you are MBB! Also MCDB or premed should, too.",
    "Totally different from MB&B 300 in its structure, MB&B 301 is a course that emphasizes the approach and methodology of science over the memorization of the subject matter. I liked this a lot, but there are other people who find this difficult to deal with. Strobel was great, Sung was a bit harder to follow at times.",
    "Yes, this class is very interesting, and will prepare you for a future of thinking in the sciences. A very interesting course after years of pre-req's as a MB&B major.",
    "MBB 301 is very different from the first semester, but still a great course. There is much less straight memorizing than there was in the first semester, and the course is focused more on analyzing data. Lectures are interactive, with group quizzes everyday, which allow for active engagement with the material. The topics covered end up being more interesting than they at first seem, perhaps because of the teaching style, and I liked the course more than I expected. Exams are long but not too difficult, and the course isn't curved. This reduces the competitiveness, but does make you reliant on the professors for writing good exams. If you have any interest in biochemistry, I would take this course, as I think it helped me grasped topics fundamental to biology.",
    "Yeah of course! It is so much better than the other bio courses at yale--but it requires more thinking and time also!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about how to approach problem solving in research. The course weaves together solid facts and thinking in a very unique way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It doesn't teach you to memorize things necessarily, but on how to think. A great class, but was difficult at times.",
    "This course was pretty difficult but it totally changed my way of thinking. I loved how we were presented with data and were taught to analyze it. That was much more useful than just memorizing the information. The professors were both very engaging and presented the material very well. I just wished that there were more ways to assess one's performance in the class than just exams. The curve was not very forgiving. From what I have heard, this is the better alternative to the MCDB biochemistry course.",
    "do not take if you are a second semester senior. you will not do the work and you will struggle.",
    "The MBB 300-301 series is probably the best way to learn the basics of biology, and anyone who really wants to do research should definitely take this class. I have spent a lot of time being frustrated by Genetics and CellBiology and Molecular Biology, all of which were fairly easy classes that skimmed the surface of a lot of the material that this biochemistry class actually teaches. A lot of biology classes fall into that tragic pattern of \"covering\" information. Covering does not equal teaching. Finally, here's a biology class that actually teaches biology by answering questions like \"how?\" and \"why?\" and \"how did scientists figure that one out?\" This is a biology class that makes you think more than it makes you memorize (though, there is some memorization as well). Definitely take this class if you're interested in understanding biology.And, in general, Scott Strobel is the best biology teacher I've ever encountered, so any class he offers is probably really good and worth all the time you put into it.",
    "One of my most difficult but most stimulating classes at Yale. I loved every minute of it.",
    "An incredible learning and inspirational experience. I honestly could feel my brain expanding in lecture and the problem sets were great ways to practice data analysis and conclusion-drawing. At the same time, you learn so so so much about the biochemistry behind lots of life processes. Because most of the biological phenomenom discussed is also presented in other biology classes, it's not that hard to be able to just focus on learning the biochemical details....it's also really satisfying to be able to understand those things at that level."
