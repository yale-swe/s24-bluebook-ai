    "See above, I recommend it.",
    "This is a very good course. Classes can be a little bit tedious, but it is a manageable workload that covers interesting material. You also get out of it what you put into it. If you care to do the reading, you will learn a lot more, and probably do better on the tests. You don't have to, though, and you can just sit in class and decline to participate. But Professor Perez is wonderful and very good at his subject matter... I would recommend it if you are interested in Spanish\/Latin American Lit and don't mind waking up at 9:00.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You definitely gain a greater depth of understanding for Latin American Literature, and the professor isvery engaging and a great lecturer. For someone who wanted to improve their speaking skills, I would recommend they look elsewhere, but for those who want to improve their Spanish listening and reading skills while gaining a deeper understanding of Latin American literary culture, this class is perfect.",
    "Yes. This class was an excellent survey of early Latin American writers. The class was especially enjoyable because of all the historical background that was presented in class.",
    "Very good introduction and analysis of early Latin American literature. Very straight forward, if you keep up with readings it makes the quizzes very fair. Just 4 quizzes, a midterm, and a final paper. The professor is awesome and so energetic about the class. Weakness - it's at 9 am. Take it if you like Literature, but we covered a lot of authors, so it's not much time on each one.",
    "Definitely, but only if you like reading early texts in Spanish, and don't want to practice speaking. Also, the 9-10.15 thing was a bummer. I still enjoyed the class, even though I'm not a native speaker, and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "The course is basically a small lecture. I enjoyed it, and it was not too much work. If you are looking for a spanish course that is not too challengeing I recommend it.",
    "An amazing Latin American studies class taught by a captivating professor. What also makes it amazing is that it is taught in Spanish, so there is no reading translated versions, you get the full affect of the literature. Take this class, it will change how you view literature in general!"
