    "Would recommend (even though it's mandatory).",
    "This is a chance to work in a high capacity team to tackle a tangible real-world challenge through original research and analysis. You learn a lot of skills during the process, and emerge having added value to the client which is a great feeling. Definitely a highlight of my time at Yale!",
    "The capstone project is a really great senior project--much more interesting than a senior essay. It gives a very real world experience as opposed to a generic essay. You not only learn about a given subject in depth but get the chance to interact with a client and get to know your group very well. It's a really great experience!",
    "I think that after this year, the Capstone projects will be improved. They give great exposure to real world problems and practitioners and allow you to apply what you've learned for these real-world clients.",
    "The capstone project is a great opportunity to apply some of the theory and academic work you've done in the major to a real-world task or project. Beyond that, you get to work with some fantastic faculty\/senior fellows and bond with other members of the global affairs major. A great capstone to the experience!",
    "Despite some serious problems with the course's structure it was a great experience. Working with a group was fun and refreshing, and we had the opportunity to work with a real organization, the US Treasury. Overall, I would recommend the course; it was interesting and exciting."
