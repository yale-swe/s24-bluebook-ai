    "If you get in, take it, definitely worth it",
    "I loved it! Definitely take it if you want to write and talk about your work in a fun workshop setting. I really feel like I learned a lot, and I had a lot of fun.",
    "Of course. If you get in, take it. Wonderful class, great professor, lots of writing.",
    "I really learned a lot in this class. Caz is more strict and tougher in his critiques than other creative writing teachers I've had, but I think that actually helped my writing a lot. If I could change one thing, I would have liked to have our second story workshopped. I'm not sure if it's going to be different next year, though, and Caz is always willing to read your drafts and talk to you one-on-one.",
    "It's a fiction workshop with the best writing professor at Yale. Take it.",
    "Perfect for the aspiring writer.",
    "Take it! Caz will make your writing better.",
    "Apply, and take it if you get the chance. Caz is brilliant, and its a wonderful environment -- he also has great judgement, and picked some really excellent writers who were great to learn from in the class.",
    "If you want to improve your fiction-writing skills, you should take this class. Caz is a great teacher and the class discussions are very helpful, usually."
