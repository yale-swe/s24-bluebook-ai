    "Yes, I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a really solid history course and is interested in the Middle East. While it's definitely easier going in with some sort of background about the Middle East, it was a very accessible class as well.",
    "This course was a thorough look into the events that have shaped Modern Iran. The first half of the course focused on Safavid Iran to the 1900s and the second half was from 1907 to present. If you are interested in Iran, I would absolutely recommend taking this course. There is an above average amount of reading, but if you are interested in the subject the class is great.",
    "If you have no knowledge of Islam, the Middle East, or Arabic\/ Persian the beginning of the class might be a little overwhelming because it's hard to keep up with what is going on. If you're not willing to do the readings (especially at the beginning) then I wouldn't take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I really enjoyed The Making of Modern Iran. Although the class covered such a broad scope of Iranian history, we were able to cover a great deal of detail. Although the small size of the lecture was a bit intimidating, it made for a more familiar and intimate setting. Prof. Amanat is a great lecturer and knows the subject incredibly well. He is approachable and while old-fashioned in teaching style at times is very understanding."
