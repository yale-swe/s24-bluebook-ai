    "This is the single most essential aspect of our education in political theory. It is thus invaluable for any student in their course towards becoming a professor.",
    "A fine introduction to a number of scholars in the field.",
    "More diversity in political theory approaches is essential, especially if attendance is tied to a grade.5th + years should not be required to attend if we want students to dedicate all of their time to the thesis. They certainly shouldn't be worrying about a U grade on their transcripts.It makes more sense to allow an auditing option than a SAT\/UNSAT basis which is needlessly punitive and frankly distracting to important work."
