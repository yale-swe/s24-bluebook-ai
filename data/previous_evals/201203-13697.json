   "comments": [
    "Fred's feedback on drafts is incredibly thorough and helpful. He clearly spends a lot of time and effort on each draft, thinking through the comments, and is always happy to talk through things.",
    "The best aspect of this course was turning a conceptual idea into something concrete through slow but deliberate writing. The course structure, which has the students writing throughout the term, is excellent. The workload over the course of the term was comprised of highly relevant work, and by the end, the student is near completion of a major piece of writing without the stress that comes with end-of-semester deadlines. The professor's approach to writing in distinct sections is highly effective.",
    "The course is a great introduction to the techniques, strategies, and tricks that professional writers employ in their work. The readings were extremely useful in demonstrating just how intentional a lot of those tactics are \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everything that John McPhee does, for example, is deliberate, and it was fascinating how Fred used the readings to reveal a lot of the subtleties that go into a work of journalism.",
    "The course was invigorating and engaging. It definitely brought everyone's voice to the forefront and it was a confidence builder for many who needed it.",
    "spending time writing.",
    "This is such a useful class for people who want to understand the structure of writing for a wide audience. I did not understand the concepts at first, but it was gratifying to come around to understanding and see my writing improve before my eyes. Prof. Strebeigh is an excellent teacher because he meets each student where they are in the writing process and respects their vision and style throughout.",
    "Discussion of the tools used in writing.",
    "Fred's incredible energy and insight",
    "Provides good insight of the way environmental writers think."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "While overall, professor Strebeigh delivered an excellent course, one area that I feel could be improved upon is the manner with which he engages students during class. A portion of each class was spent discussing readings from the previous week - either sample pieces or student work. As we discussed readings, the professor came across as being passionate about the material. At the same time though, he seemed to come to the discussions with very particular ideas he hoped to elicit from students. In practice, this amounted to students being reluctant to share their thoughts, because we were often trying to guess what it was that the professor wanted us to identify. I think that this approach can be valuable, but it appeared too frequently. I think that it would help students to balance the guessing game with more open-ended discussions that lead wherever it may lead. I feel like the course did not allow enough time to discussing the writing process, and hearing about the professor's own personal approaches to generating publishable material.",
    "I would love if we spent a little time talking about how to actually get published, especially how to write and target a pitch. It seems to me like everybody in the class wrote these beautiful but ultimately kind of unpublishable pieces (even though I know the class does have a strong publication record), and it would be great if we learned not just about how to write great work, but also about how to get it out there.",
    "The course flowed well and I can't recommend anything.",
    "I felt that it was difficult to have an evening class for so many hours, especially if I did not eat dinner beforehand.",
    "Analyzing readings. It was essentially a crowd-sourced lecture, with the professor constantly fishing for the answer he wanted, and arbitrarily linking unrelated points. Obviously he is incredibly intelligent and an excellent writer\/reader, but the rigid style with which he conducted the analyses of the readings was frustrating at times.",
    "The schedule - holding class from 6:30-9:30pm is really tough. No one is really paying attention by the end of class - sometimes even the middle of class. Please hold it at an earlier time!",
    "The diction of instructor could be more clear. It is especially important because 80% of the course is based on class discussion led by the instructor."

    "I've strongly considered trying to work as a freelance (or staff) environmental journalist after graduation, and this course was incredibly helpful in showing me some tricks of that trade. Even if I don't become a practicing journalist, I'm sure I'll always strive to write about and communicate my work, and I know this course will be helpful in that regard.",

During the first half of the term every student must read three or four pieces each week and provide substantial feedback. But by the latter half of the term when participants are split into working groups, attention can be directed on only two or three pieces. And since the work groups stay the same for weeks, each student gets to know the papers their group is processing, allowing him\/her to go deeper into the critiquing process. The professor continues to provide feedback on all students' work, so the working group was a nice way to keep students focused and engaged.",

    "I would definitely advise against trying to research and write about a topic in the same term. I had 95% of my material ready to be turned into a paper and I still found the course demanding. Unlike academic writing, journalistic pieces can't be forced as easily. If you are not feeling creative, it can take hours to process a single paragraph, let alone pages. Don't underestimate the task at hand.This creative nature of this course sets it apart from most others offered at FES. It can be a wonderful addition amidst research-heavy coursework.The time may very well change, but in 2012, this course was held from 6:30-9:30 at night. In conversation with other students in the class, it became clear that many of us found this challenging. Be ware.",
    "Take it! Whether you do it for one credit or three (I chose three), you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "Make sure you have a topic you are passionate about. Otherwise, the course will be helpful, but not as much as otherwise.",
    "helpful to learn craft of writing to support other types of work.",
    "Everybody's goal for their articles are different, but I benefited from having lots of information\/data from which to draw from, including background research, quotes from my own interviews and expert opinions.The class requires a substantial time commitment during the first half of the semester, but can ease up later on.",
    "Make sure you have all your research done up front, as well as some idea of a story you want to tell. It might be enough to just know a lot about a topic. Also, be prepared for rigidly \"guided\" discussions.",
    "I strongly recommend it. It is a golden opportunity to access Fred's incredible insight and energy. The lessons on organizing a story carry over to many other aspects of personal and professional life. Fred is a rare gem of Yale - the attention he pays to every single student and their work is really stunning, a great opportunity to really engage in material that you care about while getting continuous, very high quality feedback.",
