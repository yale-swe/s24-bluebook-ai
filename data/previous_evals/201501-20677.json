    "Good survey of organ-level physiology.",
    "Systems Cell Biology provides an overview of all of the organ systems in the body, summaries the functions of those organ systems, and shows you the main cells (and cellular mechanisms) contributing to organ system function. I would highly recommend this class to another student, because it was the best class I have ever taken. It concisely and memorably gave me an understanding of every organ system",
    "I would definitely recommend CBIO 604 - as I said above, particularly for someone that needs to brush up on their anatomy & physiology, or wants to learn more about how to look at histological sections.",
    "Give you basic understanding of how cell biology is. Good for students who are lacking a good biological background.",
    "I would describe this course as a course which summarized the workings and physiology of various organ systems similar to the introductory physiology course with a brief introduction to the histology of these systems. I would recommend this course only to a student that has not already taken this introductory physiology course or a similar survey like course.",
    "Yes, it is a great course for understanding general physiological processes."

Therefore, this course provided me with a concise and memorable understanding of all of the other organ systems. I will use this foundation for my dissertation\/research and the rest of my life.",
