    "Great seminar exploring beat literature, history and ideology. Absolutely fantastic course for those interested in intellectual history, theology or some great books and poems.",
    "TAKE TAKE TAKE IT'S AWESOME.",
    "Engaging professor. Some of the texts were awful (there is only so much Kerouac-esque stream-of-consciousness crap one can stomach), but that is the nature of the Beats.",
    "THIS WAS THE BEST COURSE, HANDS DOWN, THAT I TOOK AT YALE. It completely changed the way I looked at academics. It taught be how to be inspired and excited by school in a way that I had truly lost while being here in this competitive environment at yale. You read the most fantastic literature, and really get a sense of american literature, race and gender relations at the time. truly outstanding course.",
    "This course was highly enjoyable. The readings are GREAT. I actually did the readings for this class to procrastinate work for other classes. We learned a lot about the lives of the Beats themselves and analyzed the texts in the context of their lives. This was juicy and interesting, but I think it would have been nice to talk about some of the texts in their own right, the lives of their authors aside. Horace gave us a lot of freedom on the two papers which was really nice. We could write about pretty much whatever we wanted as long as it was related to the themes of the class, creative and analytic pieces alike. Also class at 9:30am was rough..",
    "yes yes yes. the material is great. horace is amazing.",
    "Theologies of the Beats is a study of a few of the seminal works of the Beat generation. There honestly wasn't very much theology involved, but the course was wonderful nonetheless. Horace knows everything about the Beats.",
    "Fun class if you like the Beats! You read great stuff. Horace is a lot of fun and knows a TON about the subject. It's more about the personalities of the Beats than their work, which I found a little frustrating, and class discussion sometimes tended toward the superficial. But it's not a difficult or stressful class and you'll learn a lot!",
    "Amazing amazing class. Take it take it!!",
    "A great course for anyone interested in not only the diverse works(Amiri Baraka, Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg, Bob Kaufman) of the Beat Generation, but also the lives of the Beats, hipsters, and dharma bums as well.",
    "Yes, though Horace is leaving this year.",
    "Take this course if you are at all interested in reading great literature. I suppose it won't be taught by Horace Ballard anymore, but perhaps that means that the course won't exist anymore. Well if you get the chance, this course and this reading will thrill you.",
    "Amazing and take it. Nothing else. Just do it. Do IT.",
    "Highly recommended. Awesome course. Provided a great introduction to the Beat generation- their ideas, their personalities, and the literature they produced. Interesting to return to religious influences and expressions as a way of analyzing each author and his work. This course reminded me of the importance of the author because it was not as much about new criticism-style literary analysis as it was about using literature to understand the author- as a window into his life and thought. This course was also SO MUCH fun, as learning should be!"
