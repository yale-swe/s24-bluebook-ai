    "I learned how to create and interpret statistical data.",
    "STATA, statistical thinking in assessing hypotheses in social science, and mathematical grounds in some of the statistical analysis used in social science",

   "comments": [
    "Professor Zang is an incredible professor who cares deeply about her students. She's not afraid to slow down lectures to answer our questions and never makes us feel like we're wasting valuable class time by asking questions. In fact sometimes, she's the one asking us questions! A really great course. I would have appreciated integrating some Stata into the lectures rather than just the lab. Also, having a lab immediately after class was really a lot for my attention span and make it really difficult to focus on one subject for three hours. Instead, having the lab on a different day would not only be better for attention spans but would also allow us to revisit class material on a different day which is statistically proven to improve retention!",
    "I think that it's amazing that Emma takes a lot of feedback during the course of semester, which allowed us to make changes along the way. I think that some of the strengths include the fact that she posts lectures online and gives a mix of reading and problem sets to help students engage with the material in different ways. One of the weaknesses was that the office hours were sometimes feeling overcrowded, and it was thus difficult to actually ask specific questions tailored to my own work.",
    "The structure of the assignments, only three psets with a final exam and final project, were the strengths. It helped us grow as problem solvers and have us learn-by-doing stata and quantitative analysis. This class had a big issue with clarity of directions. On in-class quizzes, psets, and the final exam, it was hard for anyone to understand what the prompts were asking us to do. I found myself having to highlight, underline, re-space paragraphs, and re-write prompts on the side once I figured out what I thought it was asking (or went to office hours and asked). In the future (next semester), it would be great if there was more effort put into writing clear, short sentences for prompts.",
    "The teacher is super nice, and the material often built upon prior things we learned.",
    "This class was useful in that it provides strong ground in understanding how the statistical analysis is meaningful in social science research. It was a hands-on class where we had to engage a lot in many of the parts of classes in order to properly run and assess statistical analysis. Having multiple ways to learn - including the quiz, assignment, and final exam was useful. Maybe for the future, the class could improve by having a clearer standard of quiz questions. There should be more investment in learning STATA - more commands, more examples of coding for reference.",
    "The strengths of this course are Professor Zang's generosity and patience. The greatest weakness is the course structure, reading load, and method of assessment.",
    "Please see question #10."

    "Yes, anyone who wants to learn STATA, probability, social science quantitative methods, and\/or regression analysis should ABSOLUTELY take this course. It was a wonderful experience with a reasonable workload.",
    "Yes, I would! Its a great background!!",
    "Yes, it will be great way to learn statistics as a beginner, trying to solve mathematical questions associated with statistical analysis will help to understand the basics, and help to interpret the results with clarity.",
    "I would. Please see the first part of #10."
