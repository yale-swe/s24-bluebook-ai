    "Definitely. It is an excellent way to begin studying higher mathematics.",
    "This class sometimes seems very abstract and difficult, but after doing the problem sets and continuing on with it it all pulls together. Professor Schultheiss just loves teaching and has such an inspiring passion for the subject. At first I thought it was weird that he had been at Yale since 1946 (rumor has it he's 93), but his knowledge and expertise are such a product of this that I do not think it was a negative at all. That being said, he is sometimes quite lenient but knows when to be firm. There is a short problem set assigned every class, but you can hand them in up to a weeklater for full credit. This seems quite intimidating at first but the workload ends up being very close to most other classes, just split up over time which actually turns out very helpful. Also, a word of caution; the first midterm is very easy, but the second midterm is a bit of a shock compared to that. Do not assume that because the first midterm was easy that the second will be along the same lines. He is also very fair in that he allows a full sheet of printer paper for whatever notes we want on the exam no questions asked.",
    "It's pretty well taught and a step up from the calculus courses. There are psets assigned every class but they are short and you get a week to turn them in. They're not too bad. The midterms aren't too bad and they're graded fairly.",
    "There's a solid curriculum. The professor, while an incredibly nice& friendly& helpful old man, is an awful lecturer. He's hard to hear, has a monotone voice, and isn't very good at explaining things. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot of this from the book or the Internet, or whore yourself out to your friends to help you out.Not too much work, though. Many problem sets (one per class, 3 classes per week) that are usually 3-4 problems each.",
    "Don't take MATH 222 for fun; it's fairly easy to do well in the class, but Schultheiss makes the class far from enjoyable. He failed to answer questions, chose an awful textbook, and ran a disorganized class. That being said, the class has a light workload, I was able to learn linear algebra (though I did do a bit of self-studying\/review), without much problem. Linear Algebra has tons of applications (which, given the name of the course, you would think we would cover in more detail), so if your major is at all quantitative, it's a great tool to have.",
    "Take it only if necessary",
    "From what I hear, many of the Math 222\/225 professors can be pretty brutal. If you want to take Linear Algebra, my advice would be to definitely take it with Professor Schultheiss. He makes the class very enjoyable and he is a very nice guy.",
    "Take it if you need it. The material is very useful, especially in science. End of story.",
    "I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to, but it is definitely a manageable class. The homework is broken up into a couple problems due a day and is straight-foward. The material can be dry but it is certainly not a class to stress over.",
    "Go Schultheiss! Take it, it's easy and worth it.",
    "its not terribly hard, especially compared to dif eq. pay attention and study and youll do fine",
    "Great course on the applications of linear algebra. The lectures are fast-paced, but Professor Schultheiss is great. His notes on the blackboard are always very comprehensive. Would not recommend to a student who does not go to class, as it diverges from the textbook after the first midterm. Overall, highly recommended.",
    "Yes",
    "Never. I hate this class with all my heart. I can feel death gripping my soul whenever I even think of the class.",
    "A course on linear algebra and its applications. You know whether or not you need this class for your major\/as a prerequisite. Not a very enjoyable course. Both the book and lectures are amazingly dry. The textbook lacks sufficient examples to demonstrate its concepts, and the author tries (quite unsuccessfully) to make the reading a bit more conversational, but instead just makes you dread opening the textbook. Professor Schultheiss makes a lot of quick jumps in mathematical logic, and his lectures are unbelievably dry: he recites literally every element of every matrix, which makes it really hard to follow his thought process without zoning out, and then in an instant, he jumps to the next topic without making much sense of the first one.",
    "It's a total gut.",
    "You're probably taking math 222 because you need to, but with Schultheiss it isn't actually too bad. He's a very clear lecturer and sets fair exams. Be prepared to turn in problem sets for each class - he assigns about four problems per class, but you have a week to turn in your homework. Exams were fair. Overall, this was a much better experience than I anticipated.",
    "Good material interesting problems",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SCHULTHEISS. He was a very chipper, enthusiastic, and helpful professor, who, despite being about 90 years old, had more energy while lecturing and passion for his subject than many other professors I've had who are young enough to be his grandchild. Schultheiss is a Yale institution--he started teaching there in 1948. As in, 66 years ago. Take this course with him if you can!!!",
    "Linear Algebra is extremely important, whether you;re a Math\/Econ and Math\/Engineering major or not. Professor Schultheiss can be unclear at times, but he is the kindest, most genuine and concerned professor I have seen at Yale. His dedication is what make this course. I liked his policy of having 3 psets a week, with 3-4 questions each, rather than having one pset a week with 10+ questions. Take this class if you want to - it is manageable!",
    "Take with Schultheiss. Be warned, the practice test will not cover all the materials on the current year's test.",
    "3 short Psets a week. Schultheiss is a good professor but sometimes his exams are filled with questions that he only briefly went over in class. Think: Fourier series, differential equations, and some other applied stuff that is crammed into just the last week of classes but is at least 30% of the final exam.Don't let the first midterm fool you. The exams get exponentially harder. Do all the psets and other than that you should be fine.",
    "It's a solid, moderately interesting class that you should do fine in if you do the work and GO TO LECTURES. It's not like Math 120, in that material that is not in the book or on p-sets, but that is in the lectures, shows up on exams.",
    "MATH 222 WITH SCHULTHEISS IS AMAZING AND EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE IT I LOVED IT SO MUCH! Amazing teacher, manageable material, and a whole lot of satisfaction and smiles.",
    "Fun, interesting, useful material. Very easy class. I probably spent around 6 hours a week watching Gilbert Strang lectures on MIT Open Courseware and doing the short problem sets (I never went to class). I mean, you might as well take it; you'll have fun.",
    "Peter is the man. Definitely take thus with him while he's still teaching. You may not pick up that much in class, but the exams are easy to teach yourself for.",
    "It's not going to ignite a passion for linear algebra, but it's a reasonably thorough introduction to the subject. There's not a ton of application, and the textbook is a little opaque, but Schultheiss is a good lecturer and really funny guy. It's also not that challenging: don't be scared away by the three p-sets a week.",
    "It's not the most exciting course, but linear algebra is quite important in computation in many fields, so I think it would be worthwhile to learn. It is important to take notes of as much of what Schultheiss writes down as possible, because THAT is you'll need to know -- the textbook covers topics you don't need, and Schultheiss covers topics the textbook doesn't have. He won't put things he hasn't taught in the exams.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. Professor Schultheiss is dry and hard to understand. The class is fairly easy, but you will want to go to lectures: there is some stuff he'll say there that you can't get online.",
    "Take this course with Professor Schultheiss. It's manageable and he's a good teacher who answers questions. Many will say the textbook sucks, but it's important to remember that a math textbook has to be read with pen and paper on hand. If you do that, and study hard for the tests, and do all the homeworks on time (they are actually short and usually easy so you should do them on the day they are assigned) you'll be fine.",
    "not bad. fairly boring so if not a requirement, i wouldn't take it but if you have to, its one of the easier math classes. basically didnt go to any classes all term and still did ok",
    "take it with Prof. Schultheiss, he is really nice",
    "This class is pretty easy, especially if you've had some experience with matrices. Prof. Schultheiss is so gleeful about math and presents the material in a pretty straightforward manner. I spent less than two hours a week on psets (there are three a week, but they're short). It is real that this class is applications based, more so than proofs, so its theory-light.",
    "Schultheiss is not the best teacher while actually teaching class. He writes small, doesn't make material make sense in the grand scheme of things (i.e. I never know WHY we are doing something, and that is very frustrating), and he talks quietly. Also another bad thing is eh doesn't use classesV2 online to post announcements about homework, tests, review sessions, etc. That is very annoying. Onto the good things, he is very organized and honestly the cutest man ever. If you are going to take Linear, TAKE IT WITH HIM. His tests are easy; they are so well written though because they really make sure you understand the core concepts and applications of linear algebra. Yael, the other teacher, is awful. She gives 25 hour homework because she can't teach at all and then the proofs on the homework and tests are impossible. Go to Schultheiss review sessions because his notes and past practice tests are all you need to literally get an A in every class.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who like\/are good at math. This isn't really a class to take on a whim. It's very useful though.",
    "Math 222 is pretty easy to follow and covers a wide range of linear algebra topics. That being said, this class is not proof-based and does not explore vector spaces and subspaces to the same degree of rigor that Math 225 does. If you're looking for an easier, more applications-based version, take Math 222.",
    "Good class with clear expectations - a challenging course, but doable. Second midterm much harder than the first.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you simply want to do some more math after calculus.",
    "Take if needed as a requirement\/to see if you maybe want to major in mathematics, but if purely for intellectual stimulation you should probably just take the class online with OCW.",
    "AAThis is a pretty standard linear algebra course, with a greater emphasis on applications such as differential equations, fourier series, etc. This focus will only come into play at the very end of the course. In general, Schulteiss is good but not great. His handwriting can be tough to read, and he does not do a great job of contextualizing the material in a broader sense. The problem sets are easy and are broken into three parts due each day. This helps you to keep up with the material and never fall TOO far behind. In general watch Gilbert Strang's lectures online with MIT OpenCourseWare. He wrote the textbook you will use and is the BEST lecturer. Linear Algebra is very interesting, super useful, and a nice change of pace from calculus. I highly recommend taking it. It is also pretty easy, and low stress.",
    "It's a very straightforward math class - not too exciting but you learn a lot. The teacher is good but I recommend sitting in the front to hear him and focus better. I like how the problem sets are given every class, but not due for a week. The exams are challenging but you get the grade you deserve.",
    "Take it! Not too hard. Psets 3 times a week can be kind of annoying but they don't take too long.",
    "Take it! It's a really good math class.",
    "It's a good class. Linear algebra is probably good to know and it is decently taught, but you may need to self-study a bit to fully understand all the concepts.",
    "If you have to take linear algebra, this is probably the best option. Unless you're really interested, don't take it.",
    "If you are interested in math or need to take this for your major, definitely don't hesitate. It was a good course!",
    "necessary. i just wish there was a better choice of profs",
    "YES. Take it.",
    "I would not recommend this course, unfortunately. Perhaps for more physics based students it is interesting.",
    "This is a great course if you haven't had linear algebra yet and want\/need to take it. The text is the preeminent book out there on the material, and overall you will learn a lot.",
    "If you have to take Linear Algebra, take this class.",
    "The class is a straightforward and computational introduction to linear algebra. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in math. If you're looking for a proof-based linear class, then this isn't the class for you.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in math; though it will not perhaps kindle your passion, it definitely introduces some important concepts and is a prerequisite for many higher math classes.",
    "I liked the class material, but not necessarily the class. From what I have heard, however, if you're going to take linear algebra, you should take it with Schultheiss. The lectures were pretty average and I found myself using the MIT video lectures as a supplement, especially towards the beginning of the course. The workload is manageable. Having three problem sets per week can be annoying, but they are short and ensure that you are keeping up with the class. I thought the first midterm was easy, but that the second midterm were much more difficult. Overall, a good math class, but don't be fooled by the level of difficulty of the first midterm.",
    "If you want to take linear algebra, take this course. Schulteiss is a good professor and the work is consistently moderate - you'll never really be surprised by an assignment that takes longer than you thought.",
    "Better than what I've heard about the other linear algebra classes.",
    "Take 222 with Schultheiss. He teaches you the stuff really well, and the psets are pretty light (you turn one in each class period, so they're online a couple problems each). First exam was really easy, second one was really hard, and the final is pretty fair\/easy. He doesn't use online communication at all (classesv2, email, etc) but he says everything in class, so make sure you go or get info from someone who goes. Pretty good and manageable course overall!",
    "Having taken an intro linear algebra course before, I was hesitant to take this class, but I'm glad I did. It's an excellent and very thorough introduction that will leave you with a solid understanding of the topic. The pace keeps the material interesting without being a burden. In other words, I had no trouble taking MATH 222 along with a heavy course load. I recommend reading the textbook, as it follows a slightly different method of approach and can put some of Schultheiss's lectures into perspective. I would recommend this course. It succeeds in showing how incredibly powerful and applicable linear algebra really is. The exams were also completely reasonable if you went to lecture and followed all the material.",
    "The class was a great introduction to linear algebra and the different uses that it has. The class starts off easy but after the first midterm it gets going really fast. The one way I would improve the class is to make the practice tests more representative of the actual exams. I would recommend this class for everyone. Everyone should know at least some linear algebra since the world practically runs on this.",
    "Good way to go, if you need the class or want to learn linear algebra. Straight forward.",
    "take if you plan on doing any higher economics or statistics. good for many disciplines.",
    "great class with lots of applications. every engineering should definitely take this version of linear algebra",
    "This class is hard.",
    "This class is a typical math course, maybe a little easier than average. Don't expect your life to be changed, but if you want to learn linear algebra, this is a pretty painless way to go. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to get linear algebra under their belt without having to focus on proofs and the likes.",
    "The general linear algebra course. It's a large lecture course with short homework assignments each class, so you'll have to be diligent about going to class or getting the homework from someone that does. It teaches the material pretty well, not too painful. Take it if you want knowledge of linear algebra as it is a fairly useful topic across the STEM fields.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. I feel very confident in my knowledge of linear algebra having taken it and I enjoyed the class throughout the semester. Also the method of assigning small pset every class due a week later was phenomenal, it really spread out the workload and helped me solidify what we had learned in class by doing a few problems right away.",
    "Not too difficult. Best linear algebra course. Small assignments every day that are easy to finish. Tests aren't too hard either.",
    "Take it. If you are taking math 222, please take it with prof. Schultheiss. It is worth turning your schedule around to do this. He is lovely and the class is pleasant and not too hard. Please take this class with Prof. Schultheiss.",
    "Linear algebra is a very interesting field of study for anyone majoring in a field requiring any sort of math, and it also teaches you a useful way of thinking about math.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone and everyone. It is quite intriguing to learn about matrix algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors and learning applications for them. The math is not difficult, rather rudimentary actually, but the concepts are enlightening and inspiring! Take this class!",
    "A solid course, way better than the alternatives in my opinion. Take it if you want to take linear, but you're looking to do problems instead of proofs.",
    "I was honestly worried taking linear algebra at Yale because of all the negative reviews the two sessions were getting. At first, Prof. Schultheiss' teaching and style of explanation did not work well with me and I ended up watching the MIT lectures. However, I found out about the teaching assistant's sections (Jifeng Shen), went to those and the lectures then made a lot more sense. Then, a few weeks into the course, I began to understand Prof. Schultheiss' style of teaching. He's been teaching this course for over like 40 years and so it's understandable that he sometimes \"forgets\" that we undergraduates don't understand everything he is saying. However, I often went to his office hours and he was very very helpful and extremely patient with me. This completely changed my attitude toward the class and ended up really liking the course (and never needed to touch the MIT lectures like everyone else told me to do). The things that made no sense in lecture became so obvious after I went to his office hours. So I would say I started the class with a negative impression which then flipped to a positive impression at the end of the course!Note that you should take Prof. Schultheiss over Yael's section. Believe me.",
    "If you have no prior exposure to linear algebra, this class is a great introduction. Sometimes the problem sets are hard to keep up with, because you are assigned one every class, but they are short and there is a grace period for turning them in. Professor Schultheiss is a wonderful professor who is incredibly distinguished in engineering and has an overwhelming passion for math and engineering that makes each lecture enjoyable. Professor Schultheiss does a great job of showing how to use linear algebra in different fields of study, so its helpful both if you're using the classas a prereq for a non-science major or if you are a science major. If you are willing to put in the appropriate amount of effort and time to do the problem sets meaningfully, I would definitely recommend taking the class.",
    "This was a good class. Schultheiss is a very old but very competent professor. He doesn't use Classesv2 at all, but it is not hard to know what is going on.",
    "If you want to be a physic or astrophysics major, I definitely recommend this class. Matrices prove extremely useful when it comes to solving problems with multiple unknowns. But be sure to take it with Schultheis,s because he's very helpful, and he's willing to go the extra mile to help you understand if you come to his office hours.",
    "Mathematics 222 is a thorough treatment of linear algebra. Matrices, vector spaces, least-squares regression, orthogonality, Fourier transforms, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, difference equations, differential equations, and similar matrices are all covered. This course will give you a solid understanding of the material. That said, the problem sets due every class can become annoying, and the unclear teaching is even more problematic. Be prepared to read the textbook a lot, and put significant time into the class.",
    "It's a standard mathematics lecture course. It's a good class to take for the material that you will learn.",
    "This is an enjoyable course - some of the applications of linear algebra are truly interesting. Professor Schultheiss sets very reasonable problem sets and exams. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the application of linear algebra to differential equations, changing population dynamics, and much more.",
    "Good standard Linear Algebra course. Schultheiss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s class is very fair, the workload isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too bad. Definitely recommended if you want to take a not-killer math course."
