    "A Panorama of Black Diasporic Studies. Engages with concepts and theories including black modernism, black visual culture, black intellectual history, black transnationalism, black marxism. The scholars we discussed included Stuart Hall, Erik McDuffie, Hazel Carby, Penny Von Eschen, Omi and Winant, Paul Gilroy, and Brent Edwards (among others).",
    "I summarize it by calling it a deep, interdisciplinary exploration into the different ways that scholars, activists, and leaders within the African American community were grappling with the concepts and realities of race, racism, international racism, and other oppressions during the early to mid-20th century.Yes, I would recommend the course to anther student. My primary reason would be the professor. The materials were also engaging.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I learned a lot.I would tell them that there are a lot of readings--so much so that it could be painful. But, part of that is a challenge to see how you cope with overwhelming amounts of reading.I would tell them about the online forum, how great those were.I would tell them about the classroom discussion and the way in which Prof. Goldsby functioned a moderator and a nonanxious presence for a great part of the course. That really enabled us to have fruitful and robust discussions.",
    "AFAM 501 01 is an introductory course for students and future scholars interested in the study of African diasporic peoples. In addition to weekly readings, students are treated to occasional guest speakers whose work we read for that week. It gives students an opportunity to have in-depth appreciation and interrogation of a scholar's work. I would recommend this course to another student interested in African American studies because it lays an important foundation for future scholarly work.",
    "I would recommend it as a foundational course in African American Studies."

   "comments": [
    "At the beginning of the course, the particular time period that we focused on was not of great interest to me and my research, but studying that time was very helpful because it broaden my knowledge in the area, and it forced me to at least consider ways in which I could consider making my research more global and more historical.",
    "This was my first course in African American studies. The trajectory that the readings mapped for us was phenomenal. I learned a lot about African American studies; so much so that I considered applying to Af-Am studs PhD programs.",
    "This course helped to broaden my knowledge of theoretical and methodological frameworks in the humanities and deepen these frameworks in the social sciences. Without this course, my research endeavors and possibilities may have been much less exciting.",
    "I learned a lot more about the mid-twentieth century and cultural studies in general. Also the foundational racial formations texts we read were helpful.The course itself did not necessarily contribute a lot to my dissertation\/research, but the way the professor engaged the material with each student's interest definitely sparked a lot of ideas that I had not previously considered. I feel this course will contribute a lot to my future teaching as it helped me understand the field better."
