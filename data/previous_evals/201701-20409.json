    "This course helped me understand Ancient Greek and Roman civilizations and the day to day interactions of citizens in classical antiquity better. I also learned how to manage a very heavy reading load.",
    "It was amazing to learn about these ancient forms of magic and see how they've shaped our society.",

    "The strengths of this course lied in the discussions of the material, however, I would say the one weakness I noticed was the class size. I wish more students had taken the course."

    "If you can, definitely do take this course! For me, it was an excellent opportunity to learn more about Roman and Greek religion. It's a fun course, and you will learn lots of things that wilk shock you but it's easily the most interesting course I have taken at Yale. The reading load might seem like a lot but the texts are often so interesting\/ easy to read that it's doable. Often, texts overlap so if you're not feeling the readings that's fine too. This course had me reconsidering my major.",
    "Definitely! It really opens up your eyes to see more than just the ordinary and also appreciate the Ancient Greeks and Romans even more. Professor Lamont is also just an amazing, beautiful soul, she'll make you enjoy the class!",
    "Yes, this class was a great freshman seminar and introduced many skills like reading comprehension. In addition, the course material was very interesting.",
    "This was by far my favorite class I've ever taken. I loved Professor Lamont and always found her lectures engaging and the assigned readings fun. On top of that she's super sweet and understanding. If you find Graeco-Roman social life at all interesting, take this class. If you think talking about witches, sorcery, curses, and mythology sounds interesting, take this class. I wrote my final paper on werewolves. It was a blast. Side note: this class is also so enjoyable because the readings are interesting and help you actually be engaged in the seminar discussion; if you don't have time for about an hour of reading prior to each class, that might be more difficult (also participation is part of the grade!) But actually this class was wonderful and not super challenging and Professor Lamont is a very passionate professor... Take this class!"
