    "This is a great class if you are an HSAR major looking for an ancient\/non-western credit.",
    "I would recommend it for everyone. I am not a humanities\/art history major, but class was really fascinating and now I am considering a double major in art history.",
    "As the name of the course implies, this is a survey of the art of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Aegean. Don't take it if you aren't interested in ancient art. You don't need to buy the books or read them, just take good notes in lecture and you'll be fine for the tests.",
    "This was an overall good class. The material had the potential to be really good, but at times got a little dry. Slides are shown using a projector, and we were often expected to know information that was not given about them, but there were definitely moments I enjoyed a lot about the class. Consider taking this credit\/d if you are interested in the topic.",
    "This class is a survey of the art and culture of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Bronze Age Aegean. The course examines each artistic tradition individually and also its relation to and impact on the other two cultures. The homework is usually just reading from the assigned textbooks, which I found easy to read and manageable in volume (they really are great - I'm keeping them for my bookcase at home). The class is lecture-based, and you'll have 3 in-class assessments asking you to identify and analyze 10 pieces of art from the lecture slides. There is also a 7-9 page final paper on a topic of your choice. I'd definitely recommend this class - it's a lot of fun and you'll come away with useful knowledge about art history and art criticism."
