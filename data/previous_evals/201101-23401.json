    "This is a 1 credit course. Speakers every lecture. Some good, some you don't care for the subject matter or simply have better things to do with your time. You only have to do the readings for the topic on which you are going to write the paper. While the other readings are required for class discussion, I am going to guess most people don't read them.",
    "I think I was expecting to get more out of this course-- I wanted to hear more lectures from Prof. Nolon...",
    "10. This class fills a great little niche at FES- a glimpse into law, zoning, and planning and how they all fit together. The guest speakers are top notch.",
    "Great course, great selection of speakers",
    "I highly recommend this course to those who are interested in learning from professionals in the urban planning field.",
    "This seminar course did not fit into the regular structure that many of these questions apply to. It was a great series of speakers however. I am very glad I participated, though it would have been helpful if there had been more of a trajectory of subjects covered throughout the semester. Of course, this is probably nearly impossible as speakers came based on their availability, but it would probably have been helpful if there was a little more structure to this seminar."

    "Prof. Nolon. He is an authority on land use issues, brought in some great speakers, and is a great overall professor.",
    "Wide range of topics covered",
    "Easy credit.This is the closest approximation to course content on urban planning, which Yale lacks big time.",
    "There were different guest speakers every week. This gave students the opportunity to learn about how a variety of organizations are approaching land use planning today.",
    "Great coverage of cutting-edge issues in land use planning and policy.",
    "The opportunity to learn about a diverse set of land use planning projects from professionals in the land use development field.",
    "1. Professor Nolon's lecture on the last day of class was outstanding. I wish he had given more lectures.2. The readings were great and the speakers as well- it is informative and entertaining to be able to show up each weak and have an expert in the field come to chat for one hour.3. Jonathan Rose's visit a highlight.",
    "The range of presenters was great.",
    "It was an honor and a pleasure to get to learn about land use planning from Professor Nolon and the speakers he invited to class.",
    "- The professor's clear and evident dedication that each and every student learn more about the land use planning field- The guest speakers were amazing- The variety of topics were diverse and all students could find something that was of interest- The variety of presentation styles made coming to class always interesting- The more intermediate\/advanced levels at which guest speakers spoke (I'm very happy that the professor advised speakers to just \"jump into\" their presentations. This meant that there was very little repeat between weeks.)",
    "Really nice to hear from so many speakers working in the field."

    "None.",
    "Maybe have students vote on the value of the topics\/speakers. For future classes, eliminate the speakers\/topics least preferred by students.A field trip within New Haven would be great.",
    "This class was average. Many of the speakers talked about the same issues so there was a lot of redundancy.",
    "Some of the speakers should develop shorter presentations so that students could ask more questions about their work.",
    "It could be a little bit longer- I often felt that we were a little rushed.",
    "I think the course needs to be more credits and have more content. It could be so much more! With more credits, there could be classes that didn't have presenters but focused instead on discussion with the professor and students.",
    "More time for discussion",
    "N\/A. This class is excellent.",
    "- I only wish that this course had more sessions",
    "The speakers usually spoke for the entire class time, not leaving much time for discussion or engagement. Students would be able to get more out of the class if the presentations were kept to 30-40 minutes tops."
