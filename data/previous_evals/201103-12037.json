   "comments": [
    "This is a fabulous course that informs even the already-knowledgeable student about the civil rights and women's lib movements. Professor Feimster is brilliant. The course itself involves a large amount of reading, but it's totally manageable and the reading list is great--the class works together to process, debate, and digest the information. The topics discussed are quite provocative and sparked some very heated debates.",
    "It was a great class! The discussions are really relevant to current events and the work load is relatively light. Dr. Feimster is incredibly nice and doesn't shy away from controversial topics.",
    "Interested in women's lib? Take it. Interested in how women shaped civil rights? Take it. Interested in having your consciousness raised? Take it. You'll come out of this course ready to start a revolution, or at the very least knowledgeable about how it's done. The reading is a bit heavy (a substantial book a week) but the reading list is fantastic, the reading responses are low pressure, and the paper assignments are actually engaging.",
    "If this is your thing take it, if it isn't take it! Civil Rights and Women's Lib is so key to understanding America today. Our class was all girls with only 1 boy, so we really got into our feminist discussions about the past as well as taking about contemporary issues.",
    "Yes absolutely take this course, it is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Feimster is incredible - extremely caring and just a great seminar leader. Discussions every week were interesting and engaging (even if you didn't quite make it to the reading). Feimster makes it difficult to view the world the same after knowing her and taking her course.",
    "A class that discusses important female civil rights leaders, and then different issus in the women's movement. Really interesting and engaging, but a lot of reading. However, you don't really need to do it all to participate in discussions, especially discussions about women's rights. The papers are really fun, and Feimster is really great.",
    "AMST 326 is fantastic! If you're interested in the topic, definitely shop this class at the very least. Professor Feimster is wonderful, and the work is manageable. There's a ton of reading, but you can get away with skimming and picking and choosing the important things to read. This class made the worst aspect about taking a seminar - discussion - the best! Definitely take it if you get in. You'll learn a lot and have a fun time doing it."
