    "Yet another hoop for MBB majors to jump through. Not a bad class. Just wrote the paper, handed in a rough draft, and presented it during reading week. Good deal.",
    "A very well-organized course with Patrick Sung this year.",
    "I think this was a great experience to spend time researching a topic I was passionate about - there's no way its going to cover everything you've done in the past four years, but it's a great project for second semester. I really enjoyed writing my paper and it was wonderful to have a finished product.",
    "I thought that writing a short review of a topic of my choice helped me develop a useful skill as a scientist. Since most MB&B majors have done research for credit before, they already have experience writing primary research reports. However, compared to my friends in other majors, I did not feel like my senior project was the culminating academic achievement of my Yale career. But overall, it's a pretty light workload for one credit.",
    "Yes, take it if you are an MB&B senior.",
    "I would strongly recommend the MBB major, and specifically using this essay course as an opportuinty to research something that you have always wanted to learn but havent had the chance to. It is bizarre in that the scope of your essay is so flexible, but go write about youre favourite mechanism and you'll employ a ton of what youve learned in Biophysics and Biochem.",
    "The MBB senior project isn't bad. You write a 4000 word essay about something in biochem\/biophysics that interests you. Your friends in MCDB will look down on you for not having to present your senior research, but on the bright side, the MBB project is not difficult and not too terribly time consuming. You really learn a lot about the topic you choose, so overall it's a good project.",
    "You have to do it, its extremely manageable as far as senior projects go, you can write about something you're really interested in, listening to the presentations at the end is enjoyable, nice little capstone for MB&B.",
    "Senior requirement. Duh. If you've gotten this far in the MB&B major, this course is a breeze.",
    "The MB&B Senior Project is absolutely fantastic. It gives you the opportunity to explore any topic that interests you and learn about it in depth, and produce a literature review that you can be truly proud of. There was a tremendous amount of support from the faculty, and I can't express how much I appreciated that we were required to turn in a draft in March and that we received such extensive and thoughtful feedback. It feels wonderfulto know, in April, when you have a hundred other things going on, that you already have a full-length draft of your essay written.Also, Prof. Sung was a wonderful adviser. He was very supportive and welcoming, and always willing to read portions of your essay and provide feedback. This is a great class, and a very enjoyable way to end the MB&B major.",
    "Not a bad course - I was actually proud of the paper I turned in. Dr. Sung was very helpful, and was a good person to work with. Not a lot of work for an entire credit.",
    "This is the MB&B Senior Seminar class required by all MB&B majors to satisfy the senior requirement and to graduate. It consists of one literature review on a current biology topic and a 13 minute seminar presentation on the same topic. A draft was due after spring break, but this class does not formally meet with the exception of a brief information session at the start of the semester. This was a reasonably satisfying conclusion to the MB&B major.",
    "Gotta take it to graduate as an MBB major! Not too bad, just get the paper done over Spring Break and make a few edits, make a Powerpoint presentation and you're done."
