   "comments": [
    "it is a very informative class and you will learn a lot about remote sensing and how to apply the skills in the final project of your choice",
    "The course covers fascinating material and is taught by three invested professors. The lecture material does not always seem relevant to the labs. I would have preferred greater attention paid to ENVI during lecture. If the professors could demo some advanced techniques beyond the step-by-step labs that would have been exciting and promoted innovation and creativity in lab and final projects.",
    "It is excellent. The lab work is totally focused on the use of software ENVI, it would be useful if could be introduced to other software and resources",
    "Strengths: The class provides lots of room for freedom and is quite useful Weaknesses: the students should get started on our projects earlier (in a formal lab setting with TA's)",
    "Strengths - almost all tools and concepts seem to be equally important Weakness - Limited time and lot to to learn makes it stressful at times. Improvement - Perhaps, some topics may be dropped, though they are equally important.",
    "The course was both technical and practical. The lectures and lab works were very effective and hands-on.",
    "The class really makes you learn.",
    "I think the class was well organized and followed a logical progression, where we were slowly building on our skills throughout the class.",
    "The course was a good combination of theory and hand-on skills, and the lab sessions were very helpful.",
    "This was an excellent course.",
    "Strengths- really great team of professors and TAs. It was great to have such a high instructor to student ratio- all of whom were highly engaged in the course and student learning. I think labs can be improved a bit- I felt that it was easy to follow the lab like a cooking recipe, and not really digest the meat of what was going on. The real ENVI learning didn't happen until we were forced to work on own own projects (I almost wish there were 2 independent projects... a feeler project that replaces the labs and follows optional ENVI tutorials- and then a final project). Also, I felt that some\/most of the section regarding physics of radiation\/orbit\/etc was unnecessary for my learning goals (how to find\/analyze satellite imagery? What can it reveal?). I would have preferred that this section be expedited with more time devoted to reading papers from academic literature that used techniques from remote sensing (which I only got into later with my project).",
    "Great course."

   "comments": [
    "work on the final project early",
    "It is an excellent course to explore the capability of remote sensing and its application. If you are aligned towards conducting researches, this course would be of great application.",
    "Choose a final project that you already know something about, and that you are passionate about.",
    "Don't take more than 12 credits or 4 classes.",
    "I take raster and remote sensing at the same time, they two complement each other well. I could recommend doing that.",
    "I would advise identifying a final project you are interested in early on to maximize the scope of the project you can complete.",
    "An excellent course for students with interest in building a geospatial and\/or quantitative data skill set. Learning is geared to gradual but cumulative skill building with using the ENVI software for remote sensing analysis tasks (visualising and using different tools to analyse satellite imagery data), coupled with lectures geared to the conceptual basis behind remote sensing and its many applications across the environment sphere.",
    "Start to think early about topics of interest for independent study. Pay attention during satellite showcases!",
    "do not take the course unless you know you need remote sensing in your research or career. The work load is not worth it unless you use this....",
    "Awesome course. Take it if you intend on working with satellite imagery. Would advise taking this class before geospatial software design so you know more about various satellite products and band math."
