    "I have nothing but good things to say about this class. No background in the subject is necessary and it's taught in a way that is very accessible to non-science majors. Not only is Saiers a leader in the field, but he's brilliant at simplifying the issues and presenting themin ways that are accessible to students from different academic backgrounds. The curriculum is also very current - we study some of the most pressing issues related to water resource management, such as nuclear waste disposal and hydraulic fracturing. There's a quiz (easy if you do the reading) about once a week, 3 tests, and a final 15-pg paper. The tests are fair and if you keep up with the work you can succeed, but this class is not a gut. I highly recommend this class to students from all academic backgrounds.",
    "A great science class to take. interesting material. Nice teacher. good course load. Solid",
    "This course teaches very little. There was a much better class that focused on water resources called \"World of Water\" in the ENVE dept that was offered last year. Overall, the class is little to no work and class is barely necessary as lectures and articles are all online. I gave the class a second chance after we covered the hydrologic cycle for the first two weeks in only slightly more depth than middle school. However, when the professor asked is anybody knew what a \"peer-reviewed article\" is, I realized how little this class asks from its students. There is no final exam and the in-class exams are a piece of cake. Don't take this if you do not have to. If you want a gutty science, this is the class for you. Literally no calculations required and all the exams are short answer that you can answer with minimal knowledge.",
    "If you're really interested in the environment and have studied\/read much about it in the past, you probably won't learn anything new in this class. It's very little work. The tests are really easy, but they grade them pretty harshly in order to differentiate the class a little.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have no background in the subject. James is a nice guy, but he requires attendance in class, even though he doesn't put much effort in the preparation of lectures. He took five weeks off between guest lectures, movies, tests, and group activities. Your time is better spent elsewhere.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in the environment at all. Even if water doesn't seem all that exciting you realize how its so important to everything around us through this class.",
    "Worthwhile class",
    "This course is great! Definitely recommended. Covers a lot of interesting and relevant topics and the workload is really reasonable. Also definitely doable for someone without much of a science background.",
    "I would recommend this class. Most of the class consists of reading scientific literature that the teacher assigns as the semester progresses.",
    "Great, especially if you are an EVST major because it counts as your junior seminar. Many classes let out early, and you learn a lot about environmental problems and water resources. There are quizzes, but they aren't too bad and his exams are reasonable!",
    "Take it if you are an EVST major, American studies major, or interested in the cross between economics and environmental sciences. Water is a big problem and this class isn't too technical. Gives a brief but thorough overview of many urban problems.",
    "Overview of water flows and the importance of the hydrologic cycle. Eye-opening in many ways, I learned a lot. Highly recommended. Start the 15-pager early.",
    "This is an okay class. While I was really excited by the first few lectures, it became a bit repetitive by the end. You get what you put into it - I actually got a lot out of the readings and learned a lot from the class, but it would have also been really easy to just slide by. It was mostly filled with environmental studies majors, but as a non-science major I was more than fine. Take it if you want a relaxed, basic science class.",
    "As a senior ENVE major (taking it for the hydrology requirement) it was painfully boring. It feels like a waste of time because the material is overly simplified.",
    "I was definitely not aware how big of an issue water is these days. Definitely take it if you're interested in becoming involved in environmental studies\/engineering, or if you want a better grasp of current environmental issues.",
    "This class was fantastic!!!!! Water Resources and Environmental Change is so interesting and the workload is managable. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in water\/environmental issues.",
    "My final opinion on this course was that I could take it or leave it. It is a strong introductory environmental science class, but it is just that, an introduction. I found the lack of details a bit frustrating the final research paper felt unrelated to the rest of our coursework. However, if you're looking for a manageable science credit for non-science majors and you're vaguely interested in the environment, this is the class to take.",
    "It is a good and not-too-difficult introduction to some very important water issues. The class seemed to be not that organized this year though, and it had a changing, kind of confused structure. I felt like we didn't end up doing that much in the class.",
    "Water Resources and Environmental Change is a broad, somewhat superficial look at a number of topics in hydrology and water management. The focus is more on human use and policy than on the micro-level effects of climate change. Completely manageable with little or no knowledge of chemistry -- for better or for worse (in my case, for better). I found the course a useful way to consolidate tidbits of semi-common knowledge gleaned here and there in previous conversations about global warming and water resources into a more coherent grounding in the topic.",
    "The course did not demand as much scientific knowledge as I was expecting--we never had to know formulas for exams, even things that we learned in a simplified way. I suppose I was expecting hydrology, but this was more like \"hydrology for people who don't understand chemistry,\" or something. As someone majoring in the humanities, I found it a refreshing change of topic from my usual coursework, but as someone who has taken genchem, I found it difficult to believe that this was worth a science credit.That said, I found it a really good consolidation of the role of water in and impacts on water of various aspects of the modern world.",
    "Great, real science course. It's a fascinating subject, an important one, and a real science credit that is accessible to non-science majors. Professor Saiers simplifies things and makes everything for clear and accessible and his enthusiasm is infectious. Take it.",
    "This class was great. I would recommend it to anyone interested in environmental issues. As an environmental engineering major, many of the classes I take are very technical and we rarely get a chance to see the big picture and talk about real world environmental issues and that's exactly what you get in this class. We discussed how shale gas development, mining, climate change and urbanization affect the world's fresh water resources.You will read short real life papers, and learn real world issues. There are no problem sets, just three in class tests (which are not difficult) and a final paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, whether or not you have a solid science background going into it. I was really interested in water resources as a political issue and really enjoyed the chance to learn more about the science behind it (although the course doesn't assume\/require prior knowledge of environmental science). Saiers is a great lecturer and the workload is manageable but you will learn a LOT",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student with more than a passing interest in environmental issues and with a tolerance for science. The tests were qualitative, but the reading assignments were sometimes technical. More motivation is required to really learn than to pass. This was my first environmental studies class, and my expectations for an informative small lecture on a topic I knew little about (water) were fulfilled. I feel a lot more knowledgeable about important issues affecting our world.",
    "Discusses the impact of multiple types of industry on water quality, as well as the projected future for water quality. A very relevant and thought-provoking class."
