   "comments": [
    "This was an incredible course. It has clearly been developed well over the years, and they know how much to push the students and when to do so. You learn a LOT over the course of the semester - vocabulary, grammar, idiomatic usage, cultural items - and at the end I feel very confident in understanding and using the language in a general way.The normally small nature of the course creates a comfortable environment where it's okay to make mistakes. Also, Michael Farina is an incredible instructor and I feel privileged to have learned Italian under his guidance. If you are at all interested in learning the Italian language and feel you can make the commitment to regular studying for daily quizzes or exams, by all means take this class.",
    "Intensive Italian is what you'd expect: Intense. But don't let that daunt you, because despite all the work and quizzes and tests, you'll find that Professor Farina (or Michael) is a class act, and will always be a positive influence in class. There was never a class I dreaded because of boredom, he always kept the class rolling.",
    "A fantastic class. Michael was amazing-- deeply invested in our education and well-being and totally engaged with what he was teaching. I've never seen someone so enthusiastic at 9 in the morning, and that's probably what made me stick with the class in the first place. The pace is very fast. We finished about a chapter of the textbook a week and still had time to watch movies, walk around Yale (speaking in Italian!), and read Italian stories after we'd finished the textbook more than a week early. Lots of practice speaking, and a great crash course. There wasn't a lot of homework-- you had to memorize about 30 vocab words for a quiz every day (there was a test every Monday on the previous week's chapter) but that was about it. Workbook exercises were only assigned if you needed a little extra help on a section. It is, however, a pretty big time investment if you consider the 2 hours a day the class takes. In my opinion, it's entirely, completely worth it.",
    "I would recommend if you want to learn very fast. It is difficult at times to keep up with the material, and two hours every day can be hard."
