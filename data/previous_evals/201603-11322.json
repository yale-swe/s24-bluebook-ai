    "CRISPR\/Cas9",
    "Nothing",
    "Molecular biology methods and techniques. CRISPR-Cas9, so we're talking about stuff that really matters and are fresh from the labs!",
    "As someone who has never done bench lab research before, I found this class to be surprisingly approachable. I learned a lot about how to develop my own research questions, which methods to use in genomic research, and how to use and modify procedures depending on different experiments.",
    "I learned a lot about how to handle failure, but overall this course has taught me to learn on my feet as well as how to write a structured, in depth research report.",
    "I developed lab research skills",
    "This course, we learned how to implement CRISPR\/Cas-9 and the procedures leading up to and following said process. I learned a lot about laboratory procedures and about how to think critically in a research setting.",
    "Taken in conjunction with 342L, this course is definitely useful for anyone that wants lab experience (and wants to get the lab requirements done in one semester). It's an intensive lab, but 342L prepares you well for the second half of the semester in 343L. With familiarity in the methods used from 342L, 343L helps develop those skills and methods, as well as adding new ones. The final paper symposium also serves as a helpful introduction to the lab meeting format, if that is new to you."

   "comments": [
    "Students can do more things.",
    "Great topics, and clear guidance of experiment steps, with explanation. Better management of data would've been better. Some of the final experiments (after putting things into a tube and hand to the lab) felt like a black box. It would've been valuable to actually know and see what is happening! (e.g. instead of just a tour of the axolotl lab spaces, maybe a run through of what actually happened with our reagents).",
    "It was a well organized course, definitely a lot easier to follow than the first half. I enjoyed it !",
    "Good lab, no major weaknesses. One of the most confusing things was to find what reagents are where, since students had to share. But it was better in this lab than in the one in the previous half semester which had more people. It would also be nice to receive feedback on our work. I had no idea whether my PSETs were correct, or if I was doing lab work correctly, or whether what I was writing in my lab notebook was good or relevant."

    "Good class. Take it if you don't have much lab experience.",
    "Chill MCDB lab for premeds",
    "Yes! Please take the second part of this lab. The topics are even more interesting. Also, the symposium at the end is far more manageable and fun than the paper, so don't miss out!",
    "Yes-this is one of the chillest biology labs you can take as a premed. A lot more straightforward and manageable than the first half (and even the first half was not bad at all). I don't know how the grades will turn out, but in terms of how painful the process was, this was definitely a good choice.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who wants to achieve greater research experience and learn how to write a research paper.",
    "This is a solid lab course with interesting topics. It is cool that we get to work on research for real labs at Yale. Lab hours ranged from 1:30 to 3:30 to 6:00, but that probably largely depends on the research project that year. The work itself is not too difficult but it can be a little draining to be in there for hours. There's not much feedback in the class concerning our PSETs or lab notebook and there is only one big presentation at the end, so I'm not sure how the grade will turn out."
