I'm only moderately interested in consulting, but the course gave me a chance to gain some hands-on experience working in my field of interest (energy efficiency). Maureen is great. She's very organized and responsive and I enjoyed our weekly meeting with her. She clearly has a ton experience in the consulting field and it shows.",

I think I would have enjoyed hearing from speakers who manage the sustainability aspects of their companies, and what types of projects they work on. Ex: having Diageo come in was WAY more interesting than DEKRA, especially since we already had the other consulting company come by (which was much more informative than DEKRA, which seemed more like a start-up in its US operations).",
    "Honestly, can't really think of any. The only possible suggestion I would make is too possibly have some sort of 2-semester project option. Our project felt a little rushed at time and it would have been nice to have 2 semesters to work on it.",

The take always from them were always helpful and easy to grasp, and I would've preferred to hear from Prof. Burke more often, rather than from guest lecturers.",

Whatever your project is, you'll learn a lot about environmental consulting in action simply through the process of doing.Be thorough in your communications with both your client and Prof. Burke. She'll be best able to guide you when she had a clear picture of what's going on, and her guidance is very helpful indeed.",
