    "-Professor's lecture style is somewhat meandering and unclear, and occasionally he didn't finish on time and asked us to watch the rest of the lecture out of class (given time constraints and the time spent in this class and on field trips, this was difficult). -Students sometimes left lectures a little lost and uncertain of what the key concepts were that were covered. -The textbook is fantastic and clear (again with the time constraints) it was sometimes too much to get in lectures, field trips, and readings in a week. Especially as field trips took up most fridays, all day.",
    "Would prefer 2 or 3 weekend field trips like yale meyers instead of 7 half days. tough really getting into the half day field trips. learned so much on yale meyers trip.",
    "Overall i felt like this class catered to the lowest common denominator of students. We spent a lot of time at the beginning of the semester and during each field trip reviewing basic things that students should have already known (species ID and stand dynamics being big ones) and that took away time that we could have been focusing on more advanced subject material. If students chose to take this class without previously taking stands or taxonomy, they should be responsible for learning that material on their own time, not wasting the time of those students that came to this class prepared with the correct material.",
    "Fewerhalf day field trips with more full day field trips focused around field exercises and practical application.",
    "The online lectures helped me greatly, the in class lectures were hard to follow.",
    "About Q #1 I had trouble finding the readings on classesv2 for much of the semester. But when I did figure it out, I skimmed through most of the chapters (at least for the 2nd half of the semester). I found that the chapters could use a bit more headings to organize some topics. It seemed a bit like the content in some chapters was a lot of information that is somewhat difficult to absorb all together. It might be that additional structure might help. Some chapters are in their draft form, so that may be part of the reason for this.",
    "Question 10 - Dr. Ashton could benefit by better organizing his in-class lectures so they are more focused and easier to follow, and should be careful to not be overly harsh and embarrass students when answering questions\/responding to comments."

    "Field trips were really great, especially the Yale Myers overnight. They were, however, too many in number, even for a four credit course, and it would have been nice to have the option to pick 5 out of 7 field trips, or something that allowed some flexibility. I really enjoyed speaking with the professor, and he's got a wealth of knowledge, but I really did struggle to follow lectures.",
    "The silvicultural prescription and actively applying the material",
    "I actually enjoyed the traditional lecture format for this course. Once you get the hang of how Mark lectures you end up learning a lot more than you even realize because he has a way of repeatedly revisiting topics throughout the course.",
    "Field trip to yale meyers really like the silvics part and the types of regeneration\/thinnings mark cares a lot",
    "Field trips and hands on learning",
    "The field trips were awesome.",
    "Extensive content",
    "For the most part the field trips were great. I think the Yale Myers trip was a bit ambitious in terms of what was originally planned for the weekend. We did not cover all the material but it seemed like any more would have been almost overwhelming, at least for those students (like myself) who are relatively new to forestry. In any case, I really appreciated getting to be outside, even if some of the trips were freezing.",
    "Although they took up a lot of time, I really enjoyed the field trips for applied, field-based learning. I thought the textbook reading was very helpful to fully understand the material covered in the course.",
    "I appreciated the depth of knowledge offered by Professor Ashton. Few forest scientists have such a global perspective.",
    "The field trip to Yale-Myers and the second field trip to the water company land were the most valuable field trips. The silviculture textbook (assigned readings) is very well written and helped to clarify any misunderstandings about the material. For some of the lectures it was hard to understand the main point but the readings served as a great explanation."

   "comments": [
    "Far too many field trips, which often interferes with other classes and non-academic commitments (e.g. on-campus jobs). I also don't like the way work is heavily stacked toward the end of the semester, with what amounts to two final exams during reading\/finals week",
    "Lecture structure and balance between at-home reading, at home viewing of supplementary lecture material, and field trips. It's just too much and it seems, that upon realizing that students were struggling to complete at home assignments, the professor decided to structure much of the final exam around extra recorded lectures and readings that no one had time to complete. Which felt, frankly, kind of mean-spirited.",
    "Need more active application - more time coming up with silvicultural prescriptions, less lecture time",
    "I learned a lot from the field trips just from being in the forest and listening to Mark, but it might be helpful to have some clarification on what the goals are prior to the trip. I think getting the handouts on Wednesday and being told to read them prior to the trip on Friday would be helpful in accomplishing that. Since the in-class time commitment for this course is heavy, I think I could have benefited from more specific an more manageable readings. You can get by without the readings, but they are pretty useful when you can find the time to do them. Primarily they are a great resource if I need to revisit some of the material in the future.",
    "- the last 4 lectures on applications, wish we had guest lecturers discuss them as opposed to mark's perspective. - the course is a broad overview of so much, fairly introductory course. Although was a little frustrating in the discrepancy of understanding between those who had taken stands vs those who hadn't - could there be a follow-up advanced version that's maybe like a week long version of forest crew? For folks who don't want to be foresters, but want to work with foresters via policy\/finance, etc. More hands-on as opposed to southern trip. - we never really learned how to figure out what geology\/soil of a site was, even though it was 20% of prescription grade. So had to memorize new haven stuff, but seemed kinda dumb. Why not show us how to look up soils on the NRCS soilweb app? Look up the geology table? Compare it against the site. - I like how Ann structured her lectures\/readings, so the readings were in the same folder as the lecture. This is mainly for the first part of the course. Once we got to the last part, the chapters of the books were pretty easy to align with lectures.",
    "I wish we had done a bit more with the quantitative aspects of silviculture and spent more time talking about post establishment treatments",
    "Clarity of lectures",
    "The course needs to emphasise the importance of the readings.",
    "Field trips were great but very time intensive. Could be made more condensed.",
    "I was sometimes surprised by what we were tested on. I understand that we should definitely have a grasp of the big concepts, but some of the questions we were tested on seemed like such minor details. Also, we were not aware that we would be tested on things in the readings that were not covered in the lectures until one of the last week of classes. In that case I would have made more of an effort to review the readings. I thought the readings were more supplemental for those who are struggling to understand what is covered in class. I also wish we were told to review the lecture that was not given (plantation lecture).",
    "I think there should be some way (random quizes for instance) to ensure students are doing reading. I was not able to do as much reading as I should have, or would have liked, and would have been much more incentivized to do so if there were weekly quizes on the readings. Also, the syllabus lacked a clear reading schedule. It would be helpful if the readings were organized by the lectures they relate to.",
    "This course is taught at a very high level in terms of plant taxonomy, forest dynamics, and geography. It would be wise for the professor to better explain these topics for the students with less or no training in these areas. The professor did answer questions when asked, but in the future, some better introductions to topics at a basic level would reduce class disruption due to very basic questions.",
    "It should have been made clear from day one that students are responsible for all assigned readings not just the ones related to topics covered in lecture. If readings are supplemental they should be cleared designated as such. Sometimes the lectures were not concise, but were drawn-out and hard to understand what the main point was."
