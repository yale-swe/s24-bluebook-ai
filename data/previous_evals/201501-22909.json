   "comments": [
    "Great class, especially when taught by Guilio. It really fills the gaps in knowledge from 310. You will get exposed to various topics, which may seem a little bit arbitrary. We ended up with Riemann Surfaces - I liked it.",
    "Yes, anyone interested in mathematics MUST take this course. It is miles beyond Math 310 in both the subject matter and the professor. You learn a wide variety of advanced topics in complex analysis which relate strongly to many other areas of math, such as geometry, topology, and number theory. Highly recommended.",
    "If you are a serious mathematician in any field, this class is a must-take. It is critical material for aspiring analysts, number theorists, geometers, algebraists, and physicists. Complex analysis is a central area of mathematics, and its union with group theory is heavily explored in this course. This modern approach is the basis for so many of the serious current topics in mathematics, that it is invaluable. Regardless of the professor, this class is a must, but with Professor Tiozzo the workload was very manageable, and despite the wide variety of material, the class was considerably stress-free.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student that found complex analysis interesting and wanted to learn more. It's a fine course, and the material is interesting.",
    "315 is a good introduction to some of the more intermediate topics in complex analysis, like entire functions, elliptic functions, and Riemann surfaces. I would definitely recommend that every math major take it after 310."
