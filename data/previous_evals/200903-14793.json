    "Yes, I will recommend GG536 to other students, because this course is really useful, and Prof. Smith's teaching is really excellent.",
    "If somebody wants to understand atmospheric phenomena based on wave characteristics, I strongly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course very much.",
    "If you have an excellent physical background (even perhaps without fluids, though better to have taken an intro fluids class) and are interested in the course material, go for it. Keep in mind that it's mostly confined to the atmosphere, so if you're looking for convection in other materials -- this is not where you'll learn it.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student studying atmospheric, oceanic and climate dynamics."
