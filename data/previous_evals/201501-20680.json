   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a introductory, yet often detailed and comprehensive, light microscopy course for cell biologists who want a good grasp of both the theoretical and practical aspects of imaging for use in their own research. I would recommend this course highly to another student, and already have! I learned a great deal about a subject I felt hesitant about before the course, but now have a lot more confidence with, especially with the theoretical aspects.",
    "Very good",
    "I would say CBIO 701 is a great general course for people who would like to work on microscopy. I definitely would recommend this course to other students. Now I feel I have more knowledge in microscopy principles as well as applications.",
    "The course focused heavily on the science behind microscopy, with the goal of assisting the design and quality of microscopy experiments. The course functioned as a survey of microscopy techniques available, including cutting edge techniques, with information brought to us by experts in those fields. I would recommend this class as it gave a lot of information about the available techniques in microscopy and exposed me to some leading experts in microscopy with whom I may potentially collaborate.",
    "I do already recommend it to everyone!",
    "CBIO 701 01 is a broad survey of light microscopy techniques that focuses especially on fluorescence imaging, super-resolution approaches, live-cell imaging, and data collection and analysis. I would strongly recommend CBIO 701 01 for any student planning to use significant light microscopy during their studies or for any student who wants to know more about commonly used varieties of light microscopy (e.g., confocal, two-photon, TIRF)."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about a subject I felt hesitant about before the course, but now have a lot more confidence with, especially with the theoretical aspects. This course will help me in my research because I am now familiarized with light microscopy techniques to the point where I can theoretically understand most any microscopy technique I would encounter during my thesis work. I have also been exposed to (and in some cases used) tools and equipment with which I can perform imaging and analysis of my own experimental samples and data.",
    "Given my familiarity with available microscope techniques and the principles\/applications of these approaches, I am now more likely to apply one of these techniques to my research.",
    "After taking this course, I have a better sense of what we can do with microscopy and sometime we need to pay attention to when performing experiments and intepretating results",
    "I work a lot with confocal microscopy. I have a general idea of confocal with the help of my mentor in the lab. However, with this course, I not only know how to deal with confocal but also understand the meaning of each elements. I feel much more comfortable in using confocal now.",
    "I think this helped me to understand why microscopes work as they do and has made me much more able to manipulate microscopes to obtain better quality data. I am unlikely to use most of the techniques covered in the class in my dissertation because of the limitations of the system which I am using for my research.",
    "I knew very little about advanced microscopy, and now I know a lot more.",
    "There is a strong possibility that I will use live cell imaging during my thesis work. I may also use some of the super-resolution techniques addressed."
