    "Combinatorics is fucking cool.",
    "We learned about a lot of cool stuff in the area of probabilistic combinatorics.",
    "An insight into modern methods of combinatorial theory. Learned the \"discrete\" way of thinking.",
    "I learned a huge amount about the probabilistic method, the central theme of the course. As someone who did not have much knowledge of probability theory before the course, I also learned quite a bit about probability generally, although probably at the expense of understanding some of the more advanced topics. Unfortunately, some personal crises late in the semester left me unable to fully engage with the material, especially those advanced topics. However, the course definitely sharpened my mathematical reasoning skills overall."

    "Easier problem sets.",
    "It's different every year, and students may be apprehensive to take a course without having an idea of the material. On the other hand, this is a strength - it's a topics course, and students can take it from one year to the next.",
    "The course was a great way to learn more about combinatorics. Generally the lectures were well-done, and the material was very interesting. I would only suggest that Prof. Vu try to step back more often and give conceptual explanations of proofs; sometimes I got bogged down trying to follow the algebra and lost sight of the thrust of the argument. For the most part I appreciated the way that work was structured, although the quiz at the beginning of the course did not feel helpful (mostly, just a hit to your grade). I also would have appreciated more grading transparency. However, the homework problems were generally a good and useful challenge, and I thought the final presentation was a productive exercise."

   "comments": [
    "If you like probability and discrete math, yes!",
    "The material is very interesting. Some of the problems on the psets were quite hard, but the workload was manageable.",
    "Certainly. The material is rich, Van Vu is a fun lecturer, and the format is somewhere between a typical undergrad class and a seminar - students present final projects at the end. The problem sets are challenging, but worth it.",
    "First of all, note that the content of this course changes between semesters. When I took it, the focus was entirely on the probabilistic method and related topics, but be sure to check if you are interested in the current theme. Once you've established that you're interested (and you really should be interested), make sure that you are prepared for the course. It is a good class, and you'll learn a lot, but it can be hard. And Prof. Vu does not seem to have much patience for students who get in over their heads. That said, he is a good lecturer - incredibly smart - and the material is really interesting. While you'll undoubtedly struggle at times to understand the material, your grade is based almost entirely on homework and a final presentation, so it's not hard to do well. But be warned that the homework can take quite a while. Overall, this can be a very interesting course, but you definitely get out what you put in. Prof Vu will present a lot of information, and it is on you to be motivated and learn it. He will not hold your hand. If you are genuinely interested in the subject and good at math, it is worth taking. If not, be cautious.",
    "good class. requires a solid amount of work."
