   "comments": [
    "Amazing class with interesting topics. It has a moderate amount of reading but is manageable and you can skim some of it if need be. There are two papers-the first one which comes rather quickly and the second final paper may seem a bit daunting, but Professor LeBaron does a great job of taking you through the steps to have a polished piece of writing that you can publish by the end. Great class, great professor, would recommend especially if you are interested in forced labor or human trafficking.",
    "One presentation. One end of semester paper ~15 pages and a proposal\/outline for that paper. No reading responses but everyone was encouraged to do them for small groups and debates.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. The methodology you learn is applicable to all future courses you will ever take. The class is very reading and writing intensive, but very rewarding in the end. You will gain very specific knowledge about an important topic. Cannot recommend this class any higher.",
    "An excellent seminar that covers a most pressing issue of our times. Genevieve provides great support both in and out of class. Workload is manageable and generous feedback is given.",
    "Id recommend it! Just try to go to office hours and come up with a paper topic youll be excited to research well in advance of the prospectus deadline. From observing my peers experiences, some of the more exciting research topics were country- and\/or cultural tradition-specific studies that drew heavily on historical analysis.",
    "PLSC 145 is a small seminar that allows everyone to study more in depth about forced labor in global supply chains and understand its root causes. The class consist of weekly readings, a short paper (around 5 pgs) and a long paper (around 20 pgs). I definitely recommend this course to another student because the professor is amazing and the topic is super interesting.",
    "A survey of the academic literature and primary documents that are available on the subject of Forced Labor, this class analyzes the aspects of labor relations critically. It is an amazing course offering considering that this is not a topic that we as consumers tend to think about. Hands down one of the best courses I've ever taken; Professor LeBaron knows how to lead the seminar and is very open to students and their suggestions.",
    "I would 100% recommend. This class is not easy, or very uplifting, but the subject matter is extremely important and definitely worth learning about. The course is extremely well taught and is worth the time that is put in. I learned a lot from Professor LeBaron!",
    "Yes!",
    "This is an amazing class that might make you hate capitalism a bit more, but at the same time love it because you are so much more aware of the world and how you, as an individual, contribute to the vicious cycle of forced labor. I would highly recommend this class to anyone and everyone.",
    "YES! This class is about a variety of aspects of forced labor - definitions, root causes, how it intersects with immigration, how it shows up in a variety of industries, what people have done to attempt to stop it (and how they have succeeded and failed). Each week, we have a set of readings and one pair of students prepare questions and a presentation (which is given at the start of class). After the presentation, we go into discussion. We, as a class, found the discussion was most fruitful when the presenters led discussion and we didn't use a speaker's list. The main assignments are your presentation, a short 5-pg essay, and a 20 page research paper. They were all assignments that were well placed throughout the year. There is also a lot of guidance if you need it. I loved the research paper assignment, surprisingly. As someone who doesn't really like to write long papers, I really enjoyed researching a topic interesting to me, and being able to bring what I was learning to class discussion. Overall, take this class the next time it is taught if you get into it! Great professor, great topic, meaningful work, smart people.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course -- it is an extremely necessary exploration to the ways in which capitalism, global production networks, and our labor market function and create conditions of forced labor.",
    "Awesome class, definitely take it if it's offered again. The topic is super interesting and even more complex than you think it is, and it's great to learn from someone who's both relatively young and very experienced\/has worked with a lot of international organizations on forced labor. Workload is very doable - 1 shorter paper (that's due very early in the semester), 1 presentation, and a 15-20 page final paper (due during the last week of class). Discussion got repetitive sometimes, but I guess that happens in most seminars. Definitely one of the best poli sci seminar's I've been in.",
    "Forced Labor is an excellent class on a topic that isn't well known or broadly studied. It is an accessible introduction to an important, contemporary issue.",
    "Yes, TAKE. You will not regret it. This course will probably be one of the most fulfilling courses you have Yale. It forces you to improve on your argumentation, writing, and critical thinking."
