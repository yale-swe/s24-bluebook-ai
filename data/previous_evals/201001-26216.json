    "These seminars are incoveniently timed and make it difficult for me to balance Mondays. However, some topics were interesting, though not extraordinary.",
    "Course did better this semester bringing in outside researchers and covering a more diverse set of topics. Still room for improvement.",
    "I liked the 2nd semester seminar better. It might have been a combination of the speakers, but all of them were extremely good and thought provoking.",
    "I enjoyed the CDE\/SBS seminar much more this semester than last semester. It was probably because more of the topics were things that I am interested in, but I felt that it was worth my time.",
    "Interesting to hear about the research that's currently going on, sometimes boring, sometimes the lecturers weren't great.",
