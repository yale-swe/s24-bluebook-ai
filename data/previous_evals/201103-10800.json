    "Psyc 627 explored how psychological processes form in infants. It teaches infant methodology while looking at a multitude of psychological phenomena in infants. I would recommend this class but only if it is the only class you take because it's a lot of work and a very small group (so you can't get out of doing the reading ever).",
    "Yes. If you are at all interested in infant cognition, or in developmental psychology or cognitive science, this would be a very good course."

   "comments": [
    "It taught me a lot of methods and piqued my interest in the development of gender, a topic that I think I will pursue in the future.",
    "The course deepened my understanding of psychology by providing me with a broad grounding in the research in infant cognition. This will be highly informative for my own research as I move forward both in the methods employed and in the theoretical underpinnings covered.Additionally, the weekly responses provided a chance to think through the material critically and even propose new infant studies."
