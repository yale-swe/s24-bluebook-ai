    "Useful",
    "The seminar is good for listening to a quick (or not so quick) snapshot of a professor's current research. However, lightning talks were not well organized; there was not a moderator to make sure that each professor was not going over time. Also, not all the professors interested in having rotation students were present.",
    "I think that we don't get exposed to enough professors during this seminar.",
    "I would describe the course as a great way to get more exposure to faculty in the department so you can make a better decision about rotations. I would definitely recommend it to another student for that reason.",
    "Not really, it wasn't useful for me. I mean we had very few professors explain their research."

    "It introduced me to the variety of research conducted within Yale's BBSB program and possible rotation labs to choose from for my rotations.",
    "Overall, I thought the lightning talks were helpful. However, I didn't end up rotating with any other professors who talked. However, I did talk to one professor after I listened to his rotation talk. If the talks were better organized and held before our first rotation decision was due, it would have been more effective.",
    "This course helped me find more people I might want to rotate with."
