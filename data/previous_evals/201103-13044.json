    "Take this class if you're interested in word origins and linguistics. The class is probably unlike any other Latin course you've taken, as it looked at Latin surveyed from different time periods, so you might read archaic Latin and inscriptions. You also look at other languages and compare them. The material can be at times difficult, but at the same time really interesting.",
    "The class is intimidating at first, but with careful reading of the background texts, the class is very manageable. At the end of the class, I felt like I had really learned something.",
    "This class is most recommended to students who get excited about historical linguistics, particularly of the Indo-European variety. This is far more a linguistics course than a Latin course, though Latin does get read and discussed.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. There was a good blend between linguistics and translation. I feel that my Latin has become better because of this class."
