   "comments": [
    "Yes. Because the homework is just to read essays, it's often enjoyable, and the assignments stretch you to write in styles you're unfamiliar with.",
    "My favorite class this semester. English 120 is great with almost all the profs who teach it, because it's so fun - reading and discussing interesting personal essays, and then getting to write some of your own. Prof. Hopkins is the best, a really kind and funny guy who will help you start to find your voice as a writer. I honestly feel like after just one semester, I have become a more powerful writer. The workload is heavy though, about 1 essay every 2 or 3 weeks. Writing the essays was fun for me though, because there's a lot more freedom since they're personal essays and not the formal literary papers that we tend to associate with English classes.",
    "ENGL 120 was a fun class. The class really does teach you how to write better. Most of the readings are really interesting. Professor Hopkins is a really great instructor. He really cares about his students and is available to help out. The humor\/satire topic was also really fun.",
    "Excellent nonfiction writing course, recommended for all. Really helped me appreciate writing not just as a tool but also an art. Hopkins is an upbeat and engaging professor, and gives good advice for your writing. Definitely a great choice if you can get him. He assigns five essays, which I think is definitely better than the six that other sections assign, as it gives you more time to think and revise. The essays range from conventional (personal experience, place, person) to unconventional (experimental argument, humor), so you'll get experience writing a pretty diverse range of styles. The readings were overall very interesting, too.",
    "I think this is a great class to take if you are comfortable writing a little outside the box and are willing to receive input for one of your essays from the entire class. Often, students are really quite nice and complimentary about your essay, so there is nothing to really be afraid of. I took this class for the requirements, but I ended up thoroughly enjoying myself as it was a break from my other mores STEM intensive classes.",
    "I really enjoyed English 120, and I generally don't enjoy English classes. The readings are great - since they're nonfiction essays, they're usually interesting and fun to read. My writing didn't improve as much as I had hoped but I liked writing nonfiction essays since I had never written in this style before. Professor Hopkins was good.",
    "Good alternative to 114 but its harder to get an A",
    "Not bad.",
    "Definitely take this class if you would like to improve your writing skills and work on different styles of essays like humor and experimental form. Professor Hopkins is great! Class was interesting and entertaining. I think his grading was fair overall. You only have to write 5 essays over the course of the semester, which wasn't too bad. (The essays are only about 4-5 pages.)",
    "I would recommend the class-- the course seemed like it would have been interesting and engaging. Just take it with a different teacher. English 120 is such a staple of the Yale curriculum it is worth taking. Just this specific class felt boring and a waste of time.",
    "English 120 is a great course to start one's academic experience at Yale. It's difficulty level makes the class challenging but accessible, and it's a great immersion into what it's like to write essays to college standards. In terms of content, English 120 asks students to write in the style of the New Yorker, Harpers Weekly, or any other \"creative non-fiction\" forums.",
    "Forces you to revise your work until significant improvement is made."
