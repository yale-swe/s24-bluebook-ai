   "comments": [
    "The Confucian Tradition is an excellent class for someone looking for a fun yet challenging seminar, where they do more listening then speaking, and for someone who is willing to read a lot and is generally interested in Chinese intellectual and premodern history.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who has a serious interest in ancient Chinese history, better with background knowledge, or else it might be very eye-opening but very difficult at the same time.",
    "One of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale. I was very excited to take this course, but ended up having one of the worst experiences ever. The professor is incredibly subjective - she will not accept any interpretation other than hers of anything you read or write about. Her feedback is scattered and often non-sensical. Expect to go to all of her offices hours. She will suggest you read a ton of different sources, but in the end, the sources will have no relationship to what you're actually researching. She will continuously flipflop on what she wants - she just likes to speak poetically about nothing. There is no clear idea of your grades at any point in the semester, and she hardly gives any instructions for her assignments. Deadlines are often shifted and there is literally no description of assignments beyond page count. There's not even prompts or a scope for the papers.You'll just be in a haze of confusion most of the time during this course. Discussions drone on and she often goes off on tangents. Her syllabus is overly ambitious - there's a ton of dense reading each week, so no one bothers to read them. Its unfortunate that this is how this coursed turned out because it certainly had a lot of potential. Don't take it; just read some of the primary sources on your own if you're interested in learning about the Confucian traditions.",
    "Very interesting course taught by a very knowledgeable professor.",
    "Annping Chin is a lovely professor and very kind. Take this class. The readings are all reasonable and interesting, and it's relatively light on assignments.",
    "I needed a pre-industrial and LAAA credit so I took it. The readings were pretty interesting, but the professor was the most unorganized I've had at Yale. She often arrived late and digressed a lot in class. I could have learned so much more from the class had it been taught differently. Not recommended.",
    "I would probably only recommend this course if you're taking it Credit D. Although the subject matter was fascinating, and Professor Chin could not be more knowledgeable, its unnecessarily stressful because as far as the teaching and course structure go, it really is more of a graduate student course.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student: in its current form, it is too scattered, and frankly, quite boring - it seemed like a lecture course at times! Unless you are interested in putting a ton of time on your own into this class to try and get something out of it, I would stay away...it needs a LOT of improvement.",
    "I would take the class if you are excited by the syllabus and the final paper but know that you will be studying these texts relatively independently because seminar discussions will be pretty weak.",
    "The Confucian Tradition is a survey of Chinese intellectual history, from its early classical foundations through the modern period. If your focus is exclusively on modern China (read: 20th century or post-1949), then you should look elsewhere. However, if you are interested in the philosophical and cultural background of China throughout history, and learning about fascinating episodes and cultural shifts in China, I would certainly recommend this course. While some of the readings may be a little overly long or dry (the in-depth details of how the imperial examination chambers were designed springs to mind), many of them were fascinating or unexpected. If you have an interest in gaining a deeper appreciation for Chinese culture and intellectualism, go for it!",
    "Take this course if the subject seems interesting to you! Professor Chin is a lovely professor, and her enthusiasm is contagious. Be prepared to do the reading on you own to keep up with the class and to really get the most out of the class. For the two papers, pick topics that you are really interested in - and it will be a great experience."
