    "Completely transformed how I think about acting and acting Shakespeare; taught me seriously so much.",
    "I had no previous experience with Shakespeare so I really learned everything from the ground up. We learned proper verse scantion and paraphrasing along with acting in an Elizabethan repertoire",
    "I learned about how to approach Shakespeare by giving characters full lives and diving wholeheartedly into the language. I also learned how to do scansion and craft a ten minute performance piece.",
    "I learned how to exist in the world of a character and see through their eyes. I learned how to act in a way that was not about targetting my performance or appearance but about my surroundings."

   "comments": [
    "Bundy is a genius ; class can sometimes feel really long - but totally worth it.",
    "Strength is the tutelage from Professor Bundy. Weakness: the size of the class means you have less time to work but I would not want the class capped any lower so it comes with the territory.",
    "This course is amazing. James has pretty much got this course down to a science in all aspects. The organization of the course is great: starting out with sonnets, then moving to monologues, then scenes, then spending the remaining weeks on the character workshop. Having weekly tutorials with a TA works well because it allows you to to come into a safe space whether you feel confident or a hot mess to make choices that will inform your work (and it just so happened this semester that the TA and James were in sync, but I know that isn't always the case). There really aren't any weaknesses to the course, it's very well done and structured the way it is.",
    "Strengths: Bundy's feedback is unlike anything else. He is direct and to the point and unbelievably perceptive. The readings were AMAZING!! The room of actors was supportive and encouraging. Our TA Logan was also phenomenal and a real strength of the class is the weekly tutorial. Weaknesses: NOTHING"

    "100000%. There is no other class like this at Yale - I do not identify as an \"Actor\" so this class was outside of my comfort zone but in such a good way. I haven't learned on my feet like this in any other class I've taken. If you get in, this class is a MUST. My last semester here would have been literally nothing without it.",
    "Yes. Its one of the only acting technique classes in the major.",
    "Absolutely. I'd taken acting classes before, but this was my first one at Yale. I didn't know what to expect, but I came to learn so much about myself as an artist and human. This class requires so much vulnerability and willingness to release. There were a couple times I didn't think I could make it honestly, I didn't think I was talented enough or had the skillset to get through the semester, but you learn to lean on your classmates, TA, and James and it makes the entire experience worthwhile. At the end you complete a ten minute piece based around any Shakespeare character of your choosing and doing it is difficult as hell, but it is one of the most rewarding experiences of my Yale career. This class exists not just for senior theater studies majors, it's for senior psych majors like I am, first years who are undecided like two folks in my class were; it's for everyone. If you're able to get in, think about how it would serve your journey and growth and if it would, take it.",
    "100%. TAKE THIS CLASS. It's EASILY the best class I've taken at Yale. I learned an unbelievable amount about acting, directing, reading, and being a human being. That's the magical combination of Bundy and Shakespeare for you. Be prepared to rehearse all the time!! Take Bundy's feedback seriously and I would suggest taking only 4 classes if you enroll in Acting Shakespeare. The class is incredibly demanding and incredibly rewarding. Bundy helps bring things out of you that you didn't know were there. He pushes you, encourages you, intimidates you, and inspires you to rise to the challenge he sets."
