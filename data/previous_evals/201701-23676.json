   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of busy work, and I think it could be improved by directing more energy toward class participation than homework completion.",
    "Course was very well constructed",
    "Little much with the busy work. Else very strong organization.",
    "Strengths: The readings, movie, and novel (Batallas en el desierto) were very interesting and fun to read\/watch. Weaknesses: The online homework was extremely frustrating at times. The multiple choice\/fill in the blank questions were fine, but any time it asked you to write a sentence you knew you might as well write that section off. It's simply too difficult to guess what sentence structure they're looking for, and you'll get the entire question wrong for missing a comma.",
    "Great professor, engaging material and classes. Class everyday and repetitive online homework are weaknesses.",
    "I think it has a lot of material",
    "The syllabus was littered with typos and the instructions for the exams were not very clear. However, having a great teacher like Sebastian made up for it.",
    "This course had many strengths, including how inclusive and interactive it what, what kinds of reading we discussed in class, and how often we spoke with one another. The biggest weakness was that the VHL central website that the homework assignments were on was not always pertinent to what we were studying in class.",
    "The content of the course, especially the readings in the workbook, are very interesting and challenged my ability in comprehension. Additionally the frequency of class really improved my speaking ability. I found it hard to understand the practicality of some of the grammar constructions that we learned at the end of the semester."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Would recommend to those in the Spanish language track",
    "Yes. The Spanish Department is strong at Yale and really pushes you to become more proficient. L4 is fundamental for anyone who has a good grasp on the language but is looking to really become more confident.",
    "Yes, I would because it's a great way to solidify Spanish skills particularly in grammar, writing and conversation",
    "If you have the opportunity, DEFINITELY take this with Prof. Daz. He's a great teacher and a better person. He will push you when you slack off, but this isn't a class you can really get away with slacking off in as a results of its cumulative nature. In the end, it's a very good thing. I did not need to take this class for my language requirement, but wanted to complete the L1-L4 sequence in anticipation of interning abroad. It was well worth the effort and also gets you 1.5 credits. Highly recommend.",
    "It's your average Yale language course. It's required, takes up too much of your time, and makes you slightly better at speaking the language. The course is extremely similar to L3 with higher expectations. Homework is extremely tedious and takes way longer than you hope it would (45 mins-1 hour every night).",
    "Yes this a great course for learning spanish.",
    "If you are interested in more spanish beyond L3, take it. If not, it is only harder than previous courses so I wouldn't suggest it.",
    "I took it because it was required. Wouldn't have taken it if not for that.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "If you look to continue to improve your spanish and most especially if you would like to practice, this is a good course to take"
