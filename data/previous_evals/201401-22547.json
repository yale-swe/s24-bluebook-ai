    "I do not think this instructors teaching the course again. The course in general is a straightforward continuation of the previous semester quantum mechanics and will cover more applications.",
    "Excellent course to hone your quantum mechanics skills, focusing on time dependent QM and scattering theory. Not too work intensive, though (open-notes) exams can be difficult due to the lack of practice solving problems.",
    "Definitely -- you learn more in-depth quantum mechanics, mostly time-dependent QM, and I found that I gained a much more intuitive understanding of QM. Tully was awesome, but unfortunately I think this is the last year he's teaching.",
    "I would recommend it to students who already have a very solid background.",
