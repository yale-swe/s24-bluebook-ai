   "comments": [
    "L1 German class. You learn a lot. As with any language course, it's best to find an instructor whose teaching style you like, so shop around. Florian Fuchs is fantastic. Also as with any language course, be ready to spend time outside of course if you want to have a good time and learn something.",
    "Overall very fun class. But it moves quite quickly and glosses over some basics of grammar\/vocabulary. I would recommend the class, but would not recommend going into it with an expectation for an in-depth understanding of basic grammar\/vocab.",
    "Maybe. The course is helpful. The instruction is sometimes confusing. The textbook is poorly written and ridiculously expensive.",
    "L1 German is a great class. The class focuses on immersion instead of drilling grammar, which is refreshing and fun but at times a little confusing. There is some online homework each week, frequent tests, and a group video project instead of a final.",
    "Only students that are really passionate about learning German. The workload is far too much for someone that would just want to casually learn another language.",
    "You learn a lot of German really quickly. Grading is not hard, and you can get whatever grade you want (depending on how much effort you put in).",
    "Deutsch ist khl.",
    "Yes, German was an interesting language and the way that this class made it easy to keep up with the material as long as you paid attention in class and went over the vocab on your own.",
    "German L1 is great! The head of the department organizes it, so all of the different sections follow the same schedule. I highly recommend Florian, if he teaches L1 again. He was very enthusiastic, encouraging, and patient."
