   "comments": [
    "It doesn't require too much critical thinking because it can be basic, so you will excel if you are a rational, creative, (any adjective here) critical thinker.That said, some students complained about the simplicity. I was fine with the pace. We learned how to solve 2-4 more types of questions per week, and then had a p-set to try to apply those concepts. There are more complicated examples on the class website, more depth, and many practical applications. Professor Frame has many office hours to discuss any of those that are interesting to you.",
    "Take it. It's a class you need to take at Yale.",
    "Take it -- the midterm and final are open book\/open note. There is a pset every week but if you go to the tutoring sessions you'll get 100% on every one.",
    "This is a class for students looking to easily fill a QR requirement, but you do practice math skills and learn from a great professor.",
    "Interesting, not super hard QR. What more can you want? The material can be a little bit hard to follow sometimes, but going to tutoring\/study groups can really make a difference. The math is very artsy and abstract - I love it! Definitely worth taking if you want to try something new and\/or if you are not a fan of conventional math.",
    "Math 190 is perfect for a self-motivated student. Yes, it's possible to coast and get a good grade, but if you pay attention, you can pick up much more than he will require you to learn. It's not nearly as straight-forward as something like calculus, but it requires less previous knowledge and less work. The subject matter is quite various, which has it's pros and cons. Overall, you get a good overview of different ways of approaching fractals. But what's really valuable is that fractal geometry changes the way you see much of the world.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! You won't regret it! Frame is an extraordinary professor, the material is epic, and the class is a ton of fun. The homework is great practice but doesn't make you start pulling out your hair every week. Take it!",
    "This is a great math credit for those looking to fulfill a QR requirement. It isn't too challenging, but you do real math - I found flexing that math muscle a really nice thing after it had been atrophying for a long time. Michael Frame is a treasure - you should jump at the opportunity to take a class with him. Yes, some of the lectures were a little hard to follow, but Frame is so invested in making sure you understand something and so open to you raising your hand to try to understand and meeting you during office hours or whenever to help you out. I don't think I know akinder or more caring teacher.",
    "You will learn about fractals, you will hear jokes, you will be (I hope) at least a bit inspired by the subject and its delivery.",
    "Fractal Geometry is the most philosophical, intriguing, life-changing math class you will ever take.",
    "Fractals is a perfect QR for people without strong backgrounds in math. I found myself thinking about the applications of fractals to other disciplines and relating it directly to other classes.I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Intro to things that will blow your mind.",
    "Prepare to actually spend time learning the material.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Frame is an absolutely amazing professor, and he is just so passionate and inspiring about what he does. The class isn't super tough, but it is definitely fascinating, as the material is very relevant and applicable to many different (and surprising) aspects of life.",
    "If you are not into traditional math, then I would suggest taking this course. It's a good change of pace and Fractals are an interesting concept to learn about. The workload is completely manageable (one homework assignment a week with 1-3 problems on it) and Professor Frame is good at splitting up the lecture time by telling jokes and ending with stories.",
    "It's not exactly a \"gut\", but not exactly the hardest class at Yale either. You will struggle towards the end, towards the exams. BUT, tutors and last minute studying and practice exams help a lot.Trying to learn everything is silly though. Unless you're really interested in fractal geometry.. it's a bit of a waste of time to understand the logic behind all the math.",
    "Professor Frame is an amazing teacher and person. I'm so glad I got the chance to take a class with him. I'm generally not a math person, but I found the visual aspect of fractals really interesting, and the workload\/exams were manageable.",
    "This course exposed me to a totally new topic that I've never heard of before. Lectures can sometimes be a bit boring, but the course is interesting if you want to learn a less conventional math subject.",
    "If you don't particularly like math, but you need one of those pesky QR requirements and want to be inspired by the boss known as Michael Frame, take this class!",
    "Great class because of Michael Frame. Take it if you can. Very easy - open note exams, problem sets that take 1 hr, and generally easy material. Doesn't go into much depth though, so if you're looking for an in-depth analysis of fractal geometry, MATH 290 might be better. Nevertheless, worth taking for Michael Frame.",
    "I really enjoyed Fractal Geometry. I was probably one of my favorite class at Yale, and I'm really not a math person. Michael Frame is awesome, probably my favorite professor I had in my four years at Yale. He has so much wisdom, and he tells jokes in every class, so it really makes you want to go just to listen to him. The material is pretty easy to pick up on, and the problem sets were not bad at all. The midterm and final were completely manageable. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class for everyone!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Among other things, it's a fascinating history of how a simple idea influenced mathematics and other fields in unpredictable, wonderful ways. The class is geared toward the non-mathematically oriented, but I would advise those with a stronger math background not to hesitate to take it (perhaps as an adjunct to another math class). I didn't find the math itself challenging, but the lectures are not at all dumbed-down, and I think it's worthwhile to learn to look at mathematics (and the world!) in an unfamiliar way.",
    "This is a great fifth course. NOTE: NOT A GUT. The homework is consistent and manageable. The tests are open note, but that doesn't mean don't study. It's really important to understand the concepts, otherwise you won't be able to apply your knowledge to the random, curve-ball questions. Really, one of the best courses I've taken. I see the world very differently, thanks to Prof. Frame.",
    "If you're looking for an enriching class with an amazing professor that fulfills your QR requirement, this is the class for you. If you're just looking for a gut, take something like Astronomy instead, because the concepts in Fractal Geometry aren't easy to get at first. However, help is always there if you ask for it - Professor Frame gives ample office hours each week and is always willing to take time to make sure students understand the lesson. Personally, I am thankful that I was able to take the class a professor who loves his students as much as his what he teaches.",
    "EXCELLENT COURSE!!! Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is interesting and not too complicated, for those less talented in math. THe professor is fantastic and the class is fun.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It's interesting and engaging for students from all mathematical backgrounds. It's a unique subject, it's taught well, the workload is manageable, and Michael Frame is the best.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Fractal Geometry was one of my favorite classes this year. Michael Frame teaches every aspect of fractals, that a non math major could easily understand, very well. The class is very organized and structured. Problem sets are based on exactly what was done in class that week and they aren't too long. The class is fantastic and it opens up a new door if you don't know what fractals are.",
    "This is a great class. The material is interesting and not too difficult and the work load is relatively light. But, most importantly, take this opportunity to get to know Professor Frame. He is a truly wonderful person, and his life stories are truly inspiring. Take this class for him--you will not find another professor who is as moving or as committed to his students as Professor Frame.",
    "I would recommend it if you are a math person.",
    "Fractal Geometry is not a gut math course. That being said, it is not an impossible course. It is an engaging and intellectually challenging class. The class teaches you how to look at the world in a different way. The course requires an understanding of algebra and basic geometry. Although more advanced concepts are introduced, Professor Frame always makes them accessible and clear. The topics are fascinating and ever evolving. I would certainly recommend this course to any student who is interested in an interesting math course and a phenomenal professor.",
    "Take it--if not to learn about a strain of math that you might not otherwise, to take a class with Frame, who is as good as they come. He has teaching this class down to a science (reviews material at the beginning of every class, posts notes online, etc.), and is truly a pleasure to listen to, weaving humor, anecdote, and life lesson into his lectures. The problem sets were manageable, the exams were open-note, and there was a helpful course tutor. But know that, though some find the class easy, it is not universally a gut.",
    "YES YES YES. I couldn't say enough good things about this class and about Frame. If he teaches again, this is one of those rare Yale classes that you will remember for the rest of your life.",
    "incredible and fascinating, i would recommend it",
    "Take it, because you will remember fractals and Frame forever",
    "Fractals is a great class, more conceptually than mathematically challenging (I mean once you get the idea, though this can be difficult, the math is pretty basic), and also visually compelling (you get to look at pretty images), and also Frame is just wonderful, a sweet, great, GENEROUS, man. Because of all this, I recommend the class to non-science\/math majors trying to get a QR out of the way, but who don't want a complete gut. You go to the classes, you listen to the sweetheart Frame, and you give yourself an hour or two for the psets, and you'll probably be solid. I can't really speak to those who are science\/math majors, but I would guess that it wouldn't be PAINFULLY easy even for you guys...",
    "Take it! I loved it.",
    "Great - Frame is an awesome guy and you won't learn about this stuff anywhere else. Weekly problem sets aren't too tough, open book tests, interesting topics. Not a total gut, but good for non-math types.",
    "definitely yes, but I don't think it's going to happen again",
    "Fractal Geometry is an introduction to the math behind fractals, which are basically endless patterns. I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys learning about math in a way that is different from the high school classroom-style.",
    "This class was really cool and I recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is a strong visual learner.",
    "Take this course! Professor Frame will teach you not only about really cool math that is seen everywhere, from ammonite shells to mountains to lightning, but also about life. This is a must-take for everyone. I am not a math major, but Professor Frame made it easy for people like me to understand.",
    "Professor Frame teaches an aesthetically beautiful and intriguing class. It is also not too challenging on a workload level. Professor Frame is very devoted to making sure that even those who are clearly just taking the class for a QR credit and may never find a use for the specific knowledge in the class still get something worthwhile out of it. As for the subject matter, it's intriguing for pretty much anybody.",
    "Take Fractal Geometry-- not perhaps as a math course, but as a class on life. The material is interesting enough; problem sets are minimal; there are no books to buy. But take Fractals for Michael Frame and you will be in the presence of a being who truly loves what he does, with passion and tenderness and philosophy. A man who teaches you meaning. And jokes about cats.",
    "Pretty basic math concepts, complexity builds as the term goes on. Great way for non-math majors to get a Qr. One p-set every week, one midterm one final.",
    "This is an interesting, extremely easy math class. I would recommend it iff you are looking for a course which will not be very time consuming or challenging.",
    "This is a great and fairly basic math class. You have to do problem sets every week and the midterm and final are open note. Prof Frame is a really great professor and always there for his kids.",
    "yes yes yes! take it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Michael Frame is the kindest man, always tells jokes and stories during class. If you take the initiative to get help from the tutor or go to his office hours, the homework will be a breeze, and even if not, studying the notes he puts on the website will usually help you figure it out. The midterm and final are both open notes, you can bring anything you want and take your time to figure out what he's given you. This is the best QR i have taken at Yale.",
    "I don't think it will ever be offered again but if it is, take it if you want a QR that is easy to do well in with a professor that is amazing.",
    "Fractal Geometry is a whirlwind introduction to the this branch of mathematics suitable for those interested in the topic and those who have never heard of it alike. While it is definitely known as one of the easier ways to fulfill a QR credit, it is also one of the most interesting and engaging."
