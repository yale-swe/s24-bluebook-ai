    "Korean 150 is one of the only ways to study advanced-level Korean at Yale, and it can be a mixed experience. Most of the class time is based on reading things aloud and repeating after the teacher, and it is much different in style from the lower-level Korean classes at Yale. My reading and writing have improved, but there wasn't as much of a chance for speaking practice outside of the meetings with the TA. I would only recommend this class to someone specifically interested in Korean -if you're just looking to fill the language requirement or are just taking a language for fun, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",
    "Yes, it is a small, so a little awkward at the start, but towards the end of the semester everyone gets along quite well."
