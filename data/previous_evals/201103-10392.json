   "comments": [
    "Strongly recommend. I loved the course, and I learned a lot.",
    "First of all, advanced organic should really be called physical organic, because 'advanced organic' does not convey anything about the course material. It was a class that studies the structure-function relationship (or structure-reactivity), and it mainly deals with the meat-and-potatoes of organic chemistry.This isn't a foundational course, but it strengthens the foundations of our understanding of organic chemistry. It explains the less-than-obvious subtleties of chemistry.I'd recommend it in a heartbeat. I think it's fascinating stuff.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 518 to students wishing to further their knowledge of Organic Chemistry. The course probes the fundamentals of physical organic chemistry and is capable of changing one's perspective of chemical problems.",
    "Great class for anyone who enjoyed organic chemistry in undergrad and wants to develop a better understanding. I would recommend it.",
    "I would say the class is a review of the principles behind organic chemistry. I would definitely recommend it because I think it is not only a useful subject, it is also a well-taught class.",
    "I strongly recommend it to students in the organic division.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course.",
    "This course takes a deeper look into concepts that we had been taught in previous organic chemistry courses. Yes, I would recommend this course because it provides a fundamental understanding of organic chemistry.",
    "Advanced Organic Chemistry is a physical organic chemistry course. Several topics are covered such as molecular conformations, electronic effects, acid\/base chemistry, thermodynamics and kinetics of specific reactions, and various solvent effects. This course is very good at extending connections between pure organic chemistry and pure physical chemistry to help one really understand what is occurring in one's research and why. I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would. Professor Jorgensen is very knowledgeable about the subject."

   "comments": [
    "This course made me examine principles that I had not examined previously in my undergraduate organic chemistry courses. There are many more intricacies to chemical bonding and reactions than I realized previously, and knowledge of those intricacies has already made me a better chemist.",
    "I can't say how it contributed to my dissertation or research, but I will reiterate that it was a tremendously useful class in terms of understanding the implicit design of compounds. I can say with good confidence that it will be helpful in the long run, because it introduced a much more rigorous method of examining a particular structure, and this gives additional (necessary!) insight.",
    "The course has been especially useful for understanding how computational work complements experimental work.",
    "The information that was presented in this class is highly useful for anyone going into organic chemistry. It will undoubtedly inform MANY things that I do in the laboratory.",
    "I have to be honest that since I'm doing research in biochemistry more than traditional chemistry, what i learnin this class does not seem to be related to what I'm doing.Still, I think it help me understand organic chemistry problem much better. Even though it does not help me directly in research, i think it makes me a better chemist.",
    "Conformational analysis will be helpful in the future.",
    "Physical Organic Chemistry is necessary for understanding the basics of any organic chemistry -- synthesis, chemical biology, etc. I think this course will greatly contribute to my dissertation and future research.",
    "Physical Organic Chemistry is what I'm interested in, so this course was very fitting to my research interests. As mentioned before, I feel like this course helps one make different connections to understand the \"why\" - why is something happening and why might it change when a reaction variant is changed.",
    "Physical organic chemistry is greatly useful for determining mechanisms, which aids my research."
