    "I think it is a highly important class and very useful and practical! thank you for the many exercises and practices we can do. Sometimes I felt the frame used to introduce new topics was very \"academic\" showing with data why e.g. gesturing is important etc. It seems to me that this is already pretty clear to people and if students want to learn more on numbers they can refer to the suggested literature or readings. I think there can be more reading that is required in this context where the professor would just highlight the most important messages\/numbers. Some elements were missing (in particular I would have loved to have one class more specifically about communication among cultures - cross cultural communication - which a lot of people are usually not necessarily aware of but is highly crucial for good communication in a global world). Also some of the topics seemed very basic to me (ex. topic \"knowing your audience\"). I would have appreciated a deeper dive into. Instead of just the message \"inform yourself before you speak in public to an audience\", I would have liked to hear more about \"how do you talk to different stakeholders, what are tips and tricks, what is the different narrative that is needed, etc.\" Good speakers! In particular the speaker on \"effective PPT\"! I also liked that they were moved to the time slot over lunch. Improvisation session was great! I would have appreciated to receive this information earlier in the semester so that I could have started to visit similar activities next to school."

    "Getting practice with public speaking in various formats, lengths, solo and with a group.",
    "practical, a lot of exercises, great community building feeling, get to know more about my own speaking skills\/strengths\/weaknesses",
    "Clearly identifying my own tripping points in public communication, and actively working on them in front of a crowd. Having speeches filmed was incredibly helpful. I gained confidence in what I can see\/hear I do well, and know exactly what to work on. By the end, I was a better speaker. It's like a yoga class--if you take it seriously, set your intentions, and work on what you personally need to, you'll get meaning and change out of it.",
    "This was a fantastic course. The best aspect was the many opportunities to practice public speaking. And even better than just practicing, we received constructive feedback throughout. And the professor did a great job of making the classroom a safe space to give and receive that feedback. The 'lecture' component was minimal, which was great. The professor gave just enough lecture to get across the main points and then we got to practice! Importantly, the professor was receptive to feedback as well and was very purposeful about asking for feedback. She didn't assume she knew everything or had all the 'correct' answers. She certainly has the expertise, but acknowledged nuance and gray areas - there's no one right way to do public speaking."

And even if you don't expect to have to get in front of a big audience for your profession, this class is valuable in helping you build confidence in smaller interactions as well. You're not just practicing public speaking, you're practicing communication!"
