    "This course demanded where more than it gave. Basically taught ourselves modeling from the readings and were quizzed on it. Never actually went over the material for understanding and comprehension. Only two lectures where spent on lecturing and workshops which is despicable for a semester long course. Guest lecturers should not begin until the material is learned. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT."

   "comments": [
    "It was a good introductory course to modeling, however would have been nice to delve more into practical applications instead of just guest lecturers every week. I feel like we learned compartmental models then just had seminars until the presentations were due. More lectures by Dr. Townsend would have been much more helpful.And there's an incredible lack of guidance by the faculty and TA regarding what is expected of us for the presentation and final.",
    "The topic area is quite interesting and the first couple lectures do introduce the topic decently. However, the series of guest lectures afterwards do not really teach modeling to students who do not already have a lot of modeling experience. More lectures that go in depth into the methods used and how to apply them would have been much more helpful than all those guest lectures which were really more like talks at a general public health research seminar than talks designed to teach students how to model. I found the quizzes somewhat annoying as well ... I did not feel like they really tested skills acquisition and while some of them tested reading comprehension well, I don't think they all did.",
    "This was a lot of work but I still feel like I only have a very basic understanding of modeling. The lectures were too basic, the readings way too advanced. The homeworks were helpful but I wish we learned more applications, or at least more how to at least approach different types of modeling.",
    "The problem with this course is it had 3 types of students: ecology undergrads, MPH students interested in applied public health, and doctoral\/MPH students interested in being able to use modeling in research. I would suggest this class only to the second group, as the classes strength lies in the fact that it provides an overall idea of what modeling is and how it can be used in public health. In the first few weeks of the class went well, as we focused on conceptualizing a model and the basics of what goes into modeling. However, once we moved onto probability the class got disorganized. Everyone had different statistics backgrounds, so these concepts were over-whelming to some, but very repetitive for others. The rest of the class was pretty much guest lectures. Advanced topics were touched upon in readings and guest lectures, but they were not explained in detail as the class had varying mathematical and statistical backgrounds.",
    "So, it pains me to have to say this, but this course was just terrible. Enrollment was high for what sounded like it was going to be a technical introduction to mathematical modeling of infectious disease; there is obviously a strong interest in the subject on campus as the course consisted of 25+ YSPH MPH and PhD students as well as students from elsewhere in GSAS and Yale College.However, except for 1-2 introductory lectures, the entire teaching of the course consisted of graduate student or post-doc presentations of their research in progress. While much of the grad student and post doc research involved mathematical modeling, the students in the class got no instruction on mathematical modeling beyond the first few lectures, so most of the grad student and post-doc research was over-the-heads of most of the class.Papers were assigned as well--and quizzed on--which were appropriate for an advanced seminar but presupposed more than a basic knowledge of mathematical modeling that was not provided in the course.So, my advice: prepare a syllabus about what students need to know about mathematical modeling, follow a textbook if necessary, but it is definitely not cool to hand over 80% of your classes to your grad students and post-docs, hand out papers from the literature and call it a day.This course cannot be offered in the same manner it was this year: it's a waste of time for students who are eager to learn and most of whom had to simply teach themselves some basic skills by reading a textbook etc.",
    "Guest speakers were great.Students learned everything there is to learn during first couple weeks. Everything came after was a variation of the fundamentals taught during first couple weeks of classes.",
    "Course was a good introduction to modeling topics and research. Would have preferred more introduction to Bayesian modeling theory and more workshops\/homework to improve skills. Because the subject is relatively new lectures seemed bit scattered, however lectures of applied material (e.g. Megan Fitzpatrick-Rabies vaccination) were very interesting and informative. Test and exams were fair expression of what we learned.Large amount of self study required. Would recommend changing course book to \"Infectious disease modeling in humans and animals\" as this was more helpful.",
    "Topics covered were interesting, but not well presented. Some of the guest lectures were unnecessary and very difficult to follow. The course was not very well planned. The homework assignments were, however, well written.",
    "The strengths of the course are that Dr. Townsend is good at explaining really hard concepts and that the in-class workshops were really helpful. The student\/post-doc presentations were interesting, but they were given at the expense of teaching the basic objectives of the course.However, the course was very poorly organized. Combining dynamical models with uncertainty analysis all in one semester is too much. It might be a good idea to split the class into two semesters and add an weekly or bi-weekly lab component that teaches us how run basic models, simulations, model fitting, and diagnostic tests for the data in R or in matlab. Taking out the topical presentations to do these things would be a fair trade-off (we learned, but we didn't gain any practical skills from those presentations).To start, we were never even taught how to fit any data to the kinds of models that were presented. There were three homeworks that taught us to do a couple of things in excel, but these skills are insufficient to deal with the kinds of data and simulations that we would employ in the final project.Bayesian analysis was superficially introduced, but there was no homework even showing us how to employ priors and arrive at posterior distributions. This would have really helped us understand the student\/post-doc presentations. At this point, I would not know how to defend my choice between a deterministic and Bayesian model. Similarly, I would not understand how think about a paper about a model of a common disease and a model that aims to illustrate stochastic phenomena.Lastly, there was never any written rubric or description of the final project. This made it really hard to delineate how much we were expected todo. Sometimes we were told that some preliminary results were enough and sometimes we were told that a description of expected results was enough. We didn't know how much description we were supposed to include in our write-up.",
    "A great introductory course for modeling. At times the readings were a little overwhelming for someone without a background in the subject. I still feel that I've learned a lot.",
    "This course had so much potential, however it failed to live up to this potential. The problem sets were a great way to start the learning process, but they were often too prescriptive and too easy. More lecture time from the primary lectuers would have been very helpful.",

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0It did not feel like Alison was very involved in the course or with actively attempting to help students learn epidemiological modeling.",
    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0Dr. Galvani didn't lecture very often",
    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0She only taught the first class, for the rest she brought in guest lecturers. The guest lecturers do very fascinating research, but there were too many classes devoted to them in my opinion. She was encouraging and helpful with the project and seemed genuinely interested in everyone's ideas.",
    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0So, Dr. Galvani's first lecture was a great introduction to mathematical modeling. Sadly, after the first lecture, she didn't lecture again. It is a bad idea to craft a course on mathematical modeling by having your graduate students and post-docs simply come in an talk about their research in progress. The students in class didn't have the background to understand the work or the related papers assigned each week. The quizzes thus became about trying to divine some nuggets from the papers that seemed simple enough to test our knowledge of, so instead of understanding what was going on in the papers, one was trying to see which graph or chart might show up on the quiz.I really felt as if Dr. Galvani didn't put much effort into the development of the syllabus, which could have been crafted to follow a textbook or even her own set of notes to take the class through all the basic concepts and onto more advanced topics if there was time. Dr. Galvani also didn't teach beyond the first lecture and it was unclear why the decision was made to hand over the class time to presentations from her lab.Dr. Galvani is a leader in the field; it would have been great to get some instruction from her during the semester, but though sitting the classroom, we didn't hear from her as much as we wanted to, and should have.",
    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0Very smart and sweet.",
    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0Appreciated her discussion with lecturers as to why certain choices and decisions were made in the model. Homework was fair and concise.Would have liked to hear more lectures esp. in regard to her research. Would have preferred to read more of her papers in class, especially during the introduction to modeling. Her papers were very clear and helpful in explaining both use and expression of models.",
    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0She taught for 20 minutes on the first day, so it is hard to evaluate her. She was good at suggesting interesting topics for the final project as well as connecting us to professors and post-docs that could really make our projects meaningful.The only problem I would say that she and Dr. Townsend had as teachers is that there was never any rubric or description for the final project, so the expectations for the class were extremely unclear.The course in general was very poorly organized, but I will comment on that below.",
    "Instructor: Alison Galvani \u00a0I did not have enough lecture time with Allison to properly evaluate her",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Jeff is very good one on one with students but did not seem to provide the course with an overall structure very conducive to learning to use and understand mathematical modeling.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Good at presenting basic level modeling",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0He is a natural teacher, especially when it comes to breaking down complex statistical concepts and interpreting them. He also very patient and helpful when students had questions. The first 2 homeworks actually taught me a lot (the second two were repetitive). His in-class \"workshops\" and practice problems were also very helpful. This class needs more Jeff and less guest lecturers.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Dr. Townsend is an engaging lecturer, but again, except for a 1-2 lectures, often on subjects (e.g. likelihood), which were above the initial knowledge base of the class, we didn't hear from him very much.Again, the course had two professors teaching it supposedly but the vast majority of lectures were by their grad students and post docs, and were over the heads of the class.With two leading researchers on mathematical modeling as faculty, the course could have been, should have been much better. It was a punt for them I think: not much forethought, not much effort and it showed.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0very intelligent, but teaching doesn't seem like his cup of tea",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Excellent lectures, would have preferred more of them. Appreciated attention to detail and clear explanations of theory and approaches to modeling.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Dr. Townsend was a really good teacher when he taught. The only problem I would say that he and Dr. Galvani had as teachers is that there was never any rubric or description for the final project, so the expectations for the class were extremely unclear.The course in general was very poorly organized, but I will comment on that below.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Jeff is an excellent lecturer. When he gave lectures on the different distributions I learned so much. However he does not lecture near enough - there were far too many guest lecturers."

    "This course has a brief introduction to mathematical modeling in epidemiology, particularly focused on compartmental models. Then it presents a series of guest lectures by advanced graduate students that are interesting but don't really form the content of a course designed to teach students how to use mathematical models.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course, even though I think modeling is important, but time might be better spent learning more stats or programming that could be used in modeling later",
    "If you want an overview of what modeling is in public health, this class might be for you. However, I recommend it for 2nd year MPH students who have been exposed to probability concepts in Biostats. For those wanting to actually conduct modeling research in ecology or infectious disease, this class will not give you the tools to do.",
    "No one should take this course in its current form. The professors have handed over the class to their grad students and post docs, they do only a small part of the instruction. Though there is a syllabus, it largely revolves around papers more appropriate for an advanced seminar on the subject. There is clearly a skill set associated with mathematical modeling and it could have been taught in a methodical way, step-by-step, but this was not that class. If you want to read papers that you don't understand, not be challenged very much but not learn very much either, then this is for you. Otherwise, skip this and wait until the professors get their act together or someone else teaches this.",
    "If you are good at self-learning, this is your class to take. Otherwise, you will likely to struggle.",
    "Good introduction of infectious disease modeling and applications in public health. Teachers are knowledgeable in discussion, but a large amount of self-study will be required.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Modeling of diseases is interesting, but this course was not well thought out.",
    "The course is about dynamical models, primarily applied to infectious disease, but it can be applied to other processes as well. There was only one presentation about evolution and ecology was just barely referenced. Unlike the regular linear regression and logistic regression models, these models look at how things at one time point affect things in a future time points.Unfortunately, the course is not well taught and practical skills are not taught at all. You learn as much as you would learn going to seminars every week (and the second half of the class were pretty much just talks).",
    "It would depend on the student, and his or her willingness to do the extra readings and undertake the final project.",
