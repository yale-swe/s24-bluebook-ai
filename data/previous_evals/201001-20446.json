   "comments": [
    "This course combines histology with cell biology and serves pretty good as an introduction to physiology.",
    "It is a very good course to learn cell biology at a system level and very interesting because it has a lot of disease-related topic. I would recommend.",
    "Yes, this course is very useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's low-stress, really interesting, and you get an awesome breadth of material in one class. You may get frustrated if you're expecting super in-depth information, but if you'd just like to get a sense for the cell bio behind body systems, this is the course for you. Awesome profs and great guest lecturers!",
    "It's a brief overview of each organ system in the body. Histology for each system is learned as well. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone who has an interest in human disease.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other student.",
    "Yes, this is a really fun cell biology course.",
    "Gives you an introduction to cell types throughout the body, and you get a chance to examine these visually. Easy course, though I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking to gain a very specific knowledge set.",
    "This class provides a good physiological view of Cell Biology, in more of a systems context. Good for students who are interested in how various systems function.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in histology and learning about how disease affects the function and structure of systems in the human body.It is a great atmosphere to learn in with both lectures and labs, and lots of support from the instructors and TA."

   "comments": [
    "Not much to the research. But good in general.",
    "I learned broad topics about cells in different tissues and systems. The lectures are given by professors who are experts in their fields and the knowledge is up-dated.",
    "It makes me better understand many biogical processes in different tissue, organ, systems. It's really helpful!",
    "This class was not relevant to my research. However, it was an area I was interested in and gave me an good overview and understanding of the subject.",
    "It was a bit useful to look at some histology of cell types that I might end up studying and doing histology on myself.",
    "This course helped me with understanding other systems in the body besides the immune system.",
    "Because this course had a broad focus, I feel that much of what I learned in this course may be applicable to my future research.",
    "I think it is too early to see to what extent the course contributed to my research, but it gave me a lot of background information. It gave many great examples of how structure affects function and really made it clear that human systems rely on this connection."
