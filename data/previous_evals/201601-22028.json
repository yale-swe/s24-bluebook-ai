    "Yes, absolutely! Professor Gaddis is amazing, and the class is very engaging. I feel like I grew a lot.",
    "Great class if you're interested in writing historical narratives. I learned a great deal about biography especially that the genre can be defined a lot more broadly than many realize. Class discussion was often a little dry, but all the biographies we read were fantastic, and each added something different. Professor Gaddis is incredibly helpful, though the final paper was really a challenge.",
    "If you are interested in biographies or being a biographer, definitely take this class. Our first assignment is a five-page autobiography, which is quite challenging. Out final project is a thirty-page biography, which involves a lot of research and brainstorming. Therefore you will get a good sense of how a biographer works from scratch after taking this class.",
    "It is an experienced course, by which I mean that it is old and has benefited from every year. It has developed, evolved, reacted to the whims and quirks of both the times and the students. The readings are great; the assignments are great; Gaddis, in particular, is great. You get to go into the archives! It's amazing. I loved it. I really, really loved it. Take it if can.",
    "This course is a great introduction not just to biography but to experimental histories. The course readings are hugely varied and all interesting, and they force you to think in new ways about how to understand the life of a person. Professor Gaddis allows for a lot of flexibility in the final biography project, which led to some really interesting formats from the class. It's also really valuable to be able to spend time with the archives and learn how to work in real depth with primary sources. Definitely worth taking."
