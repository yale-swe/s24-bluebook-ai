    "The course gives both a historical and a contemporary perspective on the greater Middle East. Only after learning the historical perspective can one appreciate how necessary it is in order to understand the region. It is basically a course in Middle East history from a pretty broad perspective, only it's not a lecture, which is great.",
    "Yes, but really only if you're interested in this sort of stuff. It's a LOT of reading..",
    "This is a sociology class on imperialism, insurgency and state-building that I honestly thought felt more like a history class, which was exactly what I wanted. I have to admit that I was waiting for a class on imperialism and insurgency, so I was really excited to see this. The first class focuses on more theoretical topics (how do states come about in the Middle East, how do people who are not part of the state system react to the state system, how does imperial intervention affect the development of the state, etc.) The rest of the class is spent doing case studies of imperial powers, and a return to contemporary counterinsurgency theory in light of today's war in Iraq. The midterm paper is not difficult, although there is not much direction on the final paper.In general, I thought it was a very interesting mixture of people- modern middle east studies majors have very different viewpoints than history majors for example which allows for informed and interesting conversations. If you are interested in understanding more about the war in Iraq or insurgency or imperialism in general, you should definitely consider taking this class.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the subject matter",
    "I would recommend it if a student has some background in the subject. But, even if someone is just being introduced to the topics, it is a helpful class for getting acquainted with the subject.",
    "This is essentially a history course. It has a broad scope, and the historical connections are interesting. I found both the historical and contemporary portions to be rewarding, but i'm a Middle East Studies Major and others may find the regional focus to be limiting.",
    "Yes! Great overview of counterinsurgency doctrine - history, and its evolution over time.",
    "Great."
