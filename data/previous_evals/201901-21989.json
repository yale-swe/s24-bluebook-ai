    "Strengths: For me, the rotation was exactly what I needed. It gave me a chance to experience life outside of the EEB department, which is very small. The freedom to choose where to go (within reason) was very valuable and exciting. Weakness: Incoming students could benefit with an explanation of the reasons for doing a rotation. We chose a rotation with the goal of acquiring certain skills and making connections. Others might enter a rotation with the goal of completing a specific project. We weren't given any instruction on this, however, and from talking with some of my cohort they felt that they had 'wasted' their rotation because of this. It might make sense to not require this rotation to occur within the first year, as it is difficult to predict what skills will be needed for their thesis. Perhaps giving the option to do a rotation during any semester of their degree would work better."
