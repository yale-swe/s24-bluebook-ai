    "This was an excellent course. Prof. Spillane created such a great classroom atmosphere, with so many diverse elements to each meeting (slideshows, reviews, discussions, workshops) that all allowed us to \"exercise different writing muscles\" and kept each meeting both engaging and productive. The field trips (to New Haven and NYC museums) added even more to the experience. Honestly, I really looked forward to every meeting -- it didn't feel so much like a class as a chance to engage in intense discussions about art with a group of intelligent, passionate peers. And my writing style improved tremendously, with the wide variety of assignments that each tested my skills in different directions. There was a fair amount of work (lots of small tasks each week, as well as a paper every other week), but everything was so enjoyable and interesting that it never felt like work. Highly recommend!",
    "Great class where you get to take advantage of Yale's amazing resources. One of the assignments was to pitch an acquisition proposal to the YUAG and the YCBA. Another was to visit the Met and the Jewish Museum in New York. You learn how to render in words, something visual, and talk about art and aesthetics in a way that is not academic and filled with jargon and terminology, but in a way that is intelligent, fascinating, and accessible to everyone.",
    "Really fantastic course--workload is a little heavy towards the middle of the year but lightens up a little bit as the final essay comes around (normally there's an assignment due every week, either a first draft or a revision). With the volume of writing done for class, it's pretty much impossible for your writing not to improve. Plus you get to take a field trip to the Met which is awesome.",
    "I recommend this course if you want to talk about the contemporary art world and get to know it a bit better. This course feels real and is refreshing after so many courses whose applications seem to stay within an academic environment.",
    "This is an art criticism course that helps you learn from the best (and the worst) critics out there, some of whom you will encounter in that class. It's tough, it's infuriating at times, especially when you get draft back and there is hardly any white space left in the margins because of Professor Spillane's comments. However, those frustrations really push you to challenge yourself and really work on your writing.",
    "This course is interesting and creative, but A LOT of work. If you are interested in art and writing, it is a great course and will challenge you push your writing and to look at art in new ways. But, this is not the fun extra class to add to your schedule; it is a real time investment.",
    "A really exciting, horizon-broadening course. Professor Spillane's passion and dedication is infectious.",
    "Amazing class! A lot of short essays that add up to a lot of work, but you will learn a lot.",
    "This class is great for those interested in writing reviews and learning new styles of writing. It is also great for those interested in the art world."
