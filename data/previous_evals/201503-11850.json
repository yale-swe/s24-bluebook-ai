   "comments": [
    "I would summarize the class as a discussion of the science, economics, and sociology behind beauty and also an exploration of one's own ideas of beauty. I would recommend the class because for me personally, it was a topic I hadn't thought a lot about so it was good to learn many new things. Also, Professor Lindskog is a great professor who will help you a lot with your writing.",
    "I would describe it as the perfect course for students who do not feel confident in their writing and would like a course that would help them mature as writers. While the titles of the courses give off the initial impression that they're easy \"gut\" classes, English 114 classes are certainly not \"guts\". They require hard work and effort, but they are also not unreasonably difficult. I would especially recommend the course to incoming freshmen.",
    "English 114 is an amazing class! I could learn about a subject that interested me while significantly improving my writing!",
    "Definitely an interesting class. I would highly reccomend.",
    "ENGL 114, Beauty, Fashion, and Ethics was an awesome course that I would highly recommend to another student. The readings cover a wide range of topics and bring up unique and intriguing perspectives. This class is well suited to any student interested in beauty from any angle, from feminism to biological, and the essays are designed well and helped me develop my own thoughts and perspective on beauty.",
    "Like many other ENGL 114 courses, this class heavily focussed on the writing process. For example, rather than analyzing the content of our nightly readings, we analyzed how they were written. This posed some drawbacks as the content we read was actually very interesting, yet we didn't analyze it as much as I would have liked. That is not to say that we ignored the content altogether; we simply didn't go as in depth as a traditional English class might. In terms of course workload, the readings tended towards around 20 - 30 pages on average, however, they were mostly all entertaining to read which made it bearable. The essays we wrote were also incredibly enjoyable because the topics were always intriguing and allowed for some leeway in customizing them to our liking. Furthermore, Katja was always very understanding and helped us enormously with our essays during her office hours. She is a wonderful professor that was a joy to learn from and I highly encourage taking a class with her. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course. The topic was engaging and my writing progressed to a level I might not have achieved without Katja's feedback."
