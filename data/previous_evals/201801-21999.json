    "I learned a significant amount of Spanish this semester, which is exactly what I was hoping for.",

    "Grammar and correct pronunciation.",
    "Speaking Spanish decently well",
    "I felt like I learned A LOT of Spanish in this course. I am satisfied with my level of knowledge of the language and I am looking forward to taking more classes. I learned that while we look at them totally differently, English and Spanish share many traits and we can carry a lot of our innate grammar instincts over to Spanish as native English speakers."

   "comments": [
    "Although the exercises were edifying, I would suggest a more interactive set of in-class exercises beyond the ones included in the textbook. I think a slightly stricter no English policy would be a good idea.",
    "This course is great because of the small class sizes. Being in a class with 8 total students allowed me to seriously practice speaking and listening skills with feedback from the professor. Meeting everyday was really beneficial because it forced me to practice Spanish a little bit everyday. Another strength is how well organized the class and work is; the syllabus is very exact and descriptive. One weakness of the course is the variation in professors between classes. Some professors are more knowledgeable and better teachers than other sections, but all sections take the same exams.",
    "More focus on grammar. Probably a new textbook would be beneficial.",
    "It's very organized as a whole, but some inconsistencies exist from section to section",
    "Strengths- amazing instructor, high expectations from instructor, mandatory attendance. Weaknesses- online homework was too long on rare occasions."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. In one semester of Spanish, albeit my Spanish is far from perfect, I already feel comfortable speaking with native speakers.",
    "Yes, I would greatly recommend this course. It is a great introductory class to speaking Spanish. You learn a lot in just a single semester, and the course is very well organized.",
    "Yes, I would recommend if you are a true beginner. It is good also to review and strengthen some concepts. but maybe you will not expand much your vocabulary. It is pretty basic under that point of view.",
    "Yeah, if you want to learn Spanish",
    "Yes, for sure. If they truly wan't to open their mind to learning Spanish, this is the course for them. There is no prior experience needed, though I will say about half of the class had an upper hand because they were familiar with a fairly large portion of what was being taught."
