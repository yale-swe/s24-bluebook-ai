    "I feel like a lot of the topics in this class were pretty juicy and interesting because they were about things like sex and the body. That being said, there was actually a pretty consistently intellectual level of engagement in class, which I appreciated.",
    "I learned about the history of women's reproduction and abortion. I had to write 6 reading responses that were difficult at times but helped me gain a better understanding of the reading material.",
    "I learned so much about how different cultures perceive life, abortion and gestation in general.",
    "I learned much about the history of how sex, life and generation has been perceived among Western (and a bit of Japanese) thinkers",
    "An interesting course that challenged one's ideas of generation, gender, definitions of life, etc.",
    "This class explored a variety of topics related to sex and generation through a historical lens, and offered thoughtful analysis and discussion on controversial and politically relevant topics such as abortion, cloning, artificial life, disability and \"deviant\" sexualities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: taught by Ivano dal Prete lol, interesting approaches to interesting topics, just one paper and one presentation, good movie sources that were genuinely fun to watch Weaknesses: SO MUCH READING MY GUY (truly unbelievable), the seminar this year had only 9 people in it so there were a lot of tense silences, six reading responses scattered throughout the semester that can really creep up on you",
    "This course would be improved as a lecture or a larger seminar. Having this class for over 2 hours made it unnecessarily long at times. Almost every class had multiple periods of uncomfortable silence where no one was speaking because the question asked was confusing or because they didn't know the answer. I would have liked to see more modern day incorporation of many of the topics. I feel like most of my interest in the class was from a modern day lens and while it is important to analyze the historical aspect, I feel like discussion would have been more fulfilling by talking about the present and what many of my fellow students and myself found interesting.",
    "The material is really interesting but seminar needs to be structured a little bit more. Even after doing reading, it's difficult to lead a constructive conversation due to the way that the seminar was led.",
    "Professor seemed unprepared for lectures and did not have a clear outline for lessons.",
    "This course was really great, but I think it was designed for more than 9 people. I think that if there were more people in the class, discussion would have been better and deeper.",
    "I think discussions could have been more lively. The readings were often fine but I would hope there was a way in the future to engage students more.",
    "I feel like I didn't get what I should've out of this course because of an extremely quiet seminar group. The readings etc. were all good, it's just that the students were... less so.",
    "A slightly larger class size could help facilitate greater discussion among students"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you're good at skimming or are really passionate about the topics addressed. I would definitely say that it was worth all the work I did, but I know that other people won't necessarily feel the same way.",
    "I would recommend this class only if some major changes were made including the following: 1) more organized structure, 2) shorter class or more individuals taking it, 3) including a period of the class maybe the last 30minutes on how the information from that day relates to the present and current questions we have.",
    "Not really -- material is interesting but the class itself was a labor to get through.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed this class because it was fun, interactive, and allows students to explore topics that they may not be able to explore anywhere else.",
    "This class is pretty cool. You have 6 reading responses, 1 presentation, and 1 final paper. Beware of the final paper because it was originally supposed to be 10pgs at the beginning of the semester and suddenly became 15-20pgs by the end. As a MCDB major, I can tell you that taking this seminar was a very different experience for me compared to my normal classes and I'm glad I learned something from it. Ivano is pretty chill and seems genuinely interested in our thoughts on the material, but will (sadly?) fill in for people when they're not talking. It can also be hard to understand his questions. But again, cool material so I would take this class over if I had a chance.",
    "Yes, this was a wonderful seminar and I enjoyed the content of the course thoroughly."
