    "This class is a lot of work, but it's fun, well taught, and generally worth it. If you want to learn Chinese, this is the place to do it!",
    "Definately recommended if you want to learn the language. It is intense, with some work load, but I never regretted taking it. Definately work the effort.",
    "I definitely recommend this class -- even though it's one of the introductory level Chinese classes, it is taught at an accelerated rate that allows you to learn a lot in a very short amount of time. All four professors are really passionate about teaching the language, and they're really approachable and fun.",
    "A great class, you should take it. Chinese is an important world language and Yale's department is fantastic. It's a ton of fun."
