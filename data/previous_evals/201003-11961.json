    "If you are a senior EVST major you will take this course and you will sit through most colloquiums bored to tears. Try not to let it get in the way of actually getting work done on your senior essay!",
    "EVST 496 is the research colloquium for Environmental Studies. It provides a rather nurturing and informative place to develop your research question. Some of the work is kind of strange, but mostly it's pretty eye-opening.",
    "You have to take it if you're writing a senior essay! Definitely do a two-term essay! Take everything in colloquium with a grain of salt--not everything is relevant to everybody!",
    "A helpful class in framing your thesis, but you only get out of it what you are willing to put in. Be ready to do some footwork tracking down your adviser and any other professors who may be able to assist you.",
    "Yes, take it, its a great credit and helps you organize your thoughts a lot."
