   "comments": [
    "A lot of reading, and it doesn't really help teach you how to write.",
    "Play in a wired world is a testament to the spirit of how humans can maintain play in a modern culture filled with technology, and yet still maintain the true essence of play. This was definitely a nice blend between modern literature and more 1980s or 1990s texts of the canonical literature.",
    "Very good option for students looking to get a writing credit distribution requirement early on, teaches you how to write clear, cohesive, and interesting arguments, try to take the class in a topic you are interesting in learning about",
    "This class was a great class in improving all writing skills associated with writing college papers. I would recommend it for future students.",
    "This is a great class for anyone who feels unsure about how to write a college paper. Almost every assignment has you first submit a draft, which not only keeps you on top of your work but also helps you know how to improve before the professor assigns a grade.",
    "A fine writing course. Professor Wiedenfeld is an interesting man. If you're interested in learning the \"play\" phenomenon in an anthropological way, this course will be very engaging for you.",
    "You know it is going to be a lot of work and effort, but if you want to dramatically improve your writing, take it. College writing turned out to be much different than what I had imagined, and I know this course will be useful for the rest of my education. Prof. Wiedenfeld is great, sincere, funny and supportive. He tried to make the class interesting by making us more involved. The teaching was varied and interactive. Also, the theme is very interesting and easy to relate to. Lots of work, but a great, essential course."
