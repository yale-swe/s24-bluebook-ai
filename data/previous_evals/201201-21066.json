   "comments": [
    "I would recommend G&G 529, or any other course taught by Prof. Bercovici, to another student without hesitation. The material covered here is absolutely essential to any work in geophysics or related fields. The TA and professor are incredibly willing to discuss problems, help with homework, etc., and the workload is quite manageable.",
    "It covers some basics of geodynamics from fluid dynamics to geophysical application.Yes.It lays the foundation for further geophysical understanding and study.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for an introduction to high level mathematics. This class is a very good introduction on how to model large scale dynamic processes, and is similarly a good way to reinforce any prior exposure to differential equations.",
    "Take this class or any other class with Prof. Bercovici, whenever he's back. He is just too good of a professor (and this class has so many interesting topics!) to miss out.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in geophysics, and have a good background in mathematics, especially PDE."

   "comments": [
    "Basic mathematical derivation with some homework deepens my understanding of what's going on underneath the surface of the Earth.",
    "This class prepared me for my summer project tremendously. In fact, had I not taken this class I most likely would have changed my summer project. Instead, Bercovicci's class cleaned most of the rust off my mathematics and prepared me to study and develop wave equations and the dynamics of coastal erosion. Furthermore, had I asked specifically, Bercovicci would have covered topics specific to my line of research.",
    "I learned a lot about geodynamics topics that I didn't know before. I have a strong interest in fluid dynamics especially and I feel that this course taught me a lot about how to think about fluid dynamics problems.",
    "I have never taken this class before. This class gives a general idea of the classical problems and solutions in geophysics."
