    "I would recommend it",
    "I will definitely recommend any school of engineering student who is doing research related with material chemistry to take this course.",
    "I would recommend. You learn a LOT!",
    "CHEM 549 01 is a grad level introduction to material science and nanomaterials topic. It involve a lot of mat sci basics such as crystal structure, mat characterization techniques, and current research topics.",
    "I would summarize this course as a cursory overview of crystal structures, X-ray crystallography, electron spectroscopy, and materials synthesis. I would recommend this to someone interested in learning more about crystal structure and characterization methods. However, I would not recommend this course to someone, like myself, looking to learn about materials science and the synthesis of nanomaterials. We did an overview of some synthesis methods, but that is all. We did not really discuss the pros and cons of all of these methods, so I came away knowing some of the methods that people use but not why we use them. I would have also liked more discussion of the applications of nanomaterials in particular (as opposed to their macro scale counterparts).",
    "A lot of information was covered in this course. I learned so much about topics that seemed unapproachable to me as an independent learner. The exposure I got to the material in class really helped me.",
    "This course is a good overview of modern nanoscience and useful for inorganic and materials chemists."

   "comments": [
    "This course indeed deepen my knowledge on material chemistry. It contribute a lot to my research. For instance, I can determine the suitable characterization methods based on the knowledge from this class. This course also solved many confusions that I encountered while I was reading papers about material characterizations.",
    "It does...all material can potentially be used. Will def. be going back to the slides for fundamentals",
    "This course is very relevant to my research study. It also broaden my knowledge in mat sci from learning from prof Wang and other students in class (student presentation).",
    "This course gave me a nice overview of some topics in nanomaterials and materials science, and I found the textbook quite helpful. The discussions of semiconductors and graphene were applicable to my research, and perhaps our discussions of electron spectroscopy will be helpful when I actually do SEM and TEM.",
    "I loved the section of analytical techniques (TEM, AFM, XRD, EDX) covered in the last half of the class. I learned a lot about techniques I was already using in my own research and discovered some new techniques I would like to try in the future.",
    "This course improved my understanding of semiconductor materials and the field of modern metals, ceramics, and semiconductor technology. It showed me the current materials of interests to chemists that could be further improved upon or probed. This will be useful for selecting a research project or focus."
