   "comments": [
    "Absolutely--it is a really great course and the trip to the Met was a highlight!",
    "This course is the absolutely perfect course for anyone interested in learning about the history of museums and then to think critically about the many aspects that go into creating, establishing, and organizing them. A course that looks at a very specific sort of subject it's very accessible to all students, Barriger grades constructively and he really cares about his students learning things! Do the readings because they are so interesting and are never too overwhelming; short, sweet, engaging and to the point is a good way to summarize everything! An absolutely must take!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course for a fellow student.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "If you are interested in museums at all, take this class! It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. This class really encourages you to think outside of the box about the complicated world of the art museum. And Professor Barringer is great!",
    "I would advise taking it as an upperclassman, and preferably with some experience in the art museum field, otherwise you'll feel overwhelmed - and probably don't do what I did, which is take it as one of five and a half credits. It's a really great class especially if you're considering going into museum work.",
    "Critiques of the Museum is a chronological progression of the history of the museum-- first as an institution of national identity, then as a place of industry and progress, and finally as... something else (as the post-modern museum is hard to define). The class asks a lot of you creatively, which I appreciated greatly, as assignments were unconventional in the best way (analyze the webpage of two museums, critique a recent exhibition you saw, create an exhibition proposal, etc.).",
    "This class is a real must-take, and definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It's actually hard for me to overstate how great it was. As an art history major who is really interested in museums, this class was absolutely perfect; we talked about the history of museums, but also about how to engage with them today. This approach really deepened my understanding, and completely changed how I view the museums I visit. The class is also very discussion-driven, which was extremely refreshing. The assignments were interesting, and asked us to think about various elements of museums in new ways. We wrote a comparison of two museums' websites, a review of an exhibition, and our final project was a full exhibition proposal. The proposal project was really incredible, since we had to think about many of the things that real curators have to deal with who would fund our exhibition? Where would we get the works? Where in the YUAG could it go? Barringer is also fantastic, and no one should miss taking a seminar with him. Overall, I would highly recommend this course!",
    "It is not a heavy workload but is a very rewarding experience. I could not recommend a class more highly than this one.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you are at all interested\/enjoy museums and\/or art, this class is an absolute must. You will learn museum histories and theories and then have the opportunity to apply that knowledge to contemporary museum practices. I will continue to use the lessons I learned in this course for years to come. This will change the way you look at museums in the best possible way. Professor Barringer also arranges for several incredible guests to come visit and discuss their careers. I cannot say enough about how amazing this course is! Take it. You will not regret it.",
    "Amazing course with a wonderful professor. If this seminar is offered again, definitely try to get a spot in it. It really makes you think about how cultivated every aspect of the museum experience truly is and Barringer leads us in really interesting discussions while having us challenge the ideas of certain critics and question the status quo and the motives of specific museums today. Each week the 2 hours just fly by. The readings are great, a reasonable amount that's super manageable since the class meets just once a week. The assignments are enjoyable to complete as you have a lot of freedom with the topics you choose to write about and the final paper was a mock proposal for a museum exhibition that you design, making use of everything you learn about in the class about how to create a compelling and effective show. Barringer is an expert on the topic given his experience organizing shows at world famous museums (like the Pre-Raphaelites exhibit at the Tate) and towards the end of the semester, there's a great trip to the Met with him as your personal guide as you move through the galleries and critique them with the class. It's ultimately a really engaging class with a broad scope that accommodates anyone's interests in the art world and Barringer is a really understanding and caring professor. A must take if it's offered again!"
