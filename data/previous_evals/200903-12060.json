    "A performance class in which you perform about every other week before the class, get workshopped for about 20 minutes, then watch the others perform.",
    "Absolutely! It's a pleasure of a class whether you love performing, love to watch people perform, want to get better, or all of the above!",
    "Prepare one song every other week or so, write a couple of make-work papers, and have fun with musical theater once a week. Though it was sometimes frustrating to have a Friday afternoon class, I felt it was entirely worth it. Annette was really helpful in growing as a performer. This is not a vocal performance class, though, so if you're looking for that, find a private teacher."
