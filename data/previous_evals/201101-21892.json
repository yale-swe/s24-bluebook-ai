   "comments": [
    "Great class easy workload, great hist credit and interesting material.",
    "If you have room in your schedule, TAKE THIS CLASS! I recommend taking it as a Credit\/D, easy, low-stress balance to an otherwise crazy workload. Prof. Davis will make your attendance and attention completely worthwhile.",
    "I would not recommend this class to other students. The first few lectures are much more interesting than the rest of the course. All of the lectures are Powerpoints and there is a lot of rote memorization rather than analysis of the material. Also, I think the content of the course appeals much more to religious study majors rather than history majors.",
    "This course is wonderful - it is interesting, informative and surprisingly useful. I found myself getting a better understanding of my other courses while taking this course. Professor Davis is a great lecturer - he covers topics well and makes class interesting. I would definitely recommend this course. The world is manageable and the tests are not that hard as long as you pay attention in class (and if you don't go to class, you're missing out on a great 50 minutes of learning about people who spent their lives thinking about God and the nature of Jesus, seriously). This class is amazing!",
    "Yes I would. Interesting and engaging class.",
    "If you're not into Christianity, it might get a little bit dull at times. If you are into religion at all, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a really fantastic, enjoyable overview of the early Christian world.",
    "This was a solid history course - not amazing but overall enjoyable. You learn a lot about early Christian figures and the development of theology but, on occasion, the material can get somewhat esoteric. The three tests and the two 5 page papers mean that you have a steady workload over the course of the semester, but the class is never stressful. I'd say take it, especially if you are interested in the material.",
    "I definitely recommend it if you care anything about history or have any relationship to the Christian faith. It is fascinating and is very well taught.Great, Great class that most people overlook!",
    "Great lecture! One of the best I've taken at Yale. Always interesting and pretty easy. Definitely worth waking up to go to class for. The midterms are not cumulative, so they are never too much information to memorize. The papers are both only five pages, and although I disliked the topic of the first paper, they are easily written. Take this class! Get in Yoni's section if he's still a TA.",
    "If you\u0092re interested in history, religion, the Roman empire, the Middle East, the development of Western Civilization\u0085..basically, anyone should take this course! As a practicing Christian, learning about the \"church fathers\" and reading early texts was incredibly interesting and meaningful--saying the Nicene Creed on Sundays will never be the same! As a student of history, the course was perhaps even more meaningful, however, as Professor Davis did an amazing job putting the religious in the historical\/cultural context (showing us how inextricable every thread is from the other), and showing Christianity's process of definition and evolution. Be prepared to do lots of reading and absorb lots of information, but don\u0092t worry about the workload overall. The tests were really reasonable (they were so helpful in making me review the information and discussion questions, but didn\u0092t try to throw any curveballs), and the papers were a little tricky (I just felt like they were looking for something very specific, but without a ton of guidance about how to get there), but there were only two and they weren\u0092t too long.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. Professor Davis is AMAZING - he's enthusiastic, funny, engaging, and always makes the lectures extremely enjoyable. The class covers early Christianity and a bit of early Islam, with lessons about various other related topics like Judaism, paganism, architecture, etc. The structure of the class (3 midterms, none of the cumulative, and 2 papers) is easy to keep up with and the reading load isn't too heavy. If you have any interest in religion at all, whether or not you know anything about it already, TAKE THIS CLASS. I guarantee you'll learn something interesting about Christianity and about religion in general, no matter what your background is. This was probably my favorite class of the semester and I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, it is really easy and interesting, not too much reading and its fun for the most part.",
    "You pick up with the death of Jesus and trace the growth of Christianity through the 8th century. You focus on religious aspects but also on cultural ones. What did churches look lile? What caused different sects to break off? What was the relationship between church and state, and how did it change after Constantine. I would recommend this if you want to learn about how Christianity spread. You'll get a great grounding in the subject.",
    "This was an awesome course. Professor Davis presented the material in a way that was both easy to understand as well as very entertaining. The primary source readings, as well, were very interesting. The tests were very fair in that you always knew exactly what types of things you were going to be asked.",
    "This was a fantastic course, that struck the perfect balance between historical fact and cultural\/religious understanding. It was expertly taught, and the somewhat hefty workload only added to the understanding of the main themes. Professor Davis is a stupendous professor, whose clear and articulate lectures are riveting, enjoyable and extremely effective at communicating the material. You will look back fondly on this course if you are wise enough to enroll! This is an essential part of every Yalie's education, regardless of specialty or religious affiliation. Take it!",
    "The history of the Church is fascinating whatever one's religious beliefs. And if you are genuinely interested in religious studies that I highly recommend this course. But at times the reading can be dense and tedious when it appears to be about specific details regarding worship and ritual. It really depends on what you want out of a religious studies course. I was looking for a more general class with broader themes. The readings at times were a little too specific for me.",
    "This is a great class! It's a fair amount of reading, but it's all interesting. And you won't want to miss Davis' lectures... he's a phenomenal teacher. Every day I would leave class with a satisfied feeling that I had really learned something I didn't know before.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because this information still applies to today's world. Also the readings are definitely manageable and the class is just interesting!"
