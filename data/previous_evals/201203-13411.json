    "I really don't have a recommendation. This class made an impact on me because it exposed me to a lot of current events\/international issues that I would not have known about if I had dropped this course. But it's one of those things that you go into scared and come out a better person.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone interested in the economy. Otherwise, the material is pretty dry.",
    "This class is best for people that are interested in economic issues in relation to government control. I recommend this class for anyone that wants to learn how to write for an argument, or wants to learn more about capitalism and its effect on democracy. Students that are genuinely uninterested in the course and\/or will not share in class discussion will probably not like this course.",
    "ENGL 114 13 studies the formation and structuring of writing in the face of the topic of Global Capitalism and the Future of Democracy. Students learn about writing through books specifically about writing and through great authors and their pieces on the topic of capitalism and its relationship with democracy. I would recommend it to students who have specific interests in the subject of capitalism and democracy, because it would otherwise be a very difficult class to get through. The readings are very specific, and for those people who do not enjoy the subject, they would probably find it boring. Otherwise, it's a great class to take, especially before taking another class that is not specifically a class on writing but involves writing papers!",
    "i would definitely recommend the class to another student. The subtopic of global capitalism and democracy was extremely interesting, and the articles read did a good job of covering all sides of relevant economic issues. Furthermore, the class really does help you improve your writing and teach you what professors expect from college work. If you are going into a field that requires writing academic pieces, this class is a must.",
    "It's a great class to improve a person's writing skill.",
    "YES! YES YES YES! Especially if you are an Econ major - TAKE THIS CLASS!!! You won't get to read such wonderful articles in Intro to Micro\/Macro. Also, if you are super-passionate about the crisis etc., you can write about these things in your papers and hence gain more from the research. I wrote about Russian corruption for one of my classes, and I had no clue about it, yet it was probably the best writing experience of my life. Do yourself a favor and take this class! Also, even if you are not an econ major, yet interested in the fiscal policy, the EU crisis etc., there is some excellent material here.Finally, trust me, this class will certainly improve your writing, which of course is the main aim. After writing close to 8 papers (including drafts), reading other papers (including those written by your mates) and discussing them in workshops, you stand to at least improve your writing skills by 50-70%.",
    "I am a bit unhappy with how this course went for me. As someone who hates writing more than anything, I thought that maybe I could improve my writing through English 114 and learn to enjoy it. I found out that I had taken too many courses and left very little time to focus on this course. I also felt that the subject became boring much faster than anticipated. After the first few pieces we read, I felt like we were discussing the same things every class. In addition, my classmates seemed largely unaware of basic historical events that should have been shaping their opinions which lead to less than enlightening discussions. I thought the professor was very kind and very helpful with his critiques of my writing. I think that if I had allotted more time in my schedule for this class, I would have noticed more of an improvement in my writing. Perhaps over time, I will look back on this class more positively, but at the moment, taking this class feels like it was a mistake for me."
