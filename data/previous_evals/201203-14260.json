   "comments": [
    "Smaller physics class than typical lecture. Difficult concepts.",
    "Self-study class with lots of homework, essays (sic!), on-line exercises. Lectures do not prepare you to (almost) any part of the graded workload.I recommend it only to students who took physics in high school and now only need a credit for introductory physics sequence but do not have time to take phys 200. Also, take this class if you are a pre-med..Improvements suggested: Grading requirements should not change 4 times during the term + we would benefit from having an instructor with more experience in physics and in teaching.",
    "Mateljevic really wants students to understand physics. That being said, this is the worst possible class I have ever taken at Yale. She overloads you with work, gives unnecessary problems, does nothing in class, and then expects you to go to a 4 hour session every Thursday to work on problems. I didn't learn one thing in this class. She is very unclear, and the problems she expects you to do are nothing like anything on the homework, which are the only problems you will see during the entire course. She is not respectful of anyone's time: a 50 minute exam turned into a 1 hour 40 minute exam. She was 10 minutes late to every class. I was miserable this whole semester because nothing was planned out, and much of the work we had to do was completely unfair. This is why the physics department is terrible: the teachers are so bad.",
    "Physics 180 is a great introduction to Newtonian mechanics and teaches physics concepts well. Take it!",
    "Take the lecture. If you are really looking to learn the material it is all in the book. This is very similar to the first half of an AP physics course in high school.",
    "Interactive class that requires a lot of outside studying and reading. Class moves by fast, however many concepts are not fully explained.",
    "I would recommend it. You get a lot more individual help.",
    "Its a rough course, but so are all the other introductory physics classes from what I hear. Take it if you have to. Otherwise, dont.",
    "Read the textbook chapters, do the WileyPlus questions, and complete the Psets. Do lots of sample problems if you can to understand the material fully.",
    "If you have no or little physics background, you probably have no choice. 180 is probably more straightforward than 170, but pick the class based on the professor.",
    "As opposed to the other physics class, yes.",
    "If you prefer small lectures then fine take the course. But you will have to spend the majority o your time teaching yourself - as with most Physics and math classes at Yale anyway...",
    "I would never recommend this class to anyone",
    "Yes, although take the larger section. Its a good science credit, if you have a head for numbers and like problem solving. Be willing to put some time in studying the book and doing practice problems before an exam.",
    "No I would not recommend it.",
    "Physics is hard if you're learning it for the first time. Natasa puts a lot of effort and gathers a lot of resources to help you. I definitely recommend her if you like having access to all these resources.",
    "This was the pilot class for a \"leminar\" style physics class, so the entire semester was pretty rough. The concept is fantastic, but the execution was extremely sub-par. For this class to actually work, we needed to have had much longer classes than our 50-minute time slots. Hopefully, if they provide this class again, the department will work out the kinks.Natasa may not a great professor, but she is certainly a very dedicated professor. She goes beyond her job description to accomodate all students in terms of grading, exams, problem sets, and essays. Go to her office hours and take advantage of all the extra \"optional\" tools she provides!",
    "The class is a new way of doing intro physics in a smaller class with more in-class problems, etc. It's a good idea in theory, but had yet to really hit it's stride. A lot of hours just end up getting lost in inefficient class time.",
    "This is a standard introductory physics class. No calculus is really needed. The real challenge is that a huge amount of material is covered in a very short time. Anyone with previous physics training has a huge advantage. The class requires a lot of independent studying in order to succeed, but Natasha is great. She'sextremely helpful, dedicated, and really has a genuine desire to teach and see her students succeed. She'll go out of her way to try to help you understand and succeed, which is rare for an intro class professor. The smaller section concept was experimented my term, and was quite unorganized, but I expect it will improve the next time around. I think this section is primarily special because of Natasha, and if you can get in, I'd definitely recommend taking it with her.",
    "I needed to take this class because I had another class when every other physics class was held. Yet, it was very frustrating. I wish that I didn't have to learn everything on my own.",
    "If they don't mind working a lot and have a bit of background in physics, this course works fine.",
    "a course for those who want to pursue a science major or those who have an interest in physics",
    "No, definitely not. Please try to find another professor. The class size was good, but teaching was not there.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO LEARN PHYSICS because you won't. You'll end up having to teach yourself. I cam to Yale to be taught by amazing professors not to teach myself EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING. Take another Physics class if possible.",
    "As long as you never take a class with Natasa Mateljevic, I imagine you'll be fine.",
    "Professor Mateljevic is very approachable and helpful and wants to help you understand the material. Her teaching style allows for a deeper understanding of the material."
