    "Be prepared for a lot of work but you'll have fun too.",
    "It is a great course in learning the language. My writing skills greatly improved. However, I believe there could have been some more focus on the oral part.",
    "I definitely would recommend. It reviews past concepts of the language while adding on new ones so it strengthens your foundation while improving your level in Spanish.",
    "Spanish 130 is a good place to start if you studied Spanish in high school for a few years. The professors are all really great and you will learn so much about not only the language but the culture as well.",
    "A good course that extends your spanish knowledge, especially helping in wiring and reading."
