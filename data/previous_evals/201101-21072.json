   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as exclusively lecture. I'd recommend it for someone who wanted a survey of books that every student should read but avoids. This class gives you a perfect moment in time to master that material.",
    "If you want a foundation in IR, and truly understand the core of IR issues, you must take this course. You will read works you've been meaning to read all along. I almost feel this course should be a part of the IR core curriculum.",
    "It's not what you expect (in a good way). Take it.",
    "I would recommend this class, but I also recommmend that you do some recon on the reading ahead of time. Having a knowledge of the texts prior to the week it is assigned will help prepare for the final. The final is, in a word, brutal.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone looking to an introduction to political philosophy, 100%",
    "Yes, I would. It is a rare occasion to reflect on all the major works of literature and philosophy and compare them to each other, as well as to think about their validity in the contemporary world.",
    "Yes. They should make this course mandatory",
    "Yes, definitely. It is a great class to learn about western political philosophy, it really gives you a comprehensive overview of the major philosophers and their ideas about world order, and it sheds some light on current issues as well.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student interested in big picture questions related to the international system."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, as I already articulated, its a great foundation course and really brings light to how current events today can be and should be understood through classic works.",
    "It helped me think about big questions.",
    "I am sure what I learned over this semester will be useful to me in professional and personal settings for the rest of my life.",
    "This course was not relevant to my degree at Yale",
    "It broadens my horizon of world politics throughthe lens of ancient philosophies about strategies and world orders.",
    "It helped give me a big picture perspective on international relations as it is practiced in the United States and Europe."
