    "an introduction to environmental processes",
    "I learned an overview of various topics related to the environment and watersheds, but not deeply into any one area.",
    "I have learned the basis of biogeochemistry.",
    "It is difficult to convey how much I learned in Biogeochemistry and Pollution this semester. I specifically learned a lot about the three topics listed below: 1) the importance and relevance of the seven most abundant ions (i.e. Cl, Na, Mg, SO4, Ca, K, HCO3), 2) standard methods and procedures for laboratory work, 3) how to interpret water quality data based on data obtained from the isotope lab and make environmentally sound recommendations.",
    "I learned how to evaluate typical measures of water quality.",
    "chemical data analysis, an understanding of how a chemist approaches legal issues",
    "An overview of the major cycles relevant to watersheds, information about wastewater treatment processes and their functions, a deep understanding of the major constituents in water and how they are measured and relative levels.",
    "Ability to analyze water quality from data, and evaluate quality of data; interaction of water with pollutants and other chemicals in the landscape.",
    "I learned a little more about the chemical workings of biological cycles\/systems I am used to thinking about at the macro scale, though did not gain the clarity I had hoped from the course itself due to confusing course structure and off-putting classroom dynamic. I learned a lot on my own outside of the materials provided for the course.",
    "How to analyze a water analysis sheet and determine levels (of metals, pH, ions) that are too high\/low. What can be the causes of these unusual levels and how to fix them.",
    "chemical processes related to sewage treatment, water treatment, hubbard brook watershed, ocean acidification, nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle",
    "I gained knowledge in chemistry as it relates to ecosystems and urban sewage and treatment centers.",
    "A very practical, and rather complete view of pollution-related biogeochemical issues (to the extent that a complete view of an issue is possible in a semester). Exactly as advertised, and will--no doubt--be useful as I move forward in my career.",
    "I gained precisely what I was hoping to from this course. The first few weeks were a bit overwhelming, but - looking back - it becomes clear how much I learned, both conceptually and practically. Biogeochem gave me the hard science basis that I will need in the rest of my time at FES and beyond.",
    "I took this course in order to gain a better understanding of some of the science that informs environmental policy decisions because my hard science background is pretty weak. Just generally, I got everything I hoped for out of this course. Because the course was centered around Hubbard Brook, it was never too theoretical, since examples were often linked back to an aspect of Hubbard Brook. One concrete skill gained that I consider to be incredibly useful is the ability to interpret water sample results when provided with the data.",
    "Consolidated basic aquatic environmental chemistry knowledge so I can acquire more advanced materials on my own.",
    "I didnt gain much in this course. It was too basic, and more of a review.",
    "Greater understanding of how elements and chemicals move through systems, particularly water, and what contamination looks like in water bodies"

   "comments": [
    "Difficult to determine improvement of my knowledge when course format so disjointed",
    "The topics covered were what I expected.",
    "I wish it was better organized in terms of class reading, slides and lectures. The lectures were somewhat hard to follow.",
    "I honestly did not know what to expect since the term \"biogeochemistry\" encompasses so many things. Although I initially had difficulty with the material, once I grasped the concepts, I started to look at events in my daily life in a different way. For example, in one class lecture we discussed how to prevent runoff from construction sites to waterways. Two of those methods were silt fences and haybales. A day or so after the lecture, I happened to drive past a construction site. After observing runoff from the site, I mentally criticized the contractors for not properly installing the silt fences and haybales.",
    "I thought I would learn much more in this course than I did. It did not align with my expectations at all. The course was very descriptive and superficial. I had hoped to do more analytic and quantitative work.",
    "very well, i expect to take the experiences from this class directly to the field",
    "Information was not as in depth or well organized as I had expected. Field trips were very insightful and helpful! Not everything on the syllabus was covered and topics were not well outlined and connected.",
    "I learned what I hoped and expected to.",
    "Not well. The chemistry we did in problem sets or class felt like a chance for the few chemistry wizzes (professor included) to show off, while leaving most students in the dust to then go figure things out on our own or together. A missed opportunity to spread a love of chemistry and bring people along. The non-chemistry stuff was a review of what I have learned in other classes at FES, but not as clearly articulated. Felt scattered and cursory.",
    "The overall content aligned with expectations but due to to poor class organization, my learning was limited. In a better organized class, I could have learned a lot more and the class could have been much more enjoyable.",
    "Fairly well. Content was solid. His delivery could be better, but he has reasonable expectations, and his exams test your knowledge - not just what you cram into your brain the night before. If he could structure his lecture delivery (his slides are well prepared), then it could help with people who don't have as much background knowledge on the topic.",
    "I thought the course would be more case study-based. The general knowledge was what I was expecting, though. There was also more emphasis on sewage technologies and standards\/testing methods than I wanted or anticipated.",
    "Yes, very well -- please see my prior response. I might have liked a mini-unit on organic pollutants, but Gabe was clear that the class didn't cover that.",
    "This course was difficult, as I expected. However, I learned more than I expected.",
    "I got exactly what I was hoping for out of this course.",
    "The course was too basic. It did not reflect the description enough. Considering this is a graduate level course, I expected to not have introductory material through more than half the class.",
    "Pretty well, though we did not get as far into water treatment and remediation as I'd hoped and anticipated",
    "Not really - i still felt confused by some basic concepts by the end of the course."

   "comments": [
    "The set up of the course and the topics covered were great. I was really excited to take this class. The actual execution was not the best. The class was very disorganized.",
    "Strengths: the field trips were great. Weakness: very hard to follow the lectures.",
    "Strengths of the course are the wealth of material, the knowledge and expertise of the professor and the informative field trips that reinforced in-class concepts. Weaknesses of the course were the layout of the syllabus and organization of lectures. The course could be improved by including a weekly breakout of dates on the syllabus and providing a more detailed outline of lecture material.",
    "The lecture slides for this course were useless. I never referenced them and wrote all my notes by hand. Gabe is shockingly disorganized. We would organize study groups to try to go over the material and reorganize it in a coherent manner before exams. It felt like 25% of the workload in this class was figuring what was going on in terms of logistics. I still don't know when (or even if) our second problem set was due. Gabe came to our final exam late, with only the first half of the exam ready. When he returned with the second half, he was still correcting errors in it for the next thirty minutes. It was extremely distracting and frustrating.",
    "correspondence with the professor was difficult. Topics covered on assignments did not always reflect classwork; it facilitated student learning in a bad way.",
    "It is a course covering a unique topic. A focus on applications such as problems like part two of the final exam throughout the course could help connect concepts and prepare students for future work. Course and field trips utilize nearby resources very well! Definitely a highlight of the course. Readings were not well integrated into the class or not covered at all. Doing this and making sure students are doing the readings could help with understanding. Problem sets were important in the skills they covered but much of what was in the problem sets was never talked about in class or covered on an exam. For example many of the problems on the first problem set were completely separate in style and topic. Telling students to study the problem set in preparation for the first exam was misleading and led many students to prepare incorrectly for the exam spending much more time on quantitative skills. Finally, this class was very unorganized! The calendar on the syllabus had overlapping weeks and no dates leading students to be confused about readings and topics covered in class. Additionally, field trips, problem set due dates, and even communication about cancelled classes and midterms was always last minute and made students scramble to do everything or rearrange their schedules last minute. This is very hard for many students and led to some feeling like their time was being disrespected. Better communication and organization is a must.",
    "There is a lot of information delivered very fast that can be difficult to capture. Gabe often just says the important concepts without writing them down, so you have to be very attentive. I think the red and green desk flags to indicate our level of comfort with the information that is presented will be very helpful going forward. The field trips were great, wish I could've gone to all.",
    "The examples, props, and field trips were the strong points of this class. The course lacks coherence. The Hubbard Brook lens was a good one to look at these issues through, but the readings and lectures jumped around so much it was hard to follow what systems we were talking about when. The material was not particularly hard, but my sense of frustration with the problem sets, midtems and course content was very high because so much was unclear or felt like an inside joke. Slide contents are vague (lack clear titles and descriptions, content that is there is often not in common language or is a detail relevant to only part of the slide, while missing the key information). I took copious notes on paper and on the slides and was often baffled by what professor might mean when going back to look at slides. I learned much more on my own online and from other students than from lectures. Obviously, coming to a final that students invested a lot of time preparing for late with a half-written test and then having to correct the second half of the test content multiple times during the test is unacceptable. Starting 10 minutes late, sitting there for 15 minutes between finishing the first half and receiving the second half and then being told that the professor would \"let\" us have \"extra\" time to finish a test he was late and unprepared for is a good example of a strange tone-deafness that happened throughout the course.",
    "Professor is very knowledgeable about the subject. Poor communication and organization throughout the class. Often I was unsure of what the important parts of the lecture were.",
    "mentioned earlier",
    "Strengths: Topic is interesting. Weaknesses: Disorganized - hard to follow. Not really case study based. Problem sets are only somewhat useful, as having math-based problem sets seems unnecessary in this class. I would create more structure and organization in the course. What are the exact learning expectations and flow of the course? Organize the slides better. Rehearse lectures. I would also make the course case study based - have 5 or so case studies in the semester.",
    "I think the class lectures are generally pretty-well organized, slide decks are good, etc. The only issue I have is with readings -- I wish readings were (1) more extensive; and (2) better tied to the class.",
    "The field trips were vital to this course. They really helped me to connect the conceptual to the practical. Having real-life examples made the hard science concepts more tangible. Another strength was Gabe's willingness to accommodate those of us who were less familiar with the subject content. The student-professor dialogue was always open and that made the course stronger over the course of the semester. One weakness was that Canvas was not utilized to its fullest capacity. Another weakness was that Gabe was not always fully communicative when he was sick. None of the students knew whether we were having classes, if the midterm had been canceled, etc. Letting us know what is going on prior to a few hours before class would have been helpful during midterms.",
    "Strengths: 1) The number of exams\/problem sets - having a few midterms I think was a good thing because it forced you to check in and review concepts periodically throughout the semester. 2) The lectures - Gabe is an engaging professor, and I really enjoyed the in class time\/lectures. Weaknesses: I thought the bibliography assignment was really interesting and useful, but felt like kind of an after thought. I would have liked if there was a bit more emphasis put on this - maybe a class period or portion of a class period dedicated to some aspect of research\/why this assignment was important?",
    "The field trips were some of the best parts of the course. Learned a lot of hands on materials. I felt we might have spent too much time and efforts on the first 1\/3 of the class, making the most interesting final 1\/3 of the class a bit hasty.",
    "The professor was very disorganized. Our final wasnt done being written until 2 hours after the final started. He also has opinions about certain topics that dont align with most scientists, so it was confusing at times to try to understand why he was teaching something different than other professors in STEM.",
    "The strength is the content; this is really interesting and crucial stuff to understand! The weakness is in the organization of the course.The instruction was very difficult to follow and I found I learned a lot of the information through my own research while studying for exams. The lectures could be much more effective if the material were presented in a more organized way, including background information on concepts that were persistent.",
    "Better syllabus, with dates (not week numbers). Better communication by instructor regarding due dates, assignment expectations, field trip dates, and exam logistics. More organized slides (order often changed). More problem sets to practice material."

    "This class covered interesting material, but I think I took it on an off semester. I've heard good things about the professor in the past, but was not impressed this semester at all.",
    "Be ready to put a lot of effort",
    "Advice I would give to a student considering taking this class would be to carefully examine the slides that are handed out in class and to take detailed notes based on the lectures.",
    "Don't take this class. It is a waste of time.",
    "You need a baseline chemistry understanding. It is a useful class.",
    "Don't be afraid to ask Gabe to re-explain something in class- if you're confused, chances are a bunch of other students are too. This course contains knowledge essential for science-based environmental management, especially for water resources people.",
    "This class would be of benefit to people who already know chemistry well and just want a refresher, but are not depending on this class to teach new content. You provide the structure and fit content into what you know already.",
    "Unless a change in teaching, class is very frustrating although content is interesting.",
    "Study in groups, try to review on a bi-weekly or at least monthly schedule. Would really help to go over lecture notes after he presents it because it'll just whoosh over your head. When you sit down and try to understand, you can actually process the info. Ultimately, despite the negatives, I'm still glad I took the class because the material he includes in the course are great. Takes a while to get used to his teaching style. Exams are challenging but fair.",
    "Don't be discouraged\/overwhelmed in the first month of the course. Everything that is introduced at the beginning will become crystal clear over the term, and supplemented with real-world environmental management examples. This course is vital to having a baseline understanding of biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling in our environment.",
    "Brush up on your chemistry before the start of the class if its been awhile. Dont wait until the midterms to review your notes. Ask questions in class. Go on the Hubbard Brook field trip.",
    "Dont take this class if youve had any basic chemistry or environmental science class. This class is too basic if you already are knowledgeable about what nutrients are because the class didnt seem to go very far beyond that. The field trips were the best part of the class!",
    "In reference the question 8, this is advertised as a fairly accessible class for most FES students. I think this is unfair and misleading; I was able to understand the material due to background knowledge of chemistry and ecology and think this course would have been extremely challenging and more confusing than helpful had I not been able to sort through the material with some familiarity. In reference to question 9, I loved this class and wish I could keep going and take more Biogeochemistry courses! The structure of the course and engagement\/patience of the instructor was poor and leaves much to be desired.",
