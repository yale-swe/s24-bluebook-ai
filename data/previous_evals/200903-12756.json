    "As Tom Beeby proposed when Yale began teaching pro practice, this course should be offered during the first year. After taking the course, fewer people would complete the program, which would be to their long-term benefit. It would save some students a fair amount of money and leave the school w\/ a more committed group.I don't quite buy the argument that sequencing this course in the third year gives students the opportunity to spend more time gaining office experience before taking this course. The amount of time YSOA students spend interning between first and third years is negligible, and the work performed during a typical internship is unrelated to the material presented in this class.Likewise, I'm not convinced that sequencing this course during the third year provides time-sensitive information for graduating students, and that the course somehow aides their immediate performance after graduation. Graduates will not be in position to make related decisions until several years out of school, at which point the skills they have learned on the job will far outweigh the principles studied in this course.",
    "Yes it fell in proper sequence.",
    "Instructive class though tedious at times. I would have wished a bit more input at times from the TA s as well.",
    "Yes, proper sequence.",
    "Should occur in first year!",
    "Yes",
    "this course should happen in second year. there should also be a test someone can take to pass out of the course",
    "this course occur in proper sequence within the educational program.",
    "Yes, I believe this course occurred in the proper sequence.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, it is properly sequenced",
    "it did. i guess. a lot of info that would be could to discuss for every semester though. big topics with limited time. these ideas and issues should come on earlier and in more lenghty discussions for all the students. lots of students with lots of questions, that will be on going. so..... i dont know. its a good class and its tough to sequence in the curiculum. the class discussions are more valuable than many of the assignments.",
    "Yes.",
    "it is currently not possible to take this course before the third year. for students with work experience, it should be possible to take this course earlier, in order to facilitate coordination with electives or work requirements.",
    "It happened in the correct sequence.",
    "yes, it appeared in proper sequence.",
    "I think it was placed in the proper sequence but i could of just as efficiently been placed somewhere during second year, so students are a little more aware before getting their summer internships before third year.",
    "Yes, it occurred within the right sequence in the school's curriculum.",
    "Yes, I feel that we all have a very strong theoretical background, and this course is refreshing in the third year.",
    "Was a req, however I think the class should be offered to those with working experience prior to third year. For those of us with experience, this class could have been taken even in second semester and would have proven useful.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "It could have been earlier in the core curriculum."

   "comments": [
    "Much of the two hour class time was spent reiterating what was covered last week. This continued during the entire semester making for one of the most monotonous courses I have ever completed in the history of my academic career. As Phil constantly reminds us that time is money, keep it short and concise, I would like his advice to extend to the course itself. I think this class would be better as one hour and not lost to wandering anecdotes and unstructured questioning.",
    "The material was incredibly useful, and will gain use once I enter the professional world.",
    "Helpful and clear; however, formulaic. Assignments felt very highschool-ish, especially with regard to hand-holding for getting assignments in on time, and with regard to attendance. Made the course feel too forced, which didn't allow us to engage with it on our own. A chore, if you will.",
    "the sequence was fine, but the depth to which we covered the specifics of the course was lacking",
    "most of the materials presented following the sequnce, syllabus, and the assignments.",
    "I think the course followed a logical sequence. Each class lecture added to the previous week's.",
    "the material was presented in a clear and logical manner",
    "The exercises were extremely valuable.",
    "The assignments were busy work. The readings and the lectures covered exactly the same material so there was no incentive to do the reading.",
    "i think the course was a good reminder for people who had worked, but probably was more information for students with little to no experience in architectural practice.",
    "The body of information conveyed was very valuable - a little too much stress was given on the project delivery methods (i.e. IPD which was honed scrupulously).",
    "I think that the material of the course was presented in a cogent and informed manner. The sequence of topics was logical to follow and comprehensive. Unfortunately, the assignments failed to hit their mark pedagogically in this class. Boardering between busy work and mindless blabbering, they never really allowed the student to become engaged in the class or offer opportunities to rethink the material presented. I don't think that this is on account of any of the instructors' fault, but I do think that it needs to be reworked somehow. One suggestion that I would have would be to make half as many assignments, but each one twice as long. I think that it is much harder to become intellectually engaged with a couple of paragraphs (especially when all of your classmates are pulling them straight out of the AIA manual) than it is with two pages.",
    "The biggest weakness of this course was the constant discussion of Integrated Project Delivery, which seems ideal, but just unrealistic. I think it would be more valuable to really explore more viable methods of project delivery and come up with creative alternatives, rather than ponder on this ideal state of delivery (IPD).",
    "Most of the material was fairly interesting. I enjoy Phil's urging for the elimination of unpaid interns. The class had an energy that most did not.",
    "this course should be a survey of issues that come up in practice, but instead its a semester-long commercial about new project delivery methodologies. the material should be presented on its own and not as a foil to IPD.the course is important, but i'm afraid the view of the professional world is a little skewed.",
    "I think the course was organized really well. I think some of the assignments were more useful than others."

   "comments": [
    "I think the content was interesting but the abrasive personalities of the instructors and complete lack of sympathy for our time constraints were unimpressive and unprofessional.",
    "This was a highly valuable course. Again, the usefulness of the course will be best judged as a professional in the real world.",
    "Helpful as a resource, but not entirely engaging or specific to us as a class graduating in 2010.",
    "this course was not very valuable to me",
    "I found this course very valuable. I wish that there were a system of internships that would be incorporated into the class.",
    "Since I have no professional experience, this class was very valuable to me, as much of the subject matter that was presented was new to me.",
    "the course was valuable in that it taught the basics of how a firm would work",
    "I learned very little during class and with the assignments. Maybe owning the textbooks will come in handy later.",
    "i think my education would have been better served if the time spent on this course were spent elsewhere, but i understand it's practical value.",
    "I found the course rather enlightening for a required course - the course load was totally manageable and reasonable for the information conveyed. As idealistic as the course is in terms of \"helping us\" in professional practice - I think the best place to learn about this umbrella of information is still in the workpolace.",
    "This course is really important and I am happy to have taken it at Yale. A lot of the material is incredibly mundane, and I am aware that the teaching of portions of it is required by NCARB. One can sense the intentions by Phil and others to make the material more relevant and to get us to think about the way that the industry works, but still, much progress could be made in this course. One way to do this would be to put more thought into the scripting of the assignments. For this I will offer these two suggestions.1) The individual assignments each week should add up to a greater whole, frankly they just seem trivial each week. Why not just say that each person is an individual firm and that they will generate a body of internal documents? The Wire Mill project sort of intimated at this role playing procedure, but was not entirely explicit about it and did not come into play until halfway through the semester. This set of documents could be handed in at the end as an abridged version of a users manual for starting a firm. I think that any way that you can get people to think about these little assignments not as individual moments that they fire off in half an hour but as pieces in building something greater is a positive direction.2) The final project was successful on a variety of levels, but it needs to be reworked so that the goals of both the internal documents and the external document are aligned. Meaning, the students writes the documents in a way that is in preparation to be graded on them in an academic environment, and not to get a commission. While I appreciate the fact that the student is only graded on that portion, it is a distraction to have the mock interview with material that was written to address an internal audience. I don't think that it is a good idea to grade based on who is successful in the interview, but I think that there is a middle road that allows the assignment to be written such that the student can prepare a set of documents that satisfy both the \"client\" and the academic side of the class.",
    "Extremely. I would not survive without it.",
    "having worked before, i knew a lot of this stuff anyway. so it was sort of valuable.",
    "I think the course was very valuable. Given the material, I think it was presented in the best way possible."

   "comments": [
    "Phil Berstein ruins the class with his painfully obvious IPD bias, and Autodesk conflict of interest. The class feels like an infomercial, with Phil its pitchman.Unfortunately, the visitor from GSD delivered the best lecture of the semester.There are too many professors for this class. Too many assignments. Too many emails. Too much micro-managing. For a class on firm management, it was ironically the most poorly managed and least efficient class we've been required to take here at Yale. The assignments, memos, schedules, syllabi, are dense and poorly written. The lectures repetitive and drawn out.",
    "I believe the ability to absorb and apply information is of the utmost importance in judging the effectiveness of teaching. Taking attendance and snapping rude comments as students merely slip out for a restroom break during the two hour course (which has no scheduled break time in a tiny room packed beyond fire regulations)is unnecessary discipline for a group of adults let alone professionals. I still don't understand the need to put us in our places and treat us like children.",
    "Phil Bernstien is a very effective instructor and leader for this course. His charisma and clarity was on display in every class. Very entertaining for such dry subject matter.",
    "the teachers were good at covering a broad range of material but less good at answering very specific technical questions.",
    "I did not feel that the other four instructors\/TAs of the course had instructional values, and were more in the background as people who graded the assignments.",
    "Berstein was too busy giving us IPD propaganda to teach us anything. There was also far too much emailing and beuracracy.",
    "everyone was quite effective in their respective roles.",
    "The teacher taught in a cogent and clear manner. The TAs were all attentive and resourceful.",
    "Effective. Some notes could be taken from Garvin's planning class, or coordination between them. The final assignment was a lot of fun...there should be more like it.",
    "not that great -- not always clear.",
    "Phil Bernstein really led every lecture, except one guest lecturer, and I think he was very effective."
