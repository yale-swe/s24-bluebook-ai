   "comments": [
    "An excellent exploration of the elements that compose Israeli culture through the lenses of literature, film, and poetry. Students really push into the literary analysis to understand the underlying issues.It is certainly not as easy as other Hebrew classes are.",
    "This class is a wonderful way to improve your Hebrew (especially writing and comprehension) while enjoying all that the Israeli artistic community has produced. Great movies, great poetry, great short stories, and a great professor! I really recommend this course!",
    "A lot of fun--You get to watch a lot of good Israeli movies! I also really did work on writing in Hebrew--Shiri really does make you write a fair amount, which is good practice.",
    "It's a great film\/literature class. If you're interested in Israeli culture and fluent in Hebrew, you'll enjoy this class immensely.",
    "I would most certainly encourage other students to take this course if they have any interest in discussing how Israeli culture is reflected in literature and film. The discussions were very intimate and interesting, and it was a great context in which to practice written and spoken Hebrew at an academic level.",
    "A laid back class that you will get a lot out of if you are interested in the material and the discussion. I will definitely recommend it to any student interested in learning and talking more about Israel while improving their Hebrew (both conversational and written)."
