   "comments": [
    "HSAR 496 is a lot of heavy reading about a very obscure, diverse art movement, discussion in class (though often turns into a lecture by Professor Zeidler, which I suppose is fine for some people), some biweekly reading responses (which didn't end up being biweekly but instead just two responses over the whole course), a presentation, and a 10 pg research paper (get started early and you'll be fine, and meet up with the professor, who is helpful). The readings are somewhat long but nothing you couldn't finish the night before, but the issue is that they are a bit dense because Surrealism is a little tough to grasp in the first place. The movement is primarily about Freud (so, so much Freud and psychoanalysis!), Andre Breton (not so much Bataille), and friends and their strange antics - but later in the class you'll move outward from Surrealism\/psychoanalysis and painting into other offshoot topics, such as photography and feminism and the enigmatic Marcel Duchamp. If you are interested in doing a really in depth examination about a quirky movement (seriously, kind of weird, with its metaphors to praying mantises... and it's also kind of erotic - just look for the penis in the picture, seriously), take this class, it'll be entertaining... It may not be particularly practical or useful knowledge, but entertaining, nonetheless. I mean, you will come out of the class looking for phalluses in the fingers of gloves. And phalluses in female nudes. It's phalluses, all the way down. Oh, and Zeidler's a cool guy, too.",
    "Yes, Zeidler is one of Yale's best professors PERIOD",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student - especially an art history major. It is not easy but was absolutely worth taking if you are willing to put in the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It not only opens up your understanding of what constituted the Surrealist avant-garde, but it gives you an added appreciation of the versatility of what makes a work of art, and along the way, you gain a better understanding of art movements on either side of Surrealism.",
    "Take this class if you don't mind reading hundreds of pages of Freud, Breton, and Rosalind Krauss. The individual artists covered are really interesting, but the reading can be tedious (and lengthy). Other than that, there are a few (irregularly spaced) reading responses, a presentation, and final paper. Professor Zeidler is great in a seminar setting, and gives you lots of help with your research paper.",
    "I would say take it. A very interesting period, some good readings - it will help your understanding of Surrealism, and is also good at training your eye, which is even more important. If you do take it, take the time to go look at some of the work we have in YUAG, because the class didn't go as a group."
