    "Only take it to fill a distributional requirement. Otherwise, what's the point?",
    "In my experience, this was a class where you had to do a lot of self-teaching. If you haven't taken calculus before, and you aren't a math whiz, be prepared to get a tutor. The material is presented as if you've already learned it, and there tends to be a language barrier in most of the sections which makes asking questions of your prof\/TA difficult.",
    "Math 112 is a basic intro to Calc but was not a particularly fun class. The tests were pretty difficult and some of the problem sets were a real hassle. Yet, if you are interested in taking upper lever calc classes I suggest taking the course as it was interesting and if you work with others problem sets are not as much of a drag. The class overall is not too hard if you stay on top of things but my lecturer was not too passionate and that did not help the course.",
    "Do not take this course unless you've never taken calculus before or you need it for a major! Bypass it and take 115 if possible! Math 112 is not easy because the exams are extremely hard even though the teaching can be subpar. Avoid this class! Almost nobody finished our midterm! Math at Yale is not so good...",
    "It's just a basic Calculus class, I'd recommend it to anyone that needs a QR credit.",
    "It is not the most amazing way to learn calculus, but there really isn't any other choice. I wouldn't highly recommend it, but regardless, many have to take it for their major.",
    "The instructor was very good, and the material was typical calculus material."
