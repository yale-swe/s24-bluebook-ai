   "comments": [
    "I learned how to use graphs and statistical data to draw conclusions about trends in China, instead of having to be spoon-fed analysis.",
    "I learned quite a bit about the current economic and political situation in China, and an equal amount about its history, culture and traditions.",
    "I solidified my previous understanding of 20th century Chinese history, and filled in gaps post 1980 to the present. My reading skills were challenged and I learned how to skim for critical content. The most knowledge I gained surrounded current environmental policy in China, and was due to my independent research and deep readings of the provided resources.",
    "The course developed my knowledge of contemporary China, while also taught me strategies in doing sociological research and reading sociology papers.",
    "I learned sociological definitions and how to approaxh the discipline.",
    "I developed a much greater understanding of China today and the historical background\/factors behind the current situation.",
    "I learned how to analyze political, economic, and social changes and the ways in each of these forces can influence each other. The course really challenged me to deeply think about the forces that mold different societal habits."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very strong in the information it provides and the variety of types of sources it draws upon. It could be improved by greater focus on the eponymous Xi Jinping.",
    "I think that the course could be improved slightly by spending more time on the current situation in China and less on the development of the country's government.",
    "Professor Davis is an expert in her field, which was very apparent from her high-level colleagues and contacts in America and China, and her published work. The course was strong because she could provide insightful answers to any question asked in class. The major weakness of the course was that class time was ineffectively utilized, with relatively unorganized powerpoint presentations accompanying long lectures. During discussion periods, participation was low because readings hadn't often been completed and students were not compelled or encouraged to deeply engage with each other.",
    "It is a very interesting course, and Professor Davis is obviously very knowledgable about China. It is important to recognize that this is a Sociology course, not a Poly Sci or Global Affairs, so it is not a rigorous examination of China's foreign policy. Instead, it only touches on foreign policy, while mostly focusing on culture and demographics. Still overall a very interesting and enjoyable course.",
    "Disorganized professor with a confusing course progression.",
    "Strengths: Super high student involvement, broad array of topics, very enthusiastic professor. Improvements: More time spent on the intricacies of Chinese government leadership (how they think, their stories, etc.)",
    "The strengths of this course was that the content was extremely interesting and insightful. Its greatest weakness was that participation was awkward and somewhat limited. There were no checkpoints to help students who lacked fundamental knowledge to catch up."

    "Absolutely yes. It's a must-take for understanding modern China.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking to put in a lot of work and enjoy the benefits and engagement of a small seminar.",
    "No, I do not think the course fulfilled my goals as a student eager to engage with other freshman about a topic I am passionate about.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who was interested in modern China or sociology.",
    "I most certainly would.",
    "Absolutely! It was a wonderful learning experience. This is a course that really challenges the way in which we analyze policy and its sociological effects."
