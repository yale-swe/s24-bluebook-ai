   "comments": [
    "This course is an overview of interactions in the Mediterranean from the Crusades to Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. Rather than trying to cover this history in its entirety, this course focuses on trade, religious intersections, and travel and piracy around the Mediterranean. I would recommend it to another student!",
    "It is a great course if you are looking for a different way of studying history, focusing more on a general region than a country.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Be weary though, as it is a very broad course and lacks depth. Great course overall!",
    "An excellent survey course on Mediterranean history, very interesting subject matter and manageable reading loads made it a great class. A great rest of world credit for history majors.",
    "Definitely. Not too much work (two short papers and a final, along with fairly straightforward readings), fascinating material, and Yale's best professors on the topic.",
    "HIST 337 is a good class that presents a unique regional history of the Mediterranean during a time period that is not often covered. The material is very interesting and the arguments presented will make you rethink your view of many events and their connections in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Having two professors is good to cover their areas of expertise but the class can sometimes seem confined to Italian and Ottoman history and the lectures can seem irrelevant to the themes of the class. But, the assignments are great as it provides an even spread between section, two papers, and the final, and section and the papers are good ways to gain better insights into the material of the class. I'd recommend taking it if you're interested in the events of this period and of this area and taking a look at a regional history rather than national. Just keep in mind that it is a new class with a few kinks to be worked out.",
    "You should not take this course, it contains little information on this time period. I would recommend taking Golden Age Spain instead. The class works on the poorly defined premise that the Mediterranean is a unity. It ignores most events of the time period and focuses on five travel stories, and explaining how the crusades and the Inquisition were great moments of tolerance.",
    "Hist337 is a history course that focuses on the Mediterranean rather than any one country or people. It is a fascinating way to study history because it allows you to look at immigration\/emigration, trade, and long-term changes in an interesting time period. Has a valuable, small discussion section."
