    "The first half of the course, point-set topology was fairly straightforward. It was really nice to learn some real general topology (my only other exposure was the tiny bit given in Rudin's intro analysis).After the midterm, we went into algebraic topology. MUCH more difficult.The material is genuinely interesting and some of it is very cool. One cool thing is how you can use topology to prove that the subgroup of a free group is free (a fact that is surprisingly difficult to prove with just algebra). After a bit of theory you can easily prove the fundamental theorem of algebra and a special case of the borsuk-ulam theorem.However, the algebraic topology part will likely be a lot more difficult than your previous math classes. You need the mathematical maturity to fill in the gaps to Hatcher's proofs and work through the examples yourself.For a little reference, for me I found that math350, 301, 305 were really easy compared to this (unless you have naturally strong geometric intuition, which I discovered I was sorely lacking in).I didn't have enough time to put into this class this semester since I took four other time-consuming classes as well. Only take it if you're willing to put in the time to learn things yourself.Of course, things might vary with different professors, but either way the material isn't easy.If you have good geometric intuition I recommend this class, otherwise think carefully about taking it.",
    "I would recommend math 430---algebraic topology is such a cool branch of mathematics.",
    "I definitely recommend 430 to a fellow student who wants to continue studying math, and particularly to those interested in analysis. I found that many theorems from real analysis can be much better understood under the general theory of topology, and it would also definitely be helpful to have it before complex analysis.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Math 430. The course functions as an introduction to general point-set topology as well as an introduction to algebraic topology, and includes some very interesting theorems from both topics; the proofs for these theorems are generally very different from the proofs you find in most of the other undergraduate math courses, so chances are that you'll learn something (even if it's just drawing better pictures).",
    "Math 430 is a good class. You will cover a large amount of information very quickly, but the material is very rewarding. The workload is manageable, and I would definitely recommend the course to another student.",
    "Great course to take if you are looking to learn about topology, one of the most useful and most interesting parts of the undergraduate curriculum. If you are at all serious about Mathematics, take this course. The grading was gentle as well."
