   "comments": [
    "If this student is interested in this specific type of work, then yes. Otherwise it can't be a little bit overwhelming. I would summarize it as a course that describes a novel way of thinking about biology using mathematical models and computational approaches.",
    "The calculations in homework are too tedious. It would be great if more MATLAB programming is incorporated, doesn't really know how to solve ODE equations through MATLAB. The course puts too much effort in solving the ODE by hand. I don't like the discussion section nor do I think it is helpful at all.",
    "I likely would not recommend it, because the information given throughout the course is easily learned independently, should one ever need to learn it. Course time is best spent elsewhere.",
    "The class was basically an introduction to systems modeling but was aimed at a very wide audience and therefore couldn't go in to too much detail. It's hard to get to the really interesting examples of gene networks when you have to take two lectures worth of time or more just explaining the basics of transcription and transcription factors and what gene regulation is. If you don't have any kind of experience in the topic this would be a good introductory course, but if you have a good grasp of all the biology and are interested to learn about systems then you will probably be unimpressed. Problem sets were tedious and not very interesting.",
    "I enjoy it pretty much. Some parts of the course might be difficult to students without knowledge of nonlinear analysis.",
    "I would recommend it if that student's research focus is related to Systems Biology.",
    "It's an interesting and useful course for students who are interested in system biology, even though they don't have much background in programming.",
    "I would not recommend this class to other students. It is very difficult for little practical reward."

    "It was good to be introduced to the basics of this field, but I would have liked a more in-depth treatment of some topics. It won't be very relevant to my research.",
    "It's very helpful for students in Computational Biology. We can learn the basics for biological modeling.",
    "It gave me experience reading articles in research areas I was not very familiar with, but the knowledge gained did not directly contribute to my own research.",
    "It's not that related to my field but at least extend my understanding in system biology."
