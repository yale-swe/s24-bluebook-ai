    "This course gives a deeper biostat perspective to the Epi you already know from Epi I and II. The course was mostly manageable, but at some points went off into calculus and derivations that will lose most of the non-biostat students.",
    "the lectures were very dull and not interesting at all. the material presented was too theoretical and not enough emphasis on applications. i walked away from the class not knowing what i got out of it. it was mainly a theory course that show the proofs behind odds ratios. this class should have been taught as a full semester with separate lectures emphasizing theory and concepts and lectures emphasizing applications.",
    "This course was not valuable for EPI knowledge. Often CDE professors disagreed with what we were taught in this course and therefore the knowledge is not practical and applicable in an epi sense.",
    "It is a good course. But maybe it is a little bit too short (only half semester).",
    "I am very disappointed by this course. I was really looking forward to learning about how to do survival analysis step-by-step, from scratch. Instead, the class seem to catered to biostatistics majors because almost every session resulted in the instructor showing mathematical proofs on the chalk board. I'm wonder how much of this is useful for applied researchers?What would be helpful are step-by-step sessions on how to conduct survival using SAS, interpreting the output, understanding papers that used survival analysis, and how to write up the results. Instead such indispensable topics were brushed through and assumed we could digest from pages of unintelligible SAS code uploaded on classes V2.What would improve is to have a lecture tutorial system. During the tutorial the TA could go through how to actually conduct survival analysis step-by-step, assuming no prior knowledge, and explaining the SAS code step by step.",
    "The overall course was very good and provided and in depth look at epidemiological statistics. Like the survival analysis class, I think this should really be a full semester course. I think that we went through the last section extremely quickly. Having a full semester would allow us more time to digest that material.",
    "informative and useful, but it's too fast-paced",
    "Good, but could be more clear"

    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0This was Dr. Zhao's first time teaching this course. He is a very nice guy and clearly knows his stuff. Overall, I think the biggest challenge was that this material seems really basic from his perspective, and he doesn't know how to relate it to students for whom it is a lot more advanced. As this was his first time with the course, parts were a bit rough and he did not have a good sense of the amount of material that he could cover in one class. I expect those things will improve each year.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0nice approachable professor but not a great teacher. too much emphasis on proofs",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Dr. Zhao is a poor instructor who derives formulas constantly without providing the why or how behind the calculus. His slides reflect that he put little effort into the course and was unsure of what he was really teaching. If Dr. Zhao teaches this course in the future, calculus should be listed as a pre-requisite.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Professor Zhao is kind and helpful. He always explains things clearly.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0consider the class composition during preparation. This class does not only contain only biostats majors. on the contrary a majority are not and who have no survival background. instead of 80% focus on mathematical proofs, won't it be more beneficial to balance it out with a step-by-step process on how to do survival analysis and explaining SAS code? what we need to take away is how to use SAS to do survival and not a treatise on the mathematics used by the program.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0I think that Hongyu was very approachable, flexible and a good professor. This was an enormous amount of material which had to be fit into a small amount of time. Given the constraints, I feel he did a very good job.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0very learned and clear about all the concepts.But he shows not very responsive to students' need"

You will be happier if you remember some calculus, but can get by with faking it. Having an Epi background was critical for this class; without it I would have been completely lost.",
