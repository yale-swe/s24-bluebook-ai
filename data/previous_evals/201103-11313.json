    "Matt Decker was beyond helpful as a TA. He was willing to spend time troubleshooting assignments even outside of TA hours. What a great guy.The assignments were frequently frustrating. I didn't find it helpful to do something several times incorrectly before finally finding the small error I had made, as it tended to reinforce the wrong way of doing things.",
    "This course was a lot of work, but it was well worth it. Dana presents the material very clearly, but you can only really learn the program by using it, hitting walls, and figuring out ways around them.",
    "Amazing course. The instructor and TA both were very helpful and the assignments really force you to think and make sure that you understand the material.",
    "7A. Dana is an excellent professor. He gradually brings us in to a program with the assumption that you don't know anything. This makes the material seem very accessible, even though it is challenging to use. He was more responsive than almost any professor I've ever had ever, and he really worked hard to answer questions and help us understand the material.7B. Matt Decker should receive the award for Most Patient and Helpful TA in the Universe. His ability to sit with a frustrated student and answer their questions was unwavering. He was always available, willing to meet with people outside of his (extensive) office hours, and he was never annoyed (or at least visibly so), even when he was getting peppered with the same questions over and over again while he was trying to finish his own work. I've never seen a person so happy to be helping other people understand a thing like GIS. Amazing.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about a topic in which I came in knowing nothing. This course was ridiculously frustrating from the onset, but it was designed this way. I realized at the end that I had learned quite a bit. I never realized that I was actually learning while I was actually taking the course.",
    "Great instructor and great opportunity for learning in this class. the one thing i didn't like about theclass was the competitive prodding that the instructor engages in--publishing people's grades and comparing our work to UPenn students' work. This cultivates an intensity and a competitiveness that can obscure learning objectives.",
    "Question 4: This class takes a lot of time and patience.",
    "Q1: The instructors hand-outs were truly impressive, and will be saved for many years to come. These alone made the course worth taking.Q2: The instructor was very clear and methodical in his teaching style. The pace was excellent, and he made it possible for all students to stay on track conceptually.Q4: See Q13",
    "Both Dana and Matt were amazing resources. They were above and beyond helpful with questions--even encouraging communication and questions!",
    "Matt, the TA, was really helpful! I wouldn't have gotten through the course without him."

    "The support was phenomenal. Both Dana and Matt were incredibly accessible and knowledgeable. I also really appreciated the regularity and reliability of the syllabus.",
    "GIS is really an invaluable tool, the handouts are a great resource to have both for the class and to keep for the future, and the instructor is very good at explaining the software.",
    "Working on assignment and finally having that light-bulb go off in your head where everything clicks and you finally figure out what you have to do. It's a beautiful thing.",
    "The instructor is very intentional in his teaching and is responsive to student's questions. There is a lot to learn about the software, but both the professor and the TA were available to help.",
    "The fact that I really feel like I learned how to use this complex and totally useful program. I have already used GIS to make maps for a client I've been consulting for, and the work has gone into proposals for projects in New York City.",
    "great skills-building coursegreat professorgreat assignments to practice concepts",
    "The in-depth readings\/course material and immediately applicable skills.",
    "clarity of instruction",
    "Having a hands on approach to using the software and a professor that is very willing to assist students.",
    "This course was very well organized and well taught.",
    "We learnt to use Arcmap that is one of the most powerful tool in order to show in a map thing such as environmental impact, population growth, relationship between variables and so on.",
    "Getting to know all the GIS tools and playing around with the interface.",
    "The best part about this course was gaining enough proficiency to be able to continue to develop skills in modeling on one's own. That is, I learned enough of the basics that I now know how, where, and what to look for in further developing my abilities. I appreciated also that the individual skills were set into a broader ArcGIS context, helping me to understand how the various programs worked together, and how the technical facets stem from past historical developments.Other than the time commitment and grading scheme (see Q13), this was a wonderful class that provided hands-on, practical skills to be used in the real world. I am so thankful that I took it, and will absolutely take the complimentary raster-based class. The delivery, resources, and assignments were all significant contributors to my learning.",
    "All the help from the TA during office hours. Homeworks are very time demanding and it was nice being able to receive immediate help from the TA while in the computer lab.",
    "Dana is a terrific lecturer and teacher. He made learning GIS fun and interesting.",
    "The assignments were useful because you have to use the program to learn it. The instructor provided clear answers to questions asked during class.",
    "Dana's incredible descriptions of the concepts, and obvious love for the material. Dana's flexibility on assignment deadlines, and (generally) his focus on getting people to understand GIS really well through different means (repetition, the tutorials, creative assignments, etc)",

   "comments": [
    "If only ArcMap were not so finicky. It could also be frustrating not knowing by what criteria the professor was grading assignments.",
    "The homework assignments should involve less reading between the lines. It is reasonable for assignments to be time consuming and challenging, but it should be clear what is being asked.",
    "Nothing that I can think of.",
    "Not a thing. The homework was maddeningly difficult, but by screwing up a million times, I learned how to use the program. So good (in hindsight).",
    "it's a lot of work",
    "Too challenging of a question to answer. The professor was purposefully frustrating and confusing in order to make us learn better. This was a pain throughout the semester but in the end it was valuable and I appreciate it. If you had asked me this question two months ago I would tell the professor to be more direct, but I would no longer say this.",
    "none",
    "The professor dangled the curve in front of us as a motivational tool but I think this caused students an unnecessary amount of anxiety.Sometimes I had difficulty understanding exactly what was expected from assignments (eg. the need to point out problems in the Moose assignment and how to display results of biome assignment).",
    "I tended to enjoy assignments the most when they were of a very practical nature.",
    "The \"tricks\" hidden in each assignment. I would rather feel like I get it and learn more tools than take extra time trying to solve these tricks.",
    "The most frustrating part about this course was that the professor had open-ended homework assignments for which he did not provide a rubric or hit-list of which skills we were supposed to be using and demonstrating a proficiency with. The issue is not the open-endedness, but the fact that once the assignments were turned in, the professor would then grade them on a very specific set of criteria. If the students had known which specific criteria he wanted us to aim for, then many of us would have had greater success on the assignments. It seemed rather unfair, really, that we would be left to explore and present our work according to general guidelines, while be evaluated on a secret set of specific guidelines. This amounted to students trying to guess what it was that the professor wanted to see.While I do like the base concept of open-ended assignments, this course demanded an excessive amount of time for some of us who did not have prior modeling experience. If the grading criteria for eachassignment were made available to students, and an imposed time-limit was set for assignments, I think more students would enjoy this class. As it was, my sense from working with peers was that this class fell into love-hate status. The skills are wonderful and I didn't talk to any students who disliked the subject matter. But, the time commitment was so great that some of the fun of learning to manipulate data in a new program was lost. In this way, I think the positive sides of the course did not impassion the students to as great a degree as is possible. Perhaps some slightly modified approach could be adopted in the future.",
    "This course was so much more stressful and frustrating than it needed to be. The grading criteria were opaque and I honestly never knew whether I would get an 8 or a 2 on any given assignment. That doesn't exactly inspire me to put in more than the minimal amount of effort required to make something I could hand in. Hiding tricks and errors in the problem set that students have to be lucky enough to catch (or to hear about because they were in the computer lab a the right time) just makes students frustrated. It seems to have discouraged people from taking further classes about arcGIS.",
    "There is a lot of 'point chasing' that goes on. Dana dangles points in front of students, and is sometimes sneaky in hiding issues with the data\/problem in the assignment which leads to student energy wasted on trying to figure out what he wants instead of learning the material really well. Dana is occasionally condescending to students, which is not appreciated.",
    "It's nice to see something that has been perfected over time; I truly have no suggestions for improvement. (A rarity!)"

    "fantastic. Matt always made himself available and responded patiently to questions and concerns. Great balance of expertise and encouragement; he would not simply give out answers but rather push you to figure out solutions--asking probing questions or offering reminders of when and where we might have encountered simliar problems before. kudos.",

I appreciated this, and felt that it contributed positively to my own learning. The TA was most assistive during office hours, but I wish that both the TA and the professor had greater availability. Not necessarily more hours, though that would be nice, but instead just a wider variety of days and times. I was rarely available during any of the office hours, which made acquiring help very challenging.",

    "Know this course will take alot of time and energy.",
    "1.) Read the assignments VERY carefully, and try to address all of the subtleties in the the text description of what you are supposed to do. The professor chooses his words carefully, so you would do best to follow his direction.2.) Review others assignments to see what you are missing, and to get ideas for the next assignments.3.) Expect to spend 20+\/- hours a week on each assignment.4.) Like any program, ArcGIS can be insanely frustrating. The beginning seems most confusing, since it is hard to understand and access even basic tools. In time, this challenge fades and you are faced with more complex versions of the same. The program is so sophisticated that it can do pretty much everything you can imagine. So over time, the frustration falls in trying to figure out how to do what it is that you are imagining.5.) The TA was very helpful in a practical way - visit him\/her.6.) It is helpful to have a laptop in class such that you can executethe tutorial assignments (the first part of every homework assignment) in class, as the instructor leads everyone through it. This saves 1+\/- hour at home.7.) Do the assignment as soon after the class as you can. I had class on thursday, and would do the assignment thursday, friday, and saturday. If you wait too long, you might forget the technical pieces of the problem, thereby increasing the time commitment and the frustration.8.) This is part one of two.
