   "comments": [
    "An extension of 110. More of the same, though it feels like more work (though you won't be spending so much time on tones this time around). Grasping the grammar never really got easier for me, though the instructors did all they could. Good class.",
    "Very intensive and has a high workload. Definitely do it if you really want to learn the language well. I think it is a very highly rewarding course.",
    "A LOT OF WORK. Do not take this class if you are bad at time management or if you \"just want to take a language credit\". It is a commitment on all fronts.",
    "Challenging, educational and a steep learning and work ethic curve",
    "Chinese 120 is a continuation of Chinese 110. The format of the class is basically the same. A typical week consists of daily quizzes, daily written homework, and dialogue memorizations. If you picked up a good routine in Chinese 110, the workload of Chinese 120 should be very manageable.",
    "If you are interested in substantially improving your Chinese over a semester, then I strongly recommend taking this course. It will not only give you a solid foundation in the Chinese language, but also introduce you to some elements of Chinese culture.",
    "There is a quiz every day, a test every other week, and an oral test every week. So don't take this unless you are ready to commit to it. That said you will learn so much, bond with your classmates, and have wonderful teachers who will expose you to this language and culture."
