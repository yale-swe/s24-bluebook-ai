    "I learned the fundamental styles and techniques of Renaissance-era Venetian and Spanish music. I improved my sight-reading skills tremendously, not to mention my pronunciation of Italian, Spanish, and Latin.",
    "I learned about music of the 16th century, performance styles, composition techniques of the period and how to recognize them.",
    "This course helps you learn to sightread and teaches you about the history and musical\/stylistic elements of compositions from hundreds of years ago.",
    "Sight reading, singing in a large ensemble setting, engagement with the history of early music practices.",
    "Developed a greater understanding of the baroque and early music canon. Improved sight reading, blend, and understanding of early music notation. Learned more about composers like Monteverdi and Victoria."

   "comments": [
    "There are many strengths of the class. Grant is an extremely talented musician, and picks great repertoire; the vocal and instrument ensembles are filled with interesting, talented students and community members (from both of whom I have learned a lot!); and performances in the Beinecke are truly spectacular. The main weakness of the class is that Monday rehearsals can feel a bit redundant\/boring. Some of the repetition is inevitable, though, as you need to practice music over and over again to master it.",
    "Wonderful course. Learned a lot of music (and a lot about the music) and Grant made it fun as well",
    "This course's strengths lie in the fact that almost every musician in the class has a great love for music and simply enjoys getting the opportunity to sing\/play wonderful song that are hundreds of years old every Monday. The concerts at the Beinecke are a wonderful opportunity to sing in a beautiful space and give the class the feeling it is working up to something. One weakness is that there just isn't enough time - it would have been nice to be able to split into small groups of vocal parts more often."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course! As an instrumentalist, this course was one of those hidden gems that I wish I had discovered earlier. I enjoyed learning how to play early instruments and performing in the Beinecke was always a treat.",
    "yes",
    "It's fun, not much work, and really an opportunity you won't get anywhere else. Grant is great too.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in early music and who feels proficient in sight-reading! The repertoire is tons of fun, and it's always entertaining to see what obscure Renaissance-era instruments Grant will whip out and play at any moment.",
    "Great course if you have any interest whatsoever in the Renaissance or singing in general. Highly recommend, and Grant is the best",
    "Music 334 is a fantastic courseGrant brings the music alive through his contextual analysis and is a great music director.",
    "Absolutely. A fun 5th class that is also challenging in a very different way from other yale courses (not tons of homework but rather honing your craft as a musician in and outside of class).",
    "If you enjoy singing and playing and have any interest in learning about music outside the contemporary canon, I would say definitely take this. A great fifth credit."
