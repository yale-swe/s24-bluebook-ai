    "A great experiential class on engaging with practice and theory of photojournalism. I would definitely recommend this class for other students, especially people who want to learn in an atypical manner, through going out there and figuring things out by trial and error.",
    "No photo experience needed. The class is centered around developing a personal documentary project, which can be very rewarding; there's far less focus on photography itself, although some class time is spent discussing the work of professional photojournalists and documentary photographers. Professor Grinker does a really good job of helping you develop your project.",
    "Great class if what you want to do is have a semester-long photography project on something in New Haven. Honestly, most of the class and your work is about this one big project - which I thought was awesome.",
    "This class is taught by a visiting instructor who is a professional photographer. Prof. Grinker was very helpful and understanding. Her perspective is particularly insightful and may be a refreshing change of pace from the consistently academic professors one might be exposed to at Yale. I believe the course is necessary and that there should be others that encourage students to engage with New Haven, as well do work that involves proactivity. There isn't too much coursework, but the work involved for the class requires you to schedule appropriately. It is really difficult to manage your work in that class depending on your subjects for the semester's project. That \"proactivity\" that I referred to just now is a lot more difficult to achieve than one might initially perceive. It's a hands-on course. You can learn in this class through your own trials which is also something that may be missing from other classroom settings. I ultimately learned a lot and enjoyed the company of my fellow students and instructor.",
    "This class is one of the best-kept secrets at Yale. It's great. You learn photography from a really talented photojournalist, Lori Grinker, come up with a documentary project based on something you're interested in, and practice photographing over the course of the semester, presenting your work and seeing your classmates' work as you go. The best thing about the course is the fact that it basically gives you class credit for learning more about New Haven. You'll go into New Haven during class, with a partner, and on your own to practice shooting and work on your project. I took this class to get out and about in New Haven and finished it feeling like I knew more about the city and even making some close connections with residents. At the end of the course, you'll have an exhibit where you can show off the hard work you've done all semester, and it's a pretty magical event. This class is a solid introduction to photography. Definitely take it if you're interested in photography, journalism, or any kind of documentary work. It motivated me to continue immersing myself in these areas as deeply as possible.",
    "If you have the chance to take this seminar, take it. It was fantastic. We began the semester by just taking pictures around New Haven, which was a great experience in and of itself in that it really exposes you to the city and its citizens. It's refreshing to get out of the \"Yale Bubble,\" and you'll be surprised how much people will open up to you when you have a camera and show interest in them. From there, we chose themes in New Haven that were of particular interest to us, and got more involved with our projects as the semester progressed.What's really valuable is that this class gives you the opportunity to get to know New Haven in a way that few Yale students do. It's not a community service project or outreach program, it's a genuine effort to get to know the citizens and integrate yourself into the city. It's amazing how much New Haven has to offer that Yale students miss out on.Even outside of New Haven, this class teaches you how to go about documentary photography, how to be persistant, yet sensitive and try to earn your subjects' trustYou gain interpersonal skills (my project was focused on people, so that may color my perspective) that are useful even outside of photography.Our class was also fortunate in that we took a trip to NYC together to see the Apartheid exhibition at the ICP, which was absolutely fantastic. Professor Grinker also arranged for us to go to the apartment of Jill Friedman, a famous photographer, and talk with her about her work and our projects.Overall, this class was amazing. It was especially enriching because everybody in the class invested a lot of effort into their projects and we all became closer by the end, not only with each other but also with Professor Grinker. TAKE IT!!!",
    "Yes I would recommend it! this course willl change the ways in which you interact with both your direct environment and the world around you!"
