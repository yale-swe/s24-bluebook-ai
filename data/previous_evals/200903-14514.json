   "comments": [
    "Ling 663 is a basic introduction to the logic of linguistic meaning. It is a very math-oriented approach to meaning and focuses on symbolic logical as a tool for analyzing language. I would recommend the class to students interested in a technical approach to language and students who enjoy math and logic.",
    "This course uses formalism to model linguistic meaning, so a lot of the material may be familiar to students who have taken logic. The second half of the course builds upon this foundation, examining more nuanced aspects of meaning. I would recommend it to other students provided they have a strong interest in language and the persistence to learn the formalisms used to study it."

   "comments": [
    "I felt that while this class covered the basics of semantics, it was not particularly useful. I have taken semantics courses in the past that were much more engaging and better prepared me for work in semantic research. This course did not contribute greatly to my research and while I am working on a paper related to semantics, it was not inspired by or shaped by the contents of this course and is being written under the supervision of another professor.",
    "I had never considered doing much semantics research, but my mind is now more open to it after taking this course. I feel that I have a more solid background in it to begin explore the primary literature."
