   "comments": [
    "I will recommend the course to those interested in gaining more familiarity with advanced fundamentals of genetics. It stimulates your scientific thought process and the quality of the discussion sections is great.",
    "sure. it provides solid background for biology people.",
    "Genetics 625 is a graduate level class in genetics that assumes you are familiar with the basics and history of genetics (ex Mendelian genetics) and teaches modern genetics and techniques, with a focus on human disease. I would recommend this course to any who engage in biomedical research as a prerequisite to understanding the literature.",
    "I would recommend this class. The topics are pretty interesting and the take home questions and assignments truly make you think critically about the science beyond genetics. Try to get into a discussion section with the professors because the TF's (and undergraduates) unfortunately focus more on methods and techniques than strategy and reasoning behind the papers.",
    "I would like to recommend this course to another fellow student. It is really useful training in thinking.",
    "Yes. I thought the class was well paced and appropriate for a graduate student. I enjoyed doing the take home questions and appreciated having those instead of an exam.",
    "Maybe; I found that the coursework got in the way of my time in lab. I also feel that the discussion section should be credited as a separate class - it was extremely time consuming. Overall though, it was a helpful review of modern genetics topics.",
    "really great class. learned a lot of useful information that could be applied to your research.",
    "If you want a fairly broad basis in modern experimental methods in genetics, this is a good choice. More than anything you'll have the chance to read some seminal papers in the field and get a flavor for the vocabulary you need to navigate the literature. Lectures can sometimes feel a bit disjointed, but as discrete units they're usually fairly high quality; I enjoyed them and think I learned a fair amount.",
    "It is a really good introductory course to genetics. I would definitely recommend this course to others.",
    "Lots of genetics, a bit discursive.",
    "I would say that if you do not have a background in Genetics, be prepared to work hard. I did not have a strong background in Genetics, so I found this material particularly difficult. With the help of the faculty, however, I was able to successfully complete and understand the class. I would, therefore, recommend this course to another student."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me understand the principles of genetic analysis that are relevant in experimental design, also exposed me to updated principles in genetics, particularly the fundamental theory behind current approaches in the study of human disease. It contributed by providing the principles to be used in an upcoming paper.",
    "This course significantly deepened my knowledge of modern genetics, and their specific applications to human disease. I will use this knowledge mostly in understanding advances in genetics and reading the literature as I begin my thesis research.",
    "really helpful",
    "This course made me realize I like genetics more than I thought. I am now considering rotating in a genetics lab!",
    "It cleared up topics that I was unfamiliar\/unsure about, which was helpful.",
    "i learned a lot of cutting edge information that could help with genetics research during my time here.",
    "As someone with a biochemistry \/ biophysics interest, this broadened the basis of literature from which I can draw upon -- a lot of my work is based on genetics screens if you go back far enough.",
    "YES. I did not have a strong Genetics background before taking this class, and I feel that this class greatly increased my knowledge in the discipline."
