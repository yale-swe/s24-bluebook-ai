    "Very interesting course, and the little work we have is fun if you are interested in the topic. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Great seminar. Keil is a great instructor and the course material is for the most part very engaging. Workload is a weekly 500 word reading response, one presentation over the course of the semester on the week's readings, and a 20 page final paper. Very manageable course load, and the final paper (a research proposal) can be about anything you want as long as it relates to something covered in the course.",
    "Yes! If you can get into the class, take the class.",
    "Really amazing readings and syllabus on an interesting topic. Professor Keil is great but doesn't lead class to much. Great upper-level psych course.",
    "The course provides interesting insights on epistemology and the psychology behind human knowledge -- take it if you're interested in this material.",
    "Take this class!",
    "YES. The class is amazing. Professor Keil is amazing. Take it.",
    "Psych 408 provides great insight into the ways in which humans are ignorant, and how human cognition works in environments of too complex information, or imperfect information. The course made me more aware of how human cognition can mislead us, or operates differently to what we expect. The workload of the course is manageable given that this is a senior seminar. Professor Keil is a great professor, and his enthusiasm and knowledge make for great discussions."
