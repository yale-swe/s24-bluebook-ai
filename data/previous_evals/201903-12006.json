    "That taking a top-down approach by studying privilege is just as, if not more, necessary and important when studying inequality as a whole.",
    "I improved my ability to read dense, academic material, understand the main arguments and connect to it to discussion and other readings. The material we engaged with also provided me a different lens through which I could understand topics outside the course itself.",
    "I learned a lot about the structures of privilege that exist within the Americas in terms of race and gender. A lot of the readings were more anthropological in that they focused on interviews and how to conduct interviews, which was super interesting to learn about.",
    "I learned how to critique privilege effectively, as well as recognize it in my own life and around me. I also loved learning about how anthropology, specifically, could have a powerful role in revealing how privilege worked.",
    "Discovered the concept of Studying up.",
    "- Gained a broader understanding and general introduction to many topics related to Ethnicity, Race, and Migration - Got the opportunity to learn from a gifted group of young adults who are extremely passionate about the subject matter - Got the opportunity to read many fascinating perspectives on the subject matter, which broadened my own horizons and allowed me to think and empathize in a brand new way: the value of this cannot be understated"

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the archival piece very much, and think focusing on the privilege that Yale specifically exudes would be very interesting and necessary.",
    "This course is extremely strong. Although the weekly responses can be a lot of work, it prepares all students to be able to engage fully in the seminar discussion.",
    "This class was a phenomenal class! I loved doing the readings every week since they were very interesting and it was a good mix of news articles and academic articles. Professor Ramos-Zayas was a great professor and was super well informed on every topic so always had very interesting commentary. She did a great job of balancing her own thoughts with letting students have a chance to engage with the material. The only weaknesses were that I would have loved to have some smaller research assignment before the final paper. I felt a bit lost while writing the final paper in terms of how to weave together many different sources in a cohesive argument, but that may have just been my personal lack of experience in that area. The other thing is that I thought some weeks' readings were substantially weaker than most weeks. For example, I thought the readings on love were somewhat uninteresting and not well-written, especially compared to most of the readings, which were fantastic.",
    "Strengths: great readings (!), engaging topics, good mix of short lectures from Professor Ramos-Zayas and discussion with classmates, very relevant topic Weaknesses: there could have maybe been one more short assignment during the semester to balance out the long final paper"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, you are given much freedom to explore a broad range of topics that relate to privilege and that should be uncovered.",
    "YES! I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. The weekly response papers seem daunting but they are doable and make the seminar discussion so engaging. The paper assignments are also really personally rewarding, and I am so grateful to have had to the opportunity to take this course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course!!! This is probably one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I learned so much and all of the material was so interesting.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Any Yale student would benefit from the knowledge this class gives you about recognizing and starting to undo privilege. This class gives such a unique perspective on why systems of power exist and operate they way they do."
