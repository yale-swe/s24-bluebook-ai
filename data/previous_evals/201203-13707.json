   "comments": [
    "I think that students should be able to test out of this course. The range of scores on the first midterm was something like 40 to 97. As someone with a very limited statistics background it was intimidating and I supsect that the people with the highest grades never came to class because they were already fluent in the material. I went to every lecture, worked diligently on my own and still found the course to be challenging.",
    "Overall it's a good class. Problems that are on the homework should be covered more thoroughly in class.",
    "There was not enough information given about when you would be violating the assumptions of the statistical tests so that when I do my own statistics I would know if I was violating the principles the tests.",
    "Strengths: taught in a clear fashion. fidelity to the text was key in this course so that reading the text provided you with an opportunity to review the material before and after the class.weakness: nothing in particular. good intro stats course.",
    "Useful and it will be helpful too add more context",
    "I thought the course was generally good. I liked the format, and thought the assignments and labs helped to illustrate topics covered in lecture.One thing that was helpful for me that I feel could perhaps be implemented was doing the labs before the lab session every week. It enabled me to ask questions and understand the code rather than try to copy code from the examples.",
    "Even though SAS is very crucial to the field of biostatistics, I feel that it is better to have a discussion section in place of lab. In my opinion, it would help if students understood the statistical concepts first. In these discussion sessions, questions or concepts can be reviewed.I also felt that the textbook wasn't that great of a learning tool. Dr. Claus didn't really use the same phrasing as the text in her exams so the tests were difficult for me.",
    "Strengths- Cant think of anyWeaknesses- Instructor could have been better.",
    "I think I would like to have a PowerPoint presentation instead of writing in slides with over head projectors. I had difficulties reading the handwriting and it would be really helpful if they were typed in.",
    "i like that it's open book exam",
    "I thought this course provided a good foundation of statistics. I found it challenging since I do not have a strong math or statistics background, but found the office hours to be an extremely helpful resource. SAS lab took quite a bit of time, and almost felt like another course on top of lecture. I would recommend making the actual time for the lab longer because I always found myself wishing the TA could have stayed longer to answer questions. Overall, I found the course challenging but helpful.",
    "can be more difficult",
    "Weakness - 8:30am hard core thinking class, I feel like more examples when going through new material would be helpful",
    "Strengths:If you attended class, you were given great information by the instructor.Claus is personable and willing to help if you need it.The TA's were wonderful- especially Jenna and Adam.Weaknesses:Sometimes lectures went really quick.Classes V2 documents weren't organized or labeled in an easy to understand fashion.",
    "More homeworks and homework problems to improve example pool for tests.",
    "Strengths: course material was clear and helpful.Weaknesses: some of the topics were not explained in great detail due to time constraints.",
    "Very good course--Dr. Claus is very receptive, open, and helpful to students. SAS handouts in class were sometimes disjointed from weekly lab exercises. I found the book to quite unhelpful--often found myself looking up topics in a stats book from a previous course.",
    "Good introduction to biostatistics and practical applications. Good balance between conceptual framework and applying statistical knowledge to practice problems. The homework problem sets and labs were extremely helpful.Points of improvement might be the sas handouts used during class; perhaps by adding a date and short description of the purpose\/setting of the handout. Also, some organization of the resources on the classes v2 website would be helpful.",
    "This course provided a satisfactory basis for understanding statistics and a strong foundation in SAS programming.However, I have previously taken an undergraduate (geared towards freshman and sophomores) statistics class in college that was more difficult, covered more content, and better prepared me to practice statistics.I attended every single class session and felt my understanding of statistics declined from my knowledge before taking the class. This is problematic.The content in this class was often presented in a disorganized fashion - the homework, lectures, and SAS lab did not always align with each other.The professor's notes and lecture were sometimes helpful and engaging and sometimes very confusing and disjointed. I did not ever feel like I could follow the organization of the class.PLEASE in the future make other arrangements for taking the mid-term and final exam. Winslow is a COMPLETELY INADEQUATE setting and seating arrangement for 100+ students to complete an open note\/open book exam - there is NOT enough desk space, arm space or leg space in that room. Perhaps the seating could be arranged like the epidemiology final - half of the students in Winslow, half in the outside classrooms.Also, the final exam was almost certainly missing a page - the points did not add up to 100, the SAS content promised was not all provided, and as a result one of the questions asked us to calculate by hand an equation that I had specifically written in my notes \"will not have to calculate by hand\". Also, the remainder of the exam seemed haphazardly thrown together and not in alignment with the practice questions we received.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it provides a good, comprehensive introduction to statistical analysis. The way the coursework was structured was very logical and lessons seamlessly transitioned from one to the next. Another thing that was a strength is that the professor also lectured on SAS with tied the exercises with the exercises we were required to complete during lab time. The weaknesses are that I think some previous statistical analysis(at a minimum one undergraduate course) may be needed to fully understood the coursework and lessons at the level of which the students will ultimately be required to perform the coursework.",
    "Strengths - very nice TA'sWeaknesses - only one SAS class per week made it difficult to feel like I was really \"learning\" SAS. I'd prefer having SAS for half the semester, twice a week. For example, lecture 3x per week for the first half, then 1 lecture + 2 lab sections for the second half, instead of 2 lectures + 1 lab for the whole semester.",
    "Overall I feel like the material that is covered is very good. I liked that the textbook was used in conjunction with class. I also really liked the SAS printouts that were handed out in class and explained. This will definitely be very beneficial for us all in the future.One weakness I found was only turning in 4 homework assignments. I think that turning in an assignment once every other week would be much more beneficial. I would also have found it extremely beneficial if Dr. Claus had created her homework assignments rather than from the book. Her exams went into more depth than the book, and I felt it was hard to prepare with only a few practice problems given from the prior year's test.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I felt the material was presented very well and that the book and labs complemented lectures very well.",
    "Strengths: teaching us SAS, going through problems in classWeaknesses: doing labs during discussion seemed unnecessary (could be completed at home)and this time may be better spent doing more practice problems or answering general questions",
    "very good class overall.However, SAS should not be part of this course.",
    "Useful content; lecture can be improved if instructor uses powerpoint slides and lab can be improved if TA gives us more hands-on training on SAS.",
    "strengths: concepts made easy to understandweaknesses: SAS- the powerpoints were very helpful in lab, but I don't think I know how to really use SAS on my own",
    "It was not as challenging as I thought it would be, but was definitely not easy. Homework assignments were very time consuming, but extremely helpful. The midterm I thought was fair and I did alright, but the final... I felt that was a little unfair to question us on things we had not learned in class or had only learned to do by computer and not by hand. I'm not complaining too hard because I still passed the class, but I like to feel a little more confident and better about myself when I complete an exam. Not disappointed in myself.",
    "Professor could go over content in words as well as number to help students who are not as mathematically skilled. Many concepts were hard to grasp and the only notes from lectures were formulas and math problems.",
    "strengths - everything is clear to me,weakness - presentations was written not correct symbols (by hand)",
    "TAs are very approachable and helpful. The course does a wonderful job of integrating Epi material (good timing on presentation of subject matter).",
    "Does not follow book very well. HW's are based on book problems but lectures do not follow accordingly and exams do not contain much SAS even though it is emphasized on the HW.",
    "Not very well organized- definitely needed to follow the book to orient myself.",
    "I liked the overview that I got by taking this course. The concepts are very useful in terms of a foundational language for a student of public health. I had taken stats before. So it was more of a review for me. However, I think the pace would have been challenging for someone who has never taken stats before. I also think more time needs to be spent on teaching the SAS basics. We didn't spend any time on syntax or the building blocks of the SAS language and I found this to make labs difficult.",
    "Good basis for statistics. Strengths: comprehensive; weaknesses: could have used more SAS basics.",
    "It would be a lot more helpful if we had gone through specific examples of problems instead of going through the proof\/theory\/derivation of equations.I also did not think that SAS lab was particularly well-run.",
    "good course - definitely improved my skills and comfort level with biostats. It is not a particularly interesting or engaging class.",
    "I didn't think I would like statistics and this ended up being my favorite course.",
    "the lectures aren't well designed to target a class of students who don't have a math\/science background since the prof isn't great at outlining the basicsi like the structure - homework\/tests weighting, and the SAS labs",
    "This course was great. It was straightforward; we were taught what we needed to know and were tested on that material. I don't feel quite proficient in SAS yet, but hopefully that will come with the second semester of this course.",
    "The first half of the course was excellent--the professor went over the material in depth and taught us how to do the material both by hand and with SAS. The second half of the course was good too, but toward the end, the professor focused more on teaching us how to write SAS codes\/interpret SAS output, and I would have appreciated her taking the time to teach us how to do the calculations by hand.",
    "I think it would be useful to have an extra section every week to go over the homework especially for those people (such as myself) who struggled with the homework. The labs really just go over SAS and the lectures go over the material but there is no section to go over the homework. Something similar to the way epi is structured would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: SAS lab was easy to follow and learn from. The homework was challenging at times but really helped me learn.Weaknesses: 8:30 am class makes it difficult to concentrate at times! A 5 minute break in the middle of class would help.",
    "I may be biased because this is the 3rd statistics course i've taken, but I thought it was taught very well, and maybe even too slowly. The SAS labs definitely helped complement the course.",
    "I enjoyed taking this course to become acquainted with SAS, however, I found the lecture format to be somewhat abstract\/disorganized. I think that having more concrete examples of when to conduct certain tests\/problems within a specific flow chart would have been very helpful. I have taken intro to stats twice before, and felt that, other than SAS-related problems, I previously had a better grasp of the concepts and knowing what to use when tackling each type of problem.",
    "The SAS labs are difficult just because the computers are in terrible shape, some of the keyboard keys barely work and the SAS programs are going out of order because of registration. The material is good although the book and the instructor some times use different language or notations. One of the TAs the one that graded the second set of HW was unreasonably harsh, but all the other ones are very nice.More specific instruction for hw would really help, especially what to print out. because many of us were told not to print SAS material and just the code, but then we lose points for just interpreting and not including for example: a table of the means, medians.... when the question didn't ask for a table.",
    "It would be more helpful to have more frequent smaller psets because most of us waited until the day before to do them. If they are shorter but more frequent, we would have more of an opportunity to practice concepts as we learned them.",
    "The notes during class that are projected should be formatted and presented as Powerpoint slides - handwriting is very difficult to decipher.",
    "Good course. Sometimes the lectures did not relate to the exams. I wish they had video recordings of these lectures, because it was impossible to read the hand writing, listen, and pay attention to new material.",
    "Important subject matter covered in a comprehensible way. I had taken the class in college, though, and I consider the material to be presented in a way that would certainly have been too confusing for any one new to statistics.",
    "okay",
    "Overall, the course was a great introduction to Bio-statistics.",
    "I am not a huge fan of statistics and was not eager to take this course, but I realized it's important over the course of the semester. My frustration comes when SAS is somewhat of an afterthought to being able to crunch the numbers by hand when this is not the reality in any job setting. I think there should be more focus on SAS utilization and skills and less about being able to do problems by hand.",
    "strengths: clearly explain the formulae with examples and how they might be applied to real problems in researchmight be more interesting to explain the theoretical basis of the formulae and cover more materials in class",
    "Strengths: comprehensive, provision of SAS instruction, professor and TAs open to answering questions in class\/lab\/office hours, lab slides were detailed, SAS book very well writtenWeaknesses (suggestions in parentheses): lab homeworks that required SAS were extremely difficult and lengthy (the last set of lab homeworks took over 6 hours to complete and that was only half of the problem set)",
    "This course was well taught although I found the textbook a lot more useful for explaining the concepts. I liked how our problem sets were based on the textbook questions and I think some of the homework questions really helped me to understand the concepts. I liked the lab portion of the course as well but I think the one-hour lab sessions were too short to fully understand and complete the lab for each week. Maybe the time for lab sessions can be stretched to an hour and half.",
    "This SAS lab component was essentially worthless. Leaving the instruction to TAs who are also learning to use the program and exhibit varying degrees of willingness to assist with students questions is problematic. The method used to teach students the material was utterly insufficient and can be summed up in the following steps:Step 1: Complete X amount of jargon-y reading with no way to experiment unless you put the program on your computer (not on my mac) or do the reading in the SAS lab (probably the last place on earth I would want to do SAS reading).Step 2: Arrive in SAS lab and wait 20 minutes for one of the computers to boot up. Later on in the semester, there were at least 3 or 4 workstations with expired SAS accounts, which really improved everyone's attitudes about spending an hour in SAS lab.Step 3: Attempt to complete SAS assignment during lab time. TA is constantly helping other students because no one knows what they are doing. Students soon learn to copy code arbitrarily from the powerpoint presentations without actually understanding why we are using each string of commands.Step 4: Pray toall that is holy that you can figure out how to do the SAS portions of your problem sets.I have been incredibly frustrated by this portion of the class. I have thought long and hard about how I will describe these frustrations in this evaluation, and I believe that I have found an appropriate analogy to describe them. SAS is a language that we are trying to learn to speak. The way the course is currently being taught is like trying to teach students to speak that language by having us memorize the meaning of complete sentences. We are not learning syntax and conjugation; just the end result. Why use PROC Means instead of PROC univariate?? I still don't know.Literally the only benefit that resulted from this portion of the class was being able to bond over how terrible it was.",
    "In order to have a better learning experience, the class may need to be restructured. I think more of the class time should be spent in the SAS lab. Also, it would be nice if we had a review period for homework assignments similar to the way the introductory Epidemiology class was structured. We may need an extra day of class each week. The lectures were hard to follow and I felt like we were simply copying and pasting from the power points for our SAS lab assignments. I think it would make more sense to have an introductory SAS class concurrently with Biostatistics and Epidemiology.",
    "The class was very thorough and I was able to use what I learned to analyze material outside of class.The overhead projector system is really hard to read when I went back to review the class notes online- I could barely read what the words were.",
    "I only took the lab portion, it was well put together and useful",
    "Very important material, however it is presented in an uninteresting and tedious manner",
    "Overall I enjoyed the course, though I found the book to not be very helpful. It was too dense and hard to follow, and I found it not helpful for understanding the basic concepts (to provide context for what we were learning).",
    "A more generous curve should be added",
    "The homework assignments helped to check for understanding throughout the semester.",
    "Lectures are extremely difficult to follow. The professor's penmanship cannot be read under any circumstances, which made it difficult to follow along in lecture.",
    "The pace of the class was too fast. Other than that we covered a lot of material.",
    "The lab wasn't very useful. It was VERY rushed. Not enough time to really learn. And a lot of the TA's weren't very helpful. Learning about SAS lab from a lecture wasn't very helpful either. The lab needs to be integrated better and not as rushed.",
    "Very good statistical course. I learned a number of concepts not covered in previous statistic courses.",
    "To be more clear in teaching",
    "The teacher was terrible. YSPH is a small school but Claus is the epitome of \"large school prof.\" Non-responsive to e-mails, too busy to interact with students, shoved as much work as possible onto TA's laps. If the rest of my teachers were like her I wouldn't be returning next semester.Textbook was great, though. Very helpful.",
    "This course was OK. It taught the basics of biostatistics. I think the strength of the course was in combining the lab homework with the content of the course. The lab part was fairly good - the way the programming in SAS was introduced in the lab tutorials was quite good and the lab homework pertained to the material and was at the right level. There were a number of weaknesses with the course and I think it could be improved. First, an overview of what will be taught in the fall, in the form of a decision tree, which was presented at the end of the course, would be good to have from the beginning. I found the course instructor, Dr. Claus, to be lackluster. She presented material in one way\/her way only. She was not very good at understanding where students' questions were coming from and she did not go out of her way to present material in different ways to address misunderstandings. Rather, she just kept repeating the one way she had already used to explain the material. In addition, while the homework questions were out of the book and were straightforward, the test questions presented twists and were \"tricky\". I would recommend that, if the test questions are going to be different than the homework from the book, we should get practice questions like the test questions as homework in addition to the more straightforward questions. Or, on the other hand, just give straightforward questions like the book questions on the tests.",
    "Course was good.Instructor was inflexible which negatively impacted learning experience",
    "Strengths: Homework helps review class work and understand, SAS labs are also helpful.",
    "Strengths: The lectures and assignments for this course were very straight forward and did a good job of preparing us to us SAS and giving us an understanding of basis statistics.Weaknesses: The connection between the lab work and lecture material was not always particularly clear. I think that learning the SAS was important, however it would have been nice if the exams had as strong of a SAS focus as the coursework. Also, the homework problems allowed us to use SAS which helped understand SAS but made it difficult to do the work by hand on the exams.",
    "The content is not interesting but essential. I feel as though the labs could have been better structured though to actually take us through the process. I actually think SAS could be a separate course in entirety.",
    "STRENGTHS: The four homework assignments offered a wonderful chance to apply the material covered during the lectures, which helped build my confidence with the material and allowed me to identify any difficulties I was having that could then be addressed during office hours. I also really liked the weekly lab working with SAS. The lab was a time to work with SAS on a structured assignment and to ask any questions. This was really helpful! WEAKNESSES: The format for the lab questions\/write-up assignments was not always clear, and I was not always 100% sure what needed to be turned in. The TAs were always happy to answer questions though! Also, I would have appreciated more questions on both the midterm and final because if I struggled on any one question, I risked losing many points even if I knew the majority of the material. IMPROVEMENTS: If anything, I would say the lab portion of the course could be a little more in-depth in terms of working with the actual code. This would give students even more practice and confidence working with SAS.",
    "Overall structure of the course was very good. Midterms and Finals had clear reminders, review sessions and practice problems. There was no ambiguity about what course material would be covered on homework or exams.Would have liked to have an instructor approved alternate website\/textbook for extra review problems and reading on difficult subject matter."

Some of her lectures could be perhaps done in a slower manner to allow extra time for students to write out comments and additional information that is not in the slides.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is extremely open and helpful. I liked that she wrote notes on the overhead, rather than in a powerpoint. More examples that differ from the book's examples for each topic (or the most difficult topics) could be helpful in the future.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Clear explanation of statistical concepts and use of statistics in public health research.I found the written 'slides' to be more difficult to follow than use of a whiteboard or powerpoint presentation.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus has a great sense of humor that made an 8 am biostatistics course bearable. However, I did not feel that she was always understanding of the students' needs nor responsive to their concerns - she sometimes would laugh off students concerns or ignore them completely.The professor's notes and lecture were sometimes helpful and engaging and sometimes very confusing and disjointed. I did not ever feel like I could follow the organization of the class.Professor Claus is clearly very intelligent and has a thorough understanding of the material, but is not always able to adequately convey that to students through her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0One major strength of the professor is that she would work out the examples on the projectors in a clear and concise manner. This was also one major weakness in that the handwritten notes could at times be confusing. Also the instructor at times assumed the class knew how she had reached a certain conclusion when in reality some clarification was providedto fully understand why those conclusions were met.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Calm cool and collected. Great style, very good teacher",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths - well organized, clear instruction, found her sarcasm entertainingWeaknesses - i never sought help from here, but heard the professor is not helpful",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths--She is very humorous; this was greatly appreciated with the class being so early.Weaknesses--The hand-written notes on the overhead were very difficult to understand at times, and there were many cases where I could not read what was written.I also felt confused with how much of the material in class was presented. I feel that prepared slides would have made the concepts much clearer and easier to follow.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I really enjoyed the course and felt Dr. Claus did a very good job with the material. She taught at a good pace and was always willing to clarify points. I was very happy to have her as my instructor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: writing out notes and problems rather than using powerpoint",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0professor is very good. she understands the students and very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I like Dr. Claus and her humor. She is very knowledgeable and easy going. The only thing is it would be better if she uses slides instead, because her handwriting is sometimes difficult to read.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought this class was very well taught. All the concepts were made easy to understand with detailed problems gone over in class and with the homework.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is good",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Elizabeth absolutely knows the material, she is brilliant. She is not as good at transferring her knowledge to her students, but maybe it was just me. However I found the textbook assigned and another statistics textbook that I purchased to be of more use to me in learning the material than class lessons.Although I may not have personally liked her teaching style, she is a good teacher and very willing to answer questions and offer help, which is important. She also cares that her students do well and she wants us to succeed in her class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Instructor overall is good and approachable. Just hard to follow flow of thoughts in class at times, and notes are hard to review because concepts are not expressed in written form. Sometimes hard to keep up.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0professor is great specialist",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Presents material in a clear\/easy to understand manner. Approachable in office hours.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good at demonstrating SAS outputs. Could follow textbook more closely.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0No more projector notes! Use the board instead- would be clearer.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She's certainly very happy to be teaching this class and this shows through. Very timely with grading and getting back to students. However, I perceive that she sometimes doesn't quite understand questions posed from students in class. Given that she's on the spot, this makes sense, but perhaps it would be helpful to ensure that the student has really understood the answer.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Her approach to teaching is insulting to my ability to learn biostatistics. I believe that a successful class requires effort on part of the student, but also on part of professor. It is my impression that Professor Claus puts very little effort into this course, which undermines my ability to effectively learn the material. It is my understanding that Claus is a very busy researcher and medical doctor, and it is therefore understandable that an intro level statistics course is low on her list of priorities. However, if the biostatistics department cannot find a professor better suited to teach this course, then the integrity of YSPH will (and, in my opinion, has) suffered.Furthermore, whenever I approached Claus with questions or concerns, her responses shut me down and did not allow me to explain my questions further. What she says goes and she doesn't give students the opportunity to explore their questions.Also, she put things on the final exam that she explicitly said in class would not be on the examAll of that said, her lectures are not miserable to sit through. She has a very dry sense of humor, which keeps your attention fairly well. However, many of these jokes are at the expense of students\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 she cracks jokes about difficulties with SAS or comedically references how calculations or thought processes may go awry on an exam or homework set. She makes jokes out of our struggles, and although we laugh it off in class, I think it's detrimental to our ability to learn. Instead of clearly explaining something, she jokes about it.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very good at simplifying the material. Good pace in lectures.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The course was wonderfully taught, all concepts were written out in a clear and concise manner.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought Dr. Claus provided exercises that helped us understand the material. Her hand-writing sometimes makes it very difficult to follow along with the notes in class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She can be a little short and cold to her students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is quite funny and I enjoy her jokes in class (though it's not the best when the prof is always laughing at how much the students mess up on everything ie tests, SAS).She isn't great at explaining basic concepts, and has a round about way of answering questions (often not really answering them at all).",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus was great. She taught slowly and methodically, so it is easy to keep up. No complaints here!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0strenghts: positive attitude, vibrant personality, clarity of explanations, promptness in replying to emails, fair grading.I didn't do great on the course (Will get high-pass). But I still would grade her high. After her course, I understand the basic concepts very well and am sure that I can use this info later in my research.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0THe professor does a really good job of presenting them material in a way that is digestible to those of us with no previous statistics background. My one critique is that she spent too much time on the beginning material and rushed a little through the second half of the course.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is a great instructor and very available during her office hours.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was a good instructor and always tried to give a real world example of how what we are learning could be used outside of class. I appreciated that very much.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus is very intelligent, and she uses an effective method of teaching statistics.The only drawback is sometimes i couldn't undersand her handwriting on the projector slides.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I really liked having Dr. Claus as a professor. She is an entertaining lecturer, which is definitely helpful for the early morning classes. I also like that she was able to pull in some examples from her own research for the class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Her lectures are hard to follow, it might be better if she had powerpoint slides, or pre written lecture notes. Most people have trouble reading the writing even as she is writing it down, and going back to it is even harder.Aside from that the professor is very good, and it really helps when she answer questions because her answers are to the point. She is also very approachable and have a great grasp of the material and how to explain it to students with different back grounds",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The notes during class that are projected should be formatted and presented as Powerpoint slides - handwriting is very difficult to decipher.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Really smart, witty, and a good professor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The professor is a true expert on the field, though I am perplexed as to why such an introductory class has a professor that is often away.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0There is no doubt that Dr. Claus is knowledgable in biostatistics, but I feel she could have done a better job of preparing lectures that made the material truly accessible. Her handwriting is hard to read and the notes were hard to follow; preparing powerpoints in advance would make the lectures easier to follow and more useful for midterm and exam preparation. Also, I would argue that both the midterm and the final were not a fair assessment of the material we covered in class. As an example, there was a question on how to calculate sample size based on power on the final, and this was something we had only done in SAS previously. There should be a more consistent way of testing our understanding of the information than testing new material on the final.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus is very kind and nice to students. I would like it even more if she teaches at a faster speed at class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very nice, but I did not learn well from her teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: class \"slides\" and materials discussed in class were available on classesv2, very quick with grading exams, thorough answer keys made available, very approachable after class and during office hours, expert instructionWeaknesses: professors' class \"slides\" were barely legible (type, please!), professor spends time describing deviations to the example she's laying out without first fully describing the basics -- makes it very confusing and overwhelming to follow the lecture (break down basic example first and then describe, if necessary for understanding, how answer changes when certain tweaksto problem\/prompt are made), final exam very obviously excluded an important page (SAS output)&included pre-midterm material despite everything being post-midterm in practice exam and in professors' exam review",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor was very good with answering students' questions in class. Maybe she can slow down a little bit with explaining certain concepts like hypothesis testing.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Recommendations:(Please)1. Use powerpoint or improve your handwriting...I'm missing crucial information trying to figure out what it is you've scrawled on the overhead. Also: you still use overheads???? The last time I saw a transparency was in 5th grade Language Arts.2. Don't bring things up that we will learn about in another class. It wastes time and is potentially confusing.3. Be accommodating when we come to your OH. I heard horror stories about people being made to feel stupid, and I never attended yours as a result. It's been awhile since some of us were in a math class---please cut us some slack.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I think Dr. Claus is a nice professor and generally wants us to succeed. She is overtly passionate about Biostatistics and knowledgeable about the subject. However, she presented the course in a confusing way sometimes. For example, she may write notes on a particular topic, then several minutes later tell us that we don't need to know the information this semester and we will only need it for next semester. Also, her handwriting was hard to read. In addition, it seemed like she was teaching us from memory and we were instructed based on her train of thought. Again, I the class may need to be restructured so that we have less lecture time and more time in the SAS lab.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor clearly knows the subject well, and she seems comfortable taking feedback from students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very ready to answer questions. Lectures were clear, but notes were difficult to read off of v2.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very intelligent however not engaging at 830 AM",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She was a good professor. She explained the material well and made it easy (as possible as it can be) to understand. I understand why she hand writes her class notes, but they were hard to understand later in the semester when trying to review the material for the final and mid-term. Posting all of the class handouts on classes V2 would be helpful as well (ideally in a specific folder...I couldn't find all of them, and a few were attached at the bottom of the class notes).",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is a very tough grader and I wished she gave more partial credit.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor sequenced the course in a logical way. She was sensitive to student concerns and the selected homework problems were helpful in understanding course material.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is a very nice person and, when pressed to provide more thorough explanations for any questions given in class, she always did so flawlessly. The speed of her class was a little to fast given her penmanship.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She tried her best to cover all the material in the time given. My only recommendation would be to review the material covered from the previous lecture.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: She repeated things quite often which was helpful.Weakness: Didn't explain some things that great. Also, didn't seem very approachable or open to meeting with students.The final: I really think she was missing a sheet. She asked us to calculate a confidence interval for something that she had told us we would never have to calculate. And we also had to plot the residuals by finding the residual points, something we didn't have to do before. The probability question was ridiculous and we never had something like that before either. I didn't find it a very fair assessment of what I knew. She should have admitted she missed printing a page with pertinent info.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was extremely knowledgeable and very receptive to student questions.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0more organized courses",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The teacher was terrible. YSPH is a small school but Claus is the epitome of \"large school prof.\" Non-responsive to e-mails, too busy to interact with students, shoved as much work as possible onto TA's laps. If the rest of my teachers were like her I wouldn't be returning next semester.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I found the course instructor, Dr. Claus, to be lackluster. She presented material in one way\/her way only. She was not very good at understanding where students' questions were coming from and she did not go out of her way to present material in different ways to address misunderstandings. Rather, she just kept repeating the one way she had already used to explain the material. In addition, she did not seem enthusiastic about meeting with students or willing to go out of her way to help students. She gave off the impression that she didn't want to be bothered by students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr Claus knows the topic too well, it is difficult for her to relate to students who do not grasp the topic.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus did an excellent job explaining the concepts in class and kept it interesting with her sense of humor and use of good, frequent example problems. My only suggestion, which is not directly related to Dr. Claus's teaching, is to have the course slightly later in the morning.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The professor did well despite the difficulty of the course material. Lecture notes were extremely hard to read especially if you missed class. I don't feel as though exams fairly assessed knowledge though. Simple answers were worth 10 points giving no room for credit for partial understanding. I also felt unfairly assessed on one of the midterm questions- was made to believe I over thought the answer and still feel as though my answer was more correct technically speaking yet received not even partial credit.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is a fantastic instructor. She is incredibly knowledgeable but is extremely approachable. She presented the material in a logical, easy to understand manner and constantly emphasized important content and key concepts throughout the semester. She also made sure class documents were posted promptly on classesv2 and was clear in any class emails. Dr. Claus also patiently answered any questions during office hours, even if that meant explaining a concept repeatedly. This was really appreciated! Lastly, I'm not sure if this was mandatory, but I really appreciated the fact that Dr. Claus sat through the midterm and final so that she could personally answer any questions. It is frustrating when professors write the exams and then leave TAs to field questions.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was obviously well-versed and familiar with all the material. Problems that were worked through in class were helpful for homework, SAS, and tests. Her notes were concise but easy to follow and reference if one had attended class. Overall a very good instructor."

    "a very useful course, especially the lab component gives us hands-on skills of SAS.",
    "I would say that this course provides all public health students with a foundation for understanding and performing basic, important statistical tests. The course consists of weekly lectures and periodic homework assignments and exams, complemented by a statistical programming lab. I would recommend this course to other students but would caution students who don't feel that statistics or math are their strengths that the course is quite challenging. I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "yes",
    "I was a HCM student so I would so dont take it, it isnt not that relevant for you.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It gave me confidence that I COULD DO statistics. I know have a deeper desire to keep studying statistics and how it applies to my future career.",
    "Very helpful - this will be a useful course throughout any public health career. it's relevant even to the other core courses you take first semester. Definitely recommended!",
    "I would recommend it because it sets the foundations of statistical tools we will have to use in the future.",
    "The course is a comprehensive look at the basis of biostatistics,and some of its purposes in public health. This course is essential to all public health students for the purpose of data management and analysis.",
    "Gives a nice overview of basic statistics (descriptive stats, statistical tests, etc) as well as an introduction to SAS. Recommended for introductory stats class.",
    "Good introductory statistics course. Provides a firm basis for statistical framework. Definitely recommend this course. Even with some statistical background, this course was very useful.",
    "A very basic statistics class accompanied by some training in SAS programming. I would recommend the lab, but not the lecture, to any student who has had statistics before. I would recommend both to any student who has not had statistics before because the content provided is a critical skill of public health.",
    "The course will provide you with a good introduction to statistics and SAS. I would recommend this course to another student because of its importance as a building block to the rest of our education at YSPH.",
    "Important tools for interpreting everything",
    "As it sounds - biostats + lab. Not thrilling.",
    "All responses were 'declined' as I was waived from taking this course by Elizabeth Claus.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I felt the material was presented very well and that the book and labs complemented lectures very well. I would definitely recommend this course since it was taught at a good pace and everything (book, lecture, SAS lab) built upon each other to really solidify subject material.",
    "A very useful course that teaches you the basics of biostatistics and SAS programming. I would recommend the class because it provides you with important statistical tools and teaches you a computer skill.",
    "It's a required course.",
    "This is a very useful fundamental course for public health students and the SAS lab is extremely helpful too.",
    "Very helpful, useful applications for later in life",
    "I would say it's not as bad as you would think it would be going into it, but make sure you read the text.",
    "Most difficult course of the term for me. Get a study group together at the beginning of the course to go over concepts and problems together. Go to office hours.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because it based course for many over courses.",
    "Yes, good course to take for basic statistical understanding but lacks structure compared to intro stats courses.",
    "Required class, so doesn't really apply.",
    "It is a good foundational course for learning the public health speak. I would recommend it as an overview course and not necessarily statistics details.",
    "It's a required course for all students, but YSPH needs to pay more attention to designing the course and selecting a professor who really engages students and cares about their learning. This is a required course for a reason... you really need to know statistical concepts in the field of public health. The class needs major improvements to really pump out great researchers and good public health professionals.",
    "Yes. Good basis for statistics.",
    "A somewhat confusing introduction to biostatistics.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who needs some basic training in biostats.",
    "Great foundation, linked to my other courses (epidemiology). Good introduction to SAS.",
    "Yes, because the workload isn't too bad and the material is very useful to know.",
    "Great course, you have to take it but it's good! You will come out on the other side with practical skills",
    "I would say the course is an intro to biostatistics going over the basics. I would recommend the course if the student enjoyed statistics.",
    "Good class, especially if you have never taken a Stats course. Very important material to learn for after graduation.",
    "It's useful if they have never taken statistics before. They should put more effort into learning SAS.",
    "The course provides a good introduction to SAS, but to enhance clarity\/organization of topics covered should definitely include text book and supplemental reading.",

    "The class is demanding though accomplishable.",
    "learned a lot",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course even to those who have taken a statistics class before.",
    "Yes- it really does help understand statistics.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it on the basis of statistics being an extremely enjoyable course, but it is valuable for anyone going into Public Health. Be sure to read the book, as the book is often more valuable than going to lecture (especially since lecture is at 8:30am...).",
    "This course is very helpful for students who do not have any background in statistics or just want to familiarize themselves with the use of SAS. However, if one has taken a course in statistics in college and had some rudimentary knowledge of SAS, I would recommend waiving this course.",
    "Yes, I think the material is very useful.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive, provision of SAS instruction, professor and TAs open to answering questions in class\/lab\/office hours, lab slides were detailed, SAS book very well writtenWeaknesses (suggestions in parentheses): lab homeworks that required SAS were extremely difficult and lengthy (the last set of lab homeworks took over 6 hours to complete and that was only half of the problem set)",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a lot of foundation for future epidemiological work.",
    "Painful. A requisite obstacle between where you are and want to be.Lab component is terrible, class is easy to get lost in. Find a study group to bounce questions off of. Grit your teeth and get through it, and, no matter what you think...you will get through it.",
    "The subject area of the course is very hard to follow, however this is a core course and many of us need I know the material. I would recommend that those taking the class should take advantage of office hours and complete assignments gradually.",
    "You may not enjoy every second of it, and stats can get a little tedious but it really is a useful class.",
    "Course providing an introduction to statistics and its applications in a public health setting",
    "It's a difficult, but manageable course. Stay on top of the labs and homework and you should be all right. Dr. Claus is a good instructor and you will learn a lot from her.",
    "It's useful, but prepared to work hard.",
    "I would recommend this course for another student. It provides a strong foundation for biostatistics.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",

    "good and useful",
    "No I would not recommend this course at all.",
    "This course is OK. It teaches the basics of biostatistics. It has some strengths. One strength is that the strategy to begin teaching programming in SAS is quite good and it combines the lab work well with the class work. However, there are some weaknesses. The overview decision tree that was given at the end of the course could have been given at the beginning of the course to refer to as we went along. Also, the homework questions are out of the book and are straightforward, while the test questions had twists and were tricky. It would be better to make the homework and the test questions more similar. In addition, Dr. Claus was pretty lackluster and not very good at figuring out how to explain the material in multiple ways to confused students.",
    "Good overview of Stats with a heavy focus on SAS",
    "This biostatistics course gives a good overview of basis statistics concepts and functions as well as an introduction to SAS.",
    "You don't have a choice but to take it. It's a lot of work but just make sure you take good notes because it will help a lot during the exams. Oh, and start the practice sets early!",
    "The structure of the course with the lectures, homework assignments, exams, and labs really helped drive home all of the important concepts. Having completed the course, I feel confident that I have mastered the major concepts and feel ready to move forward with new and advanced concepts next semester. I would recommend this course to any student looking to gain a solid understanding of intro biostats.",
    "Yes. Difficult material, but attend lecture do reading\/homework and you'll get through fine."
