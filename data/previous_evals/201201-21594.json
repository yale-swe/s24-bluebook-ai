    "definitely!!!!",
    "This class will convince you that the criminal justice system is totally messed up (biased, prejudiced, etc.). It's a good class to take if you're interested in law, and it's good for psych majors because there's not as much overlap as there is between many psych classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych and the Law to another student. You learn a TON about the justice system, and a TON about psych. It wasn't nearly as redundant as I was expecting it to be (as a psych major), and coming to class was actually really great. Definitely take this seminar with Lockhart if you can!",
    "This class was not a lot of work but was interesting. I knew very little about the legal system, and this class taught me tons. Psychology is surprisingly very important in the legal system. The class inspired me to look more into clinical psychology. The work was not very demanding, and the final paper was actually fun to write. I am glad that it forced me to go to court because I have had the experience and know just that much more about how the legal system works first hand.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone looking for an easy, fun course. There is not much work and the course material is very interesting and thought-provoking.",
    "Really good course. Professor Lockhart is excellent (and adorable, in her own way), and the material is fascinating (though it kind of makes you lose faith in our criminal justice system). I'd definitely recommend it. It was taught as a seminar this year, which I think made it particularly interesting: though the class was still primarily lecture-based, there were opportunities for discussion in almost every class, and we even got to do a few games. And going to the courthouse to observe trials for the final paper was a really cool experience. If you have any interest in law, this is a must!",
    "I really liked it as a seminar. We only had 13 thought questions, a paper, and a take home final.",
    "Fun and easy List A class for the Psych major. I really enjoyed attending court to observe a trial.",
    "This is one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. Definitely try to take it if it is offered in seminar format again (it used to be a lecture). Classes are fun, enjoyable and you learn a lot. The workload is low, weekly reading responses, a short final paper and a take home final. For the paper you go to the New Haven court to observe trials which is an amazing experience!",
    "You'll learn about the evolution of the court system in America as it relates to psychology. This year, it was a seminar which made it unique from past classes. We had weekly thought responses, a court observation to write about and relate to class material, and a take home final. The workload was not bad at all, but I'm pretty sure it was a more difficult class in lecture format. Also, Professor Lockhart is really a sweetheart. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "Take this class if you are a psychology major and have any interest in graduate school (other than Med. school).",
    "\"Psychology and the Law\" is an excellent course. The main star is Professor Lockhart: she is knowledgeable, passionate, and entertaining. The readings and the lectures are comprehensive, and the assignments ensure that you actively engage with the material. Although the course this year was meant to be a seminar, class discussion was limited; by using clickers and asking questions to students, however, Professor Lockhart guaranteed that students voiced their opinions throughout the course. I enthusiastically recommend this course to anyone interested in how psychological research can improve the legal system.",
    "You should take it because it's awesome.",
    "I really enjoyed Psych and the Law. Professor Lockhart is a really fun professor and the material is so, so interesting and important. You learn so much about police, arrests, the courthouse and legal system, and our prison system.There is not very much work at all; the weekly reading responses are not hard because the readings are short and super interesting. There is one really short paper (5 pages) that is based on observations from the New Haven courthouse, so that, too, was enjoyable. The take-home final was really time-consuming (as are all take home finals).",
    "easy course to get an A in. Just do what Lockhart tells you, and you're guaranteed an A. Interesting material, but the lectures aren't the best.",
    "Definitely recommend this class.",
    "This year's course was a little different because it was a seminar. The seminar execution wasn't exactly stellar, though, and it was basically a seminar-sized lecture with a little more talking. Prof Lockhart is crazy in a good way. She knows a ton, and the material is great."
