    "French 150 was a great class. The class was broken down into units, each of which included a grammar section, a reading, a movie, and a writing assignment. I think this organization really allowed students to improve all aspects of their language experience. My speaking greatly improved by discussing readings\/movies in class, and I became a lot more confident expressing my ideas. The two oral tests also really helped me, because it gave me the opportunity to speak for an extended period of time and practice my grammar usage and pronunciation. The writing assignments sometimes felt like a lot of work, but being able to do two drafts helped me understand my errors and avoid them in the future. I would definitely recommend this class to other students, especially with professor Schneider. She was so much fun, super dynamic, and really great at explaining grammar and engendering discussion. The class atmosphere was supportive and fun, and I really looked forward to class every day.",
    "Everything you'd expect in a language class. You need this to continue on into the French department.",
    "Summary: This class will whip your French into shape, there is a heavy emphasis on grammar, vocabulary, and verbal\/written expression. Interpretation and communication of original ideas are also big. Madame is engaging and expects you to work. The texts are for the most part enjoyable (and often humorous), the real challenge lies in the writing assignments. Again, thought, you want Madame as your professor, she is lovely and won't rest until you finally use pronominal verbs correctly! And she will make you laugh.Recommendation: You will need to work in this class. Hard. You won't get much out of it otherwise.",
    "I would recommend French 150 to another student. The course was challenging but in a very worthwhile way - I definitely noticed an improvement in my French reading, writing, and speaking skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Mme. Schneider is a such a great and lively professor; there'll never be a dull moment in the class! Though there are quite a number of essays and small writing pieces assigned, the workload is manageable. Homework varies from writing occasional essays to grammar exercises, to even watching movies, which is a great highlight of the class. I loved how we explored a whole variety of ways to learning French, including studying grammar, watching films, reading and analyzing plays and short stories, etc. This course offers a comprehensive look on grammar\/writing as well as on speaking; I definitely feel as though I improved in both by the end of the semester. If you love and want to improve your French, I would definitely suggest taking this course!",
    "I enjoyed this class. It is a lot of work, as language classes are. F Schneider is a good professor - she can be intimidating when you first meet her, but when you get to know her you discovered that she is very kind."
