    "Because of the tough-but rewarding-lists of readings I was bale to better analyze scholarly law and judicial articles and papers. Improve my writing organization and analytical skills 110%",
    "ENGL 114 with Robinson is a pretty straightforward academic writing workshop. Definitely learned how to build my collegiate writing skills, along with the interpretation of various judicial ruling and review documents (by virtue of the class's content).",
    "Beyond improving my writing skills, I really learned how to critically analyze the readings (i.e. pinpointing the thesis, questioning their analysis, and coming up with my own perspective).",
    "How to use footnotes, how to check out and return library books, how to use the writing center",
    "writing a research paper and close reading of supreme court cases",
    "Academic Writing, Bibliography, Thesis",
    "I learned quite a bit in this class about how to become a better writer."

    "Great professor, very engaging conversations, and rewarding lists of reading no complaints",
    "This class is a VERY helpful resource for improving writing. Also, it was super engaging in the beginning. However, as the semester proceeded, seminar discussions devolved into more lecture type classes. Not sure if this was the work of students losing interest or the professor feeling the need to guide us through more content (which was easier to understand than the earlier stuff). That's what I would say needs improvement.",
    "I felt Professor Robinson organized the class in a perfect manner. He made it easy to contribute to discussions while also informing students where they could improve.",
    "More feedback on how to enhance my writing in specific ways would be good. For example, it would have been nice to spend time experimenting with writing different types of captivating introductions, or to have fine tuned diction and sentence structuring. The focus on basic things like creating a thesis, arguing it, and concluding didn't feel like enough to significantly improve my writing. Working with the one theme become very boring after the second essay. This might not be a problem for students who get into a section about topics they are passionate about, but most people had to take whatever section they could get a spot in.",
    "Very loosely structured towards the end. Nice that you get to pick your own research topic for paper. Makes it more interesting. Professor talked about himself a lot during class and would get distracted from reading.",
    "Course is amazing. my favourite class at Yale. Requires Engagement and PRof Robinson makes it perfect.",
    "I think that the course is a bit too easy and unengaging. The reading are not engaged with quite enough although they are very high quality, and students can get away with not reading them."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend the course, the professor is awesome, engaging, funny--not one complaint",
    "I would recommend both 114 and this particular section because the material is usually engaging (at least in essay writing, which is important)",
    "If a student is looking to improve their writing, no better course to take.",
    "This class would be good for people who did not learn how to write well in high school. The way it is advertised as something every student should take is misleading because the class focuses on fundamental skills that many people already have.",
    "Yes, if you want a low pressure environment to explore research writing. First drafts are not graded, which takes the pressure off. Must be interested in the topic and willing to learn on your own.",
    "Yes it is an amazing class if one wants to pursue\/learn writing.",
    "I would if they're looking to improve their writing and aren't looking for an extremely difficult class."
