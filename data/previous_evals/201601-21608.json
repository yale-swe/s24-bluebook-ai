    "Great second half to 132. Definitely more workload but also more enjoyable.",
    "If you want to learn a language, you can just go online or something... but if you really want to learn what it means to be Chinese, please take this amazing class!",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to heritage speakers. Your reading and writing will improve by a ton, and you'll find yourself talking about complex issues such as politics and economics rather than just every day topics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to all heritage speakers. Honestly, even if they're above the 142 level I would still recommend they take it because of the amazing teachers and the great foundation they create. I would say this class is a lot of work though. Especially with some of the homework and the quizzes I felt like they weren't that helpful but all in all I definitely think it was worth it. I'm so sad to know that I won't be taking a class under these two teachers anymore and really think it is a shame if people don't get to take this class.",
    "Would thoroughly recommend taking the class with Professor Chan and Professor Liu. It is the best experience I have had with a language course because of the close class environment and effective teaching.",
    "CHNS 142 was an amazing course, and I'd recommend it to any heritage student. I have to admit, it's a bit of a jump from CHNS 132--CHNS 132 focused more on daily life and lifestyle vocabulary, while CHNS 142 focused more on politics and history of China so the vocabulary kicked up a notch--but it's a class worth the hard work and effort. Both Liu Laoshi and Chan Laoshi are amazing professors who care about their students, and I see them like Asian moms away from home. They're terrific professors inside the classroom, but will also make the effort to get to know their students outside the classroom, and genuinely care about how much sleep we're getting, if we're calling our parents, etc. The class itself is great, and it's easily one of my favorite classes this semester. We developed the vocabulary needed to converse in Chinese, about things like China's economy, unemployment rate, etc. and along the way, learned a lot about Chinese society in contrast to American society. A year ago, I started Chinese in college with a minimal understanding of the language, and I've learned so much after two semesters of Chinese. It's definitely a class worth taking."
