    "I worship Margaret Homans. She is so smart, and so committed to helping her students do better work and think more clearly. If you're a WGSS major, get psyched! If you're not and don't have any sort of background in feminist or queer thought, you might have some catching up work to do, but this course is also very applicable to the English and Literature majors. There are four papers in the class: 3 pages on some 18th or 19th century text, 7 page \"intellectual history\" page, 1 or 2 pages unpacking some dense theory essay, and an 8 page final relating the course materials to some current topic. Lots of reading, but you don't really have to do all of it. Homans doesn't grade based on class participation at all, which might be good or might be bad.",
    "yes yes yes. if you get the chance to take a seminar with professor homans, do it. you won't regret it. beyond that, this course is obviously required for the wgss major, but you get to really delve into some important literature in a really intensive setting.",
    "Yes, definitely. Feminist and Queer Theory was a wonderful course. The readings in the beginning bit of the semester are not entirely transformative--pre 19th century \"feminist\" thoughts are often difficult to find illuminating--but the majority of readings and writing assignments felt, to me, absolutely transformative. Quality of discussion varied--there were a lot of readings, sometimes it felt like a lot of the class hadn't completed them--but was often engaging, and Professor Homans is a wonderful instructor.",
    "Take this class! Go take it right now! You'll be so glad you did! It will change the way you think about the world.",
    "This is an incredible course. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It's certainly theory-heavy (there's very little fiction on the syllabus, unfortunately), but the readings are demanding and engaging. Professor Homans is brilliant and a marvelous seminar leader. This is, by leagues, the best course I have taken at Yale thus far.",
    "This class is a comprehensive survey of feminist, queer, and trans theory from the 18th century through modern theory.The class has a LOT of reading and covers a very wide range of texts and topics.Take it if you're interested in the syllabus and can set aside the time to read.",
    "A wonderful class. This course was difficult, intense, and thorough. I enjoyed coming to each and every seminar and diving into the material. I thought that the variety in the types of theory that we read, both in their message and in their structure, gave us a broad view of the material, and that the seminar discussions were controlled and effective.",
    "If you can get into this--which, if you're not a WGSS major, will be difficult--take it. It's an essential body of theoretical work, a whole world of intellectual history that will broaden your ability to engage with the humanities and the social sciences with an eye to perhaps the most powerful force of oppression existing. Sometimes classes are excellent, sometimes they're important. This one is both.",
    "This class was amazing! Everyone should take it, it really helped me understand issues and arguments in feminism and queer theory. The readings can be a bit long, but it is worth it. Prof. Homans is great, and classes were very engaging."
