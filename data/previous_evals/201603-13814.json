    "This course has evolved a lot since it was first proposed last spring. While it began as a capstone on informal and formal legal systems, conversations with the client quickly pushed the focus of the project from one topic to the next, without any clear objective at any given point.",
    "Group work. Understanding others' strengths and finding ways to delegate together according to strengths. Also compromising with people when you have differing ideas about the ways forward.",
    "This course was designed to be practical and hands-on. It gave us insight into teamwork and the sometimes frustrating aspects of having to deal with a client whose mind changes constantly or who gives unclear feedback."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were the leadership of our professor and the initiative of the fellow students in the group project. The weaknesses of this course was the utter lack of organization of our client and the subsequent lack of institutional guidance from the Jackson Institute.",
    "Strengths: Professor Cohen was great at navigating the many challenges thrown our way. Weaknesses: The client basically had no idea what he wanted, changed his mind several times about what he wanted, gave us a solution to a problem and basically asked us to justify it, all in all, global affairs needs to take a hard look at its capstone projects",
    "The capstone rides so much on your team and client. If you have a crappy client your project will be crappy. If your team is crappy you'll have a crappy experience. But it is also what you make of it. I had a great time and learned a lot about working with a group and with a vacillating client. i think it is unfair how little say we global majors have in choosing projects, considering how so many of us had focused on different areas of the world and had so many skill sets honed in on those areas...and how really none of those were used. It felt like we were training for this great project and then told JUST KIDDING DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE EVER SAID. But it was still a good learning experience and I am proud of our product",
    "The strength of this course was the people in it and our fearless leader, Professor Cohen. The weakness of this course was the actual set up of the capstone. This client should have never been engaged.",
    "If you get a good group, the capstone process can be a really great experience. Our group was fantastic and for the most part got along really well. Unfortunately the topics of this years capstones were centered around a theme that few people had any background knowledge in, and many of the projects weren't useful projects to be investing in, which made it less interesting and less enjoyable work.",
    "All in all, the capstone experience really depends on the strength of the project the client assigns. It's billed as a \"student-driven\" course, but in reality, it's a class that teaches you to respond to the needs of the client in question. As a result, the capstones really varied in caliber. For this particular capstone, I would recommend doing away with reading after the first few weeks and letting students get started on writing the paper sooner and doing their own research. Having to keep up with a full syllabus of reading was not useful after a certain point and detracted from time that could have been spent on research. In terms of evaluating the strengths\/weaknesses about the capstone program as a whole, I found that at the capstone presentations for Jackson at the end of the year, one of the projects that wasn't ours was particularly racially charged. I'm finding it hard to see why a group should have to assess the level of potential security threat that the Chinese diaspora community poses in Africa. Have Chinese diaspora communities traditionally maintained threatening ties with governments for the purpose of espionage\/eventually instigating revolt\/etc? Is there any reason to believe that the Chinese diaspora in Africa is doing so--have they demonstrated other suspicious activity besides just being there? I feel like the answer to both questions is in the negative, and it's about as ludicrous as trying to investigate whether American expats quietly starting their own businesses and non-profits in Africa are doing the same rather than just minding their own business (which, by the way, is far more likely, given America's colonial history.) That the group that was presenting ultimately came to the conclusion that OF COURSE the peaceful Chinese diaspora there wasn't doing anything of the sort does not exonerate the inane and inexplicable nature of the question itself. I understand the client drives the project, but Jackson should be responsible for vetting the types of projects it accepts with the knowledge that whatever values these projects ultimately espouse (and they will inevitably be normative) are a reflection of the institute as a whole. Speaking of vetting projects, it would probably be good for Jackson to ascertain the nature of the capstones it's handing to students beforehand. I understand that securing clients is partially a political matter, and I appreciate the work it takes to find people willing to work with college undergraduates, but we were handed the solution to the \"problem\" with which we were presented (policing in Liberia should be solved through micro-training) and basically asked to write a report that channeled none of our creativity or innovation in terms of solutions but simply left us parroting what the client wanted us to say. Perhaps this is a valuable lesson in real-world consulting - that the client will ultimately be the backseat driver - but while I think it's obviously important to take into account the feedback of our client, our team was asked to draw conclusion with which we were not entirely comfortable (we believe in micro-training less than the client himself). There was no problem-solving in this project at all. We just wrote exactly what we were told to write. As a result, some of the other projects that I felt created actual products were far more impressive than ours."

    "Professor Cohen did a great job of pulling together a capstone that was set up for failure. Despite being readily available to our calls, our client was disorganized in practice and in thought, and was unable to provide us with a coherent objective for our engagement. Despite the fact that most students were not inherently interested in the topic as it had changed, the students stuck through it and produced a product for the client. Ideally, the capstone should have set an objective at the very beginning of the course and worked on those deliverables throughout the entire semester. Instead, our capstone functioned more as a seminar, conducting readings and analyses for most of the semester, before beginning work on our capstone deliverables in the last few weeks.",
    "If you're a global affairs major you have to do a capstone, so get as much information as possible about the projects before you pick one. Also try and make the most of it by getting to know your group as well as possible, because regardless of what project you get it'll be so much better and easier if you are good friends with your teammates.",
    "Pick capstones carefully. Do your research ahead of time into the instructors who might lead the capstones and whether the client is returning or not. The quality of the capstones vary A LOT. Whether you will be producing worthwhile work will also vary a lot. I am pretty neutral about the capstone with the Department of Justice, primarily because the client was impossibly vague, erratic, indecisive, and told us what to write rather than having us create a product with which we could claim credit and about which we could genuinely be proud."
