   "comments": [
    "Before taking this course, I knew little about the history that brought the United States into the Iraq War in 2003. Given how seminal the Iraq War has been in the development of 21st century foreign policy, I felt my education as a Global Affairs major would be lacking without a thorough understanding of the country, its history in the region and in US and European foreign policy, and its prospects for the future. I feel this class provided me with the thorough understanding and stimulating discussion I craved on this topic.",
    "A stronger understanding of the Iraq Crisis, a passion for the study of the failing state and foreign interventions, and a depth of knowledge as to the Middle East's history.",
    "Before taking this course I had little knowledge about conflict in the Middle East. This course provided an invaluable foundation for the study of the Iraq crisis. I learned a great deal about the conflict from the 80s to the present day. The learning included an overview of sectarian conflict, the major players in the conflict, the history of the conflict, the actors, the U.S. involvement, and more. I am very appreciative of the knowledge this course has provided.",
    "This was incredible course. I learned so much about the Middle East and Iraq. I feel confident speaking about this country and Western intervention. Learning about the Gulf Wars is so important for understanding the regions and Western foreign policy. Perhaps, more important to learn of the history of Iraq since its creation by Britain. Though the region is so prominent in our politics, few understand what has happened there since the 1920s.",
    "I learned a ton from this course. Very detailed history of Iraq which encourages you to critically think about the factors that led to iraq's current state.",
    "I learned to fearlessly debate and speak my opinion during class, as well as the details of Iraq's government and the process by which the U.S. decided to go to war.",
    "This class taught me a lot about the history of Iraqi politics with respect to the US and the EU, the interrelated nature of politics in the region, the different approaches and priorities that countries had when considering the region, and the many, many mistakes that the US made. The student presentations were helpful in making us consolidate our thoughts on one text into a short presentation.",
    "I learned a great deal about the full spectrum of the Iraq War, in addition to a solid understanding of modern Middle Eastern geopolitics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings and discussions were a definite strength of the course. Readings were well-chosen, and not too long, so a majority of students completed all of the readings each week, ensuring stimulating discussion. Professor Howorth led seminar well, asking probing, difficult questions and engaging us in lively debate. The individual student presentations each week are a great structural component that allows each student to delve in to a particular topic, write a short paper and receive feedback to strengthen writing skills before the long paper, and have an opportunity to present to classmates--all valuable learning experiences. There is nothing that would make this class better.",
    "Awesome course! Howorth is a really good man, very thoughtful and caring, and the most approachable Professor I have had at Yale.",
    "The pace of the course was timed well. The material was always relevant and provided just enough depth without going overboard. The structure of the course was overall impeccable.",
    "Really incredible teaching and content. The syllabus was well-organized and seemingly comprehensive (Especially the bibliography). I wish there were more debate-like opportunities for the classroom. That class was very engaging. I think perhaps if there was a participation grade, more individuals would come prepared to class and actively engage.",
    "It's a great class! I think if Prof. Howorth gave a longer overview each course, it could be improved a little.",
    "The discussions all passed through Professor Howorth, which was a bit irritating since we didn't get to actually have rigorous debates much of the time. In addition, only a handful of students seemed to have regularly done all the reading or know much about a given day's topic. This meant that a lot of the comments were repetitive or predictive of what the professor wanted to hear or approved of people hearing about. In that respect, I guess the class relies on a good group of students to make it engaging. What was great about this class was Professor Howorth himself, who is incredibly knowledgeable about all things France-, US- and Middle East- related, and the guest speakers who came.",
    "Incredible course. Well structured, taught and delivered. Howorth is engaging, extremely knowledgable and funny."

    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another Yalie. It's a wonderful time, Professor Howorth is a fabulous professor, and you learn so much about an incredibly important topic.",
    "Absolutely! Would highly recommend, as Howorth is a wonderful Professor!",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to another student.",
    "An excellent class- would definitely recommend. Beware that most seats are filled in pre-registration since the class is cross listed in 2 or 3 departments. The work is the most reasonable of any seminar I've taken. In a day or dedicated afternoon you can usually cover all of the material. Most people did most of the readings and you have to do discussion points 4 times that encourage you to. Great class, great discussions, take it!",
    "Absolutely. This is the best class I have yet taken at Yale. I learned so much, Howorth is brilliant, and the content is extremely important and interesting.",
    "Yes, you gain a great deal of knowledge and debate various perspectives.",
    "This class was great! I learned so much.",
    "Fantastic course. Would unequivocally urge fellow students to take it. Every citizen of the US should know everything we learned in this course. Howorth is the man.",
    "It's hard to overestimate the significance and impact of the Iraq war on U.S. politics. I came in knowing next to nothing about the war and left the class with a solid understanding of Iraqi history, the U.S.'s ever changing relationship to the Middle East, and geopolitics in general.",
    "Yes! Take it if you are interested in political science, human rights, international relations, Iraq and the Middle East, or the US's continued general fuckery in less globally influential regions of the world. Solid EP&E or political science seminar. Very eye-opening if you don't know a lot about Iraq's history (British, French, and US's role in shaping Iraq's politics and state, Saddam, international sanctions, invasion, post-conflict politics, etc.).",
    "Absolutely!"
