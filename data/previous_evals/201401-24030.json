    "I think there could have been more work to promote student engagement and a more seminar style course rather than lectures. For example if instead of presenting our group's progress in powerpoints to the whole class, if we divided up into groups with reprentatives from each group to talk and learn more about the other projects I think this would have been more engaging and less repetitive.",
    "It was far too disorganized. We didn't get a syllabus until the third week, and even then, everything changed. I wish we had a textbook or set of readings that we were actually incentivized to read. Computers should be banned in class or people will be constantly checking their email, which happened constantly. Also, it would be great if we were arranged in a circle to help class discussion. The professors seemed distant, disengaged, and unmotivated to actually lead discussion. No one seemed to know what was happening at any given time. The fundraiser was such a nightmare of an organizing\/coordinating endeavor but thankfully it went off well. Most of all, I wish the professors would lecture more or engage us in class as opposed to constantly having guest lecturers who varied in quality. Think we should have a final paper about Haiti in addition to the final project -- there was very little work for the class, and I think some extra vigor would improve it quite a bit."
