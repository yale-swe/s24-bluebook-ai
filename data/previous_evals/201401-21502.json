    "A challenging class, but pretty worthwhile. Chances are, you're taking this class because it's required for your major. If not, you can definitely find easier classes to take just for fun. But Dan Speilman is awesome and enthusiastic and he really cares about the class. The psets are hard, but not nearly as bad as 223\/323 assignments and they're graded pretty leniently. The no-collaboration policy on assignments seems obnoxious at first, but by the time exams came around, I really appreciated how comfortable I felt writing proofs on my own. I would say that this class is like going to the gym: it's hard, it can be painful at times, but you come out feeling fantastic and you might even begin to enjoy it.",
    "no collaboration policy really ruins the class-- some follow, other's don't. net effect: less learning is done. content is incredibly interesting. 1st half better-taught than the 2nd.",
    "Take it if you're into solving problems, doing proofs or just learning how to do practical things like sorting, distributing jobs, etc in very efficient manners. I am very glad that I took this class.",
    "If you are a CS major you must take this class. But even if you are not but vaguely interested in the subject, you should definitely take the class. It is very well taught. Professor Spielman is definitely prepared and prepared to teach a lot of interesting things at that.",
    "Algorithms is a great course for anyone interested in Computer Science with a strong quantitative background. I now have a much deeper understanding of how think about CS problems rigorously. I took it without having taking 223, and was totally fine. The material is fascinating, the problem sets are interesting, and Dan is a great lecturer. The no-collaboration policy on homework may be frustrating at first, but you get used to it after a couple weeks. Overall the problem sets are perfectly manageable as long as you start early. I only wish I had taken the class earlier!",
    "Required if you're a CS major, though it's a class that would be interesting even if you're not in CS. Pretty fun stuff and curves seem pretty generous.",
    "Proof-heavy. Reasonably graded. No collaboration. Lots of cool things to learn. Really hard.",
    "If you are ok with proofs and math, I recommend this course absolutely. If you are, it's not as hard as people say at all.",
    "An interesting survey of algorithms. The problem sets are very challenging, and Dan's \"no collaboration\" policy seems to have gone disregarded by most of the students.",
    "Great class. You learn a lot, you practice proof writing, you get better at approaching problems and at thinking of them in general.",
    "TOUGH CLASS YO, you will have to work hard but it's pretty awesome what you end up doing, looking back it was a really cool class.",
    "Algorithms is an awesome class that I highly recommend. I will be going to medical school next year, and I found the material interesting and the class experience very enriching. My mathematical reasoning skills definitely improved through this course. At the same time, I took this course Credit\/D\/Fail, which eliminated a lot of the stress that could otherwise have been in the course. For one who had little proof experience going in, the level of mathematical rigor required was a little high at first, but settled down quickly as I learned more. This semester I felt the grading on the problem sets was fairly easy, as so many students were enrolled. Overall, this was an intellectually satisfying course, and I highly recommend it. I don't know about the practicality of the algorithms taught here, but you will certainly come away prepared to start reading some algorithms literature.",
    "365 is a very hard class however it is the most rewarding class I have taken at Yale. You have probably heard that no collaboration is allowed on anything, which means that you and you alone will have to struggle your way through the problem sets. If that scares you away, then the class probably isn't for you, however if you do the work you will learn an amazing amount about algorithms\/problem solving\/thinking outside the box and it is completely worth it. There are weekly problem sets that take anywhere from 5 to 25 hours depending on how soon you get the epiphany, a midterm and a final. The exams are fairly easy, most of the problems are straight out of lecture\/the book. If you are a CS major you will be taking this class but for anyone else who is interested in algorithms I highly highly recommend this class.",
    "If you love theoretical mathematics, go for it. Otherwise, absolutely not. I'm good at computer science, and at math, but this course ruined my semester. I didn't enjoy the material, didn't feel it was applicable to my interests, and had a really hard time with the time commitment. I would sometimes spend hours on a problem set without making any progress. It's the first course at yale that I've ever struggled just to try to pass -- otherwise I average As and high Bs in all my other subject areas. This class honestly made my entire semester pretty miserable academically. The TFs didn't even always know the answers to problem sets when I went it at office hours. Unfortunately I think this class could be fine if Yale would allow the Comp Sci department to hire more teaching fellows to provide more support to students, but there were simply almost no opportunities to ask questions about any of the material to anybody. So if you didn't understand it the first time, there was no way to get help.",
    "Absolutely - as a non-CS quant major loved the class. Intuitive and interesting!",
    "If you're doing CS, you have to take it, so it's moot. If you're looking to take it otherwise, it's rewarding but demanding in the way 223 or 323 is, but with pen-and-paper proofs instead of programming. (There's no programming in 365.)",
    "Great class. Hard class. One week I spent 12 hours thinking about a problem set and still wasn't able to find solutions to all the problems. But it is a truly great moment when, after having thought about a problem for several hours, you have some insight that allows you to pull the whole thing together. The material is fascinating. If you are a CS major you'll take it any way. If you are thinking of taking it as a math\/related discipline major, I would recommend it provided that you are willing to spend the time and thought to have certain hard but concise problems cycling at the back of your head as you go about your daily life.",
    "This is also a CPSC requirement, but it is excellent with Professor Spielman. The lectures are incredibly interesting, and so are most of the homework problems. CPSC223 and discrete math are both listed as prerequisites, but I only took discrete math and I took 223 concurrently, and they turned out to be fairly good complements of each other. You don't really need 223 if you know the basic data structures, but you probably need 244\/CPSC202 to have a good grasp on graph theory.",
    "This is the best CS lecture you will take. Period. Professor Spielman is such a clear and engaging lecturer and explains abstract concepts really easily, in such a way that we can get an intuitive grasp easily. The problem sets are very challenging until you have your \"oh duh\" moment of inspiration but extremely rewarding nonetheless.",
    "This class is terrific: take it even if it's not required. Problem sets are difficult but worthwhile, and lectures are something to look forward to. This class will not be the easiest you've ever had (although don't let that scare you away--it's totally doable if you put the effort in) but it will be worth it.",
    "Take it! It's really great. Don't be scared of the HW- they are really fun!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this, for ANYONE interested in mathematically-oriented problem solving, CS major or not. This class was difficult but extremely fulfilling, and I really feel like I learned a substantial amount. Make sure you give yourself a few days to figure out each problem set, but the workload is definitely manageable, and Spielman is wonderful. A great class overall.",
    "If you're a computer science major, you need to take this class. If you're not a computer science major, it's still a great class to take. It's essentially a \"math\" class; there's no coding involved. I actually enjoyed that\u2014it really forced me to think about the algorithms themselves rather than their implementation.",
    "Be warned, 365 is a ton of work and a ton of time. Spielman's psets are hard and hellish, and will keep you up for hours the night before they are due, so start early! But in the end, despite cursing the class thousands of times throughout the semester, I realized I learned a ton. Spielman's lectures weren't my favorite, but it's easy to follow along with the book as he keeps with it fairly closely. Tests are easy to prepare for, he gives you three problems\u2014at least two of which are from class\/book\/pset verbatim or slightly altered.",
    "CPSC 365 was a very good class. It covers all the basic algorithms that a computer scientist should know. Also, it forces you to design algorithms for new problems and write proofs for the correctness and running time of the algorithms you design. You'll get much better at writing proofs for the correctness of algorithms, and much better at designing algorithms in general. The material taught in CPSC 365 is widely applicable in many fields. It's really a class on efficient problem solving.",
    "Take it if REALLY interested in algorithms.",
    "CPSC 365 is one of those must take courses at Yale. Professor Spielman is a great lecture and an expert in the field. We learned greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, flow, NP-Hard problems, approximation algorithms, and randomizated algorithms. The problem sets were challenging (between 10 - 20 hours per problem set) and usually came out in a frequency of one per week. START EARLY. DO NOT WAIT TILL THE LAST MINUTE. The problems often require \"Ah ha!\" moments where you realize the structure of the problem. As one former TA put it, it takes a little bit of magic to do the problem sets, and magic takes time. If that advice is followed (and you are not taking too tight a course schedule), the problem sets are decently managable. Overall, the course is excellent and highly recommended!",
    "Really tough problemsets, but the class itself was awesome and interesting. I learned a lot, but didn't have the prereqs. Take Credit\/D if you can.",
    "A difficult class. Im sure you're taking it because you have to.",
    "This course definitely will teach you something new about thinking about problems and how to solve them. It'll be interesting, for sure, if you like puzzles or computer science even a little bit. If you take it Credit\/D, you won't worry. Now... if you're taking it for a grade. Be prepared - the difficulty of the psets and the exams has varied over the last few years. This year, the psets were harder (especially towards the beginning) and the exams were \"easy\" (well, they COULD be easy - you have to memorize everything from the book that was assigned, or else you might get screwed. But, you didn't have to be creative on the test, like on the psets). If you want to follow Spielman's no collaboration policy for the psets, you're going to have to start them really early. This is how you can get the most out of the course.. but of course, most people don't follow the policy. Psets are hard! I took this class Credit\/D and I'm not a CS major - I don't regret it, I learned a lot and expanded how I think about problems - but I wish I'd read the textbook sections before coming to class so I could follow lecture better!",
    "Definitely recommend for anybody interested in CS or Applied Math.",
    "Interesting material, but difficult problem sets. The beginning half of the course was much more difficult than the latter half, so stick with it! Also I strongly disagree with his no-collaboration on psets policy.",
    "If you're a Computer Science major or an Applied Math major, definitely take this course. It's difficult, but extremely important. The problem sets can be time consuming, but the concepts are interesting, and the exams are always fair and much easier than the problem sets. Dan is a great professor, and he really cares about the material, but be warned there is a no collaboration policy, so when you get stuck on a problem set things can get difficult. Overall however, it's a great course, and definitely less work than 223 or 323.",
    "Absolutely. This is a great, manageable math\/cs class that makes you think. Dan Spielman is PHENOMENAL- smart, young, energetic, and friendly. A must-take (literally and figuratively) for math and cs students.",
    "Sure, this is a pretty solid class. Its a pretty big lecture, and the lectures are generally interesting and tend to the easier side as far as math goes. The problem sets also vary sporadically in difficulty (he tries to make them harder in the beginning and then get easier), but are pretty interesting and a good learning tool. The problem sets are where most of the work is since the exams are so easy. You definitely cover all the big bases in algorithm theory, and the class is definitely enhanced by having taken discrete math and\/or 223 before it. My only regret is not having made the effort to reach out to Spielman \/ try to learn more from him one on one through office hours, etc. He is legendary in his field of research.",
    "This is a math class. Be aware of that going in. There's no programming, no discussion of implementation, very little on actual computing. You design and analyze algorithms as mathematical concepts. That said, it's interesting, and has a lot of necessary concepts, and Prof. Spielman is a passionate teacher. If you lose track of lecture for a second though, you're totally lost for the rest of class. P-sets can be frustrating because there's no way to know if you're following the wrong path for hours at a time. But when you get it, it's incredibly satisfying.",
    "Anyone even remotely interested in the subject should definitely take this class The lectures are very interesting. The problem sets, while occasionally frustrating, are very rewarding when you get the answer. And the exams are very manageable.",
    "It's a good class, well taught but very challenging psets. The book is also decent...",
    "If you are considering taking CPSC 365, you are a Computer Science major and thus, you will have to take the class. In terms of workload, 365 is not as bad as 223 and 323. So, if you are used to setting aside some time for problem sets, 365 will not be a problem. The lecture topic (algorithms) will be a hit or miss, but is generally useful to know for CS majors. The problem sets are hard and collaboration is not allowed, so expect some headache and late nights trying to solve the requisite 3 out of 4 problems on the problem set.",
    "Interesting class to learn about various algos. Some nightmare psets. Easy exams",
    "take it if you love math trivia\/proof based classes. but by no means take this if you'rel ooking for a gut.",
    "This is a fundamental course in theoretical computer science... There's no programming involved which might seem odd as compared to other schools' algorithms courses. This is really a fundamental analysis of algorithms course. It is very mathematical and definitely requires 244 beforehand! I would recommend it, but be prepared for tough tough course material.",
    "This is a great course, but it is incredibly time consuming and difficult. Expect 20+ hours on psets.",
    "The course is a an overview of many of the standard algorithm's and types of algorithms that are foundational for modern algorithms. The course is approached from a mostly theoretical standpoint, meaning little in the way of coding and mostly proofs. There is also a brief foray into complexity theory.",
    "Algorithms is an interesting and rewarding class, but it is a lot of work. The psets take time, and definitely should be started early. The no collaboration policy (which most but not all adhered to, as far as I could tell) is frustrating at first, but after you get the hang of the psets, they were more rewarding as a result. This semester Professor Spielman made the first 3 psets much more difficult than they have been in past semesters, and as a result many students got discouraged early on, but true to his word, the difficulty level didn\u2019t ramp up after that and I think the later psets were actually easier. Lectures are usually interesting but sometimes slip into detailed mathematical proofs, which was frustrating to the more CS-minded people in the class, and probably fascinating for the more mathy people. Not as much time as 323, but the 9 psets probably averaged about 8-12 hours each, and could have been more if I hadn\u2019t started as early. The biggest fault of the class is that the TAs aren\u2019t allowed to be particularly helpful with psets, and there aren\u2019t enough of them so it can be extremely hard to get individual help.",
    "365 is a great part of the CS curriculum, it requires a lot of work but is great. You learn a huge amount about algorithms but spend lots of time working on Psets. This is a really rewarding class that I would recommend even to non CS majors.",
    "Worth taking, but a difficult course. The lectures are interesting but may take some time to sink in. For hw, make sure you set aside plenty of time and start early, even if that means just reading the problems. I really struggled at first, needing all-nighters for 3-4 of the early psets. And the TAs were absolutely no help (they're not allowed to help you, more or less). But don't worry, it gets better! For me at least, the second half of the course was very manageable.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. There's no way to get help with the no-collaboration policy, so prepare for some late nights working on problem sets alone in the library.",
    "Very difficult but worthwhile. Teaches you how to think and work for hours on seemingly impossible problems. There is a no collaboration policy but very few people actually follow it. Spielman is a genius (literally) and it's cool to watch him lecture and make problems. You should have a strong math\/proof background to take this course. Only basic coding skills needed."
