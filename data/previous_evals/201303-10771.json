   "comments": [
    "Good class for learning Chinese. A lot of daily work, but you will learn a lot. I recommend it.",
    "Great class. A lot of work, but the teachers really care and it didn't feel like a ton of busy work. Take if you want to learn Chinese.",
    "Chinese 110 is, if you are willing to put in the work, possibly one of the most rewarding classes at Yale. The gains are easily measurable in how fast you speak, your tones, and simply your vocabulary. However, if you don't have time to dedicate to this class, don't take it because it takes a lot out of you in return for giving you fantastic language skills.I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class, because it has been a great experience learning Chinese, and as many times as I wanted to quit, I didn't and it has been completely worth it.",
    "Chinese L1 is a fantastic class. The sections are really small (like 10 people), and teachers rotate, so you get four slightly different accents and manners of speaking, and all of the sections in the class go at the same speed and cover the same amount of material. You cover a lot of Chinese in the semester. It is really easy to contact any of the teachers or your tutor about questions in the course. The Chinese 110 teachers obviously really know what they're doing.",
    "This is a great class, and you will learn more than you would have believed possible. However, you are going to need to dedicate a lot of time if you want to be successful. Taken in tandem with other hard classes, giving this class the time it requires can be a struggle.",
    "i would recommend this class to a fellow student because the way it is taught enables the most novice of Chinese students to pick up on the language. There is a lot of work but at the end it will be worth it.",
    "If you want to learn Chinese, there is no better or more enjoyable way to do so with Yale's intro Chinese classes. The professors are kind, sweet, and extremely helpful. Go to their office hours! There's about an hour of daily work with some extra time for studying.If you're on the fence because of the workload, just take the class. It's amazing.",
    "That it is tough, and the work load is a lot. You will have to commit to putting a lot of time in, but you will see an enormous pay off if you do.I would recommend this class because all of the stress over the work winds up being completely worth it when we realized we can really speak quite a bit of Chinese after only four months. I loved the small sections and the relationships I made with my classmates because of that as well.",
    "I would entirely recommend this class to anyone with the will and desire to learn Chinese. It is difficult and a lot of work, but extremely rewarding.",
    "I would tell others to proceed with caution. Chinese is by no means an easy language and the course is fast paced. Students should shop the class and see whether they like it or not. It starts easy and gets a lot harder",
    "Oh my goodness, most fun class I've taken this semester! The instructors are super friendly and encouraging, and they are very effective teachers. After only a month in class, all my native Chinese-speaking friends were amazed at how I spoke! Yes, of course you will need to put the two hours every night to memorize some characters and vocab, but it's not that bad and can even be fun. Just make sure you don't get behind on what you need to learn each night, because catching up is a pain. Additionally, try not to sign up for TA tutorial on Monday; you'll need to memorize a dialogue every week for both an in-class presentation and for your tutorial and usually in-class presentations land on Monday (don't want to be doing two in one day!).tl;dr: Take this class and you will be bewildered at how much Chinese you'll learn. There will be no regrets.",
    "Chinese L1 is a great class! Definitely take it if you are committed to learning Chinese. It takes a large amount of time, but it is totally doable and totally worth it."
