   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Arch 232 to any student interested in pre-Columbian history of South America.",
    "This class is a great class to take if you find archeology or south america interesting. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would, and have, recommended this class to other students. It was very interesting and the professor and TA made it so that it was manageable with a heavy course load, which I think is valuable in a class.",
    "This was a great 5th class. It's low stress and you learn a lot about a really interesting subject. It really sweeps away the notion that the Andes are just Inca. The history of the region is incredibly rich. I really want to go to Peru. In fact, taking this class qualifies you to receive money to research some Andean sites (or something like that).",
    "Yes I would. It's a fun, not too difficult course on a part of the world we often overlook. good change of pace.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn more about the Andes and the civilizations that preceded the Incas.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student, even if you are not an anthropology major. I found the subject material very interesting and the class always enjoyable.",
    "This is an introductory level anthro class, so no history with the subject matter is expected. I knew nothing about Peru at all before the class, and left being extremely fascinated with the culture. Take this class if you have a chance!",
    "definitely take it. It is interesting and not too much work",
    "A not too difficult class on a really interesting subject. Professor Burger is a great lecturer.",
    "Very interesting",
    "It's a gut, and a really interesting one. The reading is easy and you learn a lot of crazy stuff about reconstructions of temples, piles of gold, mummy bundles, ancient fishing tools, llama herding, chicha beer factoring into pretty much every religious and cultural ceremony everywhere, and and trophy heads worn as belts. It's an easy class, Burger is an eclectic guy (like many archaeologists), and it's overall totally doable and enjoyable. A good fifth class.",
    "Overall, I would say this class is a good class to take if you are trying to fulfill some kind of requirement. I took it to fulfill the Archeology requirement for the Anthropology major, for instance. It's an interesting class, a bit boring at times. It is not a huge lecture, which is nice. A midterm and a final, the final was definitely harder than the midterm.",
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in pre-Inca cultures rather than the Inca.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys history, archaeology, or the subject of Latin America. However, for people who don't have interests in any of these areas the class may be boring.",
    "This is great class if you're interested in Andean civilizations. It is being taught by the best authority on the subject matter, so rest assured that you will be receiving the best education in the material possible.",
    "This class is great if you're looking for something generally easy but still interesting. If you want to do really well, you'll need to study hard for the tests because there WILL be students who know everything, but otherwise it's pretty easy. The reading is usually unnecessary; Professor Burger knows more than any of those authors anyway, and he usually gives his opinions of the other archaeologists in class. Professor Burger himself is a funny guy with lots of anecdotes, so lecture is enjoyable. Pay attention in class and take good notes, and you'll already have done most of the work you need to do. Don't miss class, but don't worry about the reading.",
    "I thought this class was OK. It wasn't too challenging but I found classes generally a little dull and repetitive and the final rather unfair."
