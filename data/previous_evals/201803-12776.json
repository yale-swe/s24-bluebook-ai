    "Urban planning, policy, zoning",
    "I learned more about the field of urban planning and how it applies to climate adaptation and resilience at the state\/local level.",
    "I learned a moderate amount about what planning techniques and strategies available to plan development that incorporates a range of environmental concepts. I appreciated the speakers from different organizations who visited to explain their roles in the planning world.",
    "Knowledge about all parts of land use planning that spanned a range of topics I was previously unaware of.",
    "Practical knowledge of how people in the land use and planning field approach their work and the accompanying problems. A lot of how things work and the steps that people need to take to get things done.",
    "Learned a good deal on a wide variety of different land use topics, some more relevant to me and others less so",
    "The course was a nice overview of general land management practices, zoning, and stakeholder engagement",
    "I learned what planners do and the methods they use to do it. I also learned a bit about how policy goes through local governments and how it shapes actions on the ground.",
    "Learned about the environment's relationship with land use planning, community development, energy siting, economic decision-making. Key insight I gained was how many stakeholders are involved in community decision-making, and how complex and time-consuming the approval process can be for these decisions.",
    "This class had interesting content, but was challenging to engage with because of the lecture-only style"

    "100%",
    "It met my expectations.",
    "I was expecting a deeper level of detail about planning techniques. But the time constraints of the class prevented me from learning anything but a general level of knowledge.",
    "They aligned with my expectations.",
    "I really enjoyed learning from people in their fields and hearing about what they did as part of their jobs, especially when it concerned New Haven. I had no particular expectations for this class other than to hear from professionals about their work, and that was definitely met.",
    "Learned as much as I would expect to learn! It was a good seminar and some solid speakers",
    "Well",
    "Fairly well. I am looking forward to exploring these topics more in depth because this course really was only able to scratch the surface.",
    "It aligned pretty accurately.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There were a few classes where there might have been too much content for the time allotted, but this improved over the course of the semester. A strength was the guest speakers represented really cool case studies from the region!",
    "Might be useful to have a weekly discussion post on each week's topics to keep students engaged and also solicit ideas and perspectives from other students.",
    "A strength of the class is hearing from all of the great speakers filling different planning roles at different interesting organizations. Weaknesses of the class were that sessions were very short and felt rushed. There was little time for speakers to dive into much detail and almost no time for questions.",
    "Strengths of this course were the variety of speakers brought in. No weaknesses.",
    "The strengths are that there are so many guest lecturers, which was really amazing and I learned a lot from them. It was also a very doable amount of work for a one credit course, which my schedule appreciated. I have no complaints about the course.",
    "Not sure how much it could be improved? It hits on a lot of topics so not necessarily easy. It does end up running up against the clock quite a bit!",
    "I like the variety of topics. I could have used more class exercises to keep me engaged",
    "Strengths: We heard from practitioners! I loved the guest speakers. Weaknesses: This class seemed too spread out. The classes didn't really connect to one another and 50 minutes each week didn't seem like long enough for the class to seem real. I think it'd be better if this one credit course was a more intensive half semester course. I also think it should be 1 hour instead of 50 minutes. The readings were not that engaging.",
    "Strengths: great to have a practitioner teach the course - good to have real-world insights conveyed through the class Weaknesses: I was unengaged by some of the guest speakers. I enjoyed the energy-focused speakers, but found some of the others less relevant to my personal interests.",
    "I don't think this course is necessary, and should not be a prerequisite for the clinic"

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in the Land Use Clinic. It is a prerequisite for the course.",
    "Prepare to learn a basic amount regarding a wide range of topics in the environmental planning arena. But don't expect to get too much detail about any one topic.",
    "Speak with Jessica outside of class, she has a lot of great insights you can take advantage of!",
    "Know that you will not have to do a lot of work for it but it will be interesting and practical for looking at land planning and thinking about issues that relate to land use in other courses.",
    "Take it if you're interested in land use. Energy folks should definitely explore this space, but not moving too far into it!",
    "This will be a basic course with few deep dives.",
    "This class is low commitment and covers a wide range. If you are at all curious about land use planning in the US, take this class. If you know you want to go all in, know that this course is merely an introduction and will be far from sufficient on its own.",
    "Worth taking if deciding whether to join the land use specialization, or take the land use clinic. Other students may not get too much out of it otherwise.",
    "If you are interested in urban and land use issues this is a great seminar to take. We have very engaging presentations throughout the semester.",
    "Fine for a 1 credit class"
