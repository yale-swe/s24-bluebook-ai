   "comments": [
    "Strengths: we meet every day, its almost impossible to not make substantial progress. Michael Farina is an amazing, engaging, exciting teacher who cares deeply about each of his students and their progress.",
    "The course is well designed for students' learning. The tests are frequent but highly predictable and related to what we are studying, and Prof. Farina is very eager to help. Class is fun, because we are constantly discussing and watching films, reading literature, and being exposed to other aspects of Italian culture.",
    "My professor (Michael Farina) had a quiz every day in the class which ensured that I studied every night, not just before the exams, which helped keep my engagement high. The pacing was brisk but not overly fast which kept me both challenged and engaged. Additionally missing a class for being sick was understandable and the professor helped us get back on pace with the rest of the class as quickly as possible.",
    "Strengths: Michael Farina, clear expectations, very manageable workload, class becomes close Weaknesses: would say to spend less time on textbook exercises and more time speaking or reading other things",
    "The strength of this course is the pressure placed on students to speak only Italian in combination with the low stakes non-competitive atmosphere Michael has cultivated; if a student does make an error, it is easily laughed off and not a big deal. Nonetheless we are pressured to try again until we are correct. I have seen no weaknesses.",
    "Great course."

    "Yes, especially with Prof. Farina. He makes the class very fun and relaxed while still facilitating maximum learning.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student as in addition to learning another language which I always find rewarding, I've made a good number of new friends with all sorts of different backgrounds that I never would have gotten to know without taking this class.",
    "YES, especially with Michael Farina. It was a great class to come to every day with a group of students you bond with, the language is fun, and the work is easy to keep up with.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to other students. It is stimulating, challenging, fun, and a great way to forge closer relationships with classmates and your professor.",
    "Yes, awesome class."
