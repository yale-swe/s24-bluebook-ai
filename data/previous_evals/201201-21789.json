    "This is a great class. We learned a lot about signals and system control (though I wish we'd had time to do more). If your scared about taking this class, don't be. Professor Narendra tailors the class to suit the students taking it. Make sure to have taken or be taking differential equations. Also, the psets are biweekly, so it's tempting to fall behind on the material, but don't. Also you DO NOT need to buy the book. I didn't, and the one time I needed it the professor lent me his.",
    "It is a class with very hard material. To understand it you really have to put in a lot of effort. On the bright side there were bi weekly psets which was nice.",
    "This is a fantastic course that gives you a very solid theoretical foundation in signals and signal theory. You may have learned about Z-transforms, Laplace transforms, and Fourier transforms in other classes, but in this class, you learn about them in full detail and learn how you can apply them to system analysis. You also learn about very important tools in analyzing the stability of a system, such as the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, the root locus method, and the Nyquist criterion. Problem sets can be a bit long and challenging, but Prof. Narendra is fairly flexible and is accommodating to busy schedules. Prof. Narendra knows the material VERY VERY well and has a DEEP understanding. However, in class, if you do not ask questions or stop him and ask him to clarify things, he will sometimes end up talking to himself for an entire class period (he tends to not look at his students to see if they are following). However, when you ask questions, he is never annoyed or frustrated, but he will then explain things more clearly and in more detail. Sometimes he skips details assuming they are obvious to us when they are not, so if you are confused, just ask him questions, and he will then go into more detail. You definitely do not need to purchase the textbook for this class. At every class,Professor Narendra gives you a typed copy of his lecture notes. These notes are very clear, very concise, and very detailed, showing derivations and explanations for everything. By just reading all his lecture notes, you will gain a very good understanding and will be able to do the problem sets. In rare occasions, there may be a few things not explained or not clear enough in his notes, and in such cases, you can always find supplemental material online, or you can go talk to him in his office. I feel like this class should be required for the electrical engineering major (though it should be a year-long course). The material is challenging, and there are some topics (especially root locus) for which you really need to sit down and read Prof. Narendra's notes very carefully, think through everything slowly, and ask questions \/ search online if you are confused. It is unbelievable that engineers have developed all these techniques to analyze systems. I found this course very eye-opening, and it deepened my appreciation of electrical engineering.",
    "Good course following 202. More theoretical than 202 and more math intensive, but interesting material.",
    "its a tough course , manageable",
    "EENG310 is a great course in which you will learn a lot about stability theory and transforms. It would be good if you have some prior understanding of Furier and Laplace transforms or be willing to keep up with the fast pace of the course. The exams aren't easy and the psets take quite an amount of time (though are due every two weeks which was good). The final was really tough and worth a substantial part, so be prepared! You will be lucky that Zhuo, the former TA, left after this semester -- so make sure that the new TA gives you pset solutions on time and returns your graded work too!"
