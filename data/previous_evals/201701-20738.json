   "comments": [
    "Thanks to our broad, wide-ranging reading list, I know now a little bit about a lot of things. The course synthesized the concrete details and histories we read and discussed, but it also taught us how to analyze popular history books from both a writing and a content perspective.",
    "I learned SO MUCH taking this seminar!!!! I think a couple of ideas from certain books, and some overarching themes, will stick with me for a long time! And even though I felt a little out of my depth the first few classes, I learned a lot in the first few weeks from listening to other people talk about the ways they engage with and challenge texts. As a result, now I view reading with a much more active mindset than I had in the past.",
    "I learned a lot more about world history; I learned how to think on a larger scale; I learned how to be a more effective writer; I learned about how other disciplines can be relevant to history; I learned how to think critically about a work; I learned the professionals may not always be right; I learned a lot, basically.",
    "I learned how to 'think big' and understand humankind's place in the wider arc of world history. I also learned how to critically evaluate the writing and style of a historical work (be it intended for a more popular or scholarly audience).",
    "The quality of the discussion in this class really pushed me to engage critically with a variety of ideas and narratives about history and humanity. I also feel like my ability to synthesize and analyze historical arguments improved dramatically.",
    "I learnt to understand how political views and our understandings of what is acceptable or not can shade our interpretation of history"

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the breadth of ideas we were exposed to throughout the semester!! the discussions were never one-note, and sometimes went into very surprising directions! I think one thing that could change would be the amount of reading that was assigned some weeks (cough empire of things); it would also be cool to include some books by female authors, although I understand that that is not always possible!",
    "Strengths: well organized, well delivered, a lot of great information, intellectually rigorous, reasonable, good breadth Weaknesses: not a single female author in the MANY works we read",
    "Strengths lie in Professor Drixler's welcoming environment and ability to explain often very abstract concepts in an accessible way. He also facilitated section discussion well. One weakness could be that the theoretical concepts presented in the course could make it difficult to follow.",
    "The readings are quite long but usually not dense\/difficult. The discussion quality as in any seminar is as high as you and other students decide to make it but professor deixler always does a great job guiding the discussion toward interesting or productive questions",
    "This class is really strong, and I honestly can't think of any major weaknesses. The books are carefully selected and each serve a purpose. The reading\/work load was demanding but manageable. Professor Drixler was a really thoughtful discussion leader.",
    "Prof Drixler is a wonderful and amiable man and it's very difficult to tell what his political beliefs are which i thought was the main strength as it brought a sense of objectivity that other professors may not have For a history major, this course can be too vague and lack the specificity we are used to in studying particular areas and topics"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely recommend! You get to study a wide variety of subjects and time periods in a class led by a dynamic professor that does his best to engage everyone in the class and encourage exciting conversations, often successfully. It is a fair amount of writing and a ton of reading, but Professor Drixler does a good job of giving feedback and picking books that are interesting and generally pretty quick reads.",
    "YES I would definitely recommend this course to another person!!! I was introduced to so many new ideas, and more importantly, I learned how to evaluate them instead of just blindly accepting what the author was saying. Even if you're not a humanities-type major (especially if you're not) this is a fantastic class to take because: (1) you get to take an actual SEMINAR!!! (2) you get to read really really cool books that are much more interesting (and much lighter) than the average STEM textbook (3) you get exposed to a bunch of interesting ideas and new viewpoints (and realize that outside of STEM, nothing is really as objective and that's so great!) (4) you meet a lot of great people and learn how to \"talk better\" and hopefully also improve your writing (5) Professor Drixler is super intelligent (almost intimidatingly so) and is really savvy with and really appreciates interdisciplinary approaches I think! There's a bunch of other reasons to take this class, but this review is already way longer than any other review I've written for a course so I'll stop now!! Wait one last thing, you should ALSO take Professor Drixler's course on the making of Japan's great peace!!!!!!",
    "Yes definitely: there is so much to learn from this class, not only content wise but intellectually (i.e. how to have an intellectual discussion, how to think broadly, etc. etc. etc.)",
    "I'd recommend this course only if you enjoy talking about abstract concepts of world history (why the West is more prosperous than the East, the nature of 'modernity,' etc.). Otherwise, you might grow disenchanted with the topics discussed in class. There's a book assigned each week, but the required pages vary (from as little as 100 to over 400). Professor Drixler is incredibly kind and did a fine job facilitating and conducting seminar discussion, though there were moments in the semester when discussion would stall because the concepts were too far-out or because it was a rough week for everyone. The course really depends on the level of commitment of the other students, so I'd recommend at least shopping it and getting a feel for what the rest of the semester would bring.",
    "It's a great way to think about broader questions in history and the writing of history!",
    "This class is likely very different from other history seminars you've taken, but I would absolutely recommend it if you are looking to engage with some popular and powerful historical ideas. The reading load is quite heavy, but because many of the books are geared towards a popular audience, it is manageable. Taking a class with Professor Drixler is not an experience you should miss out on.",
    "To a non history major, maybe but not for a history major"
