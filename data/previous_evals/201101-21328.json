   "comments": [
    "Very good course on game theory. Professor Cho is a solid lecturer and his lecture notes are easy to understand (certainly compared to most textbooks). He's very helpful outside of class, too, whenever you need help with something. There are weekly problem sets, and they are HARD - but they really helped me to understand the material. Take this class!",
    "Definitely. A great course.",
    "A good, rigorous introduction to game theory. I would recommend it.",
    "This is a fast-paced introduction to core elements of game theory. It will be helpful for learning the 'language' of game theory to read articles that use these modeling methods; however, it does not give you advanced skills to really build your own models. It seems to be a good foundation course for more advanced courses in the economics department.",
    "I would highly recommend taking Modeling II to students who are interested in getting a basic understanding of game theoretic models and getting some practical experience in solving simpler examples.",
    "I ABSOLUTELY would recommend this class to other students and in fact I have. I'm not a \"math\" person and in fact had a very difficult time in Modelling I, and this class made all the difference. I no longer feel intimidated by formal theory, I learned a great deal and felt supported the whole time.",
    "It's a good overview of basic game theory that will help you learn to use it and at the very least, understand it better. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in quantitative and\/or formal methods and to anyone with substantive interests in institutions, which uses game theory a lot.",
    "I would recommend it. I would say that it is a great introduction to formal modeling which will take the student far enough to be able to critically evaluate any use of the method in a journal article, but would leave them short of being able to actually make a new model without some help or further experience. This is an appropriate level for a single course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for anyone who wants to become an intelligent consumer of models in political science. If you want to build your own models, you will probably need to take further coursework. I found the problem sets to be quite time consuming. But turns out that you need to spend that much time working on these problems in order to master the techniques. I thought the course was well-taught and I enjoyed taking it."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave a good grounding in game theory needed for any PhD student wanting to understand formal theory in others' work and use it in their work.",
    "Regarding question 4d above: It is too early for me to answer this question, but I imagine it to be a very helpful course for the qualifying exam in modeling.The course gave me a first insight into game theoretic models. I do not know yet whether I will use them in my dissertation, but it is a great option to have. In any case, it enables me to read models more critically.",
    "Game theory is used quite a bit in political science, and especially in the study of institutions. As I am interested in some institutional questions, this will help me immensely, even if I do not create models in my own work.",
    "Previously I couldn't really read many journal articles in political science because they relied on this method. Now I feel comfortable reading and evaluating these articles. That is a major, valuable contribution to my career. I doubt I will use this in my dissertation, but it provided enough interest in the topic that I am interested to learn more and maybe use this sometime in my research.",
    "Essential for reading models (which are very common these days in the discipline)."
