   "comments": [
    "Integration. Not in the way I was hoping",
    "I learned multivariable calculus (duh...). Increased my mental math speed and accuracy.",
    "Knowledge: I learned how to organize my thinking in a way that would allow me to look at a problem and walk through the necessary steps to determine what strategy I should use to solve that problem. Skills: I got a lot better at organizing my thinking. In order to succeed, it was really important that I go through my notes after each class and re-organize them in a way that made sense to me. Throughout the course, I also made flow charts that helped me figure out when to use certain strategies. This course had a LOT of material, which is good because it forced me to work hard and stay on top of things.",
    "I learned a significant amount of multivariable calculus in this course.",
    "This class reminded me that it's important to ask for help. My first midterm did not go very well, so before the second one, I went to my teacher's office hours a lot and attended all of the review sessions. My second midterm was much better because of that.",
    "I learned about 3D calculus and how to take many kinds of higher dimension integrals.",
    "I learned a lot about multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned a lot about 3D integration and calculations.",
    "I feel like I have a solid, working understanding of multivariable calculus at this point, and this class also exposed me to a lot of its potential applications in the real world.",
    "By taking this course, I was able to develop skills concerning both multivariable calculus and effective study habits. I learned to better conceptualize information, to view problems from various angles, and to prioritize targeting gaps in my knowledge. Succeeding in Math 120 was, for me, a matter of strategy, efficiency, and persistence, and it provided me with a meaningful experience in my first semester.",
    "I developed my problem-solving skills and my ability to ask questions whenever I needed help. There were many times when I couldnt do the problems by myself, and I learned that its completely ok to go for help (e.g. at office hours).",
    "how to do multi variable calculus",
    "I furthered my understanding of calculations in 3 space",
    "Applications of multi variable differential and integral calculus",
    "I learned a lot of mathematical skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I feel like the fact that the grade in this class is weighted so heavily on the midterm and final gives a lot of us so much anxiety. I wish Psets counted for a greater percentage, and I wouldn't even mind if they were more challenging.",
    "Please stop making the computations hard. They dont need to be hard. If I understand the concept and am regularly capable of setting up an integral, the reason I screw up a problem shouldnt be because I messed up the second integration by parts inside a trig substitution inside a u substitution. Its not helpful. It sucks",
    "The fact no calculator is allowed and the mental math is pretty easy, the course fully relies on understanding the concepts. Therefore, I found that to be a strength as it only tested the material taught in class.",
    "Strengths: pace (it never felt too slow or boring), the order in which the content was taught was also really good (each thing built off the things we had learned previously). Pam really helped us out by giving us worksheets to do in class that allowed us to practice the material we were learning AS we learned it. This was more helpful than homework because the whole class was able to work through the problems together, and we were able to get immediate feedback. Weaknesses: In the rare instances we did discuss physical or geometric interpretations of the math we were learning, the interpretations felt very surface-level and irrelevant to the class. We were quickly taught various interpretations, but we were never asked to apply those interpretations or really think critically about the interpretations and try to understand them. As a result, it was easy to just completely ignore the interpretations, which is a shame.",
    "I feel as if this class set out to teach too much material in too short a time frame. Many students were able to manage this course due to their advanced skill in the subject matter or previous exposure\/courses in multi-variable calculus, but for many of us this course was overwhelming coming from a standard high school BC calculus class. Additionally, different sections were taught in very different manners causing perceived disparity in preparedness for examinations.",
    "The course was very fast-paced, which made it difficult at times, but I'm not sure that could have been avoided due to the amount of material that had to be covered.",
    "It's a basic math course. It can be dry and tedious at times, but that's probably just the nature of the course for someone who doesn't love math. The way the class is organized is efficient and makes sense.",
    "This course covered a lot of material, which was mostly a strength but could also be a bit of a weakness. At times, especially at the end, it felt like we rushed through the most complicated and advanced material, but it also was important to take the time at the beginning of the semester to review the more basic, foundational concepts. There were also a ton of resources available, from practice problems to office hours to review sessions, so it was very easy to get help and clarification if needed.",
    "I felt like this course was definitely very challenging and comprehensive. However, I feel like students who took a version of multivariable in high school have an advantage. I also feel like it was very difficult to understand a lot of the concepts behind the course, especially if you don't have a great physics background. It would be nice if there could be some more support especially geared towards students who only have a background in single-variable calculus (no physics). Also, I feel like the physics-heavy focus of the course could be made more clear during the pre-registration \"Town Hall\" math meetings. This way, students with interests in different fields can better explore alternative math course options (ex. Math 118, ENAS 151).",
    "Strengths: lots of practice problems, all the instructors are really helpful in holding review and problem sessions, good structure and organization, very manageable workload Weaknesses: a lot of material for one semester, really fast-paced",
    "This course, overall, works very well. The material that we cover is highly relevant, the weekly assignments offer worthwhile practice, and the sample exams and Ximera modules available for studying are both helpful and effective. I do think, however, that the course should focus more on the conceptual bases of topics as we begin to explore them. While this does take more time, I find that it is more effective in introducing a subject and making it easy to truly understand.",
    "I feel like everything about this course was good.",
    "It moved a little too fast, and I wish we had a little more time for applications. Also, we never learned projections in class which meant I never fully understood them. I loved Ximera - only reason I was able to review things and make sure I understood them.",
    "The course is too broad. It is meant to teach Calc III to too many different disciplines.",
    "The course succeeded in all aspects",
    "Having the online Ximera modules was extremely helpful in reviewing for exams. They did, however, make going to class unnecessary.",
    "I enjoyed the course and it was very structured. It would be nice to have three midterms and drop one."

   "comments": [
    "Not unless you have to take it or love math. It's definitely a tough class, one where you'll have to do a lot of independent studying, especially if you've never taken multivariable calculus before. That being said, a lot of kids do come with with background knowledge and find it to be fairly easy.",
    "No, this class is hard for the sake of being hard, not for the sake of learning concepts. Yes I learned the calculus, but the amount of time I wasted on busywork and the points I lost for computational errors was not worth it",
    "Yes definitely!!!!!! loved every part of this course",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have previous exposure to the subject matter or are particularly gifted in learning math. For people who struggle to understand the conceptual background of mathematics, this course is very difficult.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to major in a STEM-related field since multi-variable calculus is a necessary prerequisite for many advanced classes.",
    "Not unless they have to take it. It's just not the most interesting course compared to other available options.",
    "I only would recommend this course to people who genuinely are interested in this type of multivariable calculus with a physics emphasis. People should read through the course syllabus and topics before electing to take this course since it is pretty high-commitment in terms of level of difficulty.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in math and prepared for a challenge.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Multivariable calculus is relevant in many different fields, and it serves as an important stepping stone for anyone looking to use higher mathematics in their career. The course is easy to navigate and highly useful, a worthwhile use of anyone's time.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is willing to work really hard at completely understanding the concepts and information.",
    "Yes, it is a lot of work but it is satisfying.",
    "No. Unless they have to, avoid at all costs. All you learn in this class is to memorize a bunch of different ways to integrate. The only knowledge you gain is memorizing a bunch of different formulas without really understanding WHY you are memorizing them.",
    "Unless you need it as a pre-req, do not take this course especially if you are doing it for qr requirements. Its not the most interesting math class either, but the skills are necessary for other STEM courses",
    "I would recommend this course, as it is a great and focused way to learn multivariable calculus",
    "I would recommend this class to students looking for a low-workload course, who anticipate needing to know topics from multi for future non math-major classes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Lectures can get boring but it's kind of a necessary prerequisite"
