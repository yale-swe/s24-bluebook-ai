   "comments": [
    "Yes. Learning languages at Yale is a great experience. You'll meet many interesting people.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to learn Spanish. It is a quick intro to the beginnings of the language and it is well taught.",
    "It's not hard. Spanish isn't a hard language to begin with. It's a fun class, but the daily ritual of talking among yourselves in Spanish on a given topic can get tedious. Excellent structure; Garcia is very organized and fair. Feels a little like high school.",
    "Great class! Workload is not bad at all. I hear L1 French has way more work (like a test every week) so go with Spanish! It's also super useful",
    "Yes. It's a great introduction to the language.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class for beginners. It's a pretty standard class, the pace is rather fast but not at all too demanding, the homework are fast to do but after a semester you WILL feel like you've learned a lot.",
    "I would, but as long as the student is willing to put in the effort.",
    "I loved Spanish 110. I had taken two years of Spanish awhile ago (in ninth and tenth grades), so it was pretty easy for me. As long as you keep up with the work it's not hard at all. And Maripaz is awesome. Just make sure you get that participation grade and keep up with the online language lab assignments.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes if you're serious about learning the language. I wouldn't take it as a easy language class. You should expect to continue Spanish for one or more semesters to truly get a good grasp.",
    "My favorite class this semester. Maripaz is a great teacher! When going to a class every day of the week it is vital to have a teacher that will make class a pleasant and enjoyable experience - and Maripaz does that in an excellent way.If you are a true beginner, the class is not easy at all and getting an A is not likely.",
    "I would because I enjoyed this class, and I think others enjoyed it too.",
    "This course is a good intro to spanish language. This year's sections were a bit harder than the past years' though. Generally, a good class to take to fulfill a language requirement but beware of students who have already had some experience with spanish in high school."
