   "comments": [
    "Math 120 is very similar to a high school math course. It goes extremely quickly, but once you have the time to review the material in your textbook and complete the problem sets, the material is not too difficult. If you took BC in high school but feel a bit rusty on topics like Series and Sequences, I would definitely recommend to take this course. A stronger BC background is not necessary for this course.",
    "It's a great class for anyone who wants to take a multivariable calculus course, but the concepts taught are very abstract and a lot depends on the instructor.",
    "Math 120 is a prerequisite for so many things; you might as well take your freshman fall to get it and your QR out of the way. You learn some cool topics and it never gets overwhelming unless you don't study for the midterm\/final in advance. Don't do the PSETs the night before. Go to office hours whenever you don't understand even the smallest thing. The best way to study is to just keep doing practice problems; the odd-numbered problems in the back of the book are perfect. Review evaluations and choose a professor wisely (I know YuWen and Miki are great).",
    "The quality of this course largely depends on your lecturer, with Havlikova and Hsu seemingly being the best by far. The course moves quickly and covers loads of content, although the problems on the exams are standard and very similar to the problems on the Psets. MIT's OCW on Multivariable Calc is an excellent complement to this course.",
    "It's a class that I took because I thought that to fulfil my QR credit I would have to take math. WRONG. If you just looking to fulfil the credit, take something easy or less math-y, like physics of dance, or movie physics or econ. do not take math if you don't like math, don't intend to use it for your major, or are not interested in it at all. However, if you do take it, as I've noticed in the review sessions, take it with Miki. She's great, and if not, then with Yu-Wen, who is also a good professor.",
    "I'm not extremely expressed with this course. Unfortunately, it's one of the only options unless you're well enough prepared for math 230. Especially if you're considering engineering, shop ENAS 151.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Math 120, especially if you can get Yu-Wen. Math 120 as a whole can be iffy just because I think it depends on your teacher. If you get Yu-Wen, the class will be amazing. You will learn a lot and enjoy it. I took AB Calc in high school, not BC, however, we learned a little more than we were supposed to. Instead of taking Calc 115, which you are generally tracked into from AB, I took 120 and it was completely fine. So, if you are in this situation, I would still recommend takingit. Basically, if you want to take Math 120, try to get Yu-Wen.",
    "This is a challenging course, but it thoroughly covers multivariable calculus. The classes are well-taught and there are several sources of outside help.",
    "I highly recommend Math 120 for anyone who has taken Calculus BC and would like to continue taking Math!However, the quality of the class will seriously depend on what teacher you have. It is definitely in your benefit to shop multiple sections until you find a teacher that explains the concepts well.Also, this class is really what you make of it. You will have to do some studying if things don't click with you the first time you hear them in class. If you follow through with your part of the work, you'll end up learning a lot!",
    "MATH 120 is a good course on multivariable calculus. You learn a lot of material over the semester, so the class is very fast paced. I usually had to read over my notes after class to understand the material. However, Yu-Wen makes the class really fun and engaging. She's a great professor, and she is very enthusiastic about helping her students - she has lots of office hours, and she holds even more open question\/answer sessions before the tests. She's probably one of the best professors for this course.",
    "Math 120 is really hard, and if you do not like math or are bad at math, it might be worth considering not taking. All the same, Yu-Wen Hsu is a good professor, and she makes it bearable.",
    "Remember AP Calc? Math 120 is that, but in higher dimensions. This class is popular because it is a prerequisite for a lot of science and economics majors, but if you just love math, you should also take this course. You will leave with a really thorough understanding of calculus appreciating the concepts and proofs behind the formulas.",
    "If you need to take it for your major, its fine. Otherwise, I wouldn't take it Also, if you think you can handle 230, definitely take it. Its a much better course.",
    "I'd recommend this class. However, I recommend getting ahead early. I think if you get ahead of it during reading week, the class will be easy for most of the semester. They give you all the homeworks at the beginning of the semester. Using that information, you can dive right into the homework assignments. See if you can do the problem just with your past knowledge of math. Then, use the book as a resource, reading as much of it as you need to solve the homework problems. You can get really far ahead this way. Then, you can stay ahead throughout the semester, and you'll never get slammed by a really heavy week (which occurs a few times toward the end).",
    "You won't be learning much of true mathematics, i.e. deriving proofs. You will just perform really difficult calculations.",
    "YU-WEN IS AMAZING! The happiest professor I've had. She recognizes and cares for every student, in and out of the classroom. Her intelligence is incredible, but her most inspiring quality as a professor was her immediate ability to see a student's question from the point of view of a person who has just been introduced to the topic, and answer the question effectively and simply. As a break, we took a vote for the name of her sister's new shop, and our class seemed that much closer after that 1 minute.",
    "I would only recommend Math 120 for another student if he\/she needed it to fulfill a requirement. It's good material to know but the review sessions are not helpful, and the class IS the discussion section you would typically see in other courses.",
    "Definitely. If they like math\/need it for their major\/like calculus or anything along those lines, they should take it. Obviously if they're not a math person advanced math classes probably aren't the way to go, but this is a very good course for someone who enjoys it. What I mean is I would make sure that the other student would benefit from the class before telling them to take it, but I would absolutely tell them to take it if it was a fit.",
    "A quick-paced course through multivariable calculus. I would recommend it to student who are pretty good with math courses as it can be challenging.",
    "Math 120 is a standard math class. The material is not particularly exciting and is presented in a very straightforward way, which sometimes makes it difficult to stay engaged in class. In class, it just seems like a lot of information is being thrown at you and not necessarily taught. However, Yu-Wen is wonderful at explaining the material during office hours and is eager to help you if you have any problems.",
    "Math 120 is a challenging but rewarding course. The problem sets grow in time required through the course, and ample review is needed for each test. That being said, the teachers make a great effort to help you at each step. I definitely recommend Yu-Wen, she gives very clear lectures and is always willing to answer questions, whether during class or during the Q&A sessions she hosts before tests. She is very approachable and has regular office hours that every student should take advantage of.",
    "I cannot recommend Math 120 with Professor Yu-Wen strongly enough! She is an amazing professor who can explain mathematical concepts concisely and clearly. Her lectures are always well organized and her extra practice worksheets are extremely helpful in terms of preparing for exams. She even does quick activities (Learning Catalytics) in class to make it more interactive. Most importantly of all, she holds numerous office hour sessions because she genuinely cares about her students. I've always found her office hours to be valuable and enjoyable, since she is such an approachable and warm person. With that being said, if you are considering taking Math 120, definitely take it with Professor Yu-Wen!"
