Great variety in approaches to these topics, from a biological, reproductive, anthropological, demographic, environmental, evolutionary, social, political, theoretical, and historical lense.",
    "The relationship between the social, scientific, and evolutionary implications of overweight and obesity.",
    "About obesity on a biological and social level!",
    "This class was my introduction to anthropology and I really loved it. I thought the workload was really fair, and intriguing, and the class discussions were engaging.",
    "I developed a critical understanding of obesity on multiple levels (biological, socioeconomic, sociocultural, etc). Due to the pedagogical teaching philosophy of the instructors, I also feel that Ive gained a crucial skill that I will take with me for the rest of my life the power of questioning everything that I am taught.",
    "I gained a better understanding of obesity from several perspectives, but the real value for me in this course was learning more about the field of anthropology and how it intersects with subjects like biology, as well as how it differs from them.",
    "The course was split into three main perspectives on Obesity -- Biology, Evolution, and Nutrition\/Society. I found the evolutionary and biological sections to be the most well structured and interesting. We also learned of anthropometric techniques for measuring body composition, and the demo class on that was pretty interesting as well."

   "comments": [
    "Such a great class. no complaints",
    "Both the major strength and weakness of the course has to do with professors Valeggia and Arslanian. The major strength comes from how invested Claudia and Kendall were in each student and in the material. I could tell from every interaction with them that they genuinely cared about my learning and my overall well-being as a person. I really enjoyed having them as professors and hope to continue to see them in the future. The major weakness of the course came from the fact that it appeared to me that Kendall and Claudia were out of sync in their teaching and grading styles. I wish that the two had been more integrated and consistent throughout the semester.",
    "I really loved the way the class was taught, although I wished we could've discussed the literature a bit more during class. I also appreciated the anonymous feedback and the receptiveness\/how open-minded the professors were! They really wanted to make sure that we understood concepts, wanted to hear our opinions and were super nice and engaging! Also, the meditation sessions were great and allowed me to do meditation sessions on my own\/outside of class! I do wish that the grading distribution was a bit more evenly spaced, or that we had more opportunities for grading. Knowing that the flash talk was 25% of the grade made me really nervous!",
    "Strengths: great topic, so much information to cover, great readings, great comprehensive view of a single disease. Weaknesses: organization of the course was lacking. Because it was co-taught, there was often confusion about information, expectations, and assignments. We were required to turn in weekly journals, but didn't really receive feedback on them. Seemed like we should have just used that time doing more reading. The written critiques were a good assignment idea, but minimal feedback didn't help me improve from one to the next.",
    "Strengths: instructors are passionate. material is interesting. Very important subject material Weakness: lectures were a little disorganized or repetitive. But for a first time class, overall excellent.",
    "I really appreciated how they professor added objectives for each lecture! It made it much easier to go back and study and understand what the flow of the class was intended to be!",
    "I think the class had a few organizational weaknesses, but none more than to be expected for a first time course. I thought the content was really wonderful, and the teaching was amazing.",
    "I loved this course!",
    "A lot of the readings were a little repetitive, and also the class powerpoints were sometimes unclear. I think the course could be organized a bit better, but I think it was the courses first time, so it was pretty good overall. I think the subject was really interesting and unique.",
    "One glaring weakness is the \"leminar\" structure of the course. I found this ambiguous way of running the class to be nearly unbearable, and I would not have taken the class would my DUS not STRONGLY suggest that I do for graduation requirement purposes. The lectures given by the instructors, especially by Mrs. Arslanian, were littered with poorly structured questions aimed at the class that were often met with time-wasting silence. These questions, which were the main attempts at making the class more seminar-like, were not often conducive to actual interesting discussion and discourse (at least in my opinion). Physically, the classroom was structured exactly as a lecture course would be -- a true leminar may have been better carried out in a space where people could sit either at one long table or at several group tables. The activities that we did while splitting up into groups were a good strategy for inciting discussion, but many of the pauses in the lecture to ask bad questions were very painful to sit through. The midterm was very poorly written and the questions were weighted nonsensically -- the instructors had to reconsider the weighting of certain questions after student feedback. I am glad that the instructors were at least receptive to feedback, though I can't help but feel that many of these mistakes ought not have been made given the instructor's experience and ability to work as a team. In general, students felt like our expectations for the midterm were very unclear, for a course covering as wide of a variety of material as this one, not providing at least a study guide for students was a choice that did not facilitate our learning in any way. The journals, in which we were expected to reflect concerning readings or lecture material in the class, were tedious and felt like busy-work. I often struggled to find things to write about, and I would have rather placed some of the effort that went into the journals into reviewing and taking proper notes. The critiques of headlines concerning obesity were simple enough to do and probably the more valuable assignments of the course. Writing them was actually interesting and left one with insights on just how easy it is to sensationalize scientific work for online clicks. I found that the flash talk assignment could have also been better guided. There was not enough guidance concerning possible topics for a student to choose from, resulting in several presentations on similar topics. Some of the questions on the feedback forms that we were expected to write for every student presenter were also conducive to repetitive answers, and having to fill ALL of those questions out in the 7-ish minutes allowed took away from one's ability to actually pay attention to the presentation. We were told we would receive these evaluations back on the day of the exam, along with our journals, and that did not happen. Additionally, vaguely suggesting that the flash talk content may be on the final exam was very stressful to add into a studying routine. I went back through every single flash talk and studied the contents -- these were dense presentations covering a WIDE variety of topics that we had only been exposed to in the last two days of class. In the end, such efforts felt like a very stressful waste of time since the question on the final just asked you to describe ONE of the flash talks and its main idea. I was rarely excited to go to class, often confused concerning the learning goals, and this certainly reflected in how much I was able to ultimately take away from the course. While professor Valeggia's experience and knowledge is evident, I really disliked Mrs. Arslanian's teaching style -- I will go into more detail in a later question."

    "Definitely, mainly if you are interested in health or the human body",
    "Super interesting course! At first, I was a bit afraid that the class might seem a bit disorganized (first time being taught, makes sense), as there wasn't a clear directive at first. But after the objectives were established and we were allowed to submit anonymous feedback, the class really took off! I learned so much about obesity, especially the biology of it (which I'm so glad I did because I feel like people talk about obesity or being overweight and really don't know anything else!). It was so interesting to learn about how complicated obesity was (the evolutionary hypotheses are so fun to talk about with family, actually, because they're fascinated to learn that adipose tissue\/'fat' is actually really useful!). It's also changed the way I view not just obesity but public health problems in general. I also loved the \"leminar\" aspect of the class and could feel myself being more comfortable with the class as we got closer to the end of the semester. It was also fun to realize that I started questioning scientific literature and explanations\/possible solutions for obesity\/about obesity, as I never thought I'd be able to do that!! The guest lectures were extremely fascinating, too. Overall, a really great class I'm glad I took.",
    "I absolutely loved this class! Always really interesting and Kendall and Claudia made a great team. Definitely recommend if you're not too much of a science person but are interested in obesity. I felt like I learned a lot about such an important issue in our society.",
    "Yes. Definitely take this class. You likely only have a good perspective from the biology, society, or evolution side. But to put them all together is very valuable.",
    "Yes! If you're pre-med you will find the course doable but interesting! Some of the material is very much a review but touches upon an important medical issue that doesn't get a lot of attention!",
    "Yes! I really hope this class is offered again so I can recommend it to my friends.",
    "ABSOLUTELY YES!",
    "Since the graded workload for this class was much lower than some others Ive taken, it was a very self-driven experience. If you cared, you got a lot out of it! I would highly recommend it to self-motivated students who are also looking for a class where it is okay to take a break from constantly working.",
    "Some students which were more invested in the topic, either due to personal experiences or professional goals, would likely enjoy diving quite deep into the basic concepts covered in the course. The guest speakers were really great and it was cool to hear first-hand from people researching obesity. Otherwise, I cannot say that I enjoyed the course or that I would recommend it. The lectures were often quite boring and questions asked of students during the lectures were structured as if geared towards middle schoolers. To my horror, some student responses did seem to be at that level."
