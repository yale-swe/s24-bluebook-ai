    "This is a literature requirement, so no way around it for literature majors. I would not recommend it as a class.",
    "A course that purports to encompass such a wide range of material needs make sure to provide context, so that the similarities and differences hold some meaning. I didn't feel that this class did that at all. I think that students can handle radically different readings, and I even thing that the jarring differences themselves can be educational\/interesting. I did feel that, in this class, I confronted the sheer potential range of poetry\/performance literature in a way I have never been before. However, ideally, through context, this range would have helped me learn something deeper about this genres in general, and I'm afraid that it didn't. The lack of context also made it difficult for me to fully appreciate\/enjoy the readings, I think. Professor Creswell spoke a lot during section, and sometimes made sweeping generalizations without backing them up in any way; however, he often said very interesting and enlightening things about the works, and clearly cared deeply for the works and the class.",
    "This was a good course. The material was a little scattered, but the good stuff we learned was really engaging. Professor Creswell was amazing, and it seemed like the other section leaders were good as well. I hope in the future the syllabus is flushed out more and there is more connections between the works (Professor Creswell did a good job connecting them but it seemed like he had to work a little bit to do this because sometimes the material was very disparate). The essays were interesting and gave us a fair amount of freedom as well. Many of the students in the class were older literature majors who had to take the course as a requirement. They were very intelligent and brought a lot to the course even though they did not always want to be there.",
    "World Poetry and Performance offers a fantastic overview of poetry and drama across disparate traditions. It explores the lineage, or lack thereof, of the development of language and its functions. I would definitely recommend the course to a student unfamiliar with various world traditions but perhaps not to one already initiated in comparative approaches to literature.",
    "Avoid at all costsif you have to take it for Lit, avoid Creswell as a section leader."
