   "comments": [
    "Take this class. If you want to learn more about development, especially in Africa, this class is incredibly thorough. Professor Simon is also a wonderful teacher.",
    "If you already know a ton about development, then don't bother. But if you don't, then take it.",
    "This is quite a good course, with interesting discussions. Class discussion is good, but rarely great. However, when Prof. SImon brings in speakers, the class is at its best - their on the ground experience is fascinating to hear about.",
    "I would recommend PLSC 430 to anyone interested in international development and new to the subject. Those with overwhelming experience in the topic may feel that most of the material is old. Especially non-majors will find the course interesting and horizon-broadening. It's a solid course and not too much work besides the term paper.",
    "Definitely. 2 midterm papers and final paper, on topics of your choice relating to development assistance, and a lot of freedom on what you want to write about.",
    "It won't be the best seminar you take at yale, but if it works for your major and you're interested in development issues, it's definitely worth taking.",
    "Take it.",
    "A broad look at foreign aid questions, recommended to anyone interesting in economic development",
    "I would recommend Politics of Developmental Assistance to a fellow student. Readings and interesting, speakers are great, conversations are good, and there's not an overload of work for a seminar.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It is a great way to learn about development.",
    "I recommend taking it. It's interesting if you like the topic, and even if you're unfamiliar with it, the class is accessible. That said, it might seem a bit introductory if you already know about aid or have taken a class on aid - there's a huge range of knowledge in the class.",
    "I would recommend it to a friend, but advise that they have studied economics or development previously in order to have a strong enough foundation to get the most out of the course."
