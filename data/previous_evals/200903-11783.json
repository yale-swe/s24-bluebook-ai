   "comments": [
    "This is a really good course for people interested in looking at identity, especially as it pertains to Asian Americans. The readings are interesting and the work load is very manageable.",
    "I would take this class if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in the topics at hand: identity, transnationalism, Asia, the U.S., and women's studies. If you are not interested in the subject of the class, you probably won't get as much out of it.",
    "For people who like to \"explore issues\", it's perfect. For people who want to find solutions to issues, this class is not for you, since we largely dealt with overarching topics relating to family, gender, identity, immigration, etc. that have no definite answer.Since it's in seminar format, you will have to do all the readings\/books and watch all the movies--this is quite a lot of material, but at least most of it is interesting. I've never worked harder for any class, but it has allowed me to see the world in a different way.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is comfortable thinking and writing abstractly, who is willing to consider options beyond the usual, normative ones.",
    "AMST 322 is a good course, although from what Professor Chanda told us we were a much quieter bunch than some of her previous courses--which would have doubtlessly made the class more fun. Most of the topics were pretty interesting, although I felt uncomfortable in a few of the class discussions when they became overly feminist. Overall I'd recommend it, but keep in mind it's anything but an easy A--and there's a decent amount of reading. Don't take it just to satisfy a WR, but if you're passionate about the subject you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "Mostly everything the - very long - name says it is. Our weekly readings (mainly collections of short papers with some novels and books) were grouped thematically, covering everything from identity and nationalismto hypermasculinity in Sikh culture, food cultures, portrayals of Asian-Americans in US media, debates on wearing the veil in France, ect. Really interesting readings, but a lot to read. I ended up investing a lot more emotional energy than I expected in this class because the readings and discussions raised so many questions that applied to things I was thinking about outside of class. Our seminar group also started to bond nicely.Start on the papers early! And don't be intimidated by Prof. Chanda, she definitely speaks her mind, but really wants others to do so as well. Be prepared to engage and you will get A LOT out of this class.",
    "Yes. The books are interesting. The movies are interesting. The class discussions are thought provoking and the professor knows a lot about what she teaches.",
    "I think this is a good class if you want to grow as a person and have your opinions changed about the themes of the class. I know there were many times that I would discuss the topics brought up during class with friends or suite mates especially those to do with woman and the constraints of women in society. Having said this there is a lot of reading. It is not a terrible writing credit, 3 papers, and reading responses did not take long. It was annoying having to go all the way to Whitney Humanities center to watch the movies. The professor is a wonderful person but she really does push you and expects you to be prepared for class. Looking back it doesn't seem like to was too bad but I know that there were times I was printing out hundreds of pages of reading and thinking to myself that it was ridiculous. Take this course if you are really interested in minority or gender issues."
