    "the material is really interesting, but it matters who the prof is. definitely shop it!",
    "This course looks at contemporary responses to issues revolving around the mind-body problem. It is not as glamorous as it sounds, as many of the readings are very technical. The course draws on a few different approaches to analytic philosophy, which can make it both exciting and demanding. I can't really recommend it except for philosophy majors who have taken multiple philosophy classes."
