   "comments": [
    "Questions 6\/7: I really enjoyed the last field trip where we visited the bioretention gardens in Bridgeport, but I really wish we had had a lot more chances to visit different examples\/ strategies for increasing coastal resiliency. Rather than hearing each team do the same presentations over and over again, I think it would be valuable to increase the number of field trips earlier on in the class. The class is long enough to make short trips to see local examples\/approaches that deal with flood control, erosion, habitat restoration, etc.",
    "With regards to questions 3-4, I don't necessarily feel that the workload was particularly heavy and that the pace was too fast, but rather the organization of the assignments could have been improved. I thought that the successive nature of the assignments was effective for developing the regional to municipal scale designs. However, if this progression had been made clearer at the onset of the course, the \"workload\" and \"pace\" of the course would have been more reasonable. It may have also been more valuable to provide more guidance with respect to what GIS data and municipal\/regional planning contacts were available early on in the process. So much of the first part of the assignment was completing work that had largely already been accomplished by the regional or municipal planners. Being put in touch with these officials earlier in the process could have led to a more appropriate end product. If the class were treated more like a \"clinic\" I think it would be more effective in achieving its goals. Also, based on conversations with other students it was a trend that the FES students ended up investing more time and effort than the SOA students into the project work, which may have also led to the perception that the course was fast paced and a heavy workload. More effort could be made to ensure that workload is distributed evenly amongst the different skillsets. For the field trips, I believe that they could have been organized a bit better. I found it valuable to present our final project to town officials but the length of the outing was extraordinary and we were not told who our audience would be until 2 days before the presentations. I understand that it is difficult to coordinate all of the different officials for one day but if this process could be figured out earlier, I think it would be a more positive experience for the students.",
    "This is one of the only climate adaptation courses available at FES currently. It would be helpful if it was named as such to make sure students know it is available. It was much more a climate adaptation regional planning\/ ecological planning course than an urban design course. It was extremely helpful for me in my career and ultimately the knowledge gained in this class as well as Alex's help and connections landed me a perfect internship for the summer that is relevant to my career and will help connect me in the climate adaptation field."

    "The classmates.",
    "I love the content and the idea of bringing together different disciplines to work on shared problems.",
    "The pinups were great because they allowed us to gain feedback at different stages of our project from different professionals in the field. It also helped give us a sense of their perspectives and the work they do.",
    "The content is fascinating. Landscape approaches are great for both architecture and environmental management. This puts it in a new lens for all of us.",
    "For me the best aspects of the course, were meeting with Alex to discuss specifics of our project outside of class. I felt that these meetings were the most productive moments in project development since we were able to evaluate details of the project. Alex, also provided valuable insight with regards to strategic approaches, which were clearly from his own experiences in regional\/municipal planning. While he discussed these insights during some lectures, I found the application to our specific project goals most effective for really learning these strategies.",
    "Field trips, guest speakers, opportunity for FES students to engage with climate adaptation and built environment through working with the architecture school. I loved this class."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, no aspect of this course comes to mind that does not need improvement. The course material was poorly put together and overwhelming for both architects and ecologists. The overall structure of the course kept changing without any regard for the students. The course material was solely about Felson's (the professor's) experience, but contained little content which furthered the students' understanding of the course subject. It seemed as though the course was not mainly\/entirely directed towards furthering the students' understanding of the topic, but rather propping up the accomplishments of the professor in a self indulgent manner. Lastly, while the group work brought about some fruitful collaboration, there was a distinct lack of guidance and facilitation on part of the professor which ultimately detracted from the capacity of the students to put forth a valuable project.",
    "I would have liked to see guest lectures from architecture professors, not just FES professors. At the beginning of the semester we were told we'd leave the class with a \"toolbox\" of resilience techniques and design ideas, which didn't really happen. I think this might've been different if we had lectures that weren't so specific to just Alex's experience but also about resilience planning more broadly.",
    "The organization of the class could use some improvement. At times it was unclear what we were expected to turn in and when. I think it would have been beneficial to have a few more formal lectures before the informal discussions and presentations with the visiting professionals\/professors.",
    "Having fieldtrips throughout instead of just at the end. Less time in lecture and more time site visiting would be great. Then have the stakeholders come to us instead of us to them. The traveling exhibition could then be \"presented\" to them for their use.",
    "There is a HUGE difference in the amount of work contributed to the class by the forestry students over the architecture students, which makes the group work very difficult at times. The architecture students are ungraded and tend to focus less time on this class, which makes learning from them very difficult. One of the things I was most excited about for the class was learning how to use illustrator\/indesign and to think about everything from more of a planning\/design perspective, but I didn't end up learning nearly as much as I wanted from the arch students since they (on average) put minimal effort into the project. This made the project very stressful for me at times, and I ended up doing a lot more work than other members of my group.",
    "1. Organization 2. I would have liked to have had some more guest lectures from SOA professors or other designers. The guest lectures were heavily dominated by FES faculty.",
    "Better organization of the course materials and discussions, more field trips to sites that Alex has worked on, and more in depth reading discussions."

   "comments": [
    "The relationship between lectures and discussion needs serious improvement. Comments from students were consistently ignored or brushed over by the professor, with the few exceptions being for architecture students, leaving behind their peers from FES. The professor frequently asked, \"What do the *architects* in the room think of this?\" Furthermore, while it is possible to make three hour long lectures fruitful, some degree of variation is needed; listening to a professor speak for three hours straight is a poor method of engaging the students.",

    "This course fits prominently into my overall program as I am interested in ecological design, coastal resiliency, and urban issues. I was able to apply much of the knowledge I gained during my previous experience with green infrastructure design and project management but also learned numerous knew skills and design strategies. In addition to the hard design skills that I learned, the course also provides valuable lessons with regards to how municipalities and regional planning agencies function, which were useful to me as I plan on pursuing a career that will involve working in\/with these entities."

    "Yes.",
    "Could have benefited from more direction.",
    "I wish we had spent more time in the beginning of the course going through concrete strategies for dealing with coastal issues, and then going through the pros and cons for each of the strategies. For instance, we could have had a more thorough intro to past approaches to coastal protection and their issues (i.e. all the army corps of engineers work). Then we could have moved through some more novel approaches (living shorelines, etc) and discussed how well these more novel approaches have worked so far. I also wish the class had included more of an opportunity for landscape design.",

    "The group work was very useful. As a joint FES\/ARCH class, the group work meant that different teammates brought very different skillsets to the table. You can learn a lot from your group members through this class.",
    "Learned a lot from my groupmates.",
    "Advantages - It was exciting to see how the environmental\/ecological science site analysis and interventions were translated into visually representative products by the SOA students. Disadvantages - At times it was clear that the SOA students were more focused on studio coursework than the assignments for this class.",
    "Very difficult to sync up schedules across architecture and FES. A lab section for this course would have been very beneficial. There should also be additional sessions for studetns to get up to speed or at least exposed to GIS and basic photoshop or Indesign so that Arch students don't have to shoulder the full burden of teaching their classmates."
