   "comments": [
    "Fun course. Should have less people and multiple sections. Priority was given to theatre studies majors but I think non theatre people benefit the most from this class, and are beautiful to witness their growth.",
    "This is a class that tries to pull inner comedic elements out of a person in a childish manner. It pushes people out of their comfort zone.",
    "I have developed an abandon for my inner critic--it is ok to have fun and be silly and vulgar in the world of theatre.",
    "I really learned a lot about myself and I had a blast.",
    "Vulnerability, , courage, everything about how I want to live my life",
    "Began to be trained in Clown technique, a pretty particular form of physical comedy. Forced to consider and weigh what comedic defense mechanisms I use. I think the most helpful and interesting thing for me were the warmup techniques, which lasted about an hour of each class. I know warming up is super important in performance, but it's hard to know what to do without being shown. Those were techniques I'll definitely use.",
    "I learned how to take myself a little less seriously. Be a little goofier. More phsyical comedy techniques. Tryign to find where the funny is. How to make humor with just my body and a sound.",
    "Understanding the source of humor and finding the game and living in abadon",
    "I learned how to push my inhibitions aside and have fun for fun's sake and with the intention of making others happy. This could seem trivial, but it was actually instrumental in my growth as a performe.",
    "This is a great course that provides insights on human nature, life and our interactions with one another and our relationship with ourself through the lens of comedy.",
    "I learnt to be more accepting of myself while performing and in life more generally.",
    "This class is best for its insights into yourself, and your relationship to performance and the world. It was difficult to break the bad habits that I had coming in, but letting go was very rewarding."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Again multiple sections. Maybe meet once a week. Otherwise, very perfect.",
    "The course is fantastic.",
    "It was very jarring--some of the activities. And also maybe don't make people do sexual stuff\/lick each other. But, that being said, it did get me out of my comfort zone.",
    "I thought it was extremely well done, though I have no other theater classes to compare to. Really enjoyed all the methods used and exercises we did",
    "I felt like the course was too big, and would have benefitted from more individual attention. Obviously a lot of people want to take it, and I think it'd be helpful to have some audition or selection process (like, maybe theater majors shouldn't obviously get in). It was a little frustrating because I was one of the first to go for our last exercise, and then for the last three or four classes wasn't able to go again, so wasn't able to incorporate or try to improve upon the critique I got. I would have also appreciated some written feedback, and a more structured way to work on it, or maybe just a smaller class. I found the warmups really helpful and useful. Definitely gonna use them in the future. I wish I'd had a sense earlier int he semester of what we were working towards like, what did a performance in this form look like? I think I didn't have a sense until the end how specific this medium is. The class had some really nice moments and there is obviously no class like it, in terms of what the work looks like. Was cool to do that in an academic setting! A few times Professor Bayes said something kind of inappropriate, and when called out for it kind of snapped back, rather than acknowledge there was room for him to learn. Lots of the class was invested in the gender binary in ways that I found kind of weird. Lots of \"ok, how about the BOYS go now!\" in ways that didn't feel necessary.",
    "Strengths: Very fun, great group of people. You get to laugh a lot. Bayes is pretty fun. A great break from other school in the middle of the week. Only class like this at Yale. Should definitely be contiually offered. Weaknesses: sometimes it can feel like a bit of a waste of time because for individual exercises, you spend most of the class watching others (usually doing very simialr things). The warmup takes up a huge part of the class. I wish we went more in depth into physical comedy and did more exercises instead of spending time on the warmup.",
    "I think it was strong overall. I just wish it were longer (as in a full year as opposed to just a semester). I feel like there was so much more to unpack.",
    "I wouldn't change anything about this course except the number of people in it - too many meant we didn't get the opportunity to retry exercises to really let lessons sink in and to have the freedom to experiment.",
    "A little more time for solo work would be nice, but I also liked having a lot of people in the calss."

   "comments": [
    "Ya! I have never taken a performance class before and so this was a super new experience for me . It was a nice break in the day. It is very mentally hard. You think \"clowning\" but really it's \"being extremely vulnerable and honest and sometimes embarrassed and sometimes sad and sometimes angry and sometimes happy but never really comfortable\". It's definitely not all fun and games.",
    "Yes; if you want to grow as a performer and develop trust in yourself and your innate sense of fun TAKE THIS.",
    "Awesome!!!! so emotionally challenging but definitely worth it.",
    "Absolutely.this was the best class I took at yale, hands down. I learned so much about myself and others this semester, and plan to continue working on the skills I developed",
    "YES definitely take it. It'll teach you how to be a better, happier, more open person",
    "Yes, overall I would. Only class like this at Yale. If you want to do comedy or are curious about your body and how it moves on stage do this. If you like to play in the light, take this class. Perhaps cred\/d\/fail cause I hear grading can be wonky.",
    "Yes! It's rare to find such a studio intensive class at Yale and it's very interesting to examine he art of clowning and understanding the humor.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes if you are willing to make this a major component of your term and manage your week around it to some extent. Lots of work, demanding of energy and space of mind.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone in or out of theatre. It's the perfect environment to rediscover your sense of fun, to let loose and stop worrying so much and to reinforce the fact that honesty is the best policy. This course was just what I needed and allowed me 3h a week to be my goofy self that the real world doesn't always want to accept. The class is supportive and Chris Bayes helps you let loose - next thing you know you're singing to the class or doing some really stupid things, but ultimately you're having fun.",
    "absolutely fantastic course. I had no experience with theatre, but took it anyway. The class is a ton of fun, you literally laugh for 3 hours straight. Professor Bayes is a genius when it comes to life advice (and theatre too). If you're remotely interested, take it. You'll walk away with so much at the end.",
    "Absolutely worth it if you want to learn just how much room you have to grow in being honest, generous, fun, and not worrying about being so bad on stage or in life."
