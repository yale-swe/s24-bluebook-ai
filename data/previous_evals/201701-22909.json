    "This class teaches about computability and first order logic as well as some related concepts.",
    "Learned incompleteness theorems, recursive functions, a lot of crazy stuff",
    "Writing proofs, thinking about very abstract mathematical concepts, learning how to evaluate my own understanding of a topic.",
    "Theoretical knowledge",
    "Learned a lot about first order logic, something I had not studied before.",
    "This class taught me so much. I now have a great understanding of the basics of logic. The material covered was really interesting and I have a wealth of fun stuff to talk about at philosophy parties. I've already begun to apply the skills in proof-based logic in my other classes and I'm incredibly grateful. This class was great.",
    "Learning logic and computability, specifically Godel's incompleteness theorems, undecidability, first order logic",
    "I feel like I have a much better grasp of the concept of computability (unsurprisingly), along with some basic aspects of logic (theories, completeness, etc.).",
    "i feel like I came out with a much more thorough understanding of mathematical foundations. Developed skills for writing and presenting very complex proofs (thanks to class presentation)",
    "You learn about computability theory.",
    "My understanding for mathematics completely changed during this class. The depth and range of the material this class covers is amazing. Proving Gdels Incompleteness theorem requires a semester of dedication, and it's definitely worth it!",
    "Facility with formal logic, proof-writing",
    "I learned a lot about logic that enhanced my understanding of core CS concepts, such that computability and the Turing machine."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was very well taught. Lectures and assignments were all really helpful, and I loved that even things like the oral exam felt more like opportunities for Professor Shin to help us consolidate the knowledge and to teach us more, rather than to test us.",
    "This class forced me to know things! Really enjoyed it!",
    "Strengths: Professor Shin is one of the most talented professors I know. She makes such difficult material so fun and easy to understand. Improvements: Course was heavy towards the end and a bit imbalanced in that the final only covered the last few lectures.",
    "This might be by design, but I never understood anything until I'd looked over the notes later on. Everything fell into place as I was taking the final. While this was a pretty cool feeling to finally understand, it would have been much less stressful earlier on. That being said, it might be my fault as I didn't take as much advantage of office hours as I could have. Class notes were incredible.",
    "Presentation, oral exam, and (some of) the assignments force engagement with the material, in a good way. The last assignment was good in that it made me understand the material, but it didn't seem right that 40% of our grade come from such a small portion of the class content.",
    "Very interesting material. Psets are not very big, but have some interesting problems. Overall well structured course.",
    "Material is very interesting. Student presentations were often hard to understand.",
    "I think it would probably be better if it was not a once a week 2 hour seminar.",
    "The only weakness is that not all students engage with lecture, however sooner or later most of them realize it's better to focus during lecture.",
    "The material became more interesting as the course progressed. Group presentations were sometimes tedious but probably a good experience.",
    "I thought it was all great. The PSets were helpful but not too bad, the oral exam and presentations were helpful for reinforcing the material, and Professor Shin was very helpful and cared a lot of the course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It is super obvious that Professor Shin wants the students to learn, and she is always extremely helpful and accessible. Lecturers were very informative, notes were great, and assignments tied in well with the information.",
    "This class is awesome! It really forces you to learn the material without being a lot of work. I found the material to be really interesting, and Professor Shin is great. Only downside is the class was 2 hrs once a week, which is a lot for any subject but particularly this kind of thing.",
    "It's a solid course on some interesting topics. Lectures can be a little dry sometimes, but by the end you have a good grasp of the material. Also counts as a CS credit.",
    "Yes. A great HU for CS majors.",
    "If you're interested in weekly epiphanies, yes. This course will blow your mind.",
    "Take it if you're looking to learn more about logic and have some background in it (maybe from CS 201 or similar classes).",
    "I didn't have much experience with philosophy, logic, or proof-based maths before taking this class. In the beginning, the notation is a lot to get used to. Only at the very end did a lot of things I found confusing come together. The core of this class is interesting but it gets very obfuscated by tricky notation. I took this for a humanities and I'm glad I took it, but only now that it's over. The professor is great and the content is really cool, and more applicable then you think. I definitely recommend if you're a STEM major looking for a humanities credit. My advice would be to focus on the bigger picture behind the proofs first and let the notation come afterwards. Also, prepare well for the class presentation.",
    "Yes, though I would caveat that recommendation by saying that it is not as easy as some recommendations may suggest. I'm not sure if the format changed this year or something, but there was a presentation, oral exam, and a pretty challenging final assignment (pretty much a take home exam), along with some problem sets. And the material itself was pretty challenging for me.",
    "If you're interested in math\/theoretical CS, then yes",
    "If you are interested in the philosophical aspect of computability and logic then I would not recommend taking this class -- it was purely technical proofs and we hardly discussed any of the philosophical implications except in the first class of the semester.",
    "It's a good, interesting course with not such a high workload.",
    "I'm a Computer Science major, and this class was fairly challenging for me. The more technical math\/logical components were tricky, but overall this was a worthwhile and interesting class. I wouldn't take it for practical knowledge, but if you are interesting in the topic of computability, Sun-Joo is a great lecturer and structures the class so that you get the most out of it.",
    "Yes, Sun Joo is amazing. Take this class.",
    "Great class for those who want to understand the basis for a lot of mathematical things that are taken completely for granted, and as a bonus learn about Godel's Incompleteness Theorems near the end.",
    "If you are interested in the underlying theories of comparability and logic, this is a great choice! The class is very technical, but the material is beautiful!",
    "Yes, but recognize you are dealing primarily with formal methods and not with explicitly philosophical content.",
    "Definitely! Especially if you're a CS or math student looking to get an HU credit while also taking a class that will challenge you intellectually."
