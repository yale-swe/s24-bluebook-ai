    "Purely introductory and fair.",
    "See question 1 above and question 7 below.Good, but not as an intro to linguistics. It's definitely better with a linguistics background.",
    "Good class.",
    "The course is a solid introduction to historical linguistics, covering traditional methodologies such as the comparative method as well as newer approaches such as computational phylogenetics. We learned how language reconstruction may contribute to knowledge about linguistic theory as well as prehistorical cultures and population movements. While this is primarily a linguistics course, it does address interfaces with anthropology, archaeology, history, and evolutionary biology. The course is designed for students with widely varying backgrounds in linguistics. I would recommend this course if you are interested in the topic."
