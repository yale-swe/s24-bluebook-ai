   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for students who are really willing to put in the time. If you don't have the time, don't take this class.",
    "Yes, especially with Professor Su. It's a semi-good amount of work, but it's enjoyable.",
    "This class was highly disappointing. I feel like I barely learned anything. The teacher is a nice person and a great scholar, but as a language teacher was very subpar. There was barely any grammar structure or vocabulary learning, which is what language is all about. It was all blown by us as if we were supposed to memorize it just like that. My Chinese actually got worse because this class didn't reinforce or add to anything I learned effectively. If you're coming off a summer from Light, don't take this class. If you're interested in culture, take a lit class or something else, but not this language class. Also, if you want an organized class where you know what's going on most of the time, don't take this one. The teacher never responded to emails, which was quite frustrating. He was such a mess regarding homework and grades and assignments that it became a joke, but also you never knew if you were missing anything or if he happened to not count one of your assignments. This aspect of the class was so frustrating throughout the semester, and alone was reason enough not to take the class if you care. Also, final test on the last day of reading week. Do you want that?",
    "The assignments and textbook are solid. However, since the materials and assignments were prepared by the previous professor (who retired last year), there is a mismatch between what is taught during lecture and what you're expected to know for the homework assignments and exams. Because of this mismatch, do expect to spend quite a bit of time self-studying for this class.",
    "Great class to continue to learn Chinese and practice Chinese. A little disorganized,but Su Laoshi is brilliant and always has some great stories to tell",
    "Good, interesting, manageable class. Take it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to someone who generally enjoys Chinese class and has the self-discipline to keep up with many assignments and learning the material on your own. It's much less detail-oriented, structured, and therefore difficult than Xu Laoshi's class, so be prepared. It's great if you have a Chinese parent who can help you.",
    "Take it if you want to get rid of a credit. It's one of the easier upper level language classes to take as it is mainly dependent on memorization of new vocab. The tests are long, but the professor in general grades easier than the previous professors.",
    "I would not recommend Chinese 162 to anyone who wants to increase their Chinese fluency. You're not going to learn much. I would, however, recommend it to anyone who already has a good grasp of Chinese and needs a 5th class.",
    "No. Stay away or take another L5 class.",
    "More stories, more vocab, more exercises, a lot of essays and recording assignments. Lather, rinse, and repeat. It is supposedly the only way to learn a language in a classroom setting. More flexible scheduling given 3 classes a week, but also gives you more time to procrastinate. Not a bad class, but not extremely brilliant either.",
    "Take it with Su laoshi",
    "Although this was an L5 class and the textbook was pretty difficult, the class was still manageable, with an essay due every other week, a presentation every other week, and weekly exercises that were submitted online. However, the class was very disorganized, and the syllabus changed multiple times over the semester. Essays used to be due every week, but were changed to being due every other week after the teacher couldn't keep up with grading all of them. Wei Su is a pretty funny, engaging professor, though, and he tells some entertaining stories about his experiences in China back in the '80s (apparently he was quite the renegade).",
    "If you feel like you want to keep practicing Chinese after the previous heritage classes, take it. It's easy, laid back and quite fun.",
    "It was a solid high-level Chinese language class. I would recommend it.",
    "Seems like a regular L5 class, but I think there are better L5 classes than this one.",
    "We mostly went through the book. Sometimes, Su Laoshi would add extra information to make the class more interesting. I would definitely recommend it! I learned a lot from it and the class wasn't too overwhelming."
