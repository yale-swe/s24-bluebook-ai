   "comments": [
    "It's a great course to practice your language skills in a relatively relaxed environment. The workload isn't huge, and the discussion is lively. You'll learn if you put the time in, which I highly recommend doing.",
    "If you interested in advancing your composition and discussion skills in Russian, I would definitely recommend this course. Since the structure of the course is fairly flexible, I would say that you have to be proactive in order to really build these skills. That means doing the little weekly assignments, going to the Professor's office hours, and handing in multiple drafts of each essay.",
    "Yes! Professor Titus is always great and the course covers interesting readings. This is one of those ideal L5 courses; it is not too difficult but will help you improve on Russian written and analytical skills that you may not have developed in prior classes. Professor Titus is always willing to help and improve your work too. When it is taught again, you should certainly take this course.",
    "Short stories. In Russian. Russki!",
    "The Russian Short Story is a great class for anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of Russian literature in the original. Julia is a wonderful class leader who knows an incredible amount about her field specifically and literature in general. Class discussions are always enlightening and tend to cover a wide range of subjects, from the author at hand to more modern discourse. The readings are all great - you're reading some of the best Russia has to offer - and there is not too much written work. Julia also highly encourages revisions, which is great for improving your Russian orthography and grammar!",
    "This is a Russian course rooted in reading Russian short stories, just as the name suggests. It's definitely worth taking, maybe in conjunction with a more traditional language class. And worth taking because Julia teaches it.",
    "This is a fab class. There's not too much work, and you'll get a ton out of it. Professor Titus is, as always, an inspiration.",
    "Great introduction to short stories and lots of fun! A good way to keep up your Russian"
