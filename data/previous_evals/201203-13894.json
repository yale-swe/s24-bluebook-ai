    "I wish that the weekly seminars covered a wider variety of topics. It seems like all we hear about is cancer and asthma. The sleep lecture was a welcome change. I know that there are students interested in many other areas, such as fracking, industrialized agriculture, foodborne illness, effects of greenspace in urban settings... let's try to get some speakers on these topics next semester.",
    "very good",
    "great",
    "While it is nice to hear from different speakers, it seemed like many topics were repeated throughout the semester. There was a lot about asthma, cancer, and cook stoves. It would be nice to get a wider variety of topics related to environmental health because not everyone in the department is interested in genetics, cancer, and air pollution\/asthma.",
    "Most seminars were the exact same - gene\/environment interactions. Many of the students don't have hard science backgrounds, and talk about specific mechanisms was wasted breath.",
    "interesting talks but too much focus on cancer.",
    "Great",
    "The obvious strength is that allows for students to learn about the environmentally related work of several professors or guest lecturers from around the country. However, one improvement that I would like to see addressed in the subsequent seminars is that for a few weeks we seemed to be hearing about the same topic presented by several different lecturers. At times the seminar was very focused on genetic markers and indoor pollutants. It would be nice to see more of a variety so that the seminars do not become monotonus.",
    "Poor. Mostly all the speakers dealt with cancer.",
    "It is interesting to hear about research people in the public health people are doing, but I feel like it was not always geared towards the right audience. I have a limited science background, and many of the seminars contained vocabulary and ideas that I had not been exposed to before."

    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0I'm glad he started taking attendance this semester. Last year most students skipped seminar. It was embarrassing. One guest lecturer had to travel to Yale to give our weekly talk and only 8 people showed up. His first comment was, \"Aren't there supposed 19 of you signed up for this class?\"",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0Yong is great, he is amongst the best professors in our department.",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0He is insightful and great",
    "Instructor: Yong Zhu \u00a0The instructor did not teach the course therefore it would be difficult to assess his strengths and weaknesses. But I believe he did a great job of organizing the seminars every week and for having guest lecturers that were passionate about their research and topics. As I stated before I would like to see a little bit more variety as this is a seminar where we can learn about so many different topics.",

    "I would recommend this to another student because the course provides an opportunity to learn from interesting lecturers from several universities and research institutes."
