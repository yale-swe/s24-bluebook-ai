   "comments": [
    "I really improved my Arabic, considering the fact that I knew nearly no Arabic beforehand. I feel like I am more excited to learn Arabic after taking the course.",
    "During this course, I was able to learn a lot of basic Arabic vocabulary (all of what was necessary for the course). Throughout the semester, I became more efficient at developing complex Arabic sentences and learning rules of the language.",
    "I learned Arabic. I already had experience with learning languages and the skill coming therewith, so most of what I learned was Arabic.",
    "I learned how to write, speak, and read the Arabic alphabet and how to have a basic conversation in Arabic. I also learned about different aspects of Arabic culture and music.",
    "This class taught me how to read and write in Arabic! I learned basic verb conjugations, sentence structures and many vocabulary words. I learned much about the evolution of Arabic and how the language operates in the world today.",
    "How to speak in both formal arabic and dialect (shaami), how to write the script and the grammar rules of the language.",
    "We learned the Arabic alphabet as well as basic vocabulary and grammar relevant to Modern Standard Arabic as well as the Shami dialect.",
    "I gained immense skills from this class, as it taught me the fundamentals of an entirely new language. I learned the Arabic alphabet, a large volume of speaking skills, and basic speaking\/translating skills as well.",
    "I learned the Arabic alphabet and sounds, as well as basic vocab and grammatical constructions",
    "ARBC 110 left me with a thorough knowledge of the Arabic alphabet and a basic understanding of MSA grammar. I also learned some basic MSA vocabulary, and began to grasp the differences between MSA and Levantine Arabic.",
    "I started to gain a basic understanding of MSA, and a bit of Shami."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - meeting every day forces you to engage with the language consistently, which is extremely crucial when beginning to speak a new language. Weaknesses - online website homework is not very helpful and very confusing.",
    "This course is excellent at getting students to think independently and not have to rely on the professor for all of their learning. Professor Aziz, unfortunately, didn't teach the curriculum as much as he made us do exercises in class that at the very most reinforced what we did for homework. The exercises that we did in class sometimes helped us practice what we were learning anyway, but were very limited and getting us to think critically about the language. Many aspects of Arabic that I wish were reinforced better would be conjugations, plurals, verb rules in general. I feel that much of what we did was memorization instead of actual application or practical learning. To improve this course, we have to be forced to use the language a lot more and receive clear explanations on important facets of the language.",
    "The textbook is pretty good and I do feel like I learned a good amount of Arabic. I feel like the most helpful improvement would be making speak Arabic more in class other than just in doing exercises and also the professor using more Arabic while teaching, at least by later in the semester.",
    "The course expectations are very clear and the class is easy to follow if you stick with them. The class environment is welcoming: Professor Aziz encourages students to make mistakes in order to learn. I feel as if I have actually learned quite a bit of Arabic, and I've done it all in a fun and engaging way (shoutout Maha). The main strength of the course is, of course, Professor Aziz: he is kind and also very passionate about Arabic (and very knowledgable about the complexities of the language). He is often laugh-out-loud funny, and he makes the entire class a happy environment. I am always excited to go to Arabic because of him! I think the course could be improved with more student participation in discussion, but I also know this was hard to do in my class (which was relatively large), and that we have a lot of material to cover daily. I just personally learn languages best when I have to practice speaking them, and found that to be a slightly lacking area.",
    "One strength of this course is the speed: because we go through the material so quickly, we learned A LOT in one semester. However, it didn't feel too overwhelming. One weakness of this course is that many students clearly came into it with background in Arabic, which put other students at a disadvantage.",
    "It is difficult to study for both shaami and formal arabic for written tests. I feel that shaami could be tested via an oral conversation with the teacher or TA.",
    "One strength about this course is that the instructor manages to engage the class through jokes and anecdotes and makes it very interesting.",
    "The course assignments were not always the most clear; it was not always certain what our homework was, or how to access it (some of our work was done through an online website, and many students had trouble accessing\/paying for the website). Additionally, there was often confusion regarding instructions for assignments, homework expectations, etc. With this being said, the instructor was understanding of website-related issues and accommodated students whenever possible. Ultimately, setting these small issues aside, the course was well-designed to facilitate our learning and help us gain as much knowledge as possible in one semester.",
    "I really enjoyed interactive classes Professor Aziz is great, but I do wish that I was able to take away more from the dialect sessions with the TA",
    "We were definitely exposed to a sizable and useful vocabulary, and Dr. Aziz's grammar lessons were effective and informative. The pacing sometimes seemed uneven though. We worked through the whole 'Alif-Baa' textbook in a few weeks, and then made it through only the first third of 'Al-Kitaab' before the end of the semester. Alif-Baa primarily teaches the alphabet, so I think this was partly because Dr. Aziz wanted us to learn the alphabet by week three and move on, but Alif-Baa also includes a lot of important vocabulary and some important concepts which I wish we had spent more time on.",
    "The strengths of this course are as follows: - strong focus on Modern Standard (written) Arabic - delves into the nitty gritty with grammar and conjugation - great professor - good way to bond with classmates - no final exam -- fun final project instead where you can talk about your life and get to know your classmates The weaknesses of this course are as follows: - very high workload (in the beginning of the semester especially) - little learning of spoken dialects - most of the learning takes place as homework, straight out of the textbook",
    "The beginning of the course was structured strangely. A lot of grammar was pushed onto us before we knew the alphabet, and thus after we had control of the alphabet, we had already skipped over some basic grammar stuff and thus had to self-teach. However, the class is very fun and forgiving."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Arabic to whoever is interested in pursuing anything that is related to the Arab world or the Middle East. However, it is a very tough language, so I would not recommend it to someone that is not willing to pursue it beyond L3",
    "I love Arabic and so I wouldn't want for anyone to not take the class just because of the professor. If your career\/academic goals are ultimately lined up with learning Arabic, I suggest you take the class. Arabic is still a language you'll have the ability to improve on down the line or learn even by yourself, but still this class will allow you to understand some of the very basics. I feel that language classes are less easy to substitute for others if they mean that much to you as compared to an English 114 class which has many sections.",
    "Yeah, Arabic is a cool language (which I why I'm taking it in the first place).",
    "Take this class! Arabic is a beautiful language, and the Arabic department at Yale is amazing. While the workload is slightly more than other classes (hence the 1.5 credit), the work is not hard to do if you keep up with it, and the grading is quite fair. You will actually learn Arabic and make friends in the process (my Arabic class is my squad and that's not a lie). I could not recommend this course more.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is committed to continuing their study of Arabic. It is very much an introduction and not worth much unless you are pursuing your study of the language.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as I believe it provided a solid and interesting introduction to the Arabic language, and made me want to continue learning the language in my next semesters.",
    "I would, but only if they are genuinely invested in learning Arabic and intended to continue it for multiple semesters. The workload is very high in the first half of the course, and this language is difficult to learn if one only takes a single semester. I would absolutely recommend it, but only for a student who views it as a long-term 'commitment' and is willing to continue this language study. It is a very thorough and strong introduction.",
    "Yes! Arabic was intense, but also one of the most rewarding experiences of my academic career thus far",
    "This was a good introduction to Arabic. For me, effectively learning the material and internalizing the language required a bit more work than was necessary to do well in the class, just because the completion-based assignments and relatively rare homework checks sometimes made it easy to ignore the actual content (the finicky Al-Kitaab website was also not ideal -- it crashed occasionally, and the necessary videos often did not load). But Dr. Aziz maintained a fun classroom environment, and I feel like I am ready for ARBC 120.",
    "If you are interested in the Middle East, want to learn about a language as well as a culture, and are willing to work extra hard to understand difficult concepts, then yes! Professor Aziz is a GREAT guy, and he notices if you are trying, even if you're struggling when it comes to tests and quizzes. You will bond over the homework struggle with your peers and be able to form good relationships through that."
