    "You do studio workshops for one class, and visit art museums during the other. YES! Take it. You are always doing amazing projects, and it's such a nice change of pace from must of your other academics.",
    "Art 002 is an interdisciplinary seminar focused on paper. It approaches paper as both substrate and medium, as surface and sculptural. The course has studio time on Tuesdays and gallery or library visits on Thursdays. It is an excellent way to broaden your creative practice, think about the theory of the artistic process, and familiarize yourself with the university's collections and resources. I would highly recommend this course, and I think it provides a wonderful experience to students with any level of arts experience.",
    "Art 002 explores the many ways paper is used as a medium for art. Take this class whether you plan to be an art major or not. There was only one art major in our class, so don't be intimidated! This class provides a free space to be yourself. It is the best! Also, the class trip to NYC is phenomenal. You will have the opportunity to explore so many of Yale's galleries. Good for the soul.",
    "Paper is the perfect class to add to your schedule as a fifth class, especially if you are not taking any other classes in the Arts. It was a refreshing part of my heavy math and science schedule. If you don't take this class, you are seriously missing out!",
    "This was a great seminar to take as a freshman. I would never have taken this class otherwise, but I'm so glad that I went outside my comfort zone. Tuesdays were spent working with our hands in the art building, and Thursdays we traveled around to Yale's different galleries and museums to look at exhibits. Siobhan was a wonderful instructor who truly cared about her students. She was interested in each and every one of us, and remembered what we were involved in around campus. She always had positive feedback when assessing our projects, and she even took us to New York at the end of the year for a class field trip. I would definitely recommend this class: the workload was minimal but the benefits were high. It was also great to be exposed to the resources available to us at Yale!",
    "Art 002 is a class dedicated to learning all about paper. I definitely recommend it because it's a class that provides a different type of work that we're not used to. It's wonderful because we have to work hard, but we're using our creative skills rather than the quantitative reasoning skills.",
    "The best kept secret at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Good for the soul. This class literally got me through freshman spring. You won't regret it!",
    "Paper was a fun, relaxing, and enriching course. Every Tuesday, we spent two hours in our studio, working on group and individual art projects. Our small class became very close, so working together each Tuesday was like hanging out with a small group of friends. Some of my favorite projects included making paper, books, and a geodesic dome from newspaper. On Thursdays, we visited one of Yale's many art holdings, including the YUAG, British Arts, Beinecke, and HAAS. There, we viewed special paper art works and learned more about the history and uses of paper. I recommend Paper to any student. Not only did I have fun each week creating art, but I also feel much more comfortable accessing some of Yale's most amazing resources. Take it. Your friends will be jealous, and you won't regret it.",
    "'Paper' was a very good freshman seminar for someone who has never taken an art course at Yale OR is taking a lot of courses in one area. For me, it was the perfect escape from countless titrations and copious problem sets. It allowed me to think in a different way and express myself though my art. I did not think I would like it at first but by the end of the year I was surprised when I looked upand realized I looked forward to our two meetings every week. Overall, how can you pass up a pretty easy course where you take weekly field trips to fascinating galleries, get to play with paper and art supplies however you wish for 2 hours, and are rewarded at the end of the course with a trip to a gallery in NYC (all expenses paid)?"
