    "I took this course because it is a prerequisite for Intermediate Graphic Design. Typography was fairly similar to Introduction to Graphic Design but the assignments were more difficult and the students were generally of a higher caliber. Many of them were in the Art or Architecture Majors, which I personally found a little intimidating.We did look at typefaces at the start of the course, but there was still a good deal of focus on layout and composition (we designed a small booklet, book covers, table of contents, and a poster). I am not quite sure how this class differs from Intermediate Graphic Design, but I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it to another student, especially if Julian is teaching again. I think that it helped me to continue practicing the skills I (began to) learn in Intro Design and it was great to have feedback from students who were producing good work.",
    "Would definitely recommend! Take it with Julian, if possible, he's the best and his design sensibilities are great.",
    "The class is great for people who are really genuinely interested in typography, but I would say only take the class if you really want to learn about everything related to type, including the minutest of details.",
    "Type 1 is a great class, and Julian is a very helpful and concise professor. Work is done outside of class, and almost all class time is used to critique that work. The first third or so of the semester was spent doing smaller assignments (drawing letterforms, spacing letterforms, variations on a table of contents, and variations on a book cover), while the other two thirds we spent working on a booklet and a modular typeface to be used in a faux architecture lecture series poster (using information from a real one). The critiques could get a little long, but it was definitely worth it in the end (if you're going to take most art classes you should get used to long critiques). You do need to take Intro to Graphic Design previously, but they occasionally allow students to take both classes concurrently.",
    "A very valuable and useful class. Yes, I will recommend it to another student.",
    "Very grateful that I took this course, as I learned so much about how to set text properly (it's harder than it looks). Julian was very devoted to the class and always there to answer questions about class projects via email and after class. Class critiques were constructive, although a bit slow-moving, but greatly helped by Julian's hilarious metaphors and analogies. Expect to put a lot of time into your projects if you want to do well--but they're all so much fun, especially the last two projects that all the previous exercises build up to. Designing a giant poster setting a booklet were both challenging but immensely rewarding.",
    "YES. Absolutely loved it. It is time-consuming, especially if you haven't gotten a whole lot of practice with InDesign in the past, but I found that I devoted so much of my time to it because I looked forward to working on the assignments. The assignments build upon each other in a logical way throughout the semester and you are slowly relieved of the restrictions of the early assignments.",
    "Take it! The work is fun - you get out of it what you put into it. The crits can be a bit dull but that's just how the class has to function.",
    "Wonderful course; I enjoyed all of the assignments and it never felt like real work, only fun stuff. Julian is wonderful, and comes up with the most hilariously inventive metaphors. Take it!",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course if you plan on doing anything graphic design related. I am no longer paralyzed by fonts and trying to pick just the right one.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student with interest in graphic design, whether an art major or not. The class was almost entirely art and architecture majors, but you're neither and did well in intro, you'll be fine (although befriending the arch majors can mean access to the department's laser cutter, which many people used for some projects). The class starts off with week-long exercises, including drawing letterforms by hand, analog letter kerning, a series of tables of contents and book covers, and then moves on to two long projects: designing a book and redesigning an architecture lecture series poster. Choose your text wisely for the book project as you'll use it more than you think to inspire design decisions. Julian appreciates when each choice is backed up by the content. The workload for this course is really what you make it. Some students spent their whole weekends prepping projects for Monday crits and others were in the lab frantically finishing up right as class began.Jessica Svendsen was the most phenomenal TA in the history of the universe. If she's TA-ing for a design class ever again, I would drop everything to take it. She won't be doing this class in the future, but regardless, TA office hours are useful for getting a second opinion and solving frustrating design problems.I recommend taking Type I with a professor other than the one you had for intro because different professors have different styles and tendencies in critique (and Julian's projects felt a little redundant because his version of intro is very typography-heavy)."
