   "comments": [
    "Each class consists of student-led discussions about student-created questions about that week's reading. Reading is typically 200-300 pages a week. Professor Inhorn lets students lead the discussions. Although most of the topics covered are about females and reproductive technologies concerning them, the strength of the reading is the cross-cultural narratives. I learned a lot about cultural relativism, which is really looking at a culture's traditions and social values from an outside perspective. Plus, Professor Inhorn is very knowledgeable, easy-going, and will share with you many things about herself. I really enjoyed this course.",
    "10 ethnographies, 3 papers, 1-2 presentations, a wonderful time! Marcia is simply fabulous - so wise, so kind, such a great professor and woman. Her optimism and passion is just astounding. Though there's a lot of reading, these books will reveal interesting topics and material that you most likely won't be exposed to in as great a capacity as you would if you just took this class. Everyone gets into pregnancy, surrogacy, infertility, abortion, menopause, etc., and examining worlds through the lens of reproductive technologies has been really worthwhile.",
    "Yes I would recommend it! All of my friends were always jealous of what we were discussing and learning about! Small, great discussion. Introduction to an array of topics. Take it if it sounds interesting to you!",
    "You read ten books about reproductive technologies. Those books are almost all split up in half, and each day either one student or two students together lead discussion on that section of the book. Two book reports and a final comparative book review are assigned. Also you'll have to lead discussion at least once.",
    "Reproductive Technologies is like a book club about reproduction. There is a lot of reading involved, but discussions are interesting. You will learn a lot about baby-making. I would recommend this class for students who are at all interested in reproductive health.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Seriously, even if you're a boy. (I'm a boy!) This isn't just a course about reproduction or sex; it'll change the way you think about culture and medicine and power\/control. The way this course works is to start small, with a topic like abortion or even menopause, and use that as a lens to view greater societal conflicts or ethical dilemmas. The only downside is that some of the readings are kind of tedious (you read mostly anthropological ethnographies, which tend to be more academic and thus less interesting), but the class discussions and the movies you watch in class make up for it!",
    "YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS. This is the best class I took in my freshman year. Marcia is amazing-- she really cares about students and about the subject matter, and she picks interesting topics. Of course, the students drive the discussion, but if you are interested in issues of public health and women's rights, you should take this class. Also, the books are great.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend taking the class. Take the class if you are interested in having an introduction to anthropology. Also, take the class if you genuinely want to learn about the cultures covered. You should also take the class because the professor is brilliant and the coursework is very insightful. This can only add to your Yale experience and your knowledge.",
    "take this course if you are interested in women's health, medicine, and feminism and have never thought about approaching medicine through a humanities perspective. the class requires a lot of reading, but the discussions are always engaging and marcia is an excellent professor. the writing workload is also not bad.",
    "It is a book discussion class that covers everything reproductive. I would definitely recommend it if you are at all interested in reproduction and don't mind quite a bit of reading.",
    "Reproductive Technologies is a great freshman seminar, as it allows one to exercise reading, writing, and discussion skills. The class atmosphere was great, with a different student leading the discussion every time. The course really exposes one to a variety of fascinating and controversial topics, and anyone interested in reproductive health, gender studies, or global health would love this class.",
    "Great seminar, discussion based class. You read a book a week and participate in student lead discussions each class. You also watch movies which are all fantastic. Professor Inhorn is amazing, brilliant and kind. She is so understanding and has so many stories and anecdotes to share with the class. TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS FANTASTIC. The work load is definitely manageable but does include a lot of reading. SUCH A GREAT CLASS TAKE IT DO NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY to learn about a super interesting and relevant topic with a great professor."
