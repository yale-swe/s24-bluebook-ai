    "If you're interested in how war changes things afterwards, from taxation systems to racial policies to gender empowerment, this is a great class. The combination of the midterm exam and the midterm essay is somewhat superfluous, but otherwise this is a great class!",
    "An overview of different ways that politics can be affected by war. This course involves a lot of technical reading (academic papers on the subject), 5 page paper, midterm, and 15 page final paper. Work's really doable and largely the topics are up to the student.",
    "I would definitely take it if you want to look at something that isn't just causes of war, which I feel like is a huge part of the political science department. Nice balance between quantitative studies and more qualitative readings. A midterm in a seminar was a bit of a waste, but not terrible. Readings were a bit much sometimes.",
    "This course begins with readings on historical wars and their effects. The second half of the course draws out broader themes of political change and applies them to the cases studied. This is a good course to examine the experimental methods of political science. If you have already taken courses that present questions on social science methodology, this may seem repetitive. If you are looking for a course on how war shapes contemporary politics, this is not the course you are after.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in political violence, state formation, or the methodology of political science."
