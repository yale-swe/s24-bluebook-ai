    "French is a beautiful and useful language to learn, and I do recommend it to others. However, expect to do a lot of assigned work and work outside of class because you will have to turn to other sources to find clear explanations of grammar usage and rules.",
    "A great introduction to French, I would recommend it to anyone. Just be sure to stay on top of the homework (it can pile up very quickly), and practice a lot with the video and audio. If you follow the homework schedule in the course packet, you will do extremely well in the course with no trouble at all.",
    "Yes, if you like French.",
    "Yes, I would recommend French 110 and Mme Grantham to a fellow student, if they are willing to work hard.",
    "I would recommend it. But there are multiple tests\/quizes every week throughout the semester and it requires a lot of work and dedication.",
    "It's a great course but a lot of work. There are tests and quizzes every week plus homework every night. It's really one of those classes where you get out as much as you put in.",
    "Great course! You'll learn the language if you put in the work.",
    "I would recommend this class- I learned a lot of French, although I may have learned more with a different instructor. Nevertheless, I learned a lot especially for an L1 language.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who is serious about French. The class is pretty intense and if you keep up with the work you can learn a lot."
