    "I would recommend this literature\/film seminar. The texts we read and films we watch are actually very good. Professor Syrimis is a fantastic professor, very approachable and seeing how he thinks is amazing. In terms of workload its the standard seminar class: meets once a week, read a book a week, 1 midterm paper, 1 final paper.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! This was the most fun course I took this semester, and really felt like a guilty pleasure. The books and movies you read are excellent and entertaining, and outside of the reading and papers the workload isn't too bad. The class was small, which meant as a group we really got to know each other by the end of the course. While this isn't a class on dystopian novels, there are a lot that we looked at so take this if that's where you're interests lie!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was a learning experience that opened my eyes to questions about privacy surveillance and paranoia that I think everyone should experience. All of the works looked at in the course connect so elegantly to help you draw your own conclusion on the matters at hand. Professor Syrimis did an excellent job orchestrating this."
