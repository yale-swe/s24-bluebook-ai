   "comments": [
    "Although this class had a heavy workload, I did not mind because we learned a lot about the discourse surrounding decolonialism and how that interweaves with literature and film of the 20th century while having fruitful discussions about how to proceed with our evaluation of history and our own standing in academia. The discussions were great because we were able to go in depth about things relating to Japan, Korea, China, and other colonial sites to question our pre-existing understandings regarding identity, empire, and colonialism.",
    "This class not only managed to take us on a whirlwind tour of postcolonial\/decolonial theory, but also its unique application to the region of East Asia. I learned a great deal about how we address scholarship performed in\/about East Asia, especially about the 19th and 20th century. Its been particularly helpful for me, a student of East Asia conducting her studies at Yale, to contextualize my role in knowledge production and awareness of the frameworks of power and knowledge at play.",
    "theoretical and literary analysis of \"decolonization\" in politics, academia (postcolonial studies), culture etc. the problems of (masculine) nationalism how many so-called decolonizing moves were just reproductions of \"imperial desire\" or certain reified modes of thinking (about resistance, defeat, etc)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths definitely had to do with the wide selection of material that we worked with, ranging from short stories to novels to films, since we were able to tease out the continuities and some of the gaps while challenging binaries of thought regarding modernity and colonialism. Professor Poland was also great because he helped guide us in interpreting the texts and contributed greatly to the quality of our discussions. The only weakness would be the extremely heavy reading load, but that became more and more manageable as the semester progressed.",
    "I appreciated how the course managed to balance theory and case studies, as well as pertinent background information. Sometimes, I felt like we bit off more than we could chew, and would just not touch on a reading at all in discussion because we ran out of time (though our discussions were always fruitful). I would be curious as to how the class might improve (or not improve) if the class were more organized around themes than chronological progression through the subject.",
    "sometimes too much class time spent on basic history (which students should be expected to cover on their own) amazing texts and movies, amazing professor great syllabus not so much focusing on East Asia as victim of colonization (which was what I thought the course would be about) but rather cultures of imperialism"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you are remotely interested in East Asian literature\/films or if you are interested in understanding coloniality and its impacts on empire, identity, space, politics, etc!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in East Asia, because regardless of whether the student is interested in ancient texts or modern politics, decolonial theory is incredibly relevant to knowledge production in the 21st century and understanding the unique relationship of East Asia to colonialism\/imperialism is critical to being a self-aware student of East Asia.",
