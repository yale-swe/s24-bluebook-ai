   "comments": [
    "A lot of this course is about preparing you for cocktail parties. In section there is no room to clash with the material - instead you just review what the authors said. The readings are occasionally brilliant and more often impenetrable. The focus is on authors who have been academically valued, so expect all men, plus Arendt (whose work will soon be contextualized with reference to her relationship to Heidegger). Professor Shore is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "HIST 271 is an excellent survey history course of modern philosophers that teaches them in their historical context. Not only do you learn and read about the greatest thinkers in the modern Western tradition, but you get to know why they thought what they thought, and how their ideas affected the world around them. We read amazing things, and I have a much better understanding of different traditions of thought such as modernism, existentialism, structuralism, phenomenology, etc. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's a great foundation for any humanities-type class that has anything to do with the 19th and 20th century. It grounds modern ideas in historical context.",
    "Great class--very interesting material and not a lot of work",
    "The class is an overview of much of continental philosophy. The class operates at a fairly surface level; as someone with some background in philosophy, it was clear that our understanding of the texts was not as rigorous as it could have been. However, the course gives you great \"bang for the buck\"--you get a decent grounding in a lot of influential thinkers (and the material often rings true at a personal, not just academic level). The workload is very manageable. Worth taking.",
    "Absolutely amazing course. Fundamentally challenged and changed my thinking on many aspects of history and philosophy, most notably Romanticism. A great, great intro course to provide a foundation on thinkers you simply have to encounter in your stint on campus: Kant, Marx, Heidegger, Freud, Husserl, Arendt, Derrida, Foucault, Dostoevsky, Hitler, Nietzsche, just to name a few. Really wonderful class. Couldn't recommend it strongly enough to anyone and everyone. Shore is absolutely brilliant. If her charming personality and adorable sense of humor don't lure you in, the knowledge that you're studying with one of the nation's eminent historians of Eastern Europe ought to. She is an incredible, engaging lecturer of prodigious merit. Really, you'd be missing out to forgo this course. Manageable readings with a midterm, final, weekly section, and an end-of-term paper. Not terribly much work at all.",
    "As someone who had never taken a philosophy class before, I thought it was an excellent introduction to a wide range of thinkers and ideas. The combination of philosophy and history made the information more accessible, and you leave Prof. Shore's lectures feeling like you just watched a performance, as she made abstract ideas come to life easily. Amazing class.",
    "A great survey of intellectuals. Definitely recommended even if you are a non-major. Now that I have taken this class I can't stop seeing references to these philosophers everywhere, even in the places you would least expect.",
    "This was a good course overall especially for someone who isn't a history wiz but is just interested in general philosophy\/history or just needs a humanities credit. It is a survey class with a new thinker discussed every class. The material can be abstract at times and requires you to think, but there is very little work - just one essay and section.",
    "ABSOLULTELY TAKE IT. If you are interested at all in the history of ideas, or just take a look at the syllabus and think that you want to know some of the key concepts associated with these influential thinkers, then take this class! The concepts I was introduced to in this class really started to creep into my other courses, and also into my life. Marci Shore is a phenomenal lecturer, definitely go to office hours to talk to her more!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It gave me an excellent overview of some of the greatest thinkers of the 19th and 20th centuries.",
    "I would heartily recommend this course. It's an excellent survey into the many intellectual strains of European thought since the Enlightenment. Professor Shore is a very engaging lecturer who skillfully maintains the delicate balance that intellectual history demands. She's also a brilliant thinker who really engages with the texts assigned. Also, the course work is pretty standard and very manageable.",
    "AAA. Okay, so if the reviews are listed alphabetically, that should allow me to deliver this message: Everyone at Yale should take this class. There's not much work, but the material can be extremely dense. This is not your average history class in terms of understanding significant events and facts and studying the relationship between different history-shaping forces. You are to understand many different philosophies quickly, and that can be quite confusing. However, these are all names that one at Yale should know, and the class is worth it.",
    "This class is a lot of fun: Professor Shore gives you an overview of the ideas of a lot of major thinkers in a fascinating and accessible way. It isn't a lot of work, but the material is fairly challenging. If you're curious about philosophy or history, but don't want to really take a scary course, this is perfect. The class is really interesting, a lot of fun, and not much work beyond the final and final paper at the end of the semester.",
    "The classes were really engaging both because of the material and because of Professor Shore's presentation. If you're looking for a fun, interesting HU where you can feel like you actually learned something but doesn't have too much work, you should take a look at this class!",
    "Survey of intellectual thought from the Enlightenment to the fall of the Soviet Union. A non-traditional history course that challenged preconceived notions. Absolutely recommend.",
    "HIST 271 is a class with great lectures, interesting readings, and reasonable workload. Midterm, paper, and final; the final is like a longer midterm, but the most interesting part of the class was being able to explore authors on our own for the paper. You learn a lot about the history of modern (and post-modern) intellectual thought in this class, though be warned that this class DOES NOT focus on the philosophies themselves. The class is meant to be accessible to anyone regardless of background. As long as you have a basic sense of European history pre-war, inter-war, and post-war, then you're good to go. (I'm a science major and I took AP Euro in sophomore year; five years later, I was fine.) Take it if you want to learn about lots of theories! Certainly not a practical class, as far as living day-to-day goes, but it gives you a lot of food for thought.",
    "A must take at Yale - it's an interesting look at what happens to God's death after Nietzsche's proclamation that God is dead. Unlike many other philosophy classes, the readings are incredibly manageable and the workload is pretty low. The material is very interesting, and Professor Shore's enthusiasm shows in every lecture. Her lecturing style may take a bit to get used to, so definitely shop it to see if you like the way she leads a class, but absolutely a class worth taking before you graduate!",
    "Here is this course in a nutshell: Enlightenment occurs and along with it the exaltation of reason. The romantic revolt happens and along with it the exaltation of passion. However you can't un-storm the Bastille and so GOD IS DEAD. Modernity - people start wondering how we replace God, and - structuralism - decide that the best way is with structures and then change their mind and say that - post-structuralism - actually no, there is no God and no structures to replace God. BUT MAYBE EVERYTHING IS JUST A SMALL MOMENT IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF GOD. The end. If the above summary seems exciting to you, take the course. The first portion of this class is admittedly quite good. The impressionable shopper is lured in by Professor Shore's delightful opening lectures on her philosophy of history, the enlightenment, and romanticism. However, shortly after the death of God, the class takes a downward turn. The second portion of the course is severely lacking in substance. We are introduced to certain thinkers during lectures and more and more over the course of the semester, the majority of the lectures are spent not on discussing the ideas of the thinkers, but instead on superfluous biographical information. It would often be the case that ten minutes would be remaining in lecture and the professor had not yet begun discussing the actual ideas of the relevant thinker. The course overall is also very much lacking in diversity of thinkers - although we were informed of this from the beginning. But actually it would have been nice to read really just anyone who was not a self-hating jew. Seriously someone behind me in lecture one day was surreptitiously looking up Sartre on Jewornotjew.com because there were so many white jews covered in this course he needed to know if Sartre was one of them. The class is also extremely repetitive. There are several phrases that are used again and again throughout the course and once you know them there is not really that much else to know. Exaltation, you can't un-storm the Bastille, you are always already in the world, etc. Finally, you should know that despite being a history course, there is very little history in this history course. Overall I would summarize this course as a strange combination of biography and watered-down philosophy that ultimately leaves you feeling relatively good about yourself in terms of how many buzzwords and phrases you know but also puzzled, and unsure if you actually learned anything. Oh also the paper seems short and easy but is actually kind of awful to write.",
    "If you really want to delve in, take a specific seminar. This is very survey.",
    "Even though it was a weird hybrid course, I would definitely recommend it to someone else. This was by far one of my favorite lectures, Prof Shore is a compelling speaker and the philosophies and thinkers discussed will completely change your way of seeing the world. As son as you get over the fact that it's not a really a history class but not really a philosophy class either, I think anyone would appreciate this class.",
    "Great readings, although their are hardly any (which I actually think could be changed). This material is really important. Especially important for freshman, gives them a background in philosophy that will serve them for years.",
    "I would recommend this class to a Philosophy or DS student but NOT to a fellow history student.",
    "Don't particularly recommend. While I did learn a lot of names and buzzwords, I found lectures frustratingly vague, the syllabus dangerously homogenous, and the overall takeaways repetitive.",
    "This is a very cursory glance into the history of thought (so more emphasis on the context than a typical philosophy class) and will not please people who are really looking to engage with these thinkers. Think DS but at double the speed. Not a big workload at all (midterm, 6-8pg paper, final).",
    "A great class to take if you're a studying anything that intersects with European intellectual s. It covers some of the most important thinkers of the past two centuries, and serves as a great introduction to philosophy and intellectual history. The readings are fairly short, if occasionally very dense, but certainly worth it.",
    "Truly a fantastic course. Professor Shore is engaging and really does a great job tying together the thinkers with common themes. You only get a taste of each of them, but the course is a great introduction to philosophy since the Enlightenment. The readings don't take too long, and most of them are somewhat dense but very interesting. Definitely definitely take the course",
    "It was a good intro but only an intro. You won't leave feeling like you understand them all, but you'll have an idea.",
    "The world will not look the same to you after taking this class and for that it is the best class I have ever taken. An alternative name for this course could be how to lead an authentic life. Gives you a bite size taste of the great minds of western philosophy in light of the turn to modernism. Professor Shore's lectures are amazing. Theres such drama to them-- I left quite a few with tears in my eyes. She really does love what she's doing and what she gives you is a philosophical approach that will actually enrich your life.",
    "Aamazing course. A must take if you have any interest in continental philosophy or European history in general. Marcis ability to take the complex history of continental philosophy and boil it down into 50 min lectures was tremendous. The best part of this class was the connection of themes from different thinkers and how the connected across different thinkers.",
    "A great survey course of philosophy. Tackles thinkers more than it does any history. Marci Shore is eccentric, but a fantastic lecturer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Excellent survey course. Professor Shore is a brilliant lecturer and you learn a great deal about European history and individual thinkers.",
    "Take this class! It's one all Yale students should take. Overall, it was exactly what was promised: a sampler course on modern European intellectual history. If you want to delve more deeply into any one philosopher or philosophy, this class is not for you. It is meant to cover a good breadth and we didn't get bogged down in heavy readings or too much detail. Instead, the class will give you a \"feel\" or \"mood\" of each person's philosophy, and a solid basic understanding.",
    "Take Intellectual History! Such an incredible class!",
    "When it's a hit, it sticks. When it's a miss, you really feel disappointed because the material is very provocative.",
    "A great question. I hate to say it because I may not have ended up doing as well as I would have liked, but this is perhaps one of the best classes at Yale. Everyone should take this class to understand the Western history of thought and appreciate where modern thinking fits in.",
    "Best class I've ever taken. I had not had much exposure to philosophy before taking this class, so all the ideas were revolutionary to me. Seeing the ideas in chronological order really makes the course cohesive. Also makes more explicit the way the authors are in dialogue with each other through time. Lectures are what really make this class excellent; professor Shore presents the material so well, and you can see how excited she is about every topic, which makes investing time in the readings easier. Mostly primary sources. Reading are not essential if you go to lectures, but you should do the readings for section discussion.",
    "European Intellectual History since Nietzsche provides you with a solid foundation for future philosophical investigation and study. This may go without saying, but you will not go in depth into any given philosopher in class (though you might do so with your final paper, depending on how much effort you put into it; I suggest you put a good amount, as it's more rewarding that way). Rather, it is a sampler. You'll understand the historical context, what kinds of questions are prevalent for each philosopher and other philosophers of his (or her) time, and general themes and issues that all of these thinkers are grappling with. This class has given me a lot more confidence in approaching previously unapproachable texts - like Heidegger's Being and Time, which I'm starting to read now! I definitely feel that I am getting more out of reading these works now that I did before I took the class, and I think that's the real takeaway. I would recommend this class, though I wouldn't set your expectations too high. It'll be cool, but it won't be amazing-all-the-time-mind-blown-cool. It will be sometimes, but more than that it will give you (some of) the tools you need to approach very important and compelling philosophical texts. Take the class, but be aware that you'll have to deal with pseudointellectuals and their irritating comments, but such is life (or more specifically life at Yale...). Have fun when you take the course!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend to a fellow student. A really important overview, but perhaps good to have a background in modern philosophy (at least Kant) to truly make the most of the course.",
    "It's a great survey course for the material, and if you give it a chance, you may end up loving it.",
    "A broad overview of some of the ideas which dominated Western intellectual and political life since Hegel.",
    "A great overview of 20th century intellectual history - especially a good follow-up course for Directed Studies students. The class is certainly more on the philosophical as opposed to the historical side of the spectrum, but that's to be expected with intellectual history. Moreover, this class seems to draw a lot of really smart and engaged students, so the sections (if you have a good TF) are productive and thought-provoking.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The lecture is great and the readings are manageable. Both are pretty mandatory, but I'd say the lectures are more important. If you're willing to listen and take a lot of notes, this course should be a favorite.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Must take.",
    "I would summarize it as a contextual look at modern European philosophy. It is learning how intellectual theory reacted to its historical environment. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it extremely stimulating and thought-provoking.",
    "A must-take for anyone seeking to understand why we think the way we do.",
    "Great class if you dont have much philosophy background - gives you a good overview of several important thinkers of the time.",
    "It's a straightforward and interesting class to take, especially if you have little or no background in the important philosophical thinkers discussed in the class. Professor Shore is an entertaining lecturer and she makes the complex ideas much clearer for students.",
    "This class is incredible and one that everyone should take. It provides the historical\/intellectual background to explain where we are and why we think the way that we do in the 21st C. Absolutely fascinating and well taught. It's the main reason I want to be a history major",
    "Great sampler course of great thinkers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Would definitely take it.",
    "Professor Shore is a fantastic lecturer and if you have any interest in European intellectual history it is probably worth taking the class just to hear her lectures. The workload is relatively light and the class covers a large number of thinkers rather quickly so its a good fifth class. Write quickly on the exams.",
    "Take it take it take it take it take it.",
    "I honestly loved this course. Shore is a phenomenal lecturer, and the course is an awesome survey of 20th century philosophy. Shore does an awesome job of framing the postmodern turn by starting with the Enlightenment and moving through Nietzsche, then through Lenin, the existentialists, structuralists, into post-structuralists. Take this course!!",
    "This is an ambitious course on the part of the instructors it is a rather surface-level survey of intellectual thought from Enlightenment through Postmodernity. I think it is an excellent introduction to modern\/postmodern philosophy, and would recommend it to someone in the earlier part of their education at Yale to provide a basis for further exploration of these authors.",
    "Take it",
    "Great course, definitely take it if you get the chance. It's an easy class to take for a credit but you would benefit much more from it if you took it for a grade and really immersed yourself in the readings. I very much appreciated the historical foundation of the course. Try to get a TF that is further along in their graduate program because they are more likely to have read full texts rather than just the excerpts for the course, and that makes a big difference in section."
