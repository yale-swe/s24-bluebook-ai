    "I'd recommend this class if you are interested in theorising power and in learning about how other scholars have theorised it, from various disciplinary perspectives and from various historical periods. I feel well-equipped now for future academic work relating to power.",
    "Yes. This is the best seminar I have taken in graduate school.",
    "It's an interesting idea for a course but the readings are kind of all over the place. On the other hand, if you haven't thought about theories of power before this is a nice introduction. You might get the most out of the case studies if you have already read Marx, Weber, Gramsci, Foucault, etc. Because the case studies range so widely, there will probably only be a couple books relevant to your work or your departmental exams but it should be a useful exercise for most students to spend a semester thinking about power dynamics."

   "comments": [
    "I feel much more conceptually armed to undertake ambitious analytical projects, though I do not yet know how skillful I may be with those arms.",
    "This course gave me new theoretical tools for thinking about and analysing power and it gave me more confidence in using those tools in my own work. It was great the way we read books from different academic disciplines and saw how different scholars have approached this theme.",
    "I have thought more about power dynamics specifically and intentionally this semester than in any other semester. To that end, I feel like it was a useful course for me. I was a little disappointed to not get a chance to read more deeply into some of the fundamental theoretical texts."
