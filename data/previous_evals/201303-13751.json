    "There was a lot of reading for this course each week plus weekly reflections. So maybe 10 give or take.",
    "The reading load of this class is unrealistic, but Shelley adopted a policy of starring the most essential readings, which was extremely helpful. Prepare to spend an entire day doing the reading for class and writing a reading a response. This class was very back-heavy, with most of the class grade decided by the paper and other assignments at the end of the term. We found out that the final paper needed to be 15-20 pages SINGLE spaced toward the end of the semester, which made a lot of stomachs drop. I also spent a lot of time critiquing others' paper drafts (a 2 page response) and making a powerpoint presentation of my paper. The critiques might be better to do after the presentations, as it was a major challenge to read everyone's papers and write critiques, as well as incorporate others' feedback on my paper into my presentation. Not much sleep that week.",
    "I would spend most of my time outside the classroom reading (about 5-7 hours, because this class is heavily based on assigned readings. However, it is much worth it.",
    "I spent on average 3-4 hours outside of class during the normal semester, the work load is substantially heavier towards the end of the course.",
    "At least 5-10 hours per week. There is a substantial amount of reading.",
    "4-5 on a typical week, much more with a special assignment"

    "This class is very well organized. The topics each week transition very nicely and the readings always complement each other. There are a ton of readings, but they're good readings, and Shelley does a good job at highlighting which readings should be focused on more and read in more depth.The final paper preparations (draft due early, critiques, and presentations) seemed a bit overkill at first, but it all actually sets us up to produce much stronger final papers. Shelley know's what she's doing by giving these assignments.The weekly reading reflections were a little difficult to get submitted two days BEFORE class, but I understand the rationale for that. The reflections also forced me to do the readings more thoroughly than I would have otherwise, which also means I got more out of the readings than I would have otherwise.",
    "strengths are students get to be active in class and learn course concepts in depth.weaknesses would be not hearing enough of professor's expertise.",
    "Outstanding course that provided students with an in-depth understanding of health disparities (what they are, the social determinants, why they are and pushed students to explore different ways to successfully address them). Course format encourages engagement and interaction of all participants.The multiple levels of diversity represented in the class provided additional level of richness to the journey.",
    "Although the reading is laborious, it is very very good if you're interested in health disparities in the US. I think this class represents how we ought to be approaching public health in todays world, because it evaluates the upstream determinants of health--unjust laws, discrimination, geography, education, etc--in great depth as well as downstream determinants (health care, doctor-patient relationships, etc). Shelley is brilliant and challenges how her students think about the determinants of health disparities. Furthermore, she made us think about how we would address health disparities, which I think often gets lost in other classes' focus on DESCRIBING the problem. In fact, I think part of each class could be spent discussing ways to intervene against the given determinant of a disparity, rather than saving those discussions for the end of the semester.In summary, this class is a lot of work, but it's a must take if you're interested in US health disparities, and the relationship you develop with Shelley is invaluable.",
    "1. excellent group discussions. The class is structured so that each class is based on previous discussions, I found this very helpful.",
    "Overall the course was fantastic. There was a substantial amount of reading and the course was time intensive but you walked away learning so much and really engaging with the material through reading and the class discussions.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken in my time at Yale. We went through the topic of health disparities so thoroughly - from low-level to high, from describing the problems to prescribing and evaluating solutions. The discussions were engaging and varied, and the instructor was phenomenal. Extremely proud of the work and thinking I produced in this class.The weaknesses for this class are the following: 1) there was no formal evaluation during the semester so I had no idea how I was doing in the class. I could guess based on verbal feedback from the professor, but we didn't get \"grades\" for anything 2) the semester was extremely back-loaded. The amount of time I put into this class for the last 3 weeks of class was extraordinary, between writing two versions of the paper, reading everyone else's, giving critiques, and doing a presentation.",
    "Prof. Geballe is an amazing and supportive professor. The legal perspective offered in this course is invaluable."

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is great! She brings a much needed legal and policy perspective to a topic that's usually more grounded in epidemiological studies and social theories. She has taught the class for many years, and it's extremely clear that she makes improvements year after year. She facilitates discussion well and knows how to push us. I really appreciate that.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is a great instructor- she has really insightful knowledge, but always encourages us to share our own opinions and thoughts.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Great professor.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an awesome professor! Her previous experience as a civil rights attorney and her background as a MPH give her a unique perspective on the issue of health disparities. She is a talented facilitator who was able to quickly lead the class to develop comfort and trust sufficient to allow deep and meaningful conversations about difficult topics. She is one of the absolute best professors I have had in my academic career.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Excellent professor!! Shelley was very approachable and gave feedback on our work which I found very important in writing my final paper. Additionally, the course material is hardly touched on in other classrooms which makes this course very valuable.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0She is a wonderful professor, very knowledgeable, and brings a different perspective not often available from public health faculty. Able to encourage students to think in a systems perspective rather than by single determinant of health. Has very high standards of students which elevates work in the course.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is fantastic. She has a wealth of knowledge and is really sensitive to student needs. She helps facilitate the class in such a way that it is dynamic, interesting, engaging and you really do learn so much.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0I have nothing but praise for Shelley. She has a wealth of knowledge, wisdom, and insight on this topic, and it was a joy when she shared that with us in class. She has the uncanny ability to take what you say or write and give it just a little nudge to push it from \"good\" to \"excellent,\" and that is exactly what a professor should do."

    "A small discussion-based overview of health disparities in all its forms and facets.",
    "This class is really worth taking, whatever your background\/concentration. The readings will seem really overwhelming at first but after a while you'll get used to it and Shelley marks the ones that she thinks you should focus on. If you are prepared, and do a good job reviewing the materials beforehand, the class discussion can be really great. If you're willing to put the work in, this will be one of the best classes you take at YSPH.",
    "Lots of work, but great class.",
    "This course is a journey through the issue of health disparities that is led by a phenomenally skilled conductor...a journey not to be missed!",
    "I would recommend this to any student at YSPH or Yale. I believe a course like this is very important to a career in any professional setting. This class makes one think beyond the classroom. Most importantly we focused on acknowledging health disparities in our society and how we as public health students\/ future professionals can tackle and change these issues.",
    "A lot of work, but will learn a tremendous amount about causes of disparities in the US. Will learn to discuss them systematically and eloquently. Much of the quality of the course well depend on peers and preparedness of other students in the course to keep discussion going. Shelley does agood job of synthesizing points and keeping conversation going.",
    "I would say that the class is fantastic and definitely worth taking. It is a lot of work and there is a lot of reading but you walk away with a really well informed understanding of the issues behind health disparities and a feeling of accomplishment once you have finished the final assignment. Its a great course!",
    "Absolutely take this class regardless of division, or even school. The topic of health disparities spans beyond just the health sector, and this is clear from day 1 of the course. It is a lot of work, but definitely worth it. This class is what comprehensive education looks like.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course, for the content and the professor."
