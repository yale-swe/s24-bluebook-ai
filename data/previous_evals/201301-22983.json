    "I would recommend the class to someone who is looking for a science credit without wanting a very intensive class.",
    "A survey course that meets once a week on different fields of science, taught by guest lecturers who are experts in their fields. Very interesting, not high commitment, definitely worth taking for those who want a broad introduction to different fields of science, and don't mind having class on Friday afternoons!",
    "I would only recommend the course to humanities or social science students who have an interest in the natural sciences but don't know enough about them to pursue further studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend SCIE 030. It is not a demanding course but highly informative. I think it's intended for non-science majors but as a science major, I still found the material new and at times, challenging. The small class size facilitates discussion and allows students to easily ask questions."
