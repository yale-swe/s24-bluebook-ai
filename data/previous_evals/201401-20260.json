    "Math 231 is the continuation of an introduction to different math topics: primarily calculus and linear algebra. The class is proof-based and requires a significant commitment of time and effort, but is very rewarding. The class was ultimately very fun, but I would not recommend taking the class without having taken Math 230, or another proof based math class.",
    "Math 231 is an amazing course. It isn't as fast-paced as 230, but the problem sets are still quite long. By this point though, you should be used to that. You learn a lot more about differential topology, the language of differential forms, and Stokes' theorem, which gives a great foundation of understanding for future mathematics and physics.",
    "It is a shame that Prof. Hadari will no longer be teaching at Yale; he truly has a gift for this material. If you're considering 231, then you already took 230 and you know what's expected of you. You'll build up to Stokes' theorem using a lot of different tools, but significantly more analysis at the expense of algebra (compared to 230). Strongly recommended for anyone who liked 230.",
    "Math 231 is a fantastic course. It's basically the same drill as last semester. The problem sets are somewhat harder, but will probably take less time because you're better at math by this point. The course slows down during the second half of the semester, since we enter more foreign material while covering some topics in differential topology and integration on manifolds, but it's still a pretty wild ride. Hadari is, as always, a god among professors.",
    "Yes, pls take b\/c it will make your math skillz better",
    "This is a lot of work, but it should be that way and if you took 230 you know what you're in for. The stuff you learn this term though is so much cooler. Hadari will be greatly missed, but whoever teaches it should be pretty great. Plus, the classmates will become your good friends if you care to work together.",
    "If you are reading this, you have probably took math 230. Also, Hadari will not be teaching the course next year so I expect the course will be very different. Nevertheless, if you are interested in math, definitely take 230\/231.",
    "If you are seriously considering majoring in math, this is a must-take course. You see SO much incredible mathematics. It's overwhelming, but at the same time exhilarating. FIND A PSET GROUP IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!",
    "Hard work, but great learning experience. Worth it for someone interested in higher level mathematics.",
    "Math class for people who want an accelerated path for math.",
    "This course will whip you into shape in a mathematical sense. You will learn more about forms than you even knew existed. This course is very difficult but extremely rewarding.",
    "Its a course that covers a generalized form of vector calculus and integration covering differential forms, De Rham cohomologies, generalized Stokes theorem and more.",
    "Math 231 was excellent, really great. I just am not sure it will be the same without Professor Hadari though.",
    "Math 231 is a continuation of Math 230. In this half of the course you will cover integration on manifolds. You'll learn about Stokes's Theorem and all the special cases of that, basing this on knowledge you'll gain of the exterior derivative and forms. Also there's a lot more room for what ever the instructor wants to cover, which can be pretty much anything. Hadari was a great professor and made you love math. If you didn't take 230, I'd advise you not to take 231. Otherwise you know what you're in for.",
    "Hard.",
    "Don't shop this course for the sake of shopping this course. It'll kick your ass through and through, but it's so incredibly worth it if you can stick it out. You'll learn a ton, feel like you know nothing, and then show up for an exam and surprise the hell out of yourself.",
    "You do tons of math and you learn a decent amount of it. Not for the weak of heart"
