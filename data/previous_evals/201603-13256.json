    "It is more practical than theoretical. I like to know the principles before I learn how to achieve it in the SAS, but the class is focusing on the latter. I think it would be better helping me to interpret results if I know the mechanism first.",
    "useful course on modeling and using data if there are more practical questions for students to solve, it would be better.",
    "This course is useful",
    "The lectures are informative and discuss the selected topics very clearly. Both our theoretical knowledge and SAS programming skills can be improved by the combination of lectures and lab sessions. The lecture notes are well organized and to the point, which makes it easy to review after class.",
    "It's very clear and easy to understand even for layman.",
    "Great.",
    "Strength: The course materials are really helpful. Weakness: Instructor's presentation skills. Workload of this course is really large. Lack of HW solutions.",

    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor is kind of shy and struggling with her speaking. But once you get used to it, you will find she makes the explanation plain and detailed. Her slides are concise and the textbook she is using is very informative.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Her oral English needs to be improved",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Very friendly and responsive, she clearly wants to help students succeed. She struggles to keep control of the classroom, however, as a large majority of students are ignoring her as she speaks (talking among themselves, laughing, coming late and leaving early, playing games on their computers, etc.). I would love to see her get the respect in the classroom that she deserves, although she may need to be more assertive in commanding it.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Prof. Wang is good, very professional in catogorical data analysis and modeling. if lectures can be taught more clearly, that would be perfect.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Her lecture notes are very organized",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang's lectures are informative and helpful and the lecture notes are a great complement or summary of the textbook. Dr. Wang is also kind and responsive to our questions. Discussion with her after class helps me a lot in learning this course.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She helps me a lot!",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She is a great instructor. If her spoken English is better, this course would be perfect.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Prof. Wang is really nice. However, her presentation skills really need to be improved. In addition, I would suggest to use R as the primary language for this course, since both Prof. Wang and the TA are more familiar with R. Lastly, it would be really helpful if there are solutions for homework assignments."
