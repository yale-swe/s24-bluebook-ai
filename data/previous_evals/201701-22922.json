    "I learned a lot about the rational actor model of addiction from the economics portion of this course. I also learned about different philosophical theories of addiction, especially with regard to free will.",
    "As a psych major it was very good to get a philosophical perspective on the topic of addiction.",

   "comments": [
    "The multidisciplinary approach to the concept of addiction in the law was great. The syllabus was robust and I will continue looking back at it. The class could have been better organized, in my opinion, as the professors did not always seem on the same page. However, I think that was mainly attributable to this being the first time the class happened. Overall I think the multiple perspectives was greatly beneficial.",
    "Law students are good at asking questions and debating, but sometimes we would get into it before we got into the meat of the discussion and the topic of the day got derailed into debates about minute points. A moratorium on questions (other than for clarification) in the first half of each class might have been helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! If any of the perspectives interest you, take this! You will benefit from the other perspectives while deepinging your understanding of the perspective you're most comfortable with.",
    "This was a very good class. The readings were challenging, and the only assessment is a 30 page term paper on a topic of your choice, so that's somewhat stressful, but the readings and discussion are very interesting and engaging.",
    "If they're interested in addiction absolutely. Otherwise it might be a bit too specific\/narrow. But I thought it was excellent and 10\/10 would take it again!"
