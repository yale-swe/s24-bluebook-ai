   "comments": [
    "The pracicum at a school for students with autism really made the course successful, it was great to be able to have firsthand experience to relate class material to. Seminars were interesting overall, but often repetitive from week to week because different people present each time and don't know what others have already discussed.",
    "Absolutely take it! Even if you are not a psychology major, this class is eye-opening. You get to work with some of the best researchers in the field!",
    "If you are at all interested in Autism, take this class... this is as good as it gets. Then again, if you aren't interested in Autism, really, don't take this class, because that is all there is.Warning: the placement can be very intense, but a wonderful learning experience, and lots of fun.",
    "First off, this class is not easy to get into. However, if you are lucky enough to get a spot in this lecture\/seminar, HIGHLY consider it. You will not find a better teach of lecturers in any similarly structured course at Yale and is very likely the best course on Autism in the country. You sit in on a new guest lecturer every class, but there are always opportunities to ask questions and the professors who speak generally conduct research at Yale, so are always available to answer questions. I met one instructor who gave such a great lecture that I was fortunate enough to talk to her about post grad opportunities and to experience work as an RA in her lab one day. The workload is manageable, as you are responsible for one very comprehensive paper on the topic of your choice, but other than that it is a real treat to just sit in on the lectures and get a glimpse into the state of current research on autism.",
    "Anyone who wants to understand more about autism should take this course. Individuals with and without psych experience will take a lot out of this class.",
    "Yes, if you're truly interested in this subject. Otherwise, lectures might get a bit boring. Also, be prepared that your final grade basically boils down to the last paper. While there is essentially no work for this class during the semester and only one hour and a half lecture each week, there is the 3 hour observations per week, for which you have to travel to off campus, so all in all this class takes up the same amount of time that other classes do.",
    "Love this class and honored to be accepted into it. Fit right in to schedule and great for understanding Autism related disorders. Would definitely take it again and the professors actually care about you.",
    "It is a seminar with various guest speakers all experts in their fields and studying various apsects of autism. There is also a practicum placement either with adults with aspergers or autism that you are expected to go to three hours a week.",
    "yes, i would definitely recommend it to someone at all interested in autism, but don't expect a seminar style class. it is a series of lectures. interesting but not too interactive and you don't get to know the professors very well. the practicum placement is great!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in autism! It is a very unique opportunity \/ experience and you learn A LOT about the disorder through the very interesting lectures and work at the practicum sites. The different placements are all very different, and all yield very distinct experiences, but overall the course is very informative and provides a very hands-on perspective at the disorder and the research surrounding it.",
    "It is a sweeping introduction to Autism. Through academic lectures, on site experience, and exposure to other nonacademics affected by Autism in some way, we saw Autism through many angles.",
    "This was a very interesting class in which students were able to learn from experts, however it is not a seminar, it is a lecture series and there is not very much discussion. There was not too much work andthe field placement was a good experience."
