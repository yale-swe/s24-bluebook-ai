    "Harries is a brilliant lecturer and the content of the course is very interesting if you have a genuine interest in Descartes, but it is run like a lecture (not a seminar) and there are no opportunities for participation whatsoever.",
    "Unfortunately, I think the class was a bit of a disappointment overall. Though this was technically a seminar, it was essebtially a lecture, as Professor Harries would comebto class every week with a typed lecture and proceed to read verbatim from the printed pages. This was incredibly unengaging and I struggled with this format the entire semester. There were few opportunities for discussion, and when people asked Professor Harries a question or he asked the class a question, the response was always relatively brief, from both parties. I think that the lecture-reading kind of suffocated the discussion spirit. His notes were extremely valuable and insightful, and it really was wonderful that he made them available on classes v2, but I don't think reading from them in class is the way to go. Rather than take the class, just read one of his books..."
