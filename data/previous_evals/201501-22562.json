   "comments": [
    "Run away. Choose anything else. Convince your DUS to let you take the 170s or the 200s. I would literally rather get ebola than go to this class.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to. It is terrible and I would recommend taking 201 because I heard it was taught better.",
    "The class is terrible and I would not recommend you taking it unless you have to. Terrible teaching, inadequate TAs and confusing textbook. Did I say that you are expected to learn the material ON YOUR OWN and then have it tested in class? If you are taking it, find another textbook.",
    "It's the most tolerable of the intro physics classes, but take it only if you absolutely need to.",
    "Phys 181 covers the electromagnetism side of introductory physics. It is extremely interesting and challenging but not overly so. I would definitely recommend it to another student, as it is very useful for many STEM related fields.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "I really enjoyed PHYS 181 with Professor Maruyama. She's such a kind and caring professor and I would definitely recommend taking it with her. The class isn't curved but that also means that the exams are not bad at all. The problem sets were great and not too challenging. Overall, I learned a lot from this class!",
    "It would not be a good idea. I am sure changes will be made by next year but I would still try to take 201 if you think you can or 171 if that works for your requirement. The class just simply is not good.",
    "Honestly, probably not. This is a weird question, no one decides whether or not to take this class. People have to take this class, and they suffer through or are pleasantly surprised as a result. It's niche relative to PHYS 201 and PHYS 261 is secure, it's for all the people who haven't had physics before and just want the basics. That's what i'd tell someone who was interested.",
    "A good intro physics class. Take the one with smaller class size if you enjoy class interaction.",
    "This course is not great. There is a lot of point-chasing due to mandatory weekly \"study halls\" and class participation points. Due to the devotion to this \"flipped classroom\" idea, you need to do the bulk of the work independently outside of class. The lecturers are both lacking, and class time is bogged down by silly online clicker questions. On the other hand, once you spend time with the material, almost all of the questions on exams come from previous exams, problem sets, or in-class questions, which makes everything much easier, if tedious. I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone, but if you have to take a calc-based physics, this is much less difficult than 201.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's not super exciting and you'll have to invest a substantial amount of time, but as long as you make a consistent effort and keep up, you'll definitely get it. The concepts aren't that convoluted, but they are often unintuitive, so you need to spend time with them.",
    "Expect a lot of work on your own to learn challenging concepts.",
    "The material is cool and important, and you probably need to take the class. Even if it's not a requirement I think learning E&M at some point in life is worthwhile, but this class is not very good, so you might look elsewhere if you can.",
    "PHYS 181 is most aligned with the Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism high school course. This course is flipped, which means it relies heavily on efforts put outside of the classroom to learn the material. In general, I am not a big proponent of the flipped classroom structure. However, when choosing between PHYS 201 and PHYS 181, it is important to keep in mind that PHYS 181, although a bit less time-consuming, is not necessarily easier\/does not necessarily ensure a better grade.",
    "Phys 181 is a good background in Electricity & Magnetism. If you have any experience in E&M from high school, you will be fine in terms of your grade. If you do not, the professors were not great at explaining these concepts, so it might be more difficult for you. There is some busy work, but less than in 180.",
    "If you have to take PHYS 181, then take it. If not, avoid it as it can be a disappointing experience. Very little is taught in the course at all."
