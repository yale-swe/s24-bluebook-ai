    "The fables of studio will be told and retold to you by the time you are looking at these course reviews. There is nothing one can say that can assuage you at the amount of work that you will produce, nor is there anything I can say to prepare you for how much you are about to learn. Take it easy and enjoy the journey.",
    "As a required course for the architecture major, it doesn't seem quite accurate to \"recommend\" or not recommend junior studio. What I would say is for potential students to not be scared of this class. Yes, the workload is \"much greater,\" and yes, you have probably heard of the frequent all-nighters. While it is a lot of work, you can still sleep, and you can still produce great work. You will learn a ton in this class and should hopefully be excited for it.",
    "If you aren't an architecture major, obviously don't take it. If you are, don't worry. It's very challenging, and will be the most time-consuming class of your semester, but it will also be your favorite. It is fun, brings the class together, and will make you explore your creative and artistic mind in ways you have never done before.",
    "Great but time-consuming class.",
    "Yes. You kind of have to take it, but still, it's a lot of fun.",
    "ARCH 250 is Junior Studio for Architecture Majors. If you are in the major, this is required so buckle up and enjoy the ride. Bimal is your DUS and an incredible professor. Be prepared for some late nights, and to keep those to a minimum DON'T PROCRASTINATE. I know its easier said than done, but really try to start early. Good luck!",
    "Obviously if you're an architecture major, you will be in this course, so no meaningful choice there. You should be ready for a workload that moves exponentially faster than analytic model\/drawing, and for much higher expectations. The workload at times seems insurmountable, but the important thing to get through this course is to know when to finish your projects. Especially after analytic, a lot of us often feel obligated to work through the night until the last minute to push projects further and further, but this studio should be about understanding how to do beautiful work and to know when you've accomplished your design goal, rather than be the person who worked the most hours. Do tons of sketch models and use your sketchbook liberally - it will help you get through the semester and understand your projects as they develop. Use the weekends efficiently, and obviously, like in every studio, start projects early."
