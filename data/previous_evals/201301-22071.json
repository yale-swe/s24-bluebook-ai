    "Now listen up. You're looking at the evaluations for this course, and you're wondering, \"hm, should I take this course? I dunno, birds aren't really my thing, but it sound kinda cool...\" WELL THEN STOP RIGHT THERE MAGGOT. You just called Rick Prum's course \"kinda cool\". DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE YOU POTATORBRAIN? You're shopping the BEST COURSE AT YALE, YOU LITTLE WORM, YOU REALIZE THAT? You are in the presence of greatness, of a course so mind-blowingly awesome Yale Health has to cart away two or three students after each lecture because they COULDN'T HANDLE THE HEAT. You will leave this course enlightened, wondering how on Earth anything this amazing could exist without there being mass riots across the globe clamoring for a speech by Prum. Now, you might be wondering \"Why? Why is this course so great, o all-knowing reviewer?\" WELL SIT YOUR PUNK ASS DOWN AND LET ME SCHOOL YOU TO THE GAME, THEN. Here are some of the tamer things you'll learn about (I can't write about the REAL cool stuff, my keyboard would explode). You'll study BIRDS WITH MULTIPLE STOMACHS. BIRDS WITH AIRBAGS IN THEIR FACE. BIRDS WITH GPS DEVICES IN THEIR NOSTRILS. BIRDS WHO CARRY WATER IN THEIR FEATHERS. GODDAMN EXPLODING DUCK PENISES. YOU HEARD RIGHT, EXPLODING. DUCK. PENISES. What are you waiting for? Sign up for this, son. I guarantee you will grow a manly beard, be asked on a date by Kate Upton, and break a world record by bench pressing Kline Biology Tower by the end of this finals. So stop reading, maggot, sign up now!",
    "This is just a fantastic class. It is a good way to earn a science credit, but it is also just a good class to take irregardless of the need for a science credit.",
    "Ornithology is all about birds, and it's a science credit. This means that every type of science gets applied to birds, in the best possible way. For example, Prum might talk about chemistry, physics, and anatomy in one class\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then show you how the chemistry applies, or how the physics have an effect. He also uses lots of recent literature to show how the field is evolving, which makes the class more effective than any other in getting a taste of science\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially for non-sc majors. Best decision I've made. The paper is longer than you'd want it to be, but you never have to do the reading (even though you'll want to!!!), and you can cram for the tests (they're hard and detailed and intensive, but if you have a really good memory, they are not impossible). It's an early class\u00e2\u0080\u0094and worth the wake up.",
    "This class is amazing. With such a varied range of topics from feather evolution to bird mating, there is a little something for everyone. I would highly encourage any student at Yale to take this course.",
    "its good, really cool, so much about birds! but also the final paper final exam combo is the worst. if you work on your paper ahead of time you'll be fine, but if you're like me you're going to spend a lot of time hibernating in the library",
    "Great lectures; tricky tests. Not a gut science course - you have to be willing to put in the hours studying.",
    "really great class. you've got to be able to get there at 9:25 on science hill three times a week though. but it's so worth it.",
    "Great class! Really good science credit, the professor is great, not really much work except for 3 tests and an essay - which you must start on time. If you wait, you will do terrible because the essay is worth 1.5 tests. But really, an excellent bang for your buck. Really well-orgnaized very clear professor, cannot recommend highly enough for science and non-science majors (I was the latter, and had no problems). Start studying a few days before the test; you will regret doing otherwise.",
    "Yes! It's not a gut science (it is hard and a lot of work), but it's a fascinating class. The material is amazing -- all I talk about are cool bird facts. (really.) Prum is so enthusiastic about what he does, and so brilliant. It's a privilege to hear him lecture.",
    "This is a wonderful class, especially as a non-Science major. Birds are the best!",
    "if you can fit this class in, definitely definitely take it.",
    "Definitely take this class! Professor Prum's infectious love of birds keeps the class interesting throughout the semester. A few friends and I took it (all non-science majors) and found it fun and challenging.",
    "Take it. Just do it. This is one of the few science credits for non-science majors at Yale that is worth taking. You learn so much, not just about an incredibly interesting topic, but about how to think like a scientist. The last few lectures on beauty make the course. Absolutely amazing. I will never hear the chirping of birds the same way again.",
    "I would highly recommend EEB 272 - it was fascinating, fun, enjoyable and one of my favorite Yale classes.",
    "Incredible class with a quirky, engaging,and astonishingly good professor. Word for the wise: it's definitely a real science class: there's a lot of material, and there are both tests and a paper (a literature review on a topic of your choosing). You can't get away with not paying attention in class or studying and expect to do well. That said, hard work does pay off in the class, and it's exciting enough to make going up to Science Hill at 9:30 AM three days a week fun. That, and Prof. Prum genuinely cares about issues in the humanities and students from outside of the sciences, which was a delight. Very much recommended!",
    "I would and often do recommend EEB 272 to friends looking for a solid, non-gut science. If you're looking to actually learn something about an interesting topic from one of its leading scholars, or a non-science major looking for a legitimate credit. Ornithology is worth a second look.",
    "Take this class if you actually want to learn something meaningful with a science credit. You will be shocked how much there is to discover about birds, and Ornithology is the perfect subject that will actually show you why all of that high school Biology and Chemistry and Physics is important. That being said, it isn't a gut class, and definitely put in a lot of time studying the material; it's worth it though.",
    "Great class for non-science majors (an science majors! and everyone!) but be aware it is NOT a gut.",
    "This class is a very good one to take IF you're interested in zoology\/evolutionary biology. It's good for teaching you to think like a scientist, and it covers a lot of very interesting things. EXPECT to attend class and study plenty if you want to do well-- but as long as you're an attentive student, you'll learn a lot and find yourself in a challenging but not excessively difficult class.",
    "This class will teach you a lot of unforgettable things about the fascinating world of birds! You won't regret taking it. Study a lot for the tests and watch out because the grading on them can be a bit odd. That being said, ProfessorPrum's lectures are amazing and his passion for birds is inspiring. I'd definitely recommend this class for anyone with an interest in birds.",
    "TAKE IT! This is the way science education should be, and whether you are an astrophysics major, an E&EB major, or someone needing a science credit, please, please, please take this class. It is an incredible experience that will change the way you think about evolution and the natural world. It is fun - you learn about dinosaurs and hear entertaining anecdotes. Prepare to be blown away. And if you don't get to take a class with Prof. Prum, you are missing out. But please be sure to double check the deadlines as the class is not the most highly organized, and do not take the class unless you're up for writing the term paper. The class does not have a lot of work... exams and a 10-20 page paper are all, but the Prof does check attendance as well. Go on the fieldtrips and get to know professor Prum.",
    "Take it with the lab - you will get a lot more out of it.",
    "This is a great class! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a science credit, but, be warned, this is not a gut! You learn a lot of information about birds, which turns out to be really interesting and fun, but there are three tests and a paper involved along the way. The tests require a lot of memorizing and the paper is a lot of work. That being said, if you are willing to put in the work, I would say that this class is more than worth it! I recommend it for sure.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone! Professor Prum is a brilliant lecturer and funny person, even at 9:25 am. The class is not a gut, but it's also totally doable for non science majors if you go to class and pay attention. The research paper topic is open which is great, and the exams are hard but it's possible to do very well on them. I came in without any particular interest in birds and really enjoyed the class along with people already very knowledgable about\/interested in birds. This is a class for everyone.",
    "Believe it or not, it's worth the 9:35 science hill walk three days a week, and I'm saying that as a non-science person. The lectures are fantastically engaging, and you'll get plenty out of it to ponder philosophically over if that's what you're really inclined toward. Be warned, though: it's a real science class. You'll work for it.",
    "It is a great class! I definitely recommend it. I am an E&EB major, so it was pretty easy for me- very standard memorization for the tests so if you can do that you should be set. Professor Prum is a great lecturer and gives very reasonable tests. There is a lot of work at the end of the semester with a research paper and a final, but if you plan ahead it is definitely doable.",
    "Yes if you love birds, NO if you don't! I had no particular interest in birds but needed a science credit and heard great things about this class...but the class is full of absolute bird lovers, like people who have been bird-watching since childhood. Unlike the first shopping period lecture, the class has very \"cool bird facts\", nor do you learn about identifying birds unless you take the lab. Instead, it is full-on science class--biology, physics, chemistry, psychology, as applied to birds. This is NOT EASY and the professor is quite disorganized in lecture. He skims over lots of complex scientific concepts, so make sure you have a strong biology background if you are taking this.Watch out for the 10-20 page final paper AND a final. Reading period will suck.Also, after promising to return comments by March 27 on the final paper only if an outline is submitted by March 8, Professor Prum returned the paper 2 weeks late with NO comments whatsoever.",
    "EEB 272 is a fun course but more work than might be expected: essentially 3 equally-weighted and very comprehensive tests (including the final) and a paper due during Reading Week. Take it if you are interested in birds and ecology; scientific background is useful but not necessary. There is a lot of memorization but you learn a lot too.",
    "This class is an introduction to the field of ornithology, and it is great. I would recommend it to another student, with the caveat that it is a lot of work. But it is really fascinating.",
    "Ornithology is an absolutely terrific course, whether or not you go into it with an interest in birds. I began the course with almost no interest in birds, but now I find birds fascinating. The greatest strength of the course by far is Professor Prum. He is an absolutely terrific professor and a great man. He will make you excited about learning about birds. His lectures are energetic and engaging. I think that this course is a great find because it is a real biology class, but one that does not require prerequisites and is accessible to non-bio majors. As a non-science major I appreciated that the material in the class was not at all dumbed down. You get a glimpse at some real evolutionary and developmental biology without having it be at all unmanageable or overwhelming. If you're in doubt TAKE THIS CLASS, you won't regret it!",
    "Such a good course. One of my favorites at Yale. Learn literally everything about birds. Unlike what you might think, you really should not take this with no science background! You will not understand a thing about feather pigmentation, and you will get no guidance unless you seek it on the paper."
