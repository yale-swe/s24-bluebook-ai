   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. I took AP Spanish as a senior in high school and then took this class right after and it was an easy transition. My speaking skills are horrible but I was able to get by because you don't get a speaking grade except for participation. The work was a little tedious but it was a pretty manageable L5.",
    "If you like learning the nitty gritty grammatical part of the language and really want to have an accurate grasp of every part of it, then this is the class for you. If you want a more speaking and everyday life knowledge of Spanish, then don't take this.",
    "It's a Spanish grammar class, so don't go in expecting to vastly improve your speaking fluency. I wanted to solidify my grasp on grammar and really tighten up my writing skills, so I got what I wanted out of the class. If you find grammar (even in English) tedious, don't take the class. Lots of daily homework, but it's staggered such that you don't have to turn it in every day (although it tends to pile up if you leave it too long). A few short in-class compositions and writing assignments, but overall, a low-key course and an easy way to fulfill the L5 requirement.",
    "If you need to perfect your grammar, take it. But it's very tedious and filled with much busy work.",
    "Yes, especially if you are serious about developing your language skills. It's not the class to take if you're just looking for something fun and easy to keep up your Spanish (Advanced Conversational would probably be better for that), because it does require that you study many grammar rules and learn how to apply them. That being said, if you like Spanish, it can be an interesting, really useful class, especially if you take it with Terry Seymour, who is incredibly sweet and helpful.",
    "If you want to improve your Spanish grammar, definitely take this class - you will improve! If you just need a class to fulfill your language requirement, choose something else - it can be boring and is a lot of work. But if you do decided to take it, Professor Seymour will make grammar as fun as possible.",
    "This class is good for Spanish majors and people who actually want to improve their Spanish, other than that it is difficult and a lot of work.",
    "I took this class, instead of Advanced Conversational, because I wanted to finally solidify my understanding of all the grammatical nuances of Spanish, and in this area, I gained a LOT of knowledge. At long last I feel confident, not iffy, about using the all variations of the subjunctive, and quite a few smaller rules that were unknown to me now seem very clear. Prof. Seymour is great -- she's good at explaining weird\/complicated rules, very organized, and generally just a sweet person. She also does a good job of including conversation in the class every day, so you're pretty much taking advanced conversational AND advanced grammar. However, do know that the workload in this class is large. Every day you're assigned a new \"carpeta\" which is basically a series of several assignments (readings, many many many exercises, essays, paragraphs, etc). Terry collects your carpetas every two weeks or so. This means it's really easy to get behind if you aren't consistently dedicating time to this class, and when your carpeta collection is due you'll have to spend an ungodly amount of time catching up before the due date. Nevertheless, this is a good class, especially if you're really looking to increase your fluency."
