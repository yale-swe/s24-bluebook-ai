   "comments": [
    "if you can get in, absolutely take it. a seminar with kagan is unlike a lecture. he is funny animated and very available. I hear the final is a killer though, so watch out for that.",
    "I will recommend those who are prepared to sacrifice themselves to truth.",
    "I would highly recommend the class especially if you have any interest in the period or in how world wars begin.",
    "Professor Kagan is the best teacher at Yale.",
    "Athenian Imperial Democracy is a fantastic course. It covers Athens at its golden age: from the triumph of Themistocles over the Persians, to Pericles and the construction of the Parthenon. The class focuses on political and military history. You will read Plutarch, Thucydides, and other authors. You will debate the inevitability of the Peloponnesian War--and you'll conclude humbly that Thucydides was wrong on this point. Professor Kagan takes a great interest in his students. He is insightful, dynamic, and witty. Take this class.",
    "Your time would be better spent emailing him right now to get into the class than reading these evaluations. Take this course.",
    "Yes. Professor Kagan is great at leading seminar. The assessments are well-suited to the class: you write two reports, in which you have to take a stance on some issue of historical debate and defend it in front of the class. There is also a final exam. Take the class even if you don't think ancient Greece is your main area of historical interest. It's a good subject to study because the number of sources isn't as overwhelming as, say, the sources on World War II. Also, Prof Kagan makes a lot of comparisons to modern events.",
    "As long as you know you are interested in Ancient Greek history, I definitely recommend this class. Kagan does a fantastic job leading the seminar - students definitely participate (especially the ones who wrote the papers for that week), but Kagan was always adding his own knowledge to the conversation. Essentially this class consists of two papers (about which each student has their own topic, making him or her the expert) and a final exam. Most seminars don't have exams, and at times I found myself wishing I could have a final paper instead, but ultimately having a final works best for the format of the class."
