    "Take it if you are interested in the subject matter. The course material varies from week to week. Some seminars were more interesting with better discussions than others. It was great to have graduate students part of the class because they were doing research in these areas.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anthro people or bio people! This was a great class and was very interesting. It's a lighter workload during the semester, and then there is a final paper, presentation, and final at the end. It does require work outside of the classes to learn some of the genetics needed to understand the papers, but the papers and discussion are both very interesting. Brenda Bradley is a great professor too."
