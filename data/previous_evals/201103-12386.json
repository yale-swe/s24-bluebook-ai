    "A lot of reading texts andlearning new words. Not as much grammar. Basically what you'd expect for a middle-level language class. If you like the language, keep taking it. Mashad does a good job.",
    "With world politics as they are today, Persian is such a useful language to learn. And honestly it's easy. There are only really 4 levels so unlike other languages, you can master it in 2 years. There's tons of overlap with French and English and the grammar is simple and regular.There's a lot of change going on in the department right now and it's not clear who will be teaching next year. And with a language, the professor is everything. So I suggest shopping it and seeing what you think of whoever ends up teaching.",
    "Persian 130 consisted of a great deal of readings, conversations, and writing exercises. For my purposes, this was very useful as I am trying to improve on my written Persian and vocabulary and was able to do so in this class. I think its essential to continue with L3 Persian if one hopes to get even close to fluency and would therefore recommend this class, especially with Professor Mohit."
