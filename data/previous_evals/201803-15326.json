    "This course was incredible- Professor Thornbury used a textbook she herself designed, compiled, and authored, and it was as lucid and straightforward an introduction to a medieval language as any I've encountered. Class was very well structured, involving ironing out the grammatical and lexical concepts covered in the reading, going over the homework, and then a later class activity, such as sight translation. There was also a great creative component to this course, in which we all composed poems in Old English and presented them in class- a wonderful assignment which really forced me to get down into the weeds of Old English metrics and lexis. I honestly have no weaknesses to point out- it was wonderful!"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely- it's a great way to gain insight into early medieval literature, and also a wonderful avenue for getting a language requirement done. I think the language part of the Department of English is a crucial place to get in touch with the history of the language, and to trace its growth from there on out, and Professor Thornbury's class offers a rigorous but incredibly generous and open-ended place for that knowledge to be garnered. I would recommend it to anyone, in or out of the department, medieval requirement or no."
