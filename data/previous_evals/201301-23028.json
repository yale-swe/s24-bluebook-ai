    "You have to do a senior project anyway, and it's kind of fun to meet the other Applied Math\/Stats majors every week and chat about your progress \/ random stuff. It's only 2 hours a week, and it ended up being pretty enjoyable throughout, so I don't see why you would choose to do an independent project unless this class conflicts with your schedule.",
    "NO. DO THE PROJECT NOT THE SEMINAR. As long as you schedule a biweekly meeting with your adviser, it's not really necessary to sit through the seminar. It's not useful, and just adds more work in addition to the project."
