   "comments": [
    "I think Diversity (in particular) is such a sensitive topic that perhaps the assignments for student presentations in this unit should be randomized, rather than student-selected. It felt a bit awkward to have to pick topics on the spot, especially while trying to consider what topics others in the class might want to present, given their cultural identities and\/or research interests. As a result, I think that if the instructor were to assign topics in this unit (akin to how the Ethics topics were assigned), this would REALLY encourage students to become familiar with topics outside their comfort zone.",
    "I liked that we had the opportunity to present on various readings and this kept the course varied. I wonder if there is a way to make these presentations even more interactive\/engaging\/provocative. I also think we should capitalize on the individuals in the class and perhaps give each student the opportunity to do an additional presentation on something that THEY think is relevant to the course related to diversity. I feel like we had such a diverse group of students from different backgrounds, ethnic groups, family backgrounds, etc. and, although this did shine through in various ways, it might be nice to invite more discussion about personally important topics. It also felt odd to have others talking about the African American or Asian American experience when we had students in the course who had these direct experiences. I wonder if this might have been uncomfortable. It might have been nice to integrate this course with our clinical work and to discuss ethics\/diversity issues specifically related to our intakes.",
    "The course does an excellent job of reviewing ethics and diversity within clinical practice, while also stimulating meaningful discussion surrounding these topics. As these issues--particularly related to diversity--have often been neglected within the field, this course was invaluable in reminding us of their importance."
