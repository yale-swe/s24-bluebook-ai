    "I think Jane is fantastic, she gives accurate critique and she does it consistently, and although costume design is not my concentration, I feel excited about working on costumes because she is so inspiring and encouraging. I feel like I am always 'in the dark' doing projects for other classes, (I'm sure hitting the wall is a good thing) but Jane's class is always a brilliant beam of light.",
    "Jane is wonderful! Will miss her next year.",
    "Jane is a gift to the program. I never realized I would become so aware of details and raise my own standards in my designs until I saw my last project. Thanks to her",
    "very good!",
    "Costume class was fantastic. I wish we had more weeks in the year to cover more plays with Jane, but the pace is already about as fast as it can go. I wish we could have spent a little less time doing the really early stuff this year so that we could have done another Victorian era or another 20th Century play towards the end since that is the majority of plays we design in the theatre. I always look forward to class with Jane and find the assignments both challenging and enjoyable."
