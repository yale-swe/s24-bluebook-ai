   "comments": [
    "It's a fantastic class. Professor Hammer is very knowledgeable on the subject, and if you have an interest in poetry, it's a fantastic way to read writers you won't have read and deepen your sense of writers you have. Every lecture was enjoyable. Like anything, I enjoyed some writers more than others, but also learned a lot from the writers i was less thrilled about.",
    "Take this class, The material is interesting and not too overwhelming. Professor Hammer is great and is willing to offer support whenever it is needed. I highly recommend this class.",
    "A strong class if you enjoy poetry since 1950. You deal with poets of many different stripes--some of whose work is sublime, some of whose work is maybe a little less so. Be prepared for a lot of poetry that is very self-consciously dealing with the challenges of writing poetry--a theme that, I think, gets a bit worn (though thankfully not one dominating every poet's work!). Lectures are really interesting and thought provoking, but only if you've read and thought about the poems. Though only a few are dealt with, a lot are assigned. There isn't a lot of work for the class, but the exams ask you to cram a lot into a little space.",
    "Lecture focus a little heavy on the poets' lives, lacking deep reading of individual poems. Probably best for people already into poetry.",
    "Poetry since 1950 is one of the best English classes you can take! The readings are very manageable and fun, lectures are a pure joy--Professor Hammer is absolutely brilliant and yet quite down-to-earth, and the sections are very small (mine was about 8 people) and the TFs are very helpful. Definitely take this!!",
    "Really lovely lecture! I have taken a lot of lit classes but never a poetry class, and thought this was a great way to get that under my belt. Prof Hammer knows the material very well and clearly loves it, which is very fun to be around. Josh Stanley was a great TF, too. All around, I would recommend.",
    "This course is a great way to get an introduction to modern poetry, especially for someone outside of the English-major canon; I left with a handful of new authors and a new framework to think about what I read. That being said, the lectures are often superfluous; the syllabus is weighted towards male poets of a certain bread; and the combination of two exams and two essays can wear on you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It's a great overview of contemporary poetry and gave me a great framework and background with which to be able to read and appreciate poetry on my own in the future - which is something that I think will be immensely useful. If you often find yourself confused or baffled at poetry and want to be able to read and 'get' poetry, this is the perfect course.",
    "I was intimidated by poetry and now feel like I have a decent grasp of how to read poems, and a working knowledge of notable post-1950 poets. I'm an Engl major senior who spent most of her career reading novels. So this class was really helpful. I can't say I loved all the readings. But I did love a couple, and it was worth it. A nice chill class, not a ton of work. Prof Hammer is so friendly. He'll have tea with you. Do it.",
    "A really excellent course. Take it!",
    "Take it if at all interested! The work is not hard: it's beautiful and so rewarding.",
    "One should take ENGL 283 if one likes reading modern poetry. There really couldn't be a class that's better structured to accommodate a love of modern poetry.",
    "Great class. Fantastic reading list and not too much work.",
    "I highly recommend the course. It is one of the best I've taken. Lectures are a pleasure to attend, as Professor Hammer's commentaries on the poems are insightful and brilliant. The syllabus is structured so that each poet is treated for one or two lectures, so you read a good number of poems to familiarize yourself with his\/her body of work. If you love poetry, doing the reading and attending lecture will be a joy.",
    "Take Poetry since 1950 because Langdon Hammer's lectures are a joy. He is attentive and so very knowledgable. Go to his office hours with a poem in hand. Take Poetry since 1950 because it is a great introduction to the world of poetry--for us non-majors, especially--it may very well get you started on lifelong literary enjoyment.",
    "GREAT course. really relaxed small lecture where you can learn a huge amount if you pay attention. prof hammer is fantastic. one of the few courses I got more and more interested in as the semester wore on. sections are fantastic as well\u2014probable the best conversation between lecture\/section material that I've seen at Yale.",
    "This is a decent survey of Poetry Since 1950. It is very broad and gets boring at time. If you are an English major you will know exactly what to expect out of a survey like this. As usual, your grade depends entirely on your TA."
