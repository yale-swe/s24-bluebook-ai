    "Do not be scared off by first semester pchem lab. PChem lab 2 is much more chill and typically a much smaller class. The experiments provide a good overview of some of the most commonly used spectroscopy techniques and other instruments.If you're looking for a lab course, this is a good class. Lab reports are still long and they're due a week after finishing the lab (as opposed to having twolabs due at a time).",
    "This class is a lot of work for very little learning and I would definitely not recommend this class to another student. It was a source of constant frustration.",
    "P Chem Lab II is an excellent class. If you were discouraged by P Chem Lab I, this lab is much, much better. Yes, it's still a lot of writing (average lab report: 27 pages), and it was probably still the second hardest lab I've taken, but unlike the first semester lab you are actually rewarded for your efforts. You don't have to worry about losing points for formatting or other nit-picky things. Instead, you can focus more on learning the material and gaining experience with spectroscopic techniques. I learned a lot about spectroscopy (Raman, IR, NMR, etc.), which seems almost essential if you're thinking about going to grad school. I would HIGHLY recommend this class - it was one of the best science labs I've taken at Yale."
