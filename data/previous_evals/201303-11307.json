   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Philosophy if it were moved to later in the day. The nature of the class seems to require a more lively atmosphere than that provided at only 9 in the morning.",
    "Philosophy 112 was a fantastic survey course in philosophy. As a philosophy major, I loved getting exposed to so many different branches of philosophy; this course has helped me decide which philosophy classes to take in the future since I now know which areas of philosophy I find most interesting. However, this class would also be perfect for a non-philosophy major who just wants to get a taste of philosophy. The content is extremely interesting and Professor Greco is FANTASTIC. He is personable, funny, caring, and brilliant. This course isn't easy, but it's very fair and totally worth it.",
    "Study of cyclical arguments in philosophy that have never been conclusively resolved.",
    "I would summarize Phil 112 as a survey course of various controversial and unclear topics in philosophy. I would not recommend it to another student because I found it boring and not particularly instructive.",
    "Philosophy 112 examines general debates surrounding Philosophy. It's not your typical philosophy class - we don't just read and analyze philosophers' work. Instead, we actually deal with debates that have to do with said philosophy work. I would recommend this class for anyone with an eye for the philosophical, for anyone who is interested in the subject, and for anyone who wishes to broaden their range of knowledge and cultivate their manner of thinking.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is interested in philosophy.",
    "The class had many interesting topics, but was very hard to stay Focused in or attend because of its 9am start. I would recommend it.",
    "Problems of Philosophy is an incredible course and I highly recommend it! It gives an overview of the debates in many fascinating areas of philosophy, including the existence of God, knowledge, the self, artificial intelligence, and morality. The assignments are reasonable and interesting, and the lectures are always very clear and enjoyable. Professor Greco is an amazing teacher and was always excited about the material. While philosophy can often be an overwhelming subject, this course was a fantastic experience.",
    "This course is a general run-through of a bunch of major philosophical topics, without going into too much detail with any of them. It is a great way to dip your toe into philosophy without diving head-first.",
    "This is a great survey of some interesting ideas in philosophy. It's great for people with no philosophy background. Topics aren't covered very deeply, but you get a good taste of a lot of different things.",
    "A well-structured intro class to Philosophy.",
    "A great course for an introduction to philosophy and to thinking like a philosopher.",
    "Take it with Daniel Greco because he is awesome. But also, consider the fact that most of the stuff you'll learn here you can easily learn through Wikipedia--furthermore, almost everyone has heard about the trolley problem (save 5 but kill 1) and the brain in a vat. So, what are you getting from this class with your (costly) time here at Yale? Well, you'll get better at writing philosophy papers, but Greco doesn't directly teach you how to do that. Instead, he forwards you several papers about writing philosophy papers, and you'll learn a posteriori from his comments. Will you learn how to engage in a philosophical debate? Not necessarily--class was dominated by a few (5) outgoing speakers (all versus Greco) and you aren't required to speak anyway. So what do you get from a class like this? Well, you'll end up with a very enjoyable and often rewarding experience as you discover which themes in philosophy you really enjoy. Now I know to avoid epistemology like the plague, and I became fascinated with Alan Turing's work and backstory. If that sounds like a good deal to you, then I recommend this class fully.",
    "It was a little bit tricky for me\u00e2\u0080\u0094probably because I had never taken any sort of logic class in my life\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I'd still recommend it even if you're in a situation like mine. Even if you can't get some of the readings, Greco always gives a really clear outline the next day in class on what you need to know. The lectures were entertaining, and the material was interesting. Very fair grading, too!",
    "A fast paced readings-based class that covers a lot of very different philosophical topics.I would recommend it as a great intro survey philosophy course.",
    "Problems of Philosophy was a really great class. There was little homework, but the readings were always incredibly interesting. In class discussion was always very informative, and Daniel Greco was an amazing professor. I would highly recommend this class to another student. I loved the class, and it was a great one to take Cr\/D\/F seeing as I'm no philosophy major."
