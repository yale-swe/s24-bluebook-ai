    "It was great to get more exposure to modeling concepts and applications. The only weakness is the lack of opportunity to discuss the topics in an informal setting. The student journal club was usually not helpful and sometimes didn't even happen at all.",
    "Some great guests, would've loved to see some more variety in subject matter. Heavy on epidemiology. There are plenty of people modeling in other areas and disciplines of public health that would would be happy to come speak- HEOR, healthcare operations, interventions for developing countries, UN, WHO, hospital systems, payers, PBMs.",

    "it is good.",
