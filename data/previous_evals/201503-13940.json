   "comments": [
    "Overall, I enjoyed this class. Its greatest strength is Wayne, who is extremely well versed on the subject material and who has amazing experience as a practitioner. The course's greatest weakness is that class time felt very unproductive; although I enjoyed Wayne's lectures, I felt like they simply summarized the readings (student presentations did very much the same). I would hope that in the future, class time will be used primarily for discussion amongst the students, guided by the professor.",
    "GLBL 782 provides a comprehensive overview of the different policy components that shape our world today. Each seminar consists of a short lecture, a student presentation and a class discussion. It lasts 2 hours, but the time just seems to fly by. I would strongly recommend it to other students as you come away with a much better understanding of the constraints that policymakers face and the world in general.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. If you are interested in the political and policy making process behind economic reforms this is an excellent course. It provides a balance to macro and other financial reform courses taught at Yale which have focused on what went wrong in the crisis, how to prevent the next one etc, as Prof. Swan gives excellent insight into how legislation and reforms are actually pushed through and why second best solutions may be the only ones possible.",
    "Good course. The unique experience of the professor allowed for informative discussions."
