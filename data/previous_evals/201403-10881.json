    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The goal of this class is to be able to read Old English well enough to take the Beowulf course in the spring. I think that all my classmates would agree that this course was a success in that. We all worked hard and struggled at times but Traugott made sure that none of us got left behind.",
    "ENGL 500 01 is an introduction to Old English language and literature, with an emphasis on \"on sight\" translation. This course provides an excellent overview of the language and will allow the student to put his or her translation skills to practice on many well-known Old English poems and prose works. I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. I have many times already! I feel that taking this course gave me an advantage in learning other languages (such as Latin), while also increasing my confidence in class."

   "comments": [
    "As a medievalist, this course provided me with integral knowledge to my discipline. In fact, I enjoyed this course so much that I am considering tending towards Anglo-Saxon studies in my research. I find myself analyzing and understanding the modern English language in ways I never had before taking this course. It has given me an edge in my research and a deeper understanding that I would not have without the course experience."
