    "Because all answers ought to be available to students reading these evaluations, I've copied my first two answers here. I've written at length in these forms about the faults with Yale's evaluation system, so I won't repeat that argument here...\"Drama and Demos\" was unexpectedly my best class this semester. I took it because I wanted to read Athenian drama and learn something of Greek history, feeling deficient in both subjects. I got both of those things, certainly, and in a way, the best part of the class is the plays: almost all perfectly crafted, very approachable, fascinatingly similar and different. It's just a very distilled reading-list; there's (except for The Phoenician Women, which is fun to talk because it is bad and has interesting textual issues).But it was also a great class because we had genuinely fun, intellectually curious conversations that, especially as the semester went on, depended on real accumulated knowledge of our subject. That's what a seminar ought to be: that's what this was. It was great. Partially, I think we had a good group of students, partially, Professor Robinson balances lecturing and discussion well (and honors a variety of perspectives while being honest about his own), and partially, the subject is very amenable to deep discussion.Some of the secondary reading was excellent, especially the historical, philological, and textual stuff. The literary criticism (Medea's divided self, etc.) tended to be weaker, in part because, given background, the class could often do better. Otherwise, I wouldn't change much about the class.Professor Robinson is a delight, a great teacher, and a mensch!1) He's obviously brilliant. He develops intriguing readings of the plays casually, as the best professors at Yale do, and he is honest about placing that reading into the class to be openly discussed, questioned, extended, whatever. He also has obvious mastery of and love for the subject matter, the latter of which is very important to the class.2) He's very entertaining. This is, I suppose, an innate talent, so to discuss it further is silly.3) He's a kind and generous teacher, accommodating of student needs. This is uncommon, especially when you consider it affects his schedule.4) He gives great feedback on papers. Some professors give less feedback the better the paper; Professor Robinson gives plenty of feedback, regardless, and it is CREATIVE feedback--new ideas, lines of thought, people to read, etc. etc. This is a practice that ought to be standard at Yale: reading papers as entering into intellectual dialogue, rather than passing judgment. It makes me sad that this third paper is not as good as the first two... I really enjoy his comments on my better work.",
    "Great seminar for those who wish to focus on Greek drama--25 plays in total, plus excerpts from other primary and secondary sources. There's plenty to read but plays read quickly. Very open ended paper topics. A longer final paper can replace the final exam. Pretty good writing credit, but only if you're interested in Greek drama. A definite yes to classic civ, humanities, and theater studies majors; a yes also to history majors (like myself), especially if you've taken Prof Kagan's lecture; a great spring follow-up to one of Prof Robinson's intro English courses",
    "A great seminar to take! It brings political and intellectual history into discussion of literature, and produces illuminating discussions each time. The plays are amazing, and the work is reasonable.",
    "Reading most of the major tragedies and a few comedies from fifth-century Athens with Professor Robinson and a great group of fellow Yalies made this a very informative and very entertaining class. We discussed social and historical context, psychological development, and aesthetic value of the plays in very laid back classes. Professor Robinson is well-informed about the classics, very funny, and deeply concerned with the well-being of his students. Since he is so nice, sometimes discussion can go off on tangents and loses some of its coherency. The papers aren't too bad to finish and if you write a slightly longer paper, you don't have to take the final. Even if you don't read Greek, I would highly recommend this class as a way of understanding not only ancient Athens, but also something about the human experience as told by some of the greatest poets.",
    "This is an unusual theater course. Many dramatic literature courses at Yale are taught by theater practitioners\/dramaturges, but Professor Robinson is a scholar of Greek texts. Therefore, the class has more of a Greek history\/language orientation, and less of a performance-related orientation. However, Prof Robinson encourages his students to explore the \"big issues\" - gender, war, etc, and the papers are are always exciting."
