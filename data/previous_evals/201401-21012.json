   "comments": [
    "Most likely, you're taking this because you have to take it. Similar to L3, not the most exciting class ever.",
    "SPAN 140 is a continuation of SPAN 130. The only notable differences are that there is a lot more cultural context in 140, which I thought was a great improvement, and that there is more reading. I highly recommend Prof Riva - he is personable and knowledgeable.",
    "Yes, not much different from Spanish 3, just more use of many tenses at the same time.",
    "Spanish 140 is a good recap of all the spanish you already know and you will also learn a few helpful additional grammatical things, indirect speech and uses of se specifically.",
    "Very good!",
    "This is not the best course in terms of material (readings, etc.), but, thanks to Fernando it was one of my favorite courses at Yale. Our class had so much fun and learned a lot in the process. If you are taking this course, I definitely recommend it with Fernando. He is a phenomenal teacher and an even better person.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 4 if the student has the right teacher. The online homework is asinine and the supersite, considering you pay around 100 bucks for it, should have far more quality control than it actually does. On the other hand, the works you read are interesting and with the right teacher this course will greatly improve your knowledge of Spanish language and hispanic culture. I personally enjoyed going to class everyday because of Fernando as a professor and not necessarily the material.",
    "It is a good class to work on speaking and solidifying my grammar.",
    "This was an amazing course and I would recommend it to everyone. The professor made it truly amazing, and turned what would be mundane grammar lessons into super interesting cultural lessons interwoven with stories from his life and readings. Because the course's reading materials are focused on political upheavals in the Spanish-speaking world, I also found that I got a great mini-history course as well! The professor truly makes the course: mine was way more than an instructor, and a true friend to all of us. I'll actually miss getting up for an early class every day next year because of him!"
