   "comments": [
    "Don't take this if you have a moderately good background in mathematics, it won't give you much you don't already know. It's also not great for those with very little math background because you run through things so quickly that it's hard to pick them up.",
    "It's a very rudimentary survey over multiple mathematical topics. Don't expect to go into very much detail on any one topic. Take it if the course is required or if you want a very general review of the material. The course isn't too difficult.",
    "The material that *should* be covered in the book is very useful. NOT all of it is covered. Do not take it with this professor. He was on time to class maybe twice, ends early, and does NOT spend enough time covering the advanced material. Sometimes he just doesn't show up or gives lectures over Skype (useless). He doesn't respond to emails, has no regular office hours, and is incapable of solving his own homework problems (actually) so don't even bother to ask questions about the homework. The exams are RIDICULOUS. The professor sent out a past practice final the day before the exam and with the comment \"these WILL NOT be the problems on tomorrow's exam; you will get new, different problems\". The next day, we got the same problems. That said, the professor IS a nice person (I think). He's just not really a responsible professor. Everyone has faults.",
    "Professor Baker is very smart and his lectures are good. The notes for his lectures are even better, since they are complete and he does sometimes make small mistakes in class. The homeworks are more challenging than you would expect but then the midterm and the final are very straightforward and as long as you have a halfway decent grasp of the material and mathematics you will do well. One word of warning is that the class does move very fast and doesn't slow down, so spending a week on a chapter seems ok when you're doing derivatives, but then it's surprising when you still only spend a week on a chapter when you're doing differential equations or complex analysis.",
    "If your looking to understand the math probably take other classes that dedicate a whole semester to each topic.",
    "Pretty easy class that covers a lot of math but only touches on each subjects. I'd take it if you haven't been exposed to linear algebra, complex analysis, or differential equations but don't expect to completely master these topics or come anywhere close to that. It'll just get you a flavor of it.",
    "This class is a very good overview of the mathematics needed in Physics. Professor Baker is a great professor, but be prepared to really go over the notes and book to understand the material because the course covers a lot of ground very fast.",
    "Worth taking if you want to learn a little relevant linear algebra, diffeqs and some random analysis stuff or review a little from math 120, 222 and ENAS 194 if you've already taken any of those. Definitely doable if you haven't taken any of those but probably easier if you've taken some or all of them (though there will be a bunch of review).Dr. Baker is a solid lecturer (and a cool\/nice guy) and posts notes online so you can just take it in and ask questions during class (but not a huge deal if you miss a class). psets and tests aren't too tough and grading is reasonable. It was a good, relatively low-stress way of learning\/reviewing stuff.definitely recommend it if you're a physics major or will get elective credit for it.",
    "I would recommend it to a friend. It is a good survey if methods in math."
