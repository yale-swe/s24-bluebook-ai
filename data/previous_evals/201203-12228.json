    "Intermediate Macroeconomics with Professor Nordhaus is engaging and well taught. It covers what you'd expect (output, employment, inflation, consumption, investment, classical, keynesian, open economies, etc), but with a bit more math and equations than in introductory macro, so it's easier to feel like you have a sense of the dynamics at play behind changes in the economy. Problem sets this term were graded randomly, which placed a lot of weight on very few of them, and they occasionally covered material not emphasized in lecture, but they were generally fair. I found this course much more enjoyable than introductory macro.",
    "Econ 122 is and feels like a required course. I would recommend taking it with Professor Nordhaus because he is so clearly passionate about his subject, which makes lectures much more interesting.",
    "It's good. Take it have to, consider taking it if you don't.",
    "The best of the core econ courses - heavy on concepts, light on math. Poly sci majors should not be afraid.",
    "The perfect course to learn macroeconomics.",
    "I would summarize econ 122 as a mediocre core requirement of the econ major that must be completed in order to fulfill the major.",
    "Intermediate macro -- basically everything you learned in intro macro but with more complications\/calculus\/applications to the world. Nordhaus makes what you're learning very applicable by constantly bringing in real-world examples. Take it if you have any interest in macro, if you want to know what the hell is going on when someone mentions China's pegged exchange rate or the Eurozone meltdown, or just to see how awesome of a grandpa Nordhaus is.",
    "Mad boring, difficult problem sets that everybody copied off one another- besides the people who actually understand anything about economics. Nordhaus is a chill guy though.",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 122 to another student, especially with Prof. Nordhaus. You really learn a lot about the state of our current economy. This course has given me a new perspective on policy decisions and the tools to actually make an informed analysis on what the government is doing. Many of the ideas were already presented in intro macro but ECON 122 brings everything together. The workload isn't bad at all- only 6 psets this year and only 3 were graded (though I think last year had 8 total and 4 graded). It was a bit annoying to have a final paper and a final examthough, but overall I think it's definitely worth it. Take it if you're even remotely interested in understanding what the Fed\/gov't is doing- for better or for worse, and you'll definitely learn a lot.",
    "Definitely take. You understand the macro economy exponentially better after this class",
    "Nordhaus has great Powerpoints and is a good lecturer, interacting with students and whatnot. Helped us understand the material better and interact with it. Wish I got to know him better \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sort of grandfatherly.The psets are not too difficult, nor are the exams if you study more than eight or so hours in total.",
    "Course material doesn't differ much from what you've already learned in intro macro. Lectures are long and pretty dull.",
    "Yes. It's material people should know, and Nordhaus is very knowledgeable and experienced and seems to have great judgment about how to apply which theories when to real issues. That being said, if you already know a lot about economics and are more interested in theory, you might find this course a little bit boring and want to consider 126 instead.",
    "Definitely take it with Nordhaus. He's a great teacher and definitely made lecture more fun than it otherwise would have. The workload is reasonable, not too hard overall.",
    "It was tough but enjoyable. Only if you are an econ major.",
    "Recommend-- good course, great professor, good format, suitable for those who are relatively weaker at math (and I say this loosely -- basically if you're NOT an Econ\/Math double major you'll like ECON 122) really good TA's overall.",
    "I would consider taking it, if it wasn't for my major. Not a extremely difficult class.",
    "A necessary course for econ majors-- builds on the material taught in intro macro, but provides derivations, complicates the models, and applies the models to today's economic situations. Take this class with Nordhaus if you can, even ifit means waiting a semester.",
    "I was an Econ major who did not find great passion in the field of Economics. This class turned me into an Econ lover. I loved everything about this class. Professor Nordhaus is amazing, and he changed my life, and I learned so, so much. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "Take it if you need to, don't take it if you don't.",
    "A truly amazing course. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of theway in which the world we live in actually functions. You'll be able to speak intelligently about the fiscal cliff, the liquidity trap, the crisis with the eurozone.",
    "Take it, get smarter and understand what you're reading in the paper more next time",
    "I would only recommend it if it's required because the material is pretty dry and also feels like pure repetition of introductory macro most of the time.",
    "Overall, this was an ok course. If you are interested in macro, then the math behind some of the concepts can be interesting and, in some cases, applicable. Unfortunately, many of the concepts were so theoretical that there is little real-world application. The lectures were well organized though at times slow and dry. Missing a few lectures won't kill you--and would probably even be good for your mental health--as you can easily teach yourself the concepts from his slides and section. Only take if you are an Econ major or generally enjoy relatively masochistic activities. There are a lot more interesting and productive things to study once you have if you have a general background and interest in macroeconomics.",
    "Why you should take this class:Professor Nordhaus is a smart guy, and he picks the best topics. You will learn a lot, and he'll keep you pretty entertained. He's definitely the best among those who've taught this class before.Why, dear econ majors, you'll get frustrated with it:Professor Nordhaus has no office hours, or he wouldn't tell us. Is this even allowed? I wish he had posted slides at least 5 or 10 minutes in advance, so we could have printed them out before class. It would have been so much easier to follow him. Another big weakness: he would go over supplementary theories, which were great and all, but when it came to the most important theories he wanted us to focus on, he would rush through the material. He would speak fast or mumble things instead of taking it slow and explaining the different parts of the mechanisms. Here is the second big weakness: We cover hours of material and read most of a 300-page book, some of whose material didn't correspond to what we were covering in class. So for Professor Nordhaus to tell us that everything we were assigned inside and outside of class has an equal chance of being on the exams and puts none of the non-powerpoint material on there, he deceives his students. This also penalizes students who cover all the material when they should have focused more on the class material. Also, be warned that there will be times in class when the material gets way too boring. If you want a professor to be your mentor or advisor, you won't get it from him.",
    "If you can take it, take it with Nordhaus. Econ core classes are not generally the best, but this is one of the better ones. I felt like I walked away from the class with a much better understanding of the financial system and 2008 financial crisis, and the different methods the Fed and gov't have with regards to economic policy.",
    "If you are an econ major and need to take intermediate macro, take it with Professor Nordhaus. He makes lectures and material interesting and relevant. Be prepared for a tough course, though.",
    "class isn't too bad. prof is nice and kinda funny. material is ok. class gets boring sometimes, but that's about it.",
    "Nordhaus is a great teacher although the combination of the warm room and his soothing voice put me to sleep almost every lecture. It's probably the easiest of the core econ requirements, so not tons of work but there's a lot to learn if you really engage with the material. I feel comfortable talking about the economy now. Psets aren't too long and midterms\/exams are fair.",
    "Econ 122 is a continuation of Intro Macro, but adds elements and topics that are relevant to the real world of economics. We spend a good amount of time talking about the Fed, Great Depression, Great Recession, the money supply, and the open economy, topics hardly mentioned in Econ 116. Overall, this is a great class in which I have learned a lot, and I highly recommend it to both econ majors and non-econ majors.",
    "It is pretty decent for an econ class.",
    "I'd highly recommend this course to anyone thinking about it.Professor Nordhaus is a great lecturer and such a sweetheart. This course has clear lectures with materials online in case you miss any, and straightforward assignments. The best part of this course is that Prof. Nordhaus incorporates present-day economic events into his teaching, really giving you a sense for what is going on. I feel better equipped to discuss economics than after any other economics course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Not a fantastic class but pretty good. Professor Nordhaus is amazing, you should definitely wait until you can take this class with him",
    "Excellent source of insight into the seemingly random movements of the national economy.",
    "Intermediate macro is so much better and manageable than intermediate micro. Make sure you go to lecture, read the book, and ask valuable questions in class. Final paper isn't too bad. Make sure you understand big theories and not just the little gritty details.",
    "Required for major and a good topical course. Easier than micro",
    "Yes. It's a required course for Economics majors. Professor Nordhaus makes this course especially interesting!",
    "Only take this course if you need it for the major. Otherwise, do not.",
    "It is required for the econ major; this having been said, it's not the worst required class I've taken.",
    "This class is a decent introduction to macroeconomics. More math\/ science oriented people might find that the class lacks rigor. I haven't taken Macro Theory, but it might have been a better choice in retrospect (as a non-econ major). This class was, however, enlightening with regard to the current economy and our economic history.The book is generally not particularly useful. A more mathematically rigorous one would be useful. This book seems more oriented toward a high school economics class.",
    "It's a core class that is probably going to be quite easy (in terms of time invested) for you. Maybe too easy.",
    "If you are an economics major and need to take 122, TAKE IT WITH NORDHAUS. You won't regret it.",
    "It's exactly what you think it's going to be. I'd recommend it because the revamp of the course means that you will be exploring current news and some historical events - it really helps your understanding of economic events.",
    "I would totally recommend ECON122 WITH Nordhaus. Professor Nordhaus was amazing, and made the class so worth it. One could see that he enjoyed teaching and really knew the material he was teaching. He was never condescending and was really nice to everyone. Sometimes he would do like a \"Star Wars\"-themed little presentation, where he would take a topic such as the Great Depression and make it seem EPIC. From those and everything else one could really tell that he enjoys what he does and that is definitely the sign of a great educator.",
    "ECON 122 is a solid course. Nordhaus does a great job of making the material accessible and pertinent. In the first half of the semester, we learn basic macroeconomic models, such as Solow Growth, Romer Technology, and Cobb-Douglas Production models. This is basically a review of intro macro (in case you couldn't remember anything from it, as was the case with me!). The second half of the course introduces the IS-MP model and modern macroeconomic questions, such as the fiscal cliff, inflation, monetary policy, etc. I loved this part of the course, and the tools you learn will make you a better thinker and interpreter of economic phenomena.Note: Prof. Nordhaus is very liberal (he's salt-water, if you will). That's fine, but please remember that there is an equally valid counter-argument to most of his beliefs.",
    "Take it if you are an Econ. major or if you want to have a good understanding of macroeconomics. Not too hard - reasonable course load. But it can be dry sometimes and it's a lot of material to study for the final exam.",
    "Good course where you learn a lot - curve is hard.",
    "Yes. Great class, whether you're an econ major or not.",
    "Definitely take this course with Nordhaus. This is the course that taught me the most about economics so far. I learned so much about how government makes macro-level decisions, how investorsreact to macro trends, etc. These are the knowledge that I feel will be useful for my overall understanding of economic fundamentals. The class itself is hard, but definitely manageable if you put in enough work. The only drawback is that it is quite unclear at times whether we should study the textbook or lecture notes, because the textbook contains (in Prof. Nordhaus's opinion) very outdated materials, whereas the new concepts in lecture notes can be too hard to grasp.",
    "This class is very interesting, and I think macroeconomics is a field all should learn a little about. Not the most entertaining, but definitely worthwhile.",
    "Great class for econ majors. Gives you a great overview of macro.",
    "This is the best core class I have taken at Yale. Professor Nordhaus is a legend in the field (if a bit meandering in lectures), and the TA's for the course were first-rate. I used lots of the content in job interviews, and I especially enjoyed the assignments, always fairly structured and fairly graded. Essential to take to understand the financial markets, fiscal policy, and monetary policy; if you don't understand macroeconomics, you are not an educated voter, investor, or businessperson. This class received my highest marks.",
    "Basic intermediate extension of intro macro. If you took the seminar then there's some overlap.",
    "So interesting - take it!",
    "Take the course! Professor Nordhaus is the funniest professor you will ever have!",
    "Professor Nordhaus is a great Professor: very knowledgable and also logical in his powerpoint slides. The exams were tough. You need toreally study the math behind everything (which Nordhaus is not very good at explaining unfortunately...and the book wasn't either (jones)).",
    "Horrible class.",
    "Econ major? You have to take this class. I'd take it with Nordhaus, as he is niceand the course moves at a measured, if not glacial, pace. Standard types of econ assignments: problem set every week, midterm, final, and then a short paper. Course is not too difficult beyond intro macro and is considerably easier than intermediate micro.Not an econ major? I'd go to a more specific econ course if I were you (and I assume you are someone generally interested in macroeconomics), as it will likely be more interesting.",
    "If Nordhaus is teaching this class, take it! He has a great personality and assigns very good readings. The workload is very light; problems sets were actually easy. The exams were a bit harder and the final was very misleading: it focused mostly on the midterm material. The class has a 5-page paper requirement, which is ok if you start it ahead of time. Overall, a great class! Don't miss the opportunity to learn from Nordhaus! He actually puts the effort to make you be connected to the macroeconomic world.",
    "Yes absolutely. Not a whole lot of work if you're willing to pay attention in class and read the book. You learn a LOT and really learn about the practical uses of macroeconomics. I recommend it to everyone with a mild interest in learning how the US, and world, economy works.",
    "Exams were based entirely on problem sets and lecture notes so don't worry too much about the textbook. Sad thing is I found the textbook much more insightful and interesting than the lectures. Nordhaus is a great lecturer and has very good slides (i'm not sure if u need to go to class coz i went anyway)",
    "The rumors are true: take the class with Nordhaus. This guy is about as charismatic as econ professors come (he throws in occasional jokes) and his level of mastery is unquestionable. When he lectures, it is extremely apparent that Nordhaus really knows this stuff like the back of his hand. After all, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the few professors that actually engage in macro policy (he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the Boston Fed board).That being said, he does have a tendency to glaze over some of the more minute details of the macro models. For this, be sure to choose a TA wisely. Andrew Sinclair (SOM PhD) was an excellent TA and would spend the entire section discussing class models, starting from theoretical intuition and working all the way up to real-life examples of application. I definitely walked out of section with a much better understanding of the models, which is not Nordhaus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fault. He just has a lot to cover in a limited amount of time.1 midterm, 1 final, 1 short 3-5 page paper, and approximately bi-weekly psets. As far as grading, I would say the class is fair. If I do worse than I expected, it will not be the fault of the professor, or the TA, or unfair tests with material that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go over. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do as well as the amount of effort that you put in, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying a lot for an econ course.",
    "Take it if you have to and are able to get in. I took it out of curiosity for current events and learned some valuable things, but not as many as I expected to. It was too theoretical and not math heavy, which I kind of disliked.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "Great all around course that will give you an excellent understanding of the current economy. The material is very relevant and it is taught well by Nordhaus. Highly recommend the class, be prepared to work though.",
    "Well, this is a required class for all economics and economics-related majors, and Nordhaus is definitely the professor to take it with. In fact, you might even consider this class even if you're not an economics major. The material is extremely important to a clear understanding of today's world, and Nordhaus explains it clearly and with frequent reference to real world events. The textbook is hardly necessary: Nordhaus pretty much gives you everything you need to know from lectures. Problem sets aren't bad, and neither are the exams. Probably the best economics course I've had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend Econ 122 with Nordhaus. It gives really up to date information and Nordhaus can give an engaging lecture. It is a requirement for the econ major, so you have to take it and Nordhaus is the way to go.",
    "A must take",
    "Yes, if you have. You can't get in if you don't have to anyway!",
    "It\u00c2\u00b4s a great course and I would recommend it to anyone, not just econ majors.",
    "Economics 122 01 is an economics course for individual who wants to develop a solid grasp of macroeconomics. During the course a student will learn about the Federal government and the resources it has at its disposal to effect the national and world economy. Students will always learn more about America's role in the world and how this country differs from other nations. Major case studies in the course include the Great Depression, the Financial Crisis of 2008 and the resulting Great Recession. I would recommend this course for any student at Yale because the economy is something that everyone will encounter during the course of their life. It is evident studying the crisisin 2008 that many in this country and the world simply did not know enough about the macroeconomy and therefore made poor decions that they still are reeling from. No one will reget taking this course. It will dispense life lessons for all.",
    "If you want to learn anything macroeconomics, take this class. You will not regret it.",
    "You need to take Intermediate Macroeconomics if you are an economics major, and you should take it with Nordhaus. He is an excellent professor; lectures are almost entertaining, and he is fully invested in the success of the class. Only half of the problem sets are graded (though he uses the Connecticut lottery to determine which ones, forcing you to do them all), the short paper is manageable (though poorly timed), and the midterm and final are both fair. You are ostensibly at Yale to learn from the best professors; Nordhaus is one of the best in the Yale economics department. Because enrollment is limited to 120, you will probably find it difficult to gain admission if you are not an economics major.",
    "You have to take it as an econ major, but expect to put in the time and effort to understand the concepts."
