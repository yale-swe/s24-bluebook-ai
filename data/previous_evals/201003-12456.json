   "comments": [
    "You should definitely take this class. It will not only give you some perspective on different religions and their origins, but it will also develop analytical skills that are sorely needed after the decidedly light reading that high school offers.",
    "You don't have to be biblically literate to take this class but it helps a lot and it's hard to be in the class if you aren't interested in religion. A lot of reading but Hayes is incredible.",
    "If you have any interest at all in the weighty issue of Divine Law, do take this seminar. The reading is manageable and interesting, and the discussions are immersive and dynamic.One, and only one caveat, if the class is at 9 AM, be prepared to fall in love with caffeine.",
    "This class is a great overview of Christian and Jewish thought; however, it is just that - an overview. That being said, the material is very interesting, Professor Hayes is a fantastic teacher, and it is an ideal freshman seminar. There's a lot of reading, but it's okay to fall behind. Also, there are only 5 reading responses throughout the semester that don't get graded so just doing them gets you 30% of your grade. Then there's a final paper which is on the topic of your choice. Overall, if the subject matter interests you, DEFINITELY take this freshman seminar!!!!",
    "Definitely take this course. Work is so easy but you reap so many benefits just by sitting in class.",
    "even though it is early, and most readings are on the computer, focus. you don;t really get a grasp of the material though",
    "Divine Law in Historical Perspective considered the ways in which conceptions of divine, civil, moral, and human laws change, develop, and interact from pre-Judaic times, to Judaism, to Christianity, with a range of thinkers' commentaries along the spectrum. I would absolutely recommend Divine Law; it was a privilege to be in Professor Hayes' seminar and learn all that I did.",
    "It is a great course, but it is not going to answer theological questions as much as you might think. It is going to focus on individual thinker's orientations to the Law, the Will, neoplatonic dualism (although more time could have been spent on this).Overall, it is a great course and an awesome introduction to Jewish, Christian and Secular thought on issues of the law and its legitimacy.",
    "Divine Law and Historical Perspective looks at different Jewish and Christian theologians\/scholars and examines the development and evolution of Jewish and Christian thought over the centuries. I recommend this class to everyone.",
    "Take it. Take it take it take it take it take it.Seriously, the professor is brilliant and approachable, a mix that is too rare at Yale; this opportunity is too good to pass up. You'll learn a lot, especially if you read the selections faithfully, and the fact that the only assignments apart from the final paper are pass\/fail reading responses means that the grade strain is minimal. Hayes puts so much effort into responding to your thoughts that you will come out more educated whether you like it or not.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!! This class is for everyone; it's not so much about \"religious studies\" (if this would deter people), but about the critical debates at the core of social and political institutions in general. Professor Hayes is wonderful, workload is light, and you'll be so happy with what you've gained at the end!!!!"
