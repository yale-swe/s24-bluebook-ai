    "If you're reading this evaluation, then SHOP THIS COURSE. Anyone and everyone should have a basic understanding of the ACA, and you'll be pleased with how much you've learned by the end of the semester. This topic is so timely and relevant, you'd be doing yourself a disfavor by not considering it. Be cautioned, however, that yes, the lectures can feel extremely slow. Unless this course has changed to 50-minute lectures, I would do your due diligence during shopping period and assess whether you can sit in LUCE for 2.5 hours every week. The course content is relatively dry in and of itself, albeit 100 percent worth learning, so you may have to push yourself to stay engaged.",
    "Dry, so very very dry. But a helpful course to understand how and why the healthcare system is so fucked up and how one would go about starting to fix it. If that topic sounds interesting to you (enough that you could still be interested in November), go for it.",
    "Fantastic class, with a pretty chill workload. Take it for sure, but know that there's a lot of memorization involved.",
    "Love this class. Such an interesting topic and Forman really breaks it down into simple terms. I highly recommend to everyone.",
    "Introductory summary into the healthcare system in the United States, with a particular focus on the challenges and potential solutions in the space.",
    "A solid course for anybody trying to get a grasp of the American healthcare market. Lectures can be a little dry, and it's sometimes confusing to know what you need to know from the slides for exams. But Prof. Forman is clearly very passionate about it and generally makes himself available for his students. Overall, it's a great econ elective \/ less intensive class if you actually attend lecture (otherwise, exam time will be really horrible).",
    "Mixed feelings about this course; take it credit D\/fail and you'll still learn a lot. The exams are fair; just memorize and regurgitate (though there's a lot of information thrown at you, so it's easy to miss things). Lectures are interesting for the first half hour, but the last 45 minutes of class are absolutely brutal.",
    "ECON 170 opened my eyes to how our Healthcare system actually works, specifically what Obamacare has done to change that, and a framework for improving the system. Furthermore, it is a great combination of economics and healthcare for anyone who is interested in one, or both, of those subjects. Professor Forman is clearly an expert on the topics discussed in class and does a great job making the information accessible in lecture. Also, the guest lectures were definitely highlights as we got to hear from leaders in the field. This class was also extremely well-organized thanks to Professor Forman and the TAs, and expectations were always made clear.",
    "Whether or not you are an econ major, it is really important material to learn, especially now. Take it. Instead of taking some useless class, take this, probably one of the more relevant classes currently being taught at Yale.",
    "Yes take it!",
    "It's an okay class. Take it if you've got the space, but it's nothing special.",
    "Very good class if you're interested in healthcare in the U.S. The curve is a bit tough since the exams are straightforward and easy, so Cr\/D is a good option and you'll still get a lot out of it.",
    "I recommend this course to a student, but in order to do well you really do need to go to class every day. Only in class does the professor provide the nuance behind concepts that is usually tested in exams. I recommend this to anyone looking to better understand the US healthcare scene.",
    "This is a good fifth class if you are looking for an econ elective. The lectures are not super engaging, but the information is very applicable to the real world. Overall, it does a really good job of explaining the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and general insurance concepts. It is not a ton of work, but overall a good experience.",
    "Should have started this class CR\/D.",
    "A polisci class, not an econ one. If you want to spend a lot of time memorizing facts about healthcare policy, then go for it. The class is not very transparent about what you actually have to know for the exams so most people just memorize everything. The courseload is low but there is a LOT of material so be prepared for it. The final paper is somewhat tedious and honestly pretty annoying (could really have nothing to do with the class). Overall, though, the class was very well organized and if you put in the effort, you can succeed.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in healthcare and policy. This course covers health economics concepts, Medicare and Medicaid, reimbursement schemes for physicians and hospitals, the ACA, etc. There are also many guest lecturers throughout the term. Go to lecture and take good notes because you have to remember specifics about the lectures for the exams. Start the research paper early if you can.",
    "Good class for a broad overview of the healthcare system in the US. As someone interested in working in this industry in the future it was a great way to gain vast knowledge and basic understanding of the underlying policies, history and foundation. Professor Forman is very well knowledgeable on his field. He taught the class very well as he has for multiple years. He goes a bit on tangent however, it's good to hear the extra tid bits but just makes it a bit difficult to know what parts are related to potential exam material vs. just extra fun knowledge. Loads of information thrown at you but you come out knowing a LOT. If you want to work in the field, definitely take! Not economics heavy at all.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn every little detail there is to know about the American healthcare system. Your grade consists of a midterm, a final research paper, a final exam, and a few small homework assignments that are essentially free points. The class is almost entirely qualitative so it's a nice break from problem sets for the typical Econ major. Lectures tend to be dry but he posts slides online so if you want to skip it's ok... But he also has an annoying tendency to put information not on the slides on the exams so it's probably best to attend.",
    "Covering the entire US healthcare system, with particularly in-depth detail on the public system (Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare), some version of this class should be required for every informed citizen. Having worked on health policy, Howie obviously has opinions on the issues and does not hesitate to share them, but he makes a dedicated effort to share reliable and up-to-date data and all sides of debates. With two short homework assignments, midterm, final, and final paper (and optional review sections), there will be busier weeks coupled with weeks of downtime. It will be tempting to memorize a lot of the facts and figures which are thrown at you in the class, and they are nice to put down in assignments and tests when you think of them, but tests generally are fair and stick to the big concepts.",
    "Definitely a must take for anyone who wants to have a reasonably informed and intelligent conversation about health policy. I've learned a lot in this class that I wouldn't have been able to get elsewhere.",
    "This class was very fair. It tied in economics, but felt like a political science course. If you can memorize facts, you'll be fine. This course asks you to understand broad ideas and concepts, and there is very little need to dive into the minutia. Class can get long sometimes, but that is entirely contingent upon how interested you are in the content.",
    "I would take this class again in a heartbeat! It's refreshing as an Econ class because you learn a lot about something you should know a lot about, but it's not so hard that everyone has to be graded on some ridiculous curve. It's not necessarily a gut, but it's not too hard. It's more of a policy class than Econ, but Econ is definitely in there. Healthcare is such an important topic, and I am much better for taking this class.",
    "yes!",
    "This course is very dry. If you are interested in the Healthcare sector, then definitely take this class. The lectures are straightforward as are the exams, but the material is very dry. This class is NOT a gut, it is NOT easy, and sometimes it's just boring. The workload is definitely doable.",
    "As someone who came in not even entirely sure what healthcare insurance was, I would highly recommend this class to majors and non-majors alike. Interesting and relevant, it is a class that has made me reconsider my career path as well as made me feel more informed when discussing healthcare topics.",
    "Econ 170 was a really interesting class about the US Healthcare system. The guest speakers offered really interesting exposure to different topics in healthcare. The class was especially valuable because the people who were teaching us (Forman, Bach, Burstin and other guest speakers)all have real world experience in developing health policy and healthcare administration.",
    "great overview of the economic and policy challenges faced by the US healthcare system. can get a bit dry (as policy can be), but i'd definitely recommend it for the econ credit or if you're interested in healthcare, insurance, or policy",
    "Actually one of the most useful classes I've taken at Yale. There are a lot of classes that we take because we need to fulfill a requirement or finish our major. But for a pre-med person like me or any economics major, the entire curriculum is a well-developed way of learning about the US healthcare industry, how it works, and what its faults are. It's really important that aspiring physicians\/nurses\/other healthcare professionals take this class because it's one of the only classes at Yale where we'll actually find out about the industry, and it's important for business people to take it because it's such a huge part of our economy and, in turn, a huge portion of the money we waste. Professor Forman is a great lecturer with a lot of knowledge on this topic, and there are a series of guest lecturers who are really smart and provide unique perspectives on their sides of the healthcare industry. Best of all, the workload is very reasonable. Midterm, final, two homework assignments, and a 6-8 page paper which doesn't take much time as long as you're interested in your topic. PUT TIME INTO THE TWO HOMEWORKS! The TAs say be concise, but take your time to be comprehensive -- learned that between the first and second assignment. Highly recommend this class!",
    "Health Economics is an amazing course on the modern healthcare industry in America. As someone extremely interested in this topic but with a very unclear understanding of it, this course could not have been more perfect. Now I feel like I have a firm grasp on fundamental concepts and terms in the healthcare industry. The guest lectures were absolutely amazing and were all held by prominent figures in the sector, providing insight into a wide array of topics outside of the normal lectures. The daily workload was very manageable - weekly readings that were all never a chore to do, two homework assignments that were based off of website readings, a midterm, final paper, and final. The two exams were VERY fair - just make sure you know all of the important terms and facts from the powerpoints. Start writing the final paper early! It's not long, but the TAs can be picky.",
    "This is not your typical economics class. There are no psets and not tons of economic theory at play (there is stuff like moral hazard and adverse selection that we talk about in class but this is only talked about at a conceptual standpoint and no mathematics\/graphs). It definitely is more like a political science class. Overall, this is a decent class -- not the worse but not the most interesting either. Professor Forman is a very cool guy, and he tries to make lecture more interesting with his joke but sometimes the material is just not exciting or repetitive from previous lectures.",
    "10\/10 recommend especially if you are interested in healthcare in any way",
    "I learned important, real-life details about important, real-life things. Take this class for your own good.",
    "Very interesting and easy Econ elective.",
    "Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in public health and understanding the american healthcare system! It was my favorite class so far! A lot of information to memorize and grasp, but worth the time",
    "Absolutely take this class! It is so relevant and proves that economics is at the backbone of almost any discipline.",
    "I took the class to learn more about the healthcare system, and I came out really understanding the politics and economics behind it. I would definitely recommend it because Prof. Forman is one of the best professors I've had. Also, it wasn't too much work. The grading is pretty hard though.",
    "Econ 170 is an interesting course that teaches you the basic economics of healthcare and how the healthcare system is organized. I think it is very important information to know. Though there is not a lot of economics theory, it is a good elective economics class to experiment with different concentrations.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. It was by far one of my favorite classes. As a premedical student, I found it extremely useful in understanding the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, Insurance, and so many other parts of the health care system that many Americans simply don't understand. If you want to truly understand the health care market and how much needs to be reformed in the American health care system, this is the class for you. As a student who hasn't taken any economic classes before this, either, it was a great way to be introduced to a field of economics that falls with my realm of interest.",
    "This class is very broad view of health economics that takes you through all of the important areas in this field. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "An amazing course! I learned so much and it is definitely in my top two favorite courses at Yale so far. I would definitely take this alongside Christakis' \"Health of the Public\" course, since they compliment each other well. A very strong class and exactly what I wanted to learn as a student interested in getting an MD\/MBA. It was intense, engaging, and all of the basics that anyone needs to know about healthcare economics today. Tests are mostly memorization. My advice is to take really good notes, and then before the tests, taking a highlighter and pulling out key terms (making sure you understand what they are) and any lists\/bullet points that seem critical. Memorize these, use them in the tests, and you should be all set. It seemed this is the same method Professor Forman and his TAs used to write the tests, and studying this was was crucial to my success. You have one midterm, two short and very manageable assignments (giving detailed answers is key), one paper (cover as many key ideas from lecture as possible), and one final. The tests really aren't that hard and not that much memorization... I usually got it down to memorizing maybe 20 key things, since most terms are just common sense. A very easy course to take with other classes. Like Forman said, a lot more policy than economics. That being said, knowing at least intro micro gives you a better understanding of the implications he talks about.",
    "Pretty cool class. Definitely interesting to learn about the ACA. However, depending on what happens politically, it may have just been a semi waste of a semester. you definitely learn a lot more about health care in general, and I can honestly say that I feel a lot more comfortable navigating the health care system after this class. There is a final paper and an essay, but the final essay was also interesting to write. Forman is an awesome professor. He goes on rants in class and that makes it difficult to discern what will be on the first midterm, but the rants are really interesting and provide real life experience teachings. Definitely try to stop in to his office hours when he is working at YNHH. That was a super cool time and you get to see him work some radiology magic."
