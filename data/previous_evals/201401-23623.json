   "comments": [
    "Me? Personally? Probably not.",
    "A class I never knew what was going on. It's a pretty chill class, but I feel like I could have learned a lot more on the topic than I did.",
    "I would recommend this course. I felt that the course description did not justify it. It is not based on how top persuade but rather the study of persuasion.",
    "A warning: This class is NOT a political science class or an english class. It is a Classics course, taught like a classics course. There will be some readings of modern\/political speeches but not as many as you might think. Most of it will be Cicero, Aristotle, etc. That's not to say this isn't a great class--it is--but I and many others went into it expecting something more poli-sci or English oriented. Make sure to adjust your expectations going in. If you're not into classics, don't take it. However, if you are even a little bit, this will be the class for you! Professor Bakker is very friendly, though he can be a bit dry sometimes. The readings are very interesting, and the projects--almost all speeches that you write and then deliver in class--are fun to do. I'd recommend to those with any interest in both classics and rhetoric.",
    "Yes, take this class if you are interested in classics.",
    "If you are interested in classics, take this class. It is much more about ancient greek orators than it is about persuasion and written skills, although the two come together very nicely in the final speeches. It was a good class even though it may not be the right class for everyone.",
    "A Caveat, this course isn't exactly what it purports to be. It's a FANTASTIC class, but geared toward studying rhetoric from a classical lens (i.e. reading a lot of Aristotle, Cicero, Lysias, etc.). If you enjoy reflecting on the beginnings of Western Civilization (i.e. Ancient Greece and Rome) and want to learn more about how to craft a good speech, then this class is for you. It is an easy writing credit. Professor Bakker is a great teacher and very intelligent. The class is also a great break from writing formal essays and well-reasoned arguments like an essay calls for. With a speech, as you would learn in the class, you are allowed to take much more liberty with rhythm, rhetorical effects, and sentence structure. It's very refreshing in a sense and the workload is totally manageable. Just a couple 5 page papers (1.5. spaced though so it's more like 7 pages. Also, as the class is structured now, you don't get into working the actual practice of speaking, just the written aspects of speech. Your final project is a speech though. Ultimately, put a lot into the class and you'll enjoy it if you love old Western Civilization. I highly recommend this class to everyone!",
    "A nice freshman seminar where you get to read the writings of the great orators of our time. The class was nice, but had there been more presented speeches along with more video\/listening assignments, it may have been a bit more effective in accomplishing its mission, as while reading speeches is important, a huge part of what makes a great orator great is the way in which he presents his speech. There is a lot of freedom in the class and assignments, which is great. Take it if you're extremely interested in the subject matter and you understand that this class is as much reading and discussing dead white men as it is about learning about speaking, if not more. If you're expecting this to be a class on public speaking, don't take it. As long as you know up front what the class is, you shouldn't be displeased with it.",
    "Definitely take this class! Not too much work and great fun.",
    "The Arts of Persuasion is not a speech class, though it greatly involves writing and delivering speeches. Rather, it is a course about ancient rhetoric, and a great introduction to some classical philosophers if you have had no experience at all. Also, the workload is pretty light.",
    "Study of the ancient art of rhetoric."
