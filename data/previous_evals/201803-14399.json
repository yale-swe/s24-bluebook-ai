    "I learned SO MUCH from this course. While relevant to my research, it taught me a very different way of approaching modeling than I would typically use. The only suggestion (I would not call it a weakness) I would make is that sometimes the PhD problems were extremely long and too challenging. I am a PhD student and I am not opposed to challenging homework problems (in fact, I usually like them), but in many cases I felt that my background was not adequate for the PhD problems and I ended up having to try to learn an entire branch of research\/statistics\/modeling just to answer part of a question. I didn't feel like the lectures prepared me for the PhD problems.",
    "The course is designed very well and the teaching style is great too!",
    "Although Prof. Kaplan's previous work is very impressive and interesting, I think we can benefit more from learning the concept, models and methods than the background and context of the work.",
    "It is really fast paced, but I enjoyed learning with Prof Kaplan, and he's really articulate, humorous, and knowledgeable",
    "The examples used in class are all simple and easier to understand, but the problems in the homework are much harder than the class.",
    "better guidance by the teaching assistant"

    "I would recommend this course to another student; however, I would only recommend it to students with very strong quantitative skills, motivation, and enough time to dedicate to the courseload.",
    "Yes - you'll learn how to apply so many mathematical concepts to real world problems. opens your eyes to so many research questions waiting to be answered.",
    "Yes, very insightful",
    "Yes I will, if one is interested in learning quantitative policy analysis and learning challenging probability models.",
    "Yes, it is very useful for learning the basics of modelling and the class also provides the opportunity to apply what we've learned to real-life problems. Although some probability background is necessary, the level of probability background required is not too advanced.",
    "Yes! It would allow you to learn to think from a different perspective, and use different\/simple mathematic tools to solve problems!",
    "yes",
    "Yes. It is a practical class to optimization.",
    "Yes",
    "yes, non-technical skills to estimating numbers"
