    "I would recommend German 120 to any student wishing to continue their German education from L1. I do think that the course can be repetitive and is limited by a rather inflexible curriculum, unfortunately; however, I think that if well-taught, it can really teach a student quite a lot about the German language and German culture.",
    "Take it! Its a great language and the German Department offers many activities to help improve your proficiency if class is not enough!",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to other students. It's a great continuation of GMAN 110.",
    "Most things are continuous from German 110. If you can keep up with all the homeworks, including the reading, and study a couple of nights ahead for tests, you'll do well.",
    "I've enjoyed German greatly, and I highly recommend it, especially to someone who loves music, history, classics, or the other humanities that can be better accessed through German primary and secondary sources."
