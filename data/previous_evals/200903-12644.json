   "comments": [
    "This was a great introductory course to the field of Molecular Anthropology, covering a very interesting variety of topics. This course was an eye-opener to some of the most pertinent and pressing topics of our current times, as well as being a lot of fun! I recommend it to every student.",
    "Take it! Interesting material (genetics' role in understanding human evolution and cultures), great professor. Courseload is also highly manageable.",
    "It's a bit tough to get by without going to class and paying attention, though you can certainly get by without doing the reading. Not a complete joke of a class, but you can certainly get a good grade without putting in an extraordinary amount of effort.",
    "Fun class, no work except for a few ridiculously easy problem sets and two tricky exams. Definitely a good way to fulfill a science credit. Would recommend it for sure! I found myself thinking about the course content outside of class, and I also became aware of some awesome YouTube videos of strange animals.",
    "If you need a science credit, this is a good course to take because there is very little science involved. Quizzes don't count for a grade, just participation and the problem sets are really easy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to someone else. The topic is very relevant to our lives, yet is something we don't really know too much about.",
    "It is a course on how genetics and other forms of molecular analysis applies to anthropology, for instance how it supplements the fossil record in identifying human origins, clarifies human biological relationships with other animals (mainly other primate), reveals ancient human genotypes\/potential phenotypes, as well as how it can be used for forensic applications. I would recommend it for someone without a background in science who is interested in genetics and some of its practical applications.",
    "Great way to get a science credit. Pretty interesting material (does race have a biological foundation? Can a gene determine whether you're likely to commit adultery?) and very reasonable workload (three problem sets, one midterm, and a final).",
    "I would take it as a non science major. The workload is very manageable, the grading seemed fair, and its very relevant stuff that you'll actually find yourself talking about outside of class or thinking about when reading a pop magazine.",
    "Molecular Anthropology is a pretty easy science credit (that's why I took it). Ours was the first time Professor Bradley was teaching the course, so there was literally no reading, which was GREAT for a science course. Brenda Bradley is great; she really puts a lot of effort into making her lectures digestible and enjoyable, and it shows. The work isn't much (three problem sets, a midterm, and a final), and I actually learned a lot about human evolution and migration. I would recommend it.",
    "recommended, but you need to attend every single lecture, since there are pop quizzes and little things that count towards your grade. lecture can get really boring because it goes so slow. good science class for nonscience majors. professor bradley is really sweet and friendly.",
    "if you are looking to fulfill a science requirement, there are better courses to take at this point.",
    "Fun and relevant.Majoring in the Humanities, I took this for the science credit. It's great for bridging the gap between the two.Going to lecture is hardly necessary as everything Bradley said was on the slides which are the main study source for the exams (which are quite difficult, btw) unless you're a auditory learner, :).",
    "Yes. Definitely. Very interesting, not too difficult, Prof. Bradley makes students learn the most while giving them the least pressure. I am a History major and this course helped me to gain general knowledge about the history of human evolution through a novel window called genetics. It really broadened my insight and enhanced my understanding of the history of our species. I recommend this course for any non-science major looking for an interesting and fulfilling science course, or any humanities major who want to gain background about human evolution.",
    "Yes. Really easy SC that is also really interesting with great real world applications.",
    "ANTH 204 explores the structure of DNA, evolutionary factors in a broad context, human evolution specifically, modern humans\u0092 relationship with other primates and neanderthals, migration and race. It's a very interesting class with a little work (3 problem sets\/papers, a midterm, and a final). It's a very good way to get a science credit.",
    "I would like to preface this eval by saying that I really loved this class overall. I thought this was really fun and interesting and found Prof Bradley's teaching style really engaging.Nevertheless, I'm going to be very critical about this class. This course is a lot different than I expected it to be. I would say there are three sections: genetic fingerprinting and sequencing (what I thought was the cool stuff!), naming types of primates and phylogenies (hardest part of the class and most disappointing class for me), and fossils and human evolution. If you're not interested in any of these subjects, be careful about taking this class b\/c your'e not exposed to the latter two until much later in the class.I also had a lot of trouble w\/ the tests and felt really disadvantaged in this class because I had no bio background. It seemed like a lot of students knew a lot about biology already. I was also saddened because I thought the midterm and final would be more similar to the quizzes which I did well on and seemed to be testing more general knowledge with open ended questions. I thought the first quiz really asked us to stretch our brains and the knowledge we had to figure something else, but then I thought the later quizzes and the midterm and final were more about memorizing facts and I was never really sure about what were important facts versus really cool and interesting sidenotes.I am happy to say that the class was very successful in teaching me how to understand, generally, scientific papers. That made me really happy!",
    "Great as an Sc requirement. The material was very interesting to learn and lectures aren't boring. The quizzes are for attendance and the Professor's own interest to see how the students are retaining information. The 3 problem sets were very manageable, but you should definitely study for the midterm and final. The final is cumulative. The lectures are posted online so you don't need to go to class, but as mentioned, the pop quizzes are also to take attendance. You could do an optional short in-class presentation on some related current event, however, to take the place of two missed quizzes.",
    "fun class if you are interested in anthropology and genetics. tests are harder than you might think, and you should try to attend all the lectures, because the textbook isn't really a great resource",
    "I would recommend this course if the student wants to know general information on the history and potential relevance of studies on genetics. It's not too hard, but it can get a little boring as success relies chiefly on the memorization facts and timelines more than on understanding biological processes.",
    "go for it.",
    "If you're looking for an interesting, relatively easy science credit, the class is great."
