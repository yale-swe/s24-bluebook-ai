    "Sometimes the lecture format felt a little strange given the class size (6 people). I think this type of class would work better as a seminar (or a hybrid lectminar), so you have a chance to engage with the material a little more. We covered a lot of material even though it felt like the kinks were being worked out as we went. Professor Breen is a very nice man, who is definitely an expert in the field (about 5 people in the world really study mobility and he's one of them), which can sometimes make him a harsh grader.",
    "I would absolutely recommend SOCY 217. This was possibly one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Yale, and it definitely broadened my perspective on socioeconomic issues in the United States. I'm so glad I took this course, and I wish there were more like it!",
    "Social and Economic mobility is a great class if you are really interested in the material. It was nice for us because it was (very) small (only like half a dozen of us), but it was the first time it was taught and they were still trying to work out the kinks (like as to whether or not to keep it as a lecture or turn it into a seminar). Professor Breen is really helpful, though, and section was usually pretty interesting.",
    "It is a course that outlines the key thinkers of social and economic mobility with a very strong focus on the US with the occasional comparison to Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. I would not recommend this course to anyone unless it was required (or it goes under major re-working and a new syllabus is created that accurately shows what assignments are and what is expected from students). I would not recommend this course because it was taught poorly, it was boring to listen to, the readings were not placed on classes in their entirety or were put far out of order, and the assignments had zero guidance beforehand and no rubric to work with before or after (I still dont know how I got the grade I did on the midterm)"
