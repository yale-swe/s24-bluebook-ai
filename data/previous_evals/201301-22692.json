   "comments": [
    "Solid L5 Spanish option. Fairly short reading, two 5-7 page papers and 4 shorter homework assignments. Participation is important, so if you're not comfortable with interjecting your opinion in a foreign language, you might hurt a bit grade-wise. The subject matter is rather interesting - covers a lot of Latin American political issues (often disregarded in the US) on a case-by-case basis. Prof. Carballal is very knowledgeable and understanding.",
    "An in-depth look at Latin American politics -- lots of topical issues that are pretty necessary for an understanding of the region. Great discussion, great instructor, great readings. A must take.",
    "Take this course for some good language practice in an interesting environment--fun topics to practice your speaking skills and learn about contemporary issues. This course is not very stressful, but the more work you do, the more you'll get out of it! This course provides a good forum for discussion, and debates can get pretty intense, but amicable. Definitely recommend--lots of fun and very helpful!",
    "This is a really solid class. Take it, especially if you are at all interested in diving into issues relating to contemporary Latin American politics. It will make your rethink your assumptions on a number of things. It is intellectually stimulating and very manageable work-wise.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who was interested in Latin American politics and wanted to improve their Spanish abilities. This course gives a very informative overview of important political events in Latin America. As someone who sometimes didn't feel an intense connection to the issues, it was difficult to come up with insightful comments that I felt like sharing. However, overall this course provided me with a good opportunity to practice speaking and writing in Spanish and improved my understanding of the Latin American political atmosphere.",
    "TAKE IT. This class is really amazing, and goes much more in depth than Advanced Conversational Spanish will. You learn about much more interesting topics, though it's also a bit more focused on Latin American issues in political science and international relations (obviously). You get to do a fair amount of talking, and she offers a lot of guidance both during class and during office hours (which are super helpful when you're writing essays). The readings aren't too long or confusing, and the writings aren't too difficult either. I'd suggest taking a refresher course like Advanced Conversational or maybe L4 Spanish if you haven't taken Spanish in a while, but overall just take it if you can!",
    "Yes! I would say it is an interesting class in which you learn a lot about Latin American politics but it is also a great way to keep practicing your spanish.",
    "Overall, a great course that covers many conflicts in Latin America between the 1950s and the present day. Good course if you want to practice spanish. Be warned that many students know a lot of Latin American politics, and you will have to think on your feet if you aren't an avid news-reader. However, it's not impossible to keep up, and it's interesting to hear people with strong opinions speak!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to get better at spanish--especially if they want to do international relations. This class includes \"media\" in the title and we did talk about it occassionally but by no means was this a class restricted to talking about media. It felt more like a crash course \/ survey or Latin American politics and the biggest issues of the last century.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this to a student relatively unacquainted with recent Latin American political history or to a student who wants to improve his reading, writing, and oral linguistic abilities. The course dispels a lot of unfair myths that persist about Latin American politics, and it's a lot of fun. Two papers, and four minor writing assignments. Manageable at 15-30 pages of reading a day."
