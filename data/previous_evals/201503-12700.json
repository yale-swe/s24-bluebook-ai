   "comments": [
    "Take this class!! It is a relatively easy but super fun science credit, and you actually learn a ton. Professor Irons is such a sweet guy and really invested in making sure you understand the material. Homework assignments are pretty easy and it is only one midterm and one final project. I highly recommend this class!",
    "Not an easy science credit, but one where you will do something with your hands, at least in class.",
    "Definitely! Very hands on and fun. Learned a lot. Take the class!!",
    "Best science credit. Take it! You will get frustrated at points because sometimes no one really knows what's going on or a homework assignment is a little unclear, but then you remember what most Yale classes are like and remember that this class is actually really fun and chill. Also, Irons is great.",
    "It's a fun class and very different from other classes at Yale. It is very hands on and a lot of tangible learning.",
    "Probably one of the best science credits to take if you're a non-science person, especially if you want to learn how to do something with your hands rather than memorize facts and theories. Every day you come in, have max 20 mins of lecture, and then you get to work on the day's assignment (usually building some new type of circuit with new components). Most problem sets weren't that tough, but study up for the midterm. Most of your grade is based on your in class activities, psets and your final project, so it's not that bad if you mess up on the midterm. The final project is as much or as little as you want to put into it, but I found it fun and rewarding. Main problem with the course was that there were not enough TA's to help all the groups at once in class. I think they're probably going to fix this in the future. Overall, probably the best a science credit can be for a non-science student.",
    "Solid SC credit! Homeworks can be a *little* tricky and midterm was as well but really no curve balls! Nice way to break up the monotony of other classes and you do learn some cool aspects of electronics. If you get in, worth taking!",
    "I would recommend this class to other students because it is a great, hands-on experience, overall. I would, however, caution people not to go in expecting a gut. The class is pretty challenging, but the professor, TA, and other instructors are more than willing to help you out along the way.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class. Not extremely demanding workload (6 short psets, midterm, final project), but really enjoyable most of the time. Professor Irons puts in a lot of effort to help his students be engaged and successful. Final project can be fun if you put some effort in. Prof does a good job of keeping you on track with it",
    "Good Sc credit. Materials were straight forward, I got to play with cool electronic parts, and the professor was very kind and helpful. The course structure could use more organization, but overall I had a good time.",
    "Really fun hands on class, highly recommended",
    "I didn't like this course. You will be expected to do psets every week and then take a midterm exam without having been taught anything in class because all class you tinker with electronics, which is great! BUT then how do you do physics problems??? as a non-science major, I had no idea! It was all very confusing. I wouldn't do it again. I also will admit, I didn't go to office hours or try very hard to excel in this class. If you're looking for a science credit that you don't have to put any time into, this isn't for you. If you want to spend a little time on it, maybe you should take it.",
    "Overall this course was a little frustrating. There was semblance of a structure but often times I had no idea what was going on and it made it hard to get through the class. The hands on class experiments were marvelous and that definitely should not change but there was always a disconnect between what the students knew and what we should've known to get through the day. The lecture portion was always pretty good but then when it was time to do the homework or the in class assignment, I almost always had no idea what was going on. I enjoyed the in class activities a lot but often after doing them I was still unsure why things worked the way the did. I felt like the concepts were not taught well enough that we truly grasped them."
