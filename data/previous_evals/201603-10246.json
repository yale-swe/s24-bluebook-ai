    "Rev. Kelsey did a great job fostering an atmosphere of collegiality. She led the section well.",
    "Thoughtful and helpful feedback on sermons. Very experienced and engaged with the process of helping shape student sermons that would be preached in the future.",
    "Clear feedback Encouragement was strong no real weaknesses",
    "The feedback on student sermons that she provided was very helpful, very insightful. Sometimes I found her a little rigid. For instance, all Christian sermons have something to do with proclaiming Jesus, but if this wasn't explicit she noted that as a negative. I understand why, but in context of a congregational pastor, I believe it may be possible that some sermons might be effective without being explicitly Jesus-centric, particularly if 95% of that preacher's sermons ARE Jesus-centric. Of course, this is a minor quibble.",
    "She was wonderful. She was the reason I wanted to go to preaching class. She was always respectful, fair, and clear with her comments and criticisms. I would welcome the opportunity to work with Shelly again!",
    "The preaching sections were great. We each had two opportunities to preach and got good and helpful feedback.",
    "Rev. Shelley's comments on my sermons were invaluable to my preparation; she did a good job of managing section and keeping everyone focused on the task at hand. The balance of praise and critique was good as well. On the weakness side, there were one or two times when Rev. Shelley got on a theological tangent that she obviously felt passionate about. While this passion is a good thing, it also meant that sidebar conversations occasionally ate up 5-10 minutes of section before the preacher even started. While I don't discount the need for those conversations, I didn't feel it was fair to take time away from the student preachers to have them, then and there. I would have appreciated it if those conversations could have been \"tagged\" and left for optional participation at the end of the allotted time.",
    "Julie was an inspiring, encouraging section leader - both during section and through her comments and feedback on written work. She offered very helpful reflections and advice, both generally to all the section and specifically to each one of us after a sermon. Her positive, reflective manner set the tone for the section and helped to create and nurture a safe, supportive atmosphere - it felt like a place where it was possible to try things out and not be afraid of 'failing'. The sections also felt very prayerful as Julie always started them with a time of quiet, and of prayer. The two sessions when there was no one scheduled to preach (only 9 of us in the section) Julie arranged for the time to be used very effectively - one session for discussing preaching at occasional offices and special services (along with time for any general questions about preaching) and the other session with Adrienne on reading scripture aloud. This section was a joy to be part of and was invaluable in terms of learning and developing in preaching.",
    "Mrs. Stackhouse was a very valuable part of my Preaching experience. She gave great feedback and was an excellent leader of our section. I learned a lot from her stories and experiences, and feel like I could have learned more had we set aside even more time in section to discuss her experience! For example, we had great discussions on preaching at funerals, preaching Christmas sermons, preaching with no notes, etc. I believe my biggest take aways from semester may have come from Rochelle in this section.",
    "written comments on work were very helpful. effective use of time in section.",
    "Having Dean Kelsey as my section leader was absolutely fantastic. She was both encouraging and gave very helpful and thoughtful, feedback. Before I started my first sermon in the class, I was freaking out and rambling and she told me \"just preach,\" which was what I needed to hear. I also appreciated her feedback on my sermons. She offered helpful comments on both delivery and content. For our second round of sermons, she told us to keep in mind the question \"What difference does Jesus make?\" This question shows what type of section leader Dean Kelsey is: one who is un-apologetically concerned with the Gospel. This shown throughout her feedback: she wanted a good delivery, but specifically a good delivery that proclaimed the Gospel. I was incredibly grateful to have her as my section leader. She also did a great job facilitating discussion, and eventually our section got to the point where we engaged in dialogue not just giving feedback. Dean Kelsey was also genuinely concerned with how we were doing at certain points in the semester, which I appreciated. Finally, I appreciated the wisdom that she gave when we talked about funeral sermons.",
    "In section Professor McCray facilitated our feedback for sermons adeptly, guiding us through questions that elicited thoughtful critique. She switched methods mid-course, which seemed to help elicit more critical feedback. She also began\/ended some of the sections with meditations or prayers, which centered our work and time together. She modeled careful and critical listening.",
    "Strengths - Really cares about her students and guided us into caring for one another - Use of prayer in section - Availability for assistance, conversation, - Prompt, if not speedy, return of work with comments Weaknesses - Needs to be cautious about making implicit and explicit assertions of the way things should be done and the use of symbols of authority. For example, in a roundtable on sermons for special occasions, she led the conversation standing at the pulpit wearing her collar. It was the only time she wore her official priestly uniform during the semester. This discouraged a free sharing of opinion, which is what a roundtable is supposed to be about. Far better to have led us without the collar and sitting in the circle with us.",
    "Dr. McCray was incredibly innovative and attentive. She really took her time getting to know each student and speaking to their unique preaching experiences! I look forward to learning more from her in the future!",
    "Professor McCray is an incredible instructor. She demonstrates mastery of a wide range of material and shares her insights in accessible ways that account for differences in student background and goals. She is warm and offers a safe space for students to develop new skills and insights."
