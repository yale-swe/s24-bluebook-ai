   "comments": [
    "It's well structured. Yet, some lectures where really repetitive with something discussed in a previous week.",
    "I enjoyed the discussion format of the course",
    "The teachers are very experienced so that we can learn about what they have faced and prevent us from making the same mistake. It would be better if we can get one-slide summary from each teacher which is easier for us to memorize.",
    "I think that most of the discussions managed to be fun and interesting even though the material was all stipulated by the NIH.",
    "Strengths: I liked the relaxed atmosphere of most of the sessions, and the cookies. Weaknesses: I was disappointed at how few of the sessions actually discussed ethical issues. A large number of the discussion were instead about various practicalities of grad school and science work that could have been discussed at another time.",
    "I was worried that it would be just reading out of the book and really boring but the professors made it way more interesting with their stories and more real life examples.",
    "There was no announcement about the first class meeting, so some students missed it.",
    "Very good course."
