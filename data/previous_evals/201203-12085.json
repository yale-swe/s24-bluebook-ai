   "comments": [
    "DS of the East. Filled with DSers too, so be prepared for that. There is a lot of reading, and weekly response papers, but only 2 papers (5-7 pages) and no exam. Pretty cool stuff, but there's a lot of it.",
    "Definitely, unless you don't like religious studies. I didn't realize how religion-heavy this course would be, and I ended up loving that, but it's more religion\/philosophy than lit.",
    "The course feels like DS lite for India and the East. If this sounds good, take it. If it doesn't, don't. The reading load is heavy but everything you read is worthwhile.",
    "If you like analyzing literature and participating in class discussions, this is a class for you! There is A LOT of reading\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you have a full course-load, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly impossible to do it all\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the literature is amazing and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re smart about it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to be selective about the reading you do. Professor Granoff and Shinohara are great teachers, truly experts in their field. I highly recommend this class if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up to do the work.",
    "This course is an amazing overview of literature. The great things about it are:-Get a real diversity of material, including from region (India, China, Japan) as well as type (literature, poetry, philosophy, novels, political science).-Get to learn a lot about the region's ancient religions and politics through the novels, and the profs do a good job of reading between the lines to help you understand what the different works are really saying about the societies.-The work is manageable, and none of it is wasted. There is a lot of reading, but besides that there is only one short response a week and two 5-7 page papers. The responses are really helpful in enabling you to clarify your thoughts on the reading, and the papers usually come from those responses, so all the work is interesting.-Class conversation was really interesting and it really is a student-driven class.-Readings are so fun!-The professors know A LOT about the texts and are really passionate about making it all come out-- you can tell they love the texts.-Get to watch cool videos of the texts being performed, and we had a visit from an Indonesian puppet master which as so awesome.The more challenging aspect of the course is that since there is so much diversity of text, there are some texts that certain people find harder than others. For example, you might love Chinese philosophy but find Indian epics to be really difficult, or the other way around. It can be hard if you're doing a text that is hard for you, but also it is only for a short while since you'll switch soon and it is good practice!",
    "A sort of miniature DS of the East, a wonderful sweeping introduction to the mostly religious literature of India, China, and Japan. If you're interested in the subject or think you might just be, take this class. The professors--a delightful married couple--could not be better or frankly more adorable. You certainly won't regret it.",
    "It's an interesting look into a culture that you probably haven't dealt with much. Some of the books we read are fascinating, others are extremely complicated and impossible to understand or keep straight, but overall a good overview of the culture of India, China, Japan, and Buddhism, Hinduism and Daoism in general. A ton of reading, though- but it's not the end of the world if you can't make it through all of it. Definitely a great choice for Religious Studies majors looking for their Eastern religion requirement",
    "This is a fantastic class that gives you a great taste of the non-Western canon. Professors Granoff and Shinohara are lovely people and great professors, both in terms of their knowledge of the subject matter and their ability to lead discussions. The reading material ranges from philosophical to literary. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Sort of like eastern DS--a mix of philosophy, literature, and religion. Some art. Some history. Some historical thought. Seminar meets twice a week and is split between a mini-lecture that provides really helpful background and discussion, which is a mix of fruitful discussion and questions."
