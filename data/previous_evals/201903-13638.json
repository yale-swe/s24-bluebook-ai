    "A lot of skills I had taken some courses before FES on intro stats but never learned much. . This course was completely different. A lot of learning throughout the semester",
    "Good basic understanding of statistics, conducting some statistic analyses, and understanding how to interpret stats.",
    "Basic stats skills",
    "Better and deeper understanding of basic statistical tests",
    "I learned the basic statistics, how to interpret statistics results, and how to run statistics on Minitab.",
    "Developed working knowledge of introductory statistics. I understand statistics WAY better than I have ever understood it before.",
    "Conducting statistical models and their limitations, designing a statistical analysis (including cleaning data)",
    "Audit (reviewing the lectures for my statistics necessary for second semester thesis).",
    "Learned basic statistics and Minitab.",
    "Better understanding of how to use stats in my research",
    "When I enrolled in this course, I was a bit concerned about the math. However, Jonathan is the best faculty for this course. I learnt literally everything statistics can teach in a semester. I am proud of my self now because I can apply the concepts with confidence.",
    "I learned a lot in this course (pretty all ways to run a statistical analysis such as a hypothesis test, chi square, ANOVA, etc)",
    "An understanding of different statistical concepts and their application",
    "I gained a great introduction to stats through problems that were environmentally oriented and learned how to run many analyses.",
    "I learned to use statistics to answer quantitative questions, both by learning concrete analysis techniques -- such as regression, ANOVA, etc. -- and by learning to examine data before conducting tests to identify trends and make general observations. While I am most interested in doing qualitative research and work, I found the class to be very helpful, and I feel confident that I will incorporate elements of this course into my future work at F&ES and beyond.",
    "Analysis, Reporting, Regression",
    "A solid foundation of everything you need to know about statistics, and clear paths of where to go if you want to learn more.",

   "comments": [
    "Fully 100%. Gained more knowledge than I had expected",
    "Very well - better even.",
    "Very well",
    "They met my expectations",
    "The class exceeded my expectations. I've taken stats class before, and I can clearly say that this was the best course. The instructor clearly knew what he was teaching and he explained it in a way that made so much sense. He also gave lots of examples which helped us understand the material. The quizzes and homeworks were also in line with the materials covered in class and helped us review what we learned.",
    "This class extremely exceeded my expectations. Reuning-Scherer is an amazing professor - he makes stats fun, interesting, and understandable. Homeworks were at the right level to improve my understanding of topics taught in class, office hours were really helpful, overall great.",
    "Help me read statistical reports and understand them + help me conduct a statistical analysis for my capstone",
    "Aligned with expectations.",
    "Very well. The class has proved very useful already.",
    "So much. I gained what i expected to gain i.e. the ability to begin to use statistics more strategically. I can now understand better some statistical inferences in published papers and assigned readings.",
    "Very well, exactly what I was expecting",
    "I learned a bit more than I expected and enjoyed it more than I anticipated.",
    "The class exceeded my expectations. As an undergraduate student, I took an entry-level statistics course, and I only learned a smattering of what we covered in Dr. Reuning-Scherer's class. As a result of this course, I now feel confident in conducting basic statistical analysis on my own and using the results to inform real-world decisions. I am honestly surprised that I benefitted from and enjoyed a statistics\/quantitative class this much.",
    "Extremely well",
    "I thought there would be a stronger emphasis on environmental science rather than social science, but apart from that it was pretty clear from the first class what I was getting into.",
    "Less than expected. Truly a program-based class, did not expect to master mini tab.",
    "Very well.",
    "The knowledge I obtained in this class certainly aligned with my expectations. I am now able to conduct statistical analysis on my own and understand papers that discuss an analysis",
    "Well aligned",
    "Exceeded - learned more than anticipated and was much more challenging than anticipated.",
    "Greatly-I feel like I finally understand what I'm doing in statistics, and not just plugging numbers into software",
    "it is a good class, better than expected"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths- Instructors way of teaching and engagement, course material, assignments, course design Weaknesses- None",
    "The course is well organized and the option to attend in person or watch online was incredibly useful. The TFs who had not taken the course before were sometimes not very helpful (didn't know how to do a given problem\/had to look up the method during OH). I think TFs in the future should definitely be students who have taken the course before.",
    "Jonathan is a fun and dynamic teacher who keeps things really interesting. Sometimes he went a bit quickly, but you can always rewatch the lecture on video.",
    "Strength: watching videos of the class was very useful. I preferred this method instead of going to a live class; I found I took better notes and understood the material better because I can pause the video at any time, replay certain parts, and take detailed notes at my own pace",
    "The instructor is great. He is patient and does a very good job of explaining concepts that can seem confusing to students at first. The assignments and exams also helped review the materials we learned in class. I didn't find any weaknesses. Best stats class ever.",
    "Reuning-Scherer is one of the best professors I've had. He is such a good teacher! The material, homeworks, and exams were at the right level for intro statistics.",
    "Jonathan was always to help and he spends time thinking about how to explain content to students in a way that is memorable. Jonathan even comes to class when he has a cold. It's impressive.",
    "- Great course, very good professor who does a great job trying to engage students. - I wish the TAs were provided a rubric to grade each assignment so there could be consistent grading. There were assignments I did with other students and we would get different points off based on the exact same answer.",
    "Strength - engaging and interactive Weakness - started slowly and sped up very quickly. Did not finish all of the syllabus.",
    "I see everything as strengths! No weaknesses at all. The way it is structured and delivered is the best so far and should be emulated by many of the other classes that are quantitative\/ significant arithmetic engagement.",
    "There are many Strengths to the course. JRS allows this course to pretty much be accessible to all by recording lectures. Everything is take home (including exams) so we are allowed to use our notes on everything, which is very helpful.",
    "Strengths- very exercise-based and realistic, without too many expectations of having to memorize formulae and definitions, which was a breath of fresh air.",
    "It was great. Maybe a bit more information on how to run analyses in R for independent learning",
    "The course moves quickly and covers a lot of ground, so it is imperative that students do the work to keep up and not be left behind. This, in my opinion, is a strength of the course. Another strength is Dr. Reuning-Scherer's teaching style and general personality. He is a friendly person, and he is very helpful. It's also important to note that he was never once condescending when I asked him basic questions or was confused by complex problems. For someone who has such a deep knowledge of statistics, he makes sure to take the time to help his students understand the basics, and he does not get annoyed by simple questions.",
    "Too much work",
    "I thought it was the best introductory class I took at Yale thus far. I think the office hours and the videos made the class extremely accessible.",
    "The course is not taught for beginner statisticians, which is what is expected. He speaks at a rate and level that was very hard to understand and process with excessive review.",
    "Office hours were very helpful, however, it may be better to focus more on depth than breadth in subsequent semesters. The course workload was quite heavy especially during periods when there were quizzes, such that it was almost impossible to make time to review past assignments and learn from past mistakes",
    "Presentation\/lectures and course materials were great.",
    "Very engaging and interesting way to learn stats. Lots of material covered, but what was covered was very thorough. But organization of the course is difficult to follow through the powerpoints, so some organization would be helpful.",
    "Organization of this class was great, online lectures, homeworks, quizzes and midterms were well designed for student learning, and very do-able for those who have not taken stats before.",
    "I loved the structure of this course and the availability of the professor and TA's. I couldn't think of a way to improve it.",
    "Strengths: organization, accessibility, professor Weaknesses: lecture was sometimes hard to follow",
    "strength: lots of office hour weakness: too much homework"

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you have any plans with stats or data in future Take it even if you don't have any plans. Jonathan is a wonderful instructor",
    "Make sure to keep up with assignments and watch all the lectures.",
    "Take notes and don't just rely on the notes Jonathan gives you",
    "Watching the video recordings of the class can help you take better and more detailed notes",
    "Make sure to keep up and do the work. You will learn a lot by doing all the things required in the course. Even if you have taken stats before, this course will help get a solid foundation in basic stats, that is, if you do the work.",
    "If you want to learn coding, don't take this class. Reuning-Scherer teaches it in Minitab which is really useful, but not a coding language. You can tell yourself you're going to take this class and do it in R or SASS (Reuning-Scherer provides all necessary materials you would need to do this) but you won't. So, if your main objective is to understand statistics, take this class. If you need statistics in R, this won't be that helpful.",
    "Take the class, start the homework early and go to office hours.",
    "Keep up with the work as otherwise it is difficult to catch up",
    "It is worth taking especially early in the academic program. Be prepared to engage with material in and outside class for long hours. Make sure not to lag behind in significant ways because work accumulates very very fast.",
    "My advice would be to start everything EARLY (Exams, problems sets, and the final project). There is a 9\/10 chance that you will find something wrong with what you are doing and you will definitely need help.",
    "Very helpful, even if you have done statistics before but aren't so comfortable with it",
    "It's worth it to learn and not that hard if you stay up to date",
    "If you are looking for an in-depth entry level quantitative course and you are willing to put the time in to actually learn statistics, this is a wonderful course to take. The final project is especially helpful for these objectives because you get to work on a topic you care about and apply what you've learned throughout the semester to solve a problem. Dr. Reuning-Scherer also makes statistics as lively as it can be, so he keeps the material more exciting than it otherwise would be.",
    "Great course if you'd want to understand data analysis in depth",
    "Make sure you make friends and seek help. I wish I made more friends in this class to work with on projects, however because I ended up going to the undergraduate office hours a lot more, I ended up working on p-sets with people in S&DS 103.",
    "Expect to put in 5 hours of work for most minitab assignments.",
    "Take it! If you have the desire to gain an understanding of statistics, this is the class for you. I've taken a couple of statistics courses in the past but this was the first time the material actually made sense to me.",
    "Go for it, but certainly balance it out with some lighter load courses",
    "Attend the class as much as possible in whatever format works best for you.",
    "Watch the lectures online - Johnathan goes very fast, so it is helpful to be able to pause and rewind through important topics.",
    "Go to class instead of watching the online lectures. Though online is a good resource to have if you miss a class, I found going to class much more helpful",
    "be prepared to work a lot"
