   "comments": [
    "Great class. Presumably most people take 114 for a writing credit, but I would definitely recommend this section. It's as much work as a writing class would be, but the readings aren't terrible (i.e. no books, just two essays a week on average).",
    "ENGL 114 is a good course if you are looking to improve your writing skills. I would recommend it to all students at Yale just for the simple fact that no matter what career field you go into, you are going to have to know how to write. This specific section of the course was very interesting and philosophical, which made learning how to improve my writing so much more enjoyable. This was probably one of my favorite courses of freshman year.",
    "Even if you were at the top of your English class in high school, you'll find that writing-intensive classes in all disciplines at Yale require a have a very high baseline writing standard. Papers are expected to be much longer, and professors have a much more critical eye for both content and delivery. You'll also have access to a ridiculously massive library with more resources than you can comprehend - and you'll be expected to know how to use it to do research of maximal quality. If you don't want to jump into the deep end with the first essays you write here, this class is the best way to make the transition. You'll finish with the confidence necessary to take most any writing-intensive class you want to in the future. This section in particular used the philosophy of science as a common theme for its readings and essays. I don't think it will be offered in the future since this semester was Prof. Templanza's last, but if you find and decide to take a similarly themed section, expect the readings to be dense. Be sure to set aside adequate time for the readings so that you can thoroughly digest them. If you skim them, you'll get close to nothing out of the class discussions. Even a thorough reader won't find the class overwhelmingly demanding. Writing the full-length research paper is a bit stressful, but overall, Engl 114 a fairly manageable WR credit. TL,DR: If you put maximal effort into this class, you'll reap the great reward of upgrading your writing ability to the college level.",
    "Definitely take English 114. Unfortunately, professor Templanza will no longer be teaching this class and he was a huge reason to why the class was such a great experience to me. However, just the material of the particular section itself, the philosophical take on science, is also very interesting if you're a science major. Really gives a whole new perspective on what you've been learning and are going to learn as a science major."
