    "You have to do it and I hope that they give you more time to do the senior project this time around.",
    "ChemEs hopefully this class will be a bit more connected when you take it. Three main portions of this class: the lecture, mini project, and design project were not really related to one another. The design project was more bio based which would be cool assuming we had a least some bio foundation.",
    "This course is the course that ties everything together in chemical engineering. You discuss basic plant and process design principles in the first third of the course. In the second third, you discuss economic issues with plant and process design as well as complete a mini-project involving plant simulation software. In the third third of the course, you work in teams for the final project which is extremely rewarding. This year it was on Biofuel production. The course is also open to environmental engineers. I would suggest taking this course regardless of whether one is ABET or not because it really brings the senior class together and wraps up a lot of material nicely.",
    "This year was probably different from how it will be in the future. The first third (process design and HYSIS) was great, the second third (money and simple interest) was terrible and the final project was short but mostly enjoyable."
