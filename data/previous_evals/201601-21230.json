    "Take it.",
    "Plants and People is perfect for any non-STEM major looking for science credit that is engaging and not a total blow-off. It's an easy A if you go to class, take decent notes, and put in a few hours before each of the three exams and the paper. There are no problem sets or reading responses, so there's absolutely no weekly work besides class attendance. The material is very engaging. Some students may not be thrilled to take a class that meets on Friday, but almost every Friday class period was a field trip. We went to the YUAG, the Yale Farm, the Yale greenhouse (three times), and the Peabody. I cannot recommend this class highly enough to any non-STEM major looking for a science credit. Take it.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this class - its great, its fun, but you also learn a lot and its easier to learn things when you enjoy the way they're taught. The field trips are amazing and you explore buildings\/places you would never see otherwise. The instruction is engaging and the class is awesome.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn about plants and their impact on humans, noting that this is explored in a lot of different ways. This class however will remind you of a high school science class. It's a very pleasant atmosphere, and the only negatives are the grading of tests. Otherwise, little stress and pretty interesting topics that you have the freedom to delve into or just do enough to understand the basic premise of this class.",
    "This is a must take course. The field trips--from chocolate tastings to gallery visits--are a blast; and they are weekly! The material will open your eyes to the pervasiveness of plants in all aspects of life. And you will be armed with plant-themed fun-facts for life!",
    "I definitely recommend this class! Take it!!! It's a lot of hours in class, so be prepared for that (3 lectures per week plus section). Field trips are great. You have to study for the exams, but they're very doable for a non-science major. You get to choose your own paper\/project topic, so that was not a burdensome or tiring project at all. It was fun to write. Good class for non-science majors because I learned a lot so I didn't feel like I wasted a course on something useless just to get the Sc credit, but I never felt like I was at a disadvantage for not having a background in science. Also I got really good vibes from the TFs and Professor Puth. Good people.",
    "Plants and People is a great way to get a science credit! It isn't super gutty because there is a lot of material, but there is no homework, just readings, a project\/paper, and exams. The material and field trips are super fun as well. Very much recommended if you can get a spot in the course!",
    "Lots of fun and not a lot of work, but not a very memorable course. It is the epitome of a survey class and really tries to cover EVERYTHING about the relationship between plants and people. If it did a little less and went a little more in depth, it would be perfect. I did really appreciate all the site visits, though - you go to the art gallery, the greenhouse, the farm, and the Peabody.",
    "Plants and People is an eye-opening, thoughtful, and fun class! If you are even remotely interested in plants and the role they play in our lives, you will get something out of this class. It is structured like a very broad survey course, so if you are looking to get very deep into a specific subject, this probably isn't the class for you. However if you are just looking for a general overview, Plants and People will be incredibly rewarding. There are great field trips almost every week- to greenhouses, the Yale Farm, the YUAG, the Peabody, etc. You will sample chocolates, fruits, and coffees. I highly recommend it!",
    "Take this class if you can get in! It's an intro class on biology and ecology so you don't need any prior knowledge and the material is taught in an extremely approachable way. The field trips around campus are also pretty fun as you get to visit places that are always open to Yale students but that you generally might not have been aware of before. The class meets four times a week including section, though. The workload is very light and you'd can do your final project on anything you would like. I wish there were more introductory classes like this where the material is well taught and the workload manageable.",
    "Plants and People is a great course for students that are searching for an easy science credit and\/or a basic introduction to the literal interaction between plants and people. The course itself is a survey course so we never really went deeply into any topic so please keep that in mind. Some of my favorite topics included the history of agriculture, human nutrition, climate change, sustainable agricultural practices, and more. The workload is not bad at all - there are no problem sets or crazy section readings, but it is important to keep in mind that lectures are three times a week and section is once a week. You will only need to take two midterms, write an 8 page paper, and take a final exam. The TF'S were really chill with the workload, but were not really experts on the topics. Overall, I did not find the class to be really exciting\/mind boggling, but it was a good class\/gut for students that are not strong in the sciences. I would recommend it as a fifth class!",
    "!A: a science credit that doesn't feel like a science credit, more like anthropology class, INTIMATE CLASS (get to know students). wish it were more \"science\" FIELD TRIPS ARE GREAT. a moderate amount of work. ***LINDA:**** professor is wonderful, approachable and friendly. Lectures were generally good. However, the slide could have been improved since many just contain pictures and it's not clear what we're supposed to get out of them. COURSE CONTENT: this was strange. The first third was the \"plant science\" part which was too elementary (middle school\/high school level). Did learn muchshould be beefed up. Second part on plant uses was useful to me, but I wish it was more science-related. More in depth of chemical processes. Third part was WAY TOO broad, and I learned nothing. Wish we covered a few ecology topics but in more depth. TA SECTIONS: HORRENDOUS. Literally the only really bad thing about this course. TAs were unprepared, uneducated about the topic, and lazy. franz just entered the room and then left for 15 minutes and had us write stuff on the board about papers we read. *waste of time*. EXAMS: they were okay, but mostly focused on memorization. I really* wish there were more problem solving instead of regurgitation. FIELD TRIPS: they were PERFECT. don't change them at all. CLASS STRUCTURE: having class three times a week and a section seemed at first like a lot, but it's really fine. I loved the grading breakdown and how nothing counted for too much of my grade.",
    "This class is awesome. It's super interesting and covers a broad range of topics so if you don't like one you'll probably be on a different one the next day. There are field trips almost every Friday which are clutch and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE",
    "Yes, I would recommend it especially considering how relevant plants are in everyday life.",
    "Absolutely take the class if you can get in. It isn't a gut by any means but it's still incredibly fun and there are plenty of field trips. Professor Puth and the TAs were great and even though the TAs were not exactly specialists in all of the subjects we tackled, they still worked very hard to answer any questions students had. An absolute joy of a class.",
    "(1) Professor Puth is just greata clear lecturer and very caring. (2) You learn interesting things about life in the course. (3) You get a science credit. (4) The coursewith two lectures, a field trip, and a section each weekrequires more time than is necessary.",
    "Possibly the most fun and unique class I've taken at Yale. I recommend this to anyone interested in getting out of the library for fresh air, but especially arts\/humanities and environmental science people. It brings the classroom out into the history of human-plants relations and makes nature relevant to us.",
    "Don't take this class. I took it because it had great reviews last year, and because I needed a science credit but am not strong in the sciences. The class is easy, for sure, but felt like a huge waste of time in that you don't learn much and it's not particularly interesting. The class has very little work, but you meet four times a week (two lectures, a field trip, and section), and so it ends up being very time-consuming. The field trips are often cool, and the class project is great if you pick something you enjoy. Other than that, however, don't take this class expecting to learn much. Don't buy the textbook. Also, insist on better STEM classes for non-STEM majors.",
    "Really enjoyed the inter-disciplinary approach this class used and, as a result, found myself really interested in a great majority of the lecture topics. Meeting four times a week didn't even really feel like too much at times because of how many different types of topics we covered. Would 100% recommend to those looking for a science credit that focuses you to think about a number of broader societal topics\/issues (i.e. farming and climate change). I thought I'd be frustrated by having to take a science credit in my final semester at Yale but felt the exact opposite at end all the field trips were really great for showing me great places and resources I hadn't seen."
