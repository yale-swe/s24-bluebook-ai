    "I loved it. It gave me the opportunity to expand on my interests and allowed me to develop an original deliverable.",

    "great course",
    "strengths: practical and real work.",
    "The course provides an invaluable opportunity to practice skills learned in other classes such as operations, and epidemiology.",
    "Seems like there's great variation in projects that isn't controlled for by the instructor.",
    "Good learning experience",
    "I think practicum during the semester is a great idea - give students some experience and idea going into the summer internship and also preparing for those interviews. The Friday meetings could be more interactive - diving students into smaller groups for discussion, etc. Also the Weinerman Room does not offer the best space... given the size of this year's practicum students. The project placement process makes people feel a little anxious and not sure if they should be reaching out on their own or not."

    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Very helpful and great professor",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Dr. Stahl offered great insights, feedback at all our meetings. He also asked questions of us to help us think more critically about our experiences. I really enjoyed working with him overall. At our 2nd mid-semester meeting, Dr. Stahl was very wordy so it ended up taking much longer than expected to get through everyone's presentations.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Strengths - great job matching me with a practicum. Weaknesses - the Friday connects were unnecessary, especially when people were only given 5 minutes to talk during the final presentation. I've heard my peers' projects several times already.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Great instructor, gave wonderful feedback and spoke from the healthcare perspective in an understandable way.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Dr. Stahl did a great job matching the students up with projects and was really great at giving real feedback.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0I think Dr. Stahl did a great job in matching students with a project. The meeting seemed excessive and they took too much of our time without much value gained.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Good - very interested in making sure we had a meaningful experience.",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Richard Stahl \u00a0Dr. Stahl is very considerate and always offers very constructive feedback when we run into challenges. Having someone on the health services leadership to serve as an instructor is very helpful."
