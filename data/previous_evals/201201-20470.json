    "I would recommend HIST 743 to everyone. Even those who have no background in American history would learn a lot from the course. Students would learn about the history of disease, politics and the environment, history of animals, climate history, the environment and economics, and environmentalism and environmental history. Including nature in historiography is important for students of all fields, and this is the best class they can take to learn how it is done."
