   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend this class. It's not easy, but it's worth it. If you are a non-science kid, this class will teach you a ton, but not be overwhelming.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student, but this is not an easy class. Do not take this is if you are looking for a science gut. This class covers a ton of information very quickly, and also gets pretty science intensive. The end of the semester has a lot of work, too, with a cumulative final quiz, a group presentation, and a research paper. You will learn so much about a very interesting and relevant topic, though, and get to wet your feet in some very cool science things if it is outside of your major. I loved it, but you have to put in the work.",
    "yes!!! You learn a lot, and the work you put in is worth it in the end.",
    "Great way to get your science credit",
    "Take this class. You'll learn an amazing amount. Warning, it is not an easy class, but the material will challenge you in a productive way. You'll come from the class having learned about so many aspects of cancer in a substantive way. I can now explain tyrosine kinases like a pro. The class is also well-structured so that no one assignment determines your grade, which is really appreciated. I'm incredibly glad that I decided to take this class, as I got so much more out of it than I would've had I taken \"A Issues Approach to Biology.\"",
    "I would recommend this course but advise you that it isn\u2019t a gut. If you\u2019re a humanities student (as most people in our class were) the material won\u2019t feel easy peasy. A lot of it relies on stuff you learned in AP Bio like genetics and may now only remember fuzzily. The quizzes are tough; the midterm is tough. Participation, group presentation and final paper are all much more doable and within your control. By the end, you\u2019ll feel you\u2019ve learned a good amount about cancer. If you don\u2019t like microbiology and\/or biochemistry, this class may bore you. Includes some discussion, which is nice. Overall, you can do much worse when seeking a science credit; if you\u2019re willing to risk taking a harder class where you won\u2019t get an easy A, this is a solid choice.",
    "Cancer is an awesome science for non-science credit if you're willing to put in the work -- it's not too much week to week, but studying for quizzes and working on the presentation and paper will definitely require a good amount of effort. You learn a great deal on the biology of cancer that is accessible while still feeling like a real science class. Professor Belperron is a fantastic lecturer, and she makes the class really engaging -- she encourages lots of discussion, which is possible with its small size. If you're trying to avoid a mindless giant science for non-science lecture, go for Cancer.",
    "If you need a science credit or are just interested in Cancer, take this course. Its not a gut, but it is a worthwhile subject and good class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Cancer is not a topical class. We discuss a lot of science and not a lot of politics \u2013 it's very much a biology class. You'll work hard for your science credit. But it's also very clearly tailored towards non-majors, and Professor Belperron does a great job of explaining complex scientific concepts in very accessible terms.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has some background in biology and has good scientific logic. Otherwise, think twice before taking it. Very useful and interesting info, but definitely NOT a gut."
