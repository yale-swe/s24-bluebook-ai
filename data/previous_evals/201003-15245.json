    "Yes, but know that you will get tired toward the end of the semester. Will you have the stamina to read 150 pages of absurd surrealist drama (this is the episode called \"Circe\") after you've exerted yourself on midterms, etc.?",
    "An excellent course. The book is somewhat difficult to comprehend, but I would say that the class offers a fantastic overview of Ulysses, as well as of Hamlet, the Odyssey, and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Prof. Lewis is fantastic, and I learned a lot. I would recommend it, just don't expect to necessarily \"get\" Ulysses by the end of it.",
    "Yes. Though reading Ulysses requires a lot of time, it's not really a difficult book, and it's particularly fun to read out loud (which we did fairly frequently in class). Professor Lewis is very nice and extremely approachable. Also, even though he lists it as optional on the syllabus, don't try to read Joyce without the Gifford annotations.",
    "If you want to take a course on Ulysses, there is seriously no better way to do it that with Professor Lewis. Even if you think that Ulysses will be daunting, or haven't read any of it beforehand, still take the class. It's a wonderful semester--Professor Lewis is awesome and great at facilitating discussion. He also knows A TON about Ulysses and can help direct you to outside readings etc. You read Ulysses in digestible chunks and draw upon the Odyssey, Portrait, and Hamlet to further your understanding of the text. A must for English and Literature majors."
