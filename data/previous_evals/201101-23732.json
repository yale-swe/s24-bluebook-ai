   "comments": [
    "Spanish 130 was, in my opinion, much more structured and relaxed than L2. There is no longer any online submission homework, and things were much more straightforward as we were reviewing many of the pervious concepts we had learned. Maripaz Garcia was a fantastic professor!",
    "Good class, maripaz garcia was a good teacher. Homework every night but not too tough.",
    "Typical language class. If you really want to learn the language, I would recommend taking the intensive version instead, because this class is basically just review. Maripaz is nice, though, a fair grader, and explains things well. Altogether, pretty painless way to get through this level.",
    "You go over all basic grammar points (present indicative, preterite, imperfect, subjunctive, imperfect subjunctive, future, conditional, etc.). There is daily homework, but it's usually really short, just a page or two out of the workbook. There is homework you turn in and suggested homework thats for practice. All in all I never spent more than an hour on the homework each day, and many days I spent much less. During class you go over big grammar lessons, vocabulary, and do speaking\/listening exercises.",
    "This course is definitely more interesting than other Spanish classes I've taken because it actually incorporates Spanish short stories and film, which were much less cheesy than the typical textbook work. The workload was very manageable, and in some ways the class was easier than L2 Spanish (for example, prompts for compositions and oral exams were given ahead of time, which allowed for better preparation).",
    "If you're looking to improve your spanish, of course this is the class to take.",
    "Basically just a more advanced version of level 2. We go over the same stuff just in a deeper, more detailed way.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's no too difficult and it really improves your Spanish.",
    "Absolutely, my spanish improved a lot in this class.",
    "It's your run-of-the-mill Spanish class--homework everyday, an occasional project, some in-class discussion which usually doesn't improve too much by way of speaking. You solidify your grammar and writing skills in Spanish if anything."
