   "comments": [
    "I honed my ability to critically read a scientific paper and examine methods in depth. This class also forced me to become more confident at speaking in group discussions.",
    "I learned how to evaluate scientific papers critically.",
    "This course helped a lot with my understanding of cell biology and the techniques used to study it. I also better understand the background on which current theories and studies in cell biology are based.",
    "Oral presentation and classroom engagement.",
    "Fluency with difficult scientific literature, ability to discuss laboratory techniques and concepts",
    "I gained insight into how to analyze dense scientific papers and evaluate whether they are truly landmark papers in their respective fields.",
    "This course helped me learn how to read biology papers carefully and critically. I feel that I now have a much stronger grasp on understanding methods as well as the motivations behind using certain methods.",
    "public speaking skills, analyzing figures and methods in papers",
    "This was a very enjoyable course. Professor Rosenbaum is very knowledgeable and I think it the material and skills I acquired complimented my research-intensive course of study. Professor Rosenbaum challenged us to think critically and not take anything for face value.",
    "I learned an immense amount about how to read scientific papers critically and thoroughly, how to dissect the methods used, and how to put the findings in context of the current state of the biological field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "In this class, you dissect a paper in great detail each week, with smart classmates and a very experienced instructor. I learned a lot about the methods of cell biology, and Professor Rosenbaum encouraged us to think critically about experimental design. The one weakness is the lack of feedback throughout the semester. It would have been helpful to receive a grade on our class presentation or a midterm evaluation of our performance.",
    "This is a great senior-level course. I liked it alot. I grew alot as a scientist and I am sure it will help me in my career in medicine.",
    "The course was very good. Its biggest strength is the high level of participation during class. In participating throughout the full two hours, the concepts were better solidified. Professor Rosenbaum also added many interesting points about the authors themselves and clarified some of the more difficult aspects of the papers. There were very few weak points of the course. Although occasionally the participation was not balanced and some people participated more than others. However, generally, the course was balanced and engaging.",
    "This class is very stressful in-class, and requires lots of pre-class research. It feels very self-congratulatory on its focus on researchers and their affiliations, and jumps around topics so it requires review every few weeks or so.",
    "The discussion-based style of this class is great and fosters greater student independence and interest in the papers we read. One thing I would have like more is more consistent feedback from Professor Rosenbaum on things that went well, things to improve, etc. We reached the very end of the course without an inkling of the grades that would be given to us.",
    "I think the strength of this course is the depth to which we analyze each paper. Too many times a seminar class will assign too much reading and students will only be able to read the paper at a surface level. Since we only have one paper per week, we are able to really read each word and critique the paper's results in a nuanced manner. Perhaps the only weakness of the course is the lack of transparency on how we will be graded. While I understand that the class is based on discussion of the papers, rather than assignments, midterms, or papers, the professor did not keep track of participation either, so it seems that the grading may be arbitrary. However, I really loved Professor Rosenbaum -- he is not only humorous at the right times, but he also deeply cares about the course material and has a fantastic knowledge base of each of the primary authors on the papers that we read.",
    "The strength of the course is that it certainly draws on all the knowledge you've learned over the years to help you understand how everything is actually applied in the laboratory. However, sometimes the class felt like a competition to see how could remember minute details about biology and say them faster. As someone who is more of an introvert and who likes to take time to think things through, it proved to be a very stressful classroom environment.",
    "the time is not the best 7-9 and also you have no idea how you are doing in the class because nothing is graded during the term",
    "Strengths: Low stress, develop critical scientific thinking, learn from a science vet whose spent almost 50 years in the field. Weakness: uncertainty of your grade if that matters. (Your grade is heavily subject to the subjective opinion of the professor)."

   "comments": [
    "You read 1-2 papers each week and you must come prepared to discuss the methods and experimental design in great depth. Professor Rosenbaum will challenge you to go beyond the surface level of detail. This is a good upper level biology course with two caveats: (1) you must be comfortable speaking in class, and (2) you must be comfortable with receiving little feedback on your performance. If you are nervous about speaking in class, or you can't handle grade uncertainty, I would encourage you to think carefully about whether this is the right class for you. But if these things don't bother you, this is a great chance to learn from a kind and experienced instructor and dive into some classic papers in cell biology!",
    "If you get in take this class! Very interesting and probably one of the easiest bio credits you can get.",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Rosenbaum creates a very good atmosphere for learning and makes the class very engaging. The papers are important to learn and understand to grasp the major concepts in cell biology and to comprehend how the field reached its current level. It is a great above 350 course and the workload is not very bad.",
    "I would recommend this course to students already decently proficient at reading scientific literature and already familiar with many basic laboratory techniques. This course can be challenging for those who are not as well-versed in science jargon\/techniques. I would also recommend this course to those who like discussion-based classes--this class is purely discussion.",
    "DO NOT BE DRIVEN AWAY BY PROFESSOR ROSENBAUM AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS COURSE. While he can be a little intimidating initially, he is honestly a great professor. He is not only humorous at the right times, but he also deeply cares about the course material and has a fantastic knowledge base of each of the primary authors on the papers that we read. This is an amazing upper-level elective within MCDB, with only one paper to read per week and no other assignments -- no midterms, essays, or homeworks -- except for one week where you have to lead the discussion of a paper. You will be graded based on the quality of your participation and this presentation. Definitely take this course!",
    "This is a very different class from anything else you will take at Yale - all you have to do is read papers and discuss them each week. That being said, if oral skills are not your strong suite, it's very stressful, but will also help you improve. It was definitely nice to be learning biology in a way that didn't require memorizing loads of information for exams, though.",
    "reasonable choice for upper level seminar",
    "Yes, if you care to think like a scientist and go on to do research.",
    "The workload was surprisingly more than I had expected based on previous reviews. I went in expecting this class to be an easier class for senior year, but I felt like it caused a lot of undue stress because there was absolutely no feedback on our work so you don't really know how well you did\/ didn't do, and how best to improve. Since your entire grade is based on \"class participation,\" it basically boils down to how much the professor likes you and your class, which I felt like was an ambiguous standard. On the other hand, and to be fair, I did think the class taught me a lot more about biochemistry technique than I have learned in any other class at Yale, and really taught me to be an observant reader of scientific literature. Normally I would just skip over the methods section of journal articles, but the seminar has forced me to not only thoroughly examine the methods, but also do some outside research to make sure I was fully confident in the material. Take the class if you want to become more familiar with scientific literature analysis and molecular bio\/ biochemistry techniques, but be forewarned that there is a lot of ambiguity in grading, which may cause some undue stress.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was so valuable to be able to read key papers in cell biology and have detailed discussions about their methods, findings, and importance in the field in a seminar setting. Professor Rosenbaum is supportive and incredibly knowledgeable, and it was amazing to be able to discuss the papers with him and with fellow biology seniors who are passionate and excited about the material. Our discussions were always intense and fascinating. This is a gem in the MCDB department."
