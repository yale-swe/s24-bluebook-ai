   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to all students interested in learning about enzymology.",
    "I strongly recommend this course.",
    "A class that looks over experimental procedures for elucidating enzyme mechanisms. A good introduction to the way biochemical questions are actually answered in a practical sense. It's a hard class to feel like you can really do well in because the tests are really difficult to study for and favor a certain type of thinker, but it's a good class for looking at the literature and getting to understand this field of research.",
    "Biochemical Rates and Mechanisms is a class that explores enzymatic function and some processes that allow for the reaction rate enhancement they provides. Primary literature is the main source of examples of the concepts applied in current research.",
    "I would strongly recommend the class to any biophysical chemistry student. Students in other areas of chemistry, particularly less math-intensive areas like organic chemistry, will find the NMR portion of the course extremely challenging if not inscrutable. This section aside though, the kinetic theories and other methodologies covered are worthwhile for students in all areas of chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "Overall I have a better understanding of the kinetics and dynamics of biological systems and how enzymes perform reactions. This knowledge will be helpful in my understanding of seminar material and research going on at Yales chemistry department, although it may be less applicable to my research in particular.",
    "I gained an overall impression of this field.",
    "Definitely broadened my understanding of biochemical research. will be helpful in my biophysical preparation. A student in my lab has told me she directly used this material in her thesis work, therefore I anticipate that this class will have an impact down the road at some point.",
    "As I hope to pursue an area of research that involves the study of proteins and their interactions with ligands, I found this class very useful for my future work as a graduate student. The basic coverage of enzymes and the methods utilized in testing different processes was most beneficial."
