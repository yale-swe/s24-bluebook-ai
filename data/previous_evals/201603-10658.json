   "comments": [
    "This was a course that exposed me to material I would've been entirely ignorant of without taking it. I learnt about game theory, auction theory, how auctions are implemented on online platforms, I learned about the sharing economy and the ups and downs, I learnt about collaboration and how things can go wrong, price theory and how markets run efficiently or are thwarted. I learnt about graph theory and algorithms and how to think about complexity and order of calculations. I learnt about big data and matrices and machine learning and fairness of machine learning, and its value apart from regular statistics. I learnt about traffic engineering and the social costs of congestion. There's just so much. I am inordinately grateful for having taken this class and being exposed to so, so much, that I really think will help me going out into the real world.",
    "Designing the Digital Economy really gives you a good overview about how different aspects of internet marketplaces work, from auctions, to the Cloud, to PageRank, to more obscure features. While the goal was to go in depth in every topic, I came away with more of a solid overview of the different pieces involved, and the ability to research the ones I am interested in, rather than a full understanding of every topic.",
    "I learned to combine computational methods with mechanism design to solve real-world problems in the digital economy.",
    "We got exposed to economic principles and algorithmic concepts, learning to read papers that featured current research.",
    "Learned about the economics, functionality, & design of platforms.",
    "I developed an insight into a lot of the economics that drives the technology revolution we are currently experiencing. From AI and Machine Learning to Uber and crowdsourcing this class had a breadth of material that I personally found fascinating, if at times arcanely difficult and obtuse to understand. Guest lecturers were amazing and Glen invites the best of the best. Was a pleasure getting to hear some of the great minds of our time speak.",
    "Learned a lot of cool things and listen to a lot of really smart people give lectures.",
    "Read a few interesting papers that try to integrate CS and Econ. Didn't think the course taught us as much as it could have.",
    "I think I got better at Econ, Math, formulating questions, reading papers, talking to leaders in the field. I was also exposed to a lot of new and interesting ideas that I plan on investigating further.",
    "This class covered some basic and intermediate level topics in auction theory, microeconomics, data analysis\/machine learning and \"startup stuff.\" Working on the final project was super interesting and a great learning experience; the lectures and readings were inconsistent but often engaging and fascinating. Independent motivation to work on projects and problem sets, and to do the readings, is very important."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As already mentioned, I believe that this course was phenomenal in that it exposed students to so many interesting ideas and topics and forced you to think. Perhaps for some it was a bit too much of a whirlwind, particularly given the guest lecturers - things weren't always linking up well lecture from lecture. On the whole I think bringing in experts on the topics was a great idea, although perhaps Glen could've done a little more to link the topics together in a more coherent way.",
    "The problem sets were simply much too difficult. The TAs didn't even have any could what was going on in them, and they didn't help in learning the material because I didn't even understand most of what I was writing down in my pursuit of partial credit. Making the problem sets understandable would help. Moreover, the 3 hour class was too long, and especially after the midterm when we didn't need to pay attention, people didn't pay attention. While the guests were sometimes interesting, I just couldn't stay focused on them for 3 hours.",
    "This course moved at a rapid but appropriate pace, which challenged and engaged me. The final project was my most interesting project that I have pursued at Yale. It was appropriate to reduce the problem set load while students were working on the final project. However, it might have been better to have some sort of formal assessment mechanism for the second half of the semester.",
    "The quality of the guest lectures were mixed, and there could have been more of a unifying framework for the course.",
    "Strengths: Great class, lot of insanely interesting material. Questionable how much I LEARNT as opposed to all the ideas I was exposed to. Really felt like I was taking a tech and econ heavy class at Stanford, MIT or another technology filled university. Fascinating topics, interesting speakers. Weaknesses: Insanely hard psets, so hard the PhD TF's could not solve some of them. Psets were at a level beyond any sort of reasonable understanding (deriving payoffs for second price auctions under certain constraints after just ONE class of being introduced to second price auctions, for example). Also a crazy amount of assigned reading before every class (casual 40 page papers).",
    "It covered too many different topics week to week -- there was no continuity or larger arc to bring things together. There was barely any theoretical foundation that we were taught. Glen basically didn't teach, just had his friends come in to give lectures. Some of them were really cool people though so it was still fun to hear them talk, but could have been so much better. The evaluation of this course was def. the worst I've had at Yale -- problem sets were extremely hard, midterm was insane, project i don't even know. Students got no direction at all from course staff.",
    "The strengths are the great guest lectures that touch on some really interesting topics. It being 3 hours in a row got boring at times but I was able to pay attention. The problem sets are difficult but doable and help you understand the material. Glen is a great professor who really cares about and wants to help his students. The final project is a good way to explore something more fully.",
    "This class was great, and the basic idea is sound. An obvious strength is the quality of student participation in the class - the fifteen students who stuck with it were extremely motivated and interested in the material. The material itself is very interesting and not covered in many other courses at Yale (although the CS department is working on that). Any student who feels like they are a very strong Econ student and has written a program should take this class, and CS people who want to broaden their perspectives should consider it if they have taken some microeconomics and are prepared to work. Some of the problems were due to its immaturity (this year was the first it was taught). The lectures were consistently too long; the classes should have been 2 hours, leaving more information for TA review sessions and independent reading. The material was pitched at a somewhat uneven level, and was probably too hard (towards the beginning) for most students. Either the course should establish a more comprehensive list of prerequisites - more than basic knowledge of auction theory, reasonable competency writing code, serious microeconomics background - or start slower to give less prepared students time to catch up. Tons of people dropped the class because the first problem set was brutal unless you knew things that for the most part are not taught in typical Yale courses. There is a third option: maintain the level of difficulty but move the class to a more seminar-y format. But if the class aims to have a large enrollment, it'll have to change. Some or all of these things will change, I expect."

    "Yes, I enjoyed the class. It was challenging but interesting.",
    "I definitely recommend Glen's class! While the course was a whirlwind, we were exposed to so many topics that other courses at Yale don't really give you any insight to at all: I learnt about game theory, auction theory, how auctions are implemented on online platforms, I learned about the sharing economy and the ups and downs, I learnt about collaboration and how things can go wrong, price theory and how markets run efficiently or are thwarted.

I learnt about traffic engineering and the social costs of congestion. There's just so much. I am inordinately grateful for having taken this class and being exposed to so, so much, that I really think will help me going out into the real world. I highly recommend the course. As a side note, the front workload was huge, spending easily over 20 hours on a pset (but there were only 3). The group project at the end requires as much effort as you're willing to put in. This is certainly a challenging course and not for the faint-hearted (unless perhaps you're credit D-failing it in which case maybe it's better to just audit anyway)",
    "Depends what my grade is...",
    "I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "The course mainly consists of guest lectures so the quality was quite mixed. Some guest lectures were interesting and pitched at the right level though, and I expect the course will improve in future iterations.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to a student willing to put in the time. You will leave having learnt and been exposed to so many new ideas, and will have a basic understanding of some of the economics that powers the world around us (in the end, every tech advancement is led by economics. No money = no tech).",
    "Yes - if you're either well prepared or willing to figure out stuff you don't know, it's a very rewarding course. I had never taken an economics class before this and ended up learning a ton.",
    "Don't take this course. It covered too many different topics week to week -- there was no continuity or larger arc to bring things together. There was barely any theoretical\/methodological foundation that we were taught. Glen basically didn't teach, just had his friends come in to give lectures. Some of them were really cool people though so it was still fun to hear them talk, but could have been so much better. The evaluation of this course was def. the worst I've had at Yale -- problem sets were extremely hard, midterm was insane, project i don't even know. Students got no direction at all from course staff. (for background, I'm taken a ton of CS and Econ classes at Yale)",
    "Absolutely. One of the more interesting classes I took at Yale. Each week there was another idea that changed how I saw things and left me thinking and talking about it after class. It's not an easy class but it's not impossible either. If you are interested in the technology industry and the intersection of economics and computer science it is a must take. Glen is fascinating and sees the world very differently than most Yale professors and that shines through in a class that takes a contrarian view on topics.",
    "This class is great, and getting to know Glen and his work is a cool new opportunity for students who are eager to expand their horizons. Every student who knows enough background to handle this course, in whatever form it takes in the future, should take it. The value of working on the kind of final project this class expects is unusual (at Yale at least) and excellent. The topics are really cool, and the lecturers are varied and have impressive backgrounds, if you're into that kind of thing."
