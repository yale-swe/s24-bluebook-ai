    "I learned how to organize my writing around a seminal event. I also was exposed to a great list of authors with whom I had not been previously aware.",
    "I learned how to write.",
    "This was the best writing class I've ever taken!! The focus on personal narratives and story telling helped me to understand how to write a story that is captivating. I learned how to fiddle with the truth in a way that didn't make it exactly false, but made stories interesting. My favorite parts were the lessons on structureI learned a lot about how to write for a book, rather than for an essay.",
    "Through taking this course, I grew as a writer and a reader.",
    "I felt like my understanding of plot (how to write it, how to use it to deepen my characters) grew dramatically.",
    "I learned how to discuss readings, particularly fiction, from the perspective of a writer. This class also helped me develop a more thoughtful understanding of what coming of age entails and I was able to better understand and write about my own experiences."

   "comments": [
    "This was a strong course. Something that could improve it is more structured discussions.",
    "I think it would be good if we were able to edit our drafts for an improved grade once we received feedback.",
    "It was an incredible course that I deeply enjoyed,",
    "The diversity of reading material is great and Elise is great at leading the in class discussions which focus around them. I didn't enjoy the structure of our workshopping (5 papers a week for three weeks after the paper was due) because I felt it detracted from our other readings. I would have condensed the workshopping.",
    "This was a fantastic course. Not only is the subject matter hyper relevant for college aged students, but Elise creates an incredible environment for the subject matter to be discussed. The readings are carefully selected and each one of them added to the overall experience. I would use my homework for this class to procrastinate getting my other work done since the readings were so enjoyable. With regards to the essays, I wish that it could have been a more iterative process. I know that it's a lot of work for the students and the professor, but I enjoy classes that allow you to get an initial grade on a paper, revise and take the comments into account and then give it a second shot. Elise give such wonderful feedback that I wished I could have acted upon it.",
    "Strengths: good readings, relaxed class discussion, very sweet instructor, chill workload, really positive workshopping of each other's writing",
    "I would have liked to spend a little more time on writing mechanics. Also, it would have been nice to write longer pieces earlier on.",
    "The class was a really great experience. College is a good time to reflect on the your own coming of age experiences thus far and this seminar creates an more structured environment to do so. I do wish that we would have been able edit and resubmit our papers after workshopping. It would be a lot more useful if we could take our peer feedback into account."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if you are passionate about writing about turning points. If you are just interested in developing personal narrative skills, maybe take English 120.",
    "It was such a fun course! It is a nice experience to be able to express myself creatively and also to do so many interesting readings.",
    "Yes! It was a very fun class and the professor made you want to be there.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in telling their\/a story. It was cathartic, it was eye opening and it really helped me hone my craft as an artistic writer.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Elise is a wonderful professor and truly creates a fantastic environment for learning. The readings are so enjoyable and hyper relevant to our experiences as young adults.",
    "I'd recommend this course as a fun, relaxed, and enjoyable fifth class. It's not the most rigorous course, but it does get you reading things maybe you normally wouldn't pick up and gives you opportunities to write various genres.",
    "Yes. I think it's lovely, not-so-intense opportunity to read and write. All the readings were good, as were the discussions, and I enjoyed the writing projects.",
    "Absolutely take this class if it's offered again! Elise is a great professor and you get to read some great writers. The class also helped me understand and write about my own experiences more thoughtfully."
