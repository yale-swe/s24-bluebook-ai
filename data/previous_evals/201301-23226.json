    "difficult but rewarding if you put the work in. recommended if planning on pursuing English major",
    "Generically a good course, especially if you haven't studied Milton and\/or Eliot. Patterson's course was a little different from the others; our three papers were required to be ten pages while the other sections' had to five \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but she was willing to give everyone really good grades if they earned them. I found writing the longer papers rewarding (though you do need to budget more time for them), since we were tackling bigger topics. Besides upping the ante on your writing, though, Patterson is also an amazing professor to have in discussions. She read sections of everything aloud to us and it changed howI read. Overall: There are probably more interesting English courses out there. But there aren't many professors more interesting than Patterson. But if you haven't studied these poets (or you're going to major in English) then you should take 126, and you should *definitely* take it with Patterson.",
    "I see why it's a required course, because all of what we read is essential for understanding the English canon of poetry, and I never would have read half of this poetry if I hadn't been forced to. A good foundation of poetry, but if you're on the fence don't torture yourself.",
    "A good overview of major English poets since Milton, and their major epic works. I would recommend it: it totally changed how I view a lot of these poets: they are much more lively, versatile, and easy to relate to than I expected. Take it with Patterson if you can!",
    "Take it either if you re an english major or are interested in learning about importsnt figures in english lit.",
    "Annabel Patterson is a wonderful professor, and I think that 126 is the much better half of the Major English Poets curriculum. Take this if you have even the smallest inclination towards poetry.",
    "The class exposes you in depth to Milton's \"Paradise Lost,\" Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock,\" Wordsworth's \"The Prelude,\" and for my section Eliot's \"The Waste Land.\" These works were chosen as representative of a major English poet of 17, 18,19, and 20th centuries. I thought it was great to be able to analyze 4 works in depth, but I also wouldn't have minded analyzing more works of poetry. I would definitely recommend this course for someone looking for exposure to analyzing poetry.",
    "If Professor Patterson teaches it again, take it with her!!!! She makes a required class for the English major enjoyable and enlightening. It's a fair amount of work-3 10 pg. papers and an exam-but Professor Patterson is incredibly knowledgeable and hilarious and just a great teacher. I highly recommend it.",
    "Annabel Patterson is a paragon. It is really an honor to take a class with her. She is 76 years old, and all the sharper, livelier, and more knowledgeable for her age. Discussion with her is very productive, and breaks from the paradigm of many Yale classes in that she does not allow students to speak merely to sound impressive. In this mode, conversation on poetry--what Professor Patterson calls the \"epics\"--is incredibly refreshing. Moreover, she has a sterling sense of humor.Take this course. Take it with Professor Patterson.",
    "This course really differs from instructor to instructor. Patterson chose all the great works by Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and Eliot. She was wonderful, this is exactly what I wanted to get out of Major English Poets. Patterson had incredibly lively, enlightening sessions. We did close reading and talked about the big picture. She would draw in a lot of really interesting contextual facts about the authors. We only had 3 papers, 10 page minimum but with really flexible and interesting topics. The examwas informing and manageable. I absolutely recommend this class.",
    "If you enjoy reading poetry and putting time in to consider it, this class will be very entertaining. It was especially interesting to consider the evolution of poems and poets over time, which this section did an excellent job of covering."
