   "comments": [
    "Definitely! You learn a lot. It's not easy, but you walk out speaking pretty serviceable French even before L4 or L5.",
    "French 130 is a fun, engaging, and challenging course. The books and movies we studied were interesting and enjoyable, but still difficult. I loved the course because I had Mme Burton who was an amazing professor. She was energetic and passionate and that made the course very engaging I would definitely recommend French 130 with her. It is a hefty amount of work in the beginning, but it becomes more manageable and the work prepares you very well for the evaluations.",
    "The hardest course I have ever taken at Yale, taking this in the fall of my sophomore year. Madame Burton is very excellent. Just make sure you are well prepared for this class before you take it or it will be a living nightmare. (yup, I had a lot of that)",
    "I definitely recommend this class to others who are interested in learning French. You will spend a lot of time on the work, but you'll learn a lot.",
    "This class is doubtless the best opportunity to improve your french.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking especially to complete distributional requirements.",
    "Take it if you have to. Otherwise, try to skip L3 French. Learned nothing new after taking taking FREN 110\/120. FREN 130 is just review, and it's an easy A if you put the time into it. On Burton: Enthusiastic teacher. Kind and supportive but also stringent. Knows the material well. Burton gave each of her students a motivational card after finishing the final exam. I really appreciated that, and would love to take more classes with her.",
    "I felt like I learned much more in this course than FREN 110 or 120. The books were fairly entertaining, although the workload was greater."
