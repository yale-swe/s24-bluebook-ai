    "The strength of the course is that it combines theory and data and gives a broad view of banking crises and the role of the banks. The weakness of the course is that it focuses only on banks. There are other financial crises, such as sovereign debt crises, or currency crushes that create greater problems in an economy hit by such shocks than a banking crisis. We discussed very little about such events.",
