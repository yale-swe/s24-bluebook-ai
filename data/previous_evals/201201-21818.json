    "As far as chemE classes are concerned, this one is not so bad. Problem sets and tests are all very fair as long as you focus on what Professor Pfefferle tells you to focus on. Warning though, having one manageable class does not mean that your semester isn\u0092t going to suck. You thought the misery was done with pchem lab? Think again. Prospective chemE majors: get out while you still can. Juniors and seniors who feel like they\u0092ve invested too much to turn back now: focus on that light at the end of the tunnel - graduation.",
    "Recommend, but know that you will have to self-teach some parts.",
    "If you are taking this class, you probably have to take it for the chemical engineering requirement. You get what you put in the class, but you do learn some useful things important for chemical engineering research.",
    "You've gotta take it if you're chemE. If you're taking it as an elective, it's not too tough."
