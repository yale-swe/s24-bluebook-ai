   "comments": [
    "I would never recommend this class to another student. It is unorganized, hard to follow, and generally the worst taught class I've taken at Yale or in high school.",
    "Not on pain of death.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to. The workload isn't that bad but every day class is a waste of time. If we weren't graded on attendance, I would've skipped every single one. Professor Urry is a terrible lecturer and the flipped classroom aspect is poorly designed so you really don't understand the material at all until you're forced to seek out the TAs when the psets are due.",
    "A necessary evil",
    "PHYS 180 was horrendous, but PHYS 181 is actually a really good class if you take it with Meg Urry. She's intimidating at first, but you learn so much if you hold your breath and dive in with the flipped classroom. I still don't enjoy flipped classrooms a lot, but the TFs and Meg make sure that you know the information. The psets are more reasonable than last semester, and everything is great.",
    "Best bet for 2nd semester intro physics. Don't take for fun.",
    "Take only if you have a nagging wistfulness for the 3rd grade halcyon days",
    "This class went far better than expected. If you participate you will learn things.",
    "As someone who came into this class knowing absolutely nothing about the electricity and magnetism portions of physics, I have certainly left with a solid base of knowledge, and it was actually a reasonably enjoyable process too. There is a huge reservoir of resources for you to choose from to learn the material in this class, and the exams were always very fair. Professor Urry also is an incredible teacher, very friendly and invested in her students.",
    "Do not take this unless you absolutely have to",
    "All said, this is by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. Meg Urry may be an accomplished physicist, but she is completely inept as a teacher. We were not given lectures, but rather expected to teach ourselves complicated physics from a convoluted online textbook. During lecture time, we answered questions on a maddening software called learning catalytics. But wait, how can you be asked questions on material you haven't actually learned yet? That's the same question I was asking myself all semester. Difficult tests that were graded on a grading scale that was widely criticized by students as being unfair did not make that class any better, especially for people like me who have never taken physics before. I'm disappointed in Yale, and especially Yale's physics department, for offering such a poorly planned, unhelpful, and frustrating course as an intro option. Intro courses should make students excited for a subject, but all this course did was instill an unshakable hate of physics within me. Please, please, get a better teacher than Meg Urry, and actually try to care about your students learning. At present, the state of this course is, in a word, appalling.",
    "Yes it was a good experience overall and I feel that I learned the concepts pretty well.",
    "You will have to self-teach most of the course. You need to come to class with a good grasp of the reading because the professor will take the time to go over practice problems and answer questions instead of going through the concepts again. The weekly assignments really do keep you from falling behind. It's more work spread out throughout the semester (unlike some classes where there's no weekly assessment and you can easily procrastinate and end up cramming everything at the end.) Go to study hall-great place to work on homework and check answers (collaboration is encouraged! That's the point!) Not a bad class, although I have to say, I never really liked flipped classrooms in general because the kind of reduce the need to go to actual class.",
    "THIS IS THE ONLY EVAL YOU NEED TO READ. There are going to be a lot of people that give this class shit because they're going to argue that Urry and Maruyama are bad teachers. THEY'RE REALLY NOT BAD TEACHERS. WE'RE JUST BAD STUDENTS. I'M ONE OF THEM. I didn't read before class for the first half and I thought the class was terrible; thought the lecturers weren't doing enough, and I found myself on Facebook more than half the time. When I decided to turn my self around and read before lecture, I realized that Professor Urry is actually solid, and the reason I thought it was bad was because of my own distractions. I expect they'll change from Learning Catalytics to something else next year; when they do, this class will be totally fine. Don't worry about it.",
    "Unless you need this for your major or for a requirement, I wouldn't recommend it. The classroom is flipped meaning the professor isn't there to teach you, you have to learn things all on your own and in class all you do is go over review questions. Don't really recommend.",
    "If you want to learn physics out of a book take this class lol",
    "PHYS 181 is definitely not as good as PHYS 180. The professors for the course appear less competent in their teaching abilities. I would not recommend this course if it could be avoided.",
    "ONLY if you ABSOLUTELY must take it! 181 has fascinating material but the course is very disorganized and difficult to navigate. If you must take it then get a tutor to conceptually explain everything because you won't get it in class.",
    "This is a somewhat difficult class, but it is better than phys 180. The class moves somewhat quickly, but it is manageable. The material moves in a logical order and allows you to build on your understanding. It helps you understand a lot of things that you see very commonly. I would recommend this class to another student because I feel like I learned a lot in the class, but it took a lot of work to do so.",
    "Abominable. Do not take this class unless you truly have no better options.",
    "I am required to take 181 for my major, and I was dreading it from all the horror stories I have heard. But i was surprised that I actually enjoyed this class! It was alot of work, but well taught and I feel like I have a good grasp of the concepts now. Unfortunately the class is uncurved, but the problem sets and tests were still fair.",
    "If you don't mind taking 170 and 171 take that. If you can handle 200 or 201, go for it. Otherwise, well, you have to take it, right?",
    "I still believe that this is the best physics course to take if you are simply trying to complete the physics course requirement. There is constant work for the course, but it is not too difficult. The class is not graded on a curve so be sure to stay on top of course work",
    "Take it if you must, I guess. I hope you already know physics.",
    "At the current state and with the current organization, I would absolutely not recommend this class. The flipped classroom, online learning program, and grading system are all horrendous. But you probably have to take it anyways. Phys 171 is probably a better bet.",
    "The course is great except for Learning Catalytics, which didn't help AT ALL and only served to waste time. It really got me into physics, and the material was presented at the perfect level - fairly difficult, but at the same time manageable. I highly recommend this course.",
    "I hate the flipped classroom approach. Take it if u really need to.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's a general physics class taught in the flipped-classroom approach, which means you have to do a lot on your own. The TFs are a great resource.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in physics. It was a great introduction to physics in the real world and overall it was very well taught",
    "Phys 181 is a pretty fair class. As a BME major who took PHYS 200 last semester and PHYS 181 (I wanted something easier to fit my harder schedule this semester), this class is very do-able and not too hard. Psets dont take super long, but still cover a good depth of info. This class was different b\/c it was a flipped classroom and required online reading and answering of questions before each class. This took some getting used to, but was fine I think. Professor Urry can sometimes be disorganized and lose track of time during class, but besides that, she is an ok teacher.",
    "This isn't the best physics class (i was in 200 last semester and it was better) It wasn't bad though. Study halls help, learning catalytics is essential and working in groups is also better.",
    "Honestly, do not take it only if you really have to",
    "yes",
    "This was a horribly taught class. I would not be surprised if it was the worst class at Yale. I loved phyisjcs coming into college and this class has done everything possible to make me hate it. Professor Urry does not teach you anything and you have to learn everything yourself out of the textbook. Meg assumes that everyone has already taken AP physics in high school so the half of the class that has not already learned the material is screwed. Most of class time is wasted by the professor walking around the 100 student lecture hall trying to explain the concept to individual students instead of teaching to the whole class. A problem that should take only a couple minutes will routinely take twenty or more. Sometimes we will spend an entire 75 minute lecture going over 4-5 problems when we should have had time to go over almost 10 times as many. To shove salt in the wound, class attendance is mandatory and if you leave when professor Urry gives you permission, she might just open up another online session to make sure you are unduly penalized. In summary, this is a horribly taught class and Proffessor Urry should not be allowed to teach basic Physics at Yale because she does not know how to teach it. Many students in the class felt like we were in a bad community college lecture.",
    "This is a required course for engineers, and between choosing 181, 201, and 261, I would recommend 181 for students who want a good grounding in physics, but do not want the huge workload that is 201 or the complexity that is 261. On the basis of whether or not to take the class outside of the requirements, I would recommend against taking 181. It was only because I needed to take this course for my requirements that I did--otherwise, I feel like a student would do better with a textbook.",
    "Learned a lot and material is applicable.",
    "Take it! If you're reading this you probably have to do physics anyway, and I feel like I actually know E&M cold now. Meg Urry is fabulous, and talks with the class for the lecture instead of at us. Also, we use other students as a resource during group work in lecture and during study halls, and it's so much more effective than struggling on our own.",
    "Useful class, but definitely if its still Wiley Plus make sure you understand the material as you go--check your understanding with a TA during office hours even if you can get by with answering the Wiley Plus\/learning catalytics questions. You'll then be set to go!",
    "The best of your intro physics options, unless you have sufficient background and available time to commit to 260\/261. Students tend to have negative opinions of the class, but that's mainly due to the reverse-classroom style; Meg is a fantastic professor. The class is a very standard overview of electricity and magnetism. This means that although it's not always easy, there are always lots of external resources you can turn to for the material.",
    "I'm guessing that if you are taking this class you have to - for some kind of requirements. If that is not true, get out as fast as you can. Seriously. This class is miserable and you learn nothing. If for some reason you want to take physics for fun, take 180! But stop after that, because 181 is bad.",
    "Mandatory class attendance is the only reason to be in lecture. Absolutely terribly taught.",
    "Physics 181 is a good course for learning the basics of physics. Obviously if you don't need to take it as a prerequisite or requirement for your major, don't take it. If you need it for your major, I'd highly recommend this over Physics 201. Physics 181 is a good class for those with a little prior experience with physics but not really an expert.",
    "This class is a comprehensive intro E and M course. This should only be taken by students who absolutely have to take it.",
    "If you have to take it, try to take it when Meg Urry is teaching. She's great.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to. It is the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. I don't believe I learned anything lasting. It uses the flipped classroom idea, which is inherently flawed for large lectures. If you can take an alternative, do that.",
    "Only take PHYS 181 if you have to, and even then, shop 201\/261 to make sure that you absolutely cannot get out of taking this class.",
    "If you're thinking of taking this class, you probably have to. It won't be overly difficult, but it will be painful. You'll have to read chapter after chapter of the textbook, and class will be basically useless. The problem sets are quick and easy, so those don't take too much time."
