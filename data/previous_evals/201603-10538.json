   "comments": [
    "I learned a tremendous amount of skills and knowledge about philosophy, which I have never had exposure to before. Also, I learned a ton of information regarding the history of philosophy and the way in which later philosophers draw upon and reinterpret older philosophers. Much time was spent developing the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, with surprising amount of depth considering the blazing fast speed the class spent on individual works. Later philosophers were taught quickly but well enough to obtain a decent understanding of the philosophic tenets. Learning to synthesize different philosophers' views and criticize arguments were other important things I learned in this class.",
    "I learned how to read and reconstruct philosophical texts. I also started to learn how to write a philosophy paper, although that skill is still a work in progress. The mental gymnastics required to do philosophy were a completely new skill to me, and took some time and effort to develop, but ultimately were rewarding.",
    "I did not enter the course with any experience in reading philosophical work at all, and I think I got a dynamic and interesting introduction to the academic discipline of studying and deriving insight from philosophical work. A tough course, with tough papers, but a worthwhile one. Taught how to find arguments in works, how to think about different philosophical traditions, and established the importance of Plato and Aristotle on thought in general while giving insight into their writings in general.",
    "I learned how to dissect philosophical arguments and evaluate their validity and soundness. I learned how to write philosophy papers, something I had no experience with before. I learned how to map out arguments and find objections in them. I now have an understanding of most of the ancient, Western philosophers, something unique to this course.",
    "Not only was this class an excellent introduction to the thought of the authors we read, but an introduction to the skill of approaching philosophical texts in general.",
    "the ability to carefully reconstruct an argument from a small section of text; also, the ability to think critically about the use of philosophical terms over the course of a philosopher's corpus",
    "I got a snapshot from the works of some of the greatest philosophers of all time: Plato, Aristotle, etc.",
    "I learned to dissect and reconstruct philosophical arguments. I quickly learned not to try to read quickly.",
    "Apart from providing me with a basic understanding of the ideas in western philosophy, the DS Philosophy course helped me learn to break down arguments by separating the different strands of an argument from each other, and move beyond a superficial interaction with a work to meaningfully trying to understand, reproduce and evaluate a philosopher's ideas."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the class were the seminar sessions where the students had the chance to explain and discuss the philosophers. The biggest strength was Professor Harte, who explained arguments in detail when needed but still allowed the class to have some control over the discussion. The weakness of the course was having too much material to handle and finding the balance of trying to read the important excerpts and finish all the required reading, particularly for parts of Aristotle and the Arabic philosophers. Overall, I thought all the sections of the class were taught well; however, the Aristotle section was less comprehensive and clear compared to the other sections of the class.",
    "The strengths are the incredible breadth of Western Philosophy that I was able to read in a semester, and see the transitions and the relationships between the authors. It was an incredible experience going through so many influential texts and seeing how they relate to one another.",
    "Strengths structured well; great professors and lecturers; doesn't coddle you with simplified explanations, but gets to the heart of how philosophical arguments are carried out. Weaknesses I think should have provided more room philosophers not named Aristotle or Plato, passed over the Epicureans and Stoics quite quickly, jammed Maimonides in there.",
    "This course was a good introductory philosophy class, as long as one was willing to put in the effort, as the texts we began with were quite challenging. The writing assignments are very helpful as they allow students to deeply think about arguments and find flaws within them. It teaches one to think critically and deeply. The lectures were helpful in understanding the arguments that at a first read seemed confusing. I enjoyed the seminars in which we were allowed to engage with the text and ask questions. From there, mapping out arguments in section was very productive. However, because of the sheer amount of material, we never get to all the major arguments of an author. This became a large problem when we studied Arabic philosophers. We were given only an hour and fifteen minutes to study three different Arab philosophers, and in section we barely covered one argument of one philosopher. I would recommend spreading out these philosophers because there were arguments and philosophers I wanted to cover that we did not have time to do. In terms of writing, it is the most straightforward of the DS classes. However, when we were recommended to see writing tutors, the DS tutors would be booked in less than an hour, and most students would go to tutors that didn't have expertise in DS. There is a limited amount of resources for those who really wish to improve their writing in DS. Also, it is difficult to include the professor's feedback without being allotted more than 5 pages for an essay. Because there is unclear feedback on how to shorten an essay, a lack of DS tutors, and accounting for the depth of the arguments analyzed, keeping an essay under 5 pages while covering all the material needed is extremely difficult. I would recommend having more DS tutors available and more clear feedback on compacting deep arguments to only 5 pages.",
    "Strengths: fantastic material, fantastic professors, clear and effective organization. Weaknesses: the Arabic philosophers were a little crowded and therefore a little rushed. I would have also enjoyed spending some more time with Aquinas. Also - get rid of Plato's Protagoras and replace it with Symposium.",
    "I feel as though less reading would allow for greater digestion of the arguments intended to be discussed in seminar. While I certainly gained something all of the reading (I think), sometimes I skimmed most of a given reading and then read certain arguments in depth in order to actually get something out of them. Reading all of the arguments in depth that we are assigned would be a full-time job. However, it is understood that a deep understanding of all the assigned reading was not the intention.",
    "Strength: I would have had to read those books at some point, so I guess that's done now; I can put Plato and Aristotle on my shelf and feel 'sophisticated'. Another strength is Prof. Harte: amazing professor and wonderful person. Weaknesses: Incredibly expensive to buy all those books; some books cost $40-50 and we only talked about them in one or two sections. I would have never chosen to take the course if I knew I'd spend this much on books (this is from the perspective of a low-income student) Another major weakness is that I'll probably retain about 2-3% of the course material; the course is very fast-paced, and, in my opinion, it's not very wise to try and teach\/learn all of Plato's lifetime of works in two weeks (and all other philosophers).",
    "The readings were interesting, and I would have liked more time to engage with all of the topics. It felt like we glossed over most of what we read because of the time constraint.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it exposes freshmen to both lectures and smaller discussion sections, and the workload, while heavy, is well-distributed. The sections, in particular, are very useful for practicing the kind of evaluation of arguments required in our papers. A weakness might be that some of the works were given too little time to be discussed to the extent necessary for a solid understanding of their ideas (only two sections were devoted to the four philosophers Al-Kindi, Al-Ghazali, Ibn Sina and Maimonides).",
    "Maybe this class could benefit from a more structured approach to the texts? More general overviews of the writer's philosophical perspective etc could have given me a better foundation to participate in the abstract discussions of specific philosophical arguments that took up most of our class time.",
    "Philosophy is a lot of dense reading, and often it feels like the philosophers are just repeating themselves. I wish section had been more about dissecting exactly what they were saying (particularly with Aristotle) before going on to evaluate their arguments. But I understand that there is a very fine balance."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend DS Philosophy to another student. In my opinion, this is the most difficult of the three courses to approach from the beginning of the year, but Professor Harte is by far the most knowledgable and understanding of the professors (in my biased opinion) regarding this issue. Everyone in Harte's section believe her to be the best of all the philosophy professors, although she has a reputation amongst the students and staff of being a very tough essay grader, which becomes apparent as the semester continues. However, this should not deter you from taking DS or especially having Harte as your philosophy professor. She is beyond amazing, and I hope other DS students have a chance to learn from her.",
    "Absolutely, DS has been a truly phenomenal experience for me. You do need to make sure that you know what you are getting yourself into, though. It requires a high level on engagement in intensive reading and writing, but the community aspect is so wonderful as a reward, not to mention the amazing curriculum!",
    "Obviously, to take this course would necessitate being in DS in general, so I will answer this question in a more general DS way: yes, I would recommend DS, but only if you're a particular kind of person with a particular set of interests. Even if you know you don't want to major in a humanities subject, DS is a great way to get general requirements filled. The more important intellectual interest is in understanding where pivotal ideas of the West have come from, how they came to be, and who and what they were influenced by in coming to be (also, a tolerance for a West-centric curriculum with the understanding that this is not the only important intellectual tradition). It's a lot of work, a lot of reading, but worth it. I don't know for sure if I'll be continuing with DS next semester, but I'm very glad I did it this semester, if only because I would have little other reason to read the works I did, and I'm glad I did.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the humanities and philosophy. I would only recommend this to a student who is willing to put a lot of extra effort into this course because it requires immense patience to improve and learn in this class. I would recommend this course to someone who wishes to study the major ancient, Western philosophers in one semester.",
    "Yes, although office hours are a must!",
    "This is not a course someone should take because of a recommendation from someone else (I listened to recommendations and ended up disliking the course). Ths could be either your favourite or your worst course; better think before taking it. And yes, I would recommend it, but it's definitely not for everyone.",
    "yes, this course taught me to think differently. I loved discussing the flaws in various works. The best part was comparing the strategies and the format of philosophers' arguments and discussing what was most effective.",
    "Yes; the DS Philosophy course is an excellent introduction to western philosophy, and while it is challenging, it is definitely suitable even for someone who has had no prior experience with the subject."
