    "Basically all of Latin grammar, as crazy as this sounds.",
    "Basic Latin grammar, vocabulary and also come complex forms, all very useful for reading actual classical Latin as well as Renaissance and Medieval Latin.",
    "Latin 110 provides students with a great foundation in Latin grammar and vocabulary. In addition to learning the basic mechanics of the language, you also are exposed to very interesting Roman texts.",
    "I gained a good understanding of the basics of Latin grammar, and learned helpful techniques for approaching Latin literature.",
    "I learned to read Latin quite well. Prior to the course, I had no experience in the language. Now, I feel I can read most Latin texts with a proper commentary and relatively little assistance.",
    "I learned a lot of latin grammatical concepts and vocabulary as well as being able to translate simple to more advanced sentences.",
    "I've learned a plethora of nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions and adverbs in Latin. I've also learned important syntactical structures like purpose clauses and independent subjunctives."

   "comments": [
    "Strength is Mr. Zachary Wolens, who truly made learning Latin at 9:25 AM less of a struggle everyday. A weakness is the relative speed of the course--I don't understand why we had our second midterm on October 16 when November 16 was the initial date given. Another weakness is the lab section, which is a waste of time. Yale should be like UC Berkeley in this respect--my friend is taking Latin 1 with the same textbook and has class four days a week, with the lab cut out. The lab did nothing to solidify learning.",
    "This course does a great job at giving you a vert thorough introduction to Latin and I feel very confident going into L2. At times, the course felt as if it was moving a bit too fast for me, but I think that in the end it was worth it.",
    "I think this course does a good job of developing the grammar concepts in a logical order, and balancing vocabulary and reading practice along the way.",
    "The language labs could have been organized slightly better, but other than that, the course was designed fairly optimally for learning to read Latin and understanding Latin grammar constructions.",
    "Perhaps more vocabulary and grammar quizzes as well as more in class translating",
    "I thought one of the strengths of the course was the constant feedback from the instructor, who also frequently made himself available for office hours and study sessions, for which I am grateful. I did feel as though rushing through the first grammar concepts was one of the weaknesses, because even though the pace for the second half of the course allowed for a better grasp of the concepts, I did find myself having to constantly review through the less-formed concepts I learned in the beginning, giving the cumulative nature of the course. I did also appreciate the responsiveness to student feedback, and believe it was another one of the strengths of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I have to stress this: it is an intensely difficult course if you come in with no Latin experience. You will learn how to read most Latin sentences, but you must spend at least an hour everyday on the material. If you still want to take this course, it is a great foray into a fascinating language.",
    "Yes. Latin is essential not only for classicists, but also for all literature scholars, particularly if the literature studied is a Romance, pre-19th-century one.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any one at Yale that is even moderately interested in learning the Latin language.",
    "This is a great introduction to Latin for anyone who wants to learn to read Latin!",
    "If you are at all interested in learning Latin, I highly recommend the class.",
    "Yes if you have a serious interest in learning latin",
    "For any student of the humanities, especially those at the graduate level looking to research texts before the nineteenth century, a rudimentary knowledge of Latin is essential."
