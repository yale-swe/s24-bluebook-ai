    "Lots of coding. This really depends on your project though.",
    "I learned a lot about the nature of research - and the challenges one faces all along the way! I learned how to develop a model and synthesize data from various sources.",
    "I learned how to construct and finalize a good senior essay",
    "Research skills and methodology! Specifically for neuroeconomics and neuroscience.",
    "Research, data cleaning, data analysis, etc. I think this is the most I ever learned in the major because i was applying it.",
    "Learned how to pace myself with a long research project and best practices for research",
    "Conducting primary research and analysis on a unique, unexplored topic.",
    "I learned how to independently conduct a research project - it was an incredibly valuable experience.",
    "Writing a senior essay in economics was an extremely fulfilling experience--it was a great opportunity to conduct a deep-dive analysis in an area that I feel passionate about. I learned a lot about research, literature review, statistical analysis and much more.",
    "I learned a lot about how to independently conduct an economics research project from start to finish. I wish I had had a little more guidance and feedback along the way but it was overall a very educational experience.",
    "I personally didn't really use the resources made available by this course for economic thesis students due to the nature of my thesis, although it seems like it would have been very helpful to some students.",
    "My adviser disappeared. I had to write this on my own.",
    "This was my first experience producing original research and facing all of its inherent difficulties.",
    "I gained a lot technical skills (data gathering, cleaning, etc) as well as more experience with how to think economically, how to come up with analyses that will answer the question I'm interested in, how to treat endogeneity etc.",
    "Varied"

   "comments": [
    "It's an amazing experience for all Yale students",
    "The revamped support system for senior essay writers in Econ has been very helpful.",
    "I thought it was good as is! Maybe deadline for draft 1 and 2?",
    "More standardization on grading",
    "It is very much dependent on the student advisor relationship - which can be fabulous or less so. I also would have appreciated more comments from my second reader.",
    "I wish there were more standardized expectations of what an advisor does and more guidance on actually developing the question. The sections were a good start but more would be helpful.",
    "I spent a lot of time on my thesis - a lot of it spent in uncertainty about what exactly the department ultimately would expect from me. It would be nice if guidelines could be made clearer about what the department expects (especially if your adviser doesn't give you much direction). Perhaps they could make available by what standards anonymous readers judge papers and how prizes are awarded.",
    "Get seniors who write theses to take ECON 132 earlier on! Or just sub ECON 132 with ECON 135 or 136 in the EconMath major",
    "I think it was hard to know what to do since I had never done anything remotely like this original research project before. I kind of wished that there was a little more hand holding in the course, whether it be in terms of timeline (when we should have certain things completed), or more of how to approach questions that we are interested in, how we choose which models to use etc.",
    "More structure!"

    "Yeah. Explore something that interests you.",
    "Worth it!",
    "Absolutely. There were times throughout the process that were discouraging and overwhelming, but I could not be happier I decided to write a Senior Essay.",
    "He!",
    "Definitely! A very rewarding experience for econ majors who otherwise probably have not had much engagement with the major.",
    "I would! It's very satisfying. Lots of work and wont feel satisfying during but the end product will feel great! You also learn so much",
    "Couldn't recommend more highly for all economics majors!",
    "Absolutely! I would recommend writing a senior essay to all Economics majors!",
    "I am glad I did a senior essay.",
    "Doing a senior thesis for economics is a great idea! I really learnt so much.",
    "Yes",
    "No. Unless you really want to do it or have a great adviser you've known for 30 years or something",
    "It's very worthwhile to bring together the economic models and techniques of four years of study into a piece of original research.",
    "Yes. This is a course that really synthesizes everything you've learned in economics and forces you to think and really challenges you. I think this should be mandatory for all econ majors."
