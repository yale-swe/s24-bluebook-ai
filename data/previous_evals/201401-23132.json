   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend the course to another student. Although I do not agree to 100% with the course's syllabus, I am very happy that I have taken it!",
    "Highly recommend--incredibly informative and helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, but the impracticality of much of what we learned is a negative. It is hard to sell other students on pages and pages of notation to show that the HT estimator is unbiased.",
    "If you want to be a political scientist, I think this course is vital.",
    "For someone with little to now quantitative knowledge, its a great course!",
    "Highly recommend. Great introduction to good research prctices",
    "Yes! A great course to learn and apply a huge variety of research techniques with a very talented and enthusiastic Professor. Also a great opportunity to learn R.",
    "I would summarize the course as the statistics course you wish you'd gotten as an undergraduate. It did a good job of clarifying assumptions for statistical practices, and always looped back to conditional expectations, thus providing a sense of why we learn probability before we do statistics, rather than the usual discombobulated calculate odds of poker hands, and then memorize a logitmodel, with no connective tissue between the subjects.I would recommend it highly to any student who will be using or consuming quantitative works (ie, everyone), and the coverage of different modes of inference (IID, design based, parametric) was very helpful.",
    "If you are interested in statistical data analysis in social sciences, particularly causal inference, it is a 'must take' course.",
    "A rigorous, but mathematically-approachable introduction to methods for drawing causal inferences from data",
    "Definitely would recommend to all first year political science students. An absolute requirement for understanding the current field of political science.",
    "Yes of course. The best econometrics course that is \"applied\"."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I can critically assess to what extent regression analyses reported in articles make sense against the background of the assumptions implied by the regression models used.Also, OLS is mostly harmless :)",
    "This course laid an essential foundation of quantitative knowledge and will contribute significantly to general research capabilities.",
    "This was a very helpful course in terms of deepening my knowledge, but so much of what we learned is inapplicable in my particular field of study that I'm not sure how much it contributed to my research. A bit more practicality and a realization that we can't all run experiments would be a good thing for this class.",
    "I am better able to read and understand quantitative political science work, and I now can see how I can use these techniques in my own research.",
    "It helped me with the analytical aspect of my programme",
    "Yes. Very useful",
    "I definitely learned a lot about stats. Enough to know that I know nothing, that's for sure. If that was the goal of this course, then mission accomplished.",
    "I can't even begin to say. Last semester, I thought I knew what I was doing with stats...this time, I really began to realize the full power of statistics, and how little of it I can yet harness. But it also really excited me about the learning that is to come.",
    "This course deepened my understanding of how to read and justify quantitative research. Unlike other courses, which have largely been about how to make the mechanics of statistics work, this one gave me the ability to recognize how to appropriately note flaws in research designs and findings based on quantitative methods.While much of my research is less amenable to statistical inference, it has helped me think through what is needed in a research design, and will be helpful for quantitative work in future papers.",
    "This course taught me causal inference and the merits of nonparametric methods. My discipline and research are far more modeling-centered and dominated by Bayesian methods (sorry Peter). While I intend to stay a modeler, this course helped me understand where and how answering causal questions can be informative.",
    "Provided a broad overview helpful for evaluating the accuracy of papers in the field. An absolute requirement for prepping for the quantitative exam. Provides an In depth understanding of the comprehensive research methodsneeded for good research!",
    "Dircectly relevant",
    "Indispensable."
