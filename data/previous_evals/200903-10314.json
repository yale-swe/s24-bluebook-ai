   "comments": [
    "Absolutely to those students in organic synthetic chemistry. But it requires a lot of background information, so it just must limited to graduate students.",
    "A very demanding class, but a very worthwhile class. If you've ever had to completely commit yourself to something in order to achieve something, then you have it in you to get the most you can out of the class - giving it a half-effort will not be worth the time. Of my 4 classes this term, I learned the most from this class, by far.",
    "This course is a must for someone interested in organic chemistry. It more than any other course exposed me to the thought process that synthetic organic chemists use.",
    "A very difficult course, but definitely an interesting one. I never felt like falling asleep once, unlike in most other courses. The only drawback is that all the points come from 3 exams and a final project, and no scores are dropped. So one bad test might really hurt you.However, Seth told us he wanted us all to succeed in his course, and would work with any of us that felt we needed extra help via office visits and so forth.So if you are willing to work and study hard, then definitely take this course.",
    "This course is very useful to anyone who does anything that is the least bit synthetic. Even for a methodology project, this course is useful because it not only outlines the many methods that already exist, but also explores the many challenges and problems that have yet to be overcome.",
    "Yes, learned more chemistry in this course than any other organic class."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me the opportunity to explore and get new knowledge in organic chemistry.",
    "100% applicable to my research, as the class is in my field.",
    "I learned a lot of reactions that I had never seen before, and that accomplished some very useful transformations. I found myself relieved at this when I was able to use what I learned in this course to help me out in my other synthesis course.",
    "This course greatly enhanced my understanding of chemistry, and has completely changed the way in which I look at problems, both synthetic and otherwise. The knowledge attained from this course will probably be used in almost every aspect of my research.",
    "Much more knowledgable about synthetic planning and application of retrons."
