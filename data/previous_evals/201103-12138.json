   "comments": [
    "This class is a good course about various issues in international human rights. Readings were pretty much the majority of a book per week, but it's not necessary to do readings most weeks because the discussions were more broad and normative. Professor Onoma leads good discussions and provides really interesting, often counterintuitive, insights and conclusions.",
    "This class is a preliminary look at the world of human rights, offering various views and definitions of human rights such as universalism, relativism, positive rights, negative rights, etc.It's a good introduction, though not an in depth analysis.",
    "A course with minimal work that will make you think critically about what human rights are, how we categorize them, and why we care about them. If you have a good class, Onoma will be able to focus the discussion in very interesting ways.",
    "Very good! Not a lot of work, but still very informative, interesting and eye-opening. Professor Onoma is very good at facilitating discussion and calling your attention to things you did not think about before.",
    "a look at the politics of human rights, it's a good overview, the interesting theoretical aspects of human rights",
    "Survey of important considerations regarding contemporary human rights rhetoric and practice.",
    "Yes definitely...learned a lot and a very manageable course",
    "This class has a light workload--there are 5 three page reading responses, but you can choose when you want to do them. The readings are very interesting, but discussion is often not based on them. Onoma often has great insights, but the class is mainly driven by group discussion, which can become tedious at times. The class takes a broader, more unconventional look at human rights, often focusing on economic and social rights. This is a great fifth class where you will still learn a lot and can get out of it what you put in.",
    "This course covers contentious topics but it's often hard to see how all of them fit together under the idea of \"human rights.\" Readings weren't thoroughly addressed in class; some of them even seemed superfluous. Class discussions often went off topic, and students voicing their opinions actually had limited or no knowledge of what they were talking about. Yet the course required only five 3-page reading responses and a 10-minute presentation. If want to take an EP&E seminar that doesn't require a 20-page final paper, you should take this course. If you want to take a human rights course that evaluates policies, you should look elsewhere.",
    "Yes, definitely. An amazing course that really addresses a lot of key issues in international human rights law and policy. Very interesting approach to case studies and related literature.",
    "PLSC 403 is a great course. I genuinely enjoyed doing the reading and doing the work because I am interested in human rights, and the material that Prof. Onoma chooses for this class is pretty fascinating. The class is not too much work (5, 3-page reading responses over the course of the semester and reading anywhere from 100-250 pages a week). I found it to be perfect because work was manageable, homework was enjoyable, and class discussion was interesting. The grading was fair and Prof. Onoma is laid-back, though very knowledgeable and willing to let class go where it will which is rare to find a professor truly willing to do that. I would recommend this class to anyone who has not taken a similar one because you will learn a lot and it will force you to think of things that may be uncomfortable, but that it is important to think about.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. This is different from the other human rights classes offered at Yale because it picks out case studies that are not necessarily part of the foundational human rights framework. We talked much less about the UN and institutional human rights than we did about human rights issues in the context of particular countries and situations--which was really valuable as a foil to traditional human rights education and in its own right. Professor Onoma is wonderfully unpredictable in leading class and structuring discussion; sometimes we would have spontaneous debates as a class, sometimes we broke up into small group discussions, and when we would reunite as a full seminar he always left us with many words of wisdom to conclude class. He's brilliant. There is a lot of reading (usually a book a week), although there is very little writing compared to other Yale classes. You can definitely get by without doing the reading, but the reading is so good and you should probably just make time for the reading, especially since the writing is so minimal."
