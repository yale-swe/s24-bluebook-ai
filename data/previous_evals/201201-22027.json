    "This is an introduction to basic skills in digital photography--how to understand, use, and combine things like f-stop, shutter speed, ISO, framing, light, etc. to make photographs that are interesting--both to the student and to others. The class is structured so that you learn different skills in photoshop and printing throughout the course, building to a great body of work at the end, ususally with an amazing arch of growth. Four-ish critiques per semester, which can be daunting if you don't like talking about your work but I always enjoyed them--you learn a lot not only from the teacher and the medium but from classmates--a huge plus. Also, it's amazing to get out a Yale course with a tangible skill you can do with your hands--this class isn't all cerebral, and it's a gem. take it if you get in!!!",
    "Recommend this class. One of my favourite at Yale.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You will expand your notions of art and you will learn in an intellectually stimulating way that is different from non-art classes.",
    "Obviously, an amazing class. Obviously, take it! Take it with Dru if you want a chill, approachable professor. Do not take it with Dru if you are looking for a comprehensive introduction to Photoshop - she will not give you this. But, I will say, the things she does give you are worth it enough to look for photoshop help elsewhere.",
    "It is a very interesting class. I would definitely recommend it. It is time consuming, but it is most definitely worth it."
