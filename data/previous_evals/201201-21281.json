   "comments": [
    "Incredible exploration of the 19th century on a global scale through the lens of art, highly recommended!!!",
    "I would recommend HSAR 318 to every student, whether an art history major or not. It's a great introduction to a huge subject, the art of the 19th century, a very manageable workload and always interesting. Professor Barringer is fantastic.",
    "You should certainly take this course! It's not just an art history course, it's really a history course on the politics and social situation of the 19th century. Barringer is incredibly smart, and he works in so much into lectures. Lots of reading but you don't have to do them to get a lot out of the course lectures (even if exams need them, usually). Papers are enjoyable to write, and exams come without surprises and not too many IDs. The trip to the met was incredible, the guest lectures were great and we went to the collections of the BAC or YUAG every week. Such a good use of the galleries' material. I really can't recommend this enough, and I've taken a lot of art history classes that didn't move me.",
    "take it!",
    "TAKE IT!! Barringer is the best! You learn so much about history, global art in the 19th century, how to interact with primary sources, both visual and documents that help strengthen your writing.",
    "This is a great survey of 19th century western art. Professor Barringer looks at a lot of paintings often overlooked in the traditional canon. He also provideds fresh prospectives on more famous works. He organizes many, many trips to the BAC to see works \"in the flesh,\" as he says it. He is one of the most committed Professors I've had. He does cram a lot of paintings into his lectures, however. So sometimes classes can feel rushed. I'd definitely recommend this course.",
    "This is a great course -- it takes a non-traditional approach and explores artists and works beyond the modernist storyline usually told. I highly recommend it, Professor Barringer is a wonderful lecturer but also manages to make you feel like you're in a seminar because you are encouraged to speak up during class and often visit the museums in the last half hour of class."
