    "This was a great introduction to working at Yale and also a great review of basic technical theater practices. It was really great to cover a bunch of things that folks might take for granted to ensure that everyone has a thorough and proper understanding of technical theater and sound practices. I found the handouts and lectures to be totally helpful when paired together as they made note taking super efficient. The way the course was structured was also very organized.",
