   "comments": [
    "A broad course on pre- and post-World War II French culture and intellectual thought, with a particular focus on philosophical works by Sartre and Merleau-Ponty.",
    "I would recommend this course. In this semester\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iteration, it was pretty clearly a film studies course as well, due to the number of film studies students taking it. For a non-film studies\/comp lit person, this could be a little disorienting, as a certain level of familiarity with film studies issues and canon were assumed in practice. Familiarity with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cenjeux\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the main texts of the syllabus however made the course generally approachable. There was a strong emphasis on historical context of philosophical and other texts, and it would definitely be most profitable for students with a strong background in French language and\/or studies.",
    "Yes, a great class that favors interdisciplinary approach",
    "I would certainly recommend it, as I personally learned a great deal, but I'm sure the next iteration of this class will be quite different since the syllabus depends, to a degree, on students' interests and the teacher's interests of the moment.If you want to delve deeply into Sartre and postwar French thought (and be inspired by it), this class is for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend the seminar to any other fellow student interested in French thought.",
    "I'm not sure I would advise a first-semester student to take it (even though I did exactly that). Partly, it's because the \"largeness\" of the scope might prove somewhat intimidating so early in one's career. I did not find myself adrift, but I did need a few weeks to settle into the rhythm of the seminar. Be prepared to read widely and to read a lot. Be also prepared to seriously question what you're reading, to try and develop links with material that may be far removed geographically and in time. Above all, be prepared to keep an open mind and to be theoretically astute."

   "comments": [
    "Good background course on the period concerned. Professor Andrew also has a knack for making complex philosophical concepts more easily understandable.",
    "As a student from outside the hosting departments, the course contributed indirectly to my research, but on a level that is in fact important \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gaining a steadier grasp on some of the thinkers, more philosophical issues, that were central to the course.",
    "Very helpful. Helped me hone in my thesis interests",
    "It certainly deepened my knowledge of the issues French intellectuals grappled with after the war.",
    "This seminar provided a serious grounding in the post-war interplay of aesthetics and interpretive strategies between the worlds of cinema and literature (both often coming together on the ground of philosophy). It filled a sizable gap in my understanding of the history of cinema, cinema studies, and allowed me to understand the conversation between cinema and the history of art in the time period under scrutiny. I was exposed to texts that will almost certainly prove instrumental to my dissertation."
