    "i was apprehensive to take the studio as it appears in the last few years that it requires a proper partnership to succeed. the studio moves at an incredible pace and this can be crippled within a group that lacks a proper work ethic and mutual respect. so my expectations were both met and disappointed at the same time. if i was to do it again i would have better served myself to work on my own...",
    "My expectations were met. High intensity. High level of conceptual thinking. Productive studio pin-ups."

    "The resources were adequate, although the library is a continually disappointing aspect of the academics offered at Yale. That a supposedly world-class institution is devoid of an arts library with even a reasonably stocked collection of books is, quite frankly, embarrassing. In addition, the policy that only allows students to check out books for one day at a time at the arts library severely limits any potential usefulness of the library. Finally, the fact that we have 7 or 8 laser cutters is great, but their utility could be enhanced enormously if hours were adjusted just slightly to allow students to use them later or to stagger their hours so that they still have time to recharge but they are operational at different time periods over the course of a day.",

   "comments": [
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio, as I'm sure is the response every year, is the Thursday pin-up when Peter is present. It's useful for a variety of reasons: first, because decisions are made; second, it allows us as students to gauge where we are in the process; and third, perhaps uniquely to our year, because we got to hear and receive feedback from everyone else in our studio. The last reason might be the biggest benefit for me of the studio this year, that I felt, more than any other studio I've taken, that we all were engaged in each other's projects. Following from that, the least valuable moments of the studio were when it felt as though certain students were not pulling their weight, excluding them from the otherwise productive conversations that we were able to have as a group throughout the semester about architecture. If absolutely nothing else, this semester has been valuable for allowing me to collaborate with a group of students with whom I see myself working for a long time after school.",
    "i have to say you do get what you pay for in the eisenman studio. however, meeting with eisenman every week is a killer. i would suggest a few windows of time where students have an extended duration to work through their ideas without the direction or assistance of the professor.",
    "We only has pin-ups. Which I found to be an effective method of consistently building the project from week-to-week. Not that this would actually change one way or another, but this consistency in format was critical to the success of the studio.The studio may have benefited from more outside critics joining those weekly Thursday pin-ups. There were only two weeks prior to the final review when other critics were present, and these weeks were tremendously helpful in offering a different perspective and an insight into what the final review would bring."
