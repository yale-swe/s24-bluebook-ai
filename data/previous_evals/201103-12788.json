   "comments": [
    "Yes, but be sure you're interested in British social history of the last 60 years or so. Much of the class is spent discussing social issues rather than close reading, which isn't a bad thing, just be sure that's what you want to be doing. Great reading list.",
    "The class rocks. If you can get in, TAKE IT!",
    "Absolutely. You would be a fool to get in and not take it. Caz is amazing and the syllabus is incredible. I discovered John Osborne, the British playwright who I'm now obsessed with, and we read two other plays that rank among my favorites (Sing Yer Heart Out For The Lads and Translations). I looked forward to this class every week.",
    "This course is decent - not life-changing or anything, but fine if you need a senior seminar and don't like any of the others on offer. Caryl Phillips is a charming person if not the best discussion leader - he tends to monopolize the conversation instead of leading it in a direction - although he doesn't really believe in literary analysis, which is frustrating for an English major. The texts you read are fine - some better than others - though I think a more appropriate title for the course would be Race and Class in Contemporary British Fiction.",
    "This is a fascinating class. As long as you do the reading you'll be fine, and there is usually not too much reading. Caz knows so much about all the texts and authors, it's really worthwhile to take a class with him. Take it if you're actually interested in learning about Britain. There's not much close reading; it focuses more on broader issues. Just don't even think about looking at your cell phone during class!",
    "British fiction from the fifties to today, with a focus on postcolonialism and the notion of home in empire. I'd recommend it as long as you're okay with Caryl Phillips' teaching style - which is to say, he can monopolize conversation sometimes.",
    "Engl 416 explores the way that literature catalogs societal changes in class and racial makeup (among other things) in contemporary British life and history. I would recommend this class.",
    "This class presents an interesting array of reading in British fiction over the past several decades. The class reads a novel or play of Contemporary British fiction each week and the texts are always incredibly thought-provoking. This is one of the most interesting and engaging reading syllabi I've encountered at Yale. The class is organized around the themes of race, class, and finding a place in society, which keeps the class focused. The trajectory of the class from pre-colonial era, though colonial literature, to the post-colonial homeland and current class and race issues in Britain was so interesting. The class feels relevant, literary, and culturally aware.",
    "take it. great books, great professor.",
    "Absolutely take this class! The syllabus exposes you to British writers that you might not otherwise encounter and Phillips's take on them is always compelling."
