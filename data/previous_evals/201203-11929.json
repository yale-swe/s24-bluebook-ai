    "DO NOT take this if you just are getting a language credit. Just insanely more work than the other departments. Yes, it will get you speaking, but they just assign far to much work for a credit and half. Its really like 2 credits of work. Also evening tests are really a problem if you have a lot of extracurricular.",
    "This course is a ton of work.But, if you really want to take it, don't take it with Hebbard.She's very very sweet but has absolutely no idea what she's doing. From what I heard from other sections, every one else loved their professors and always talked about how much those professors were teaching them. In contrast I felt as if I had to teach french to myself. Similarly, Hebbard doesn't prepare you for the test and while, in other classes, they've gone over everything that appears on the test, in our section, major parts of those tests would focus on things that we'd never even mentioned let alone spent any meaningful time on. It was really frustrating.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who needs to fulfill the Language requirement at Yale.",
    "French is tough and work-heavy (like, at least an hour every night if you keep up, which you should) but if you're interested in knowing a language, take it. And never be afraid to look up a word that you can't figure out from context (which this course mostly expects you to do).",
    "Yes. It's very rewarding, and you learn a great deal in a short period of time.",
    "Just your regular old Level 1 French class. In short, it's a pain but you do learn a lot if you put in the work. And that if- is important.",
    "Bad. Miserable and bad. Don't start it if you want to enjoy your semester\/maintain any confidence as a student.",
    "Probably not. It requires a tremendous amount of work."
