    "better French",
    "French. Read several books and watched some French movies",
    "Better grammar skills; vocab; reading French literature",
    "I built speaking and reading fluency ridiculously quickly - I now feel like I have a solid foundation in the French language as a whole.",
    "Deeper insight into French film. Strengthened writing skills.",
    "My grasp of the French language DRASTICALLY improved. I read and write at a level and complexity much greater than prior to taking this course.",
    "In taking this course I strengthened my command of french grammar and I appreciated to greater degree how to approach learning the language",
    "This course forces you to use French everyday and in doing so lets the material sink in and be learned more easily. It requires one to learn how to manage their time better because of its constant workload that must be done daily. The course is slightly rigorous and adds variety in the books and films watched which challenge you to leave your comfort zone and refine your French."

   "comments": [
    "Great course",
    "Interesting material and engaging teacher.",
    "Not many chances to speak to classmates\/learn about each other.",
    "This course is strong in that it builds skills and teaches material very quickly, but it requires serious daily work to progress. If there is any weakness in the course, it is that there is so much day-to-day work, but this just accelerates the learning process!",
    "Strengths: engaged faculty and academically challenging program Weaknesses: more speaking time needed\/applications to modern day french",
    "The course material is time-consuming but WELL worth the effort. The preliminary writing exercise was a very important tool in tracking progress! The only weakness I can imagine is that there is not as much speaking practice as I feel there should be in order to ensure comfort with the grammar learned.",
    "The instructor demonstrated a wonder an ability to engage all the students and helped to set a high standard of excellence."

    "Yes, you will learn French.",
    "Only if you are very confident in your French and are able to spend most of your time on this class.",
    "This was a stressful course, but if you reach out and do the homework, you will get through.",
    "Yes, but I would warn them that it is a serious time commitment!! As long as you put in the time, you will get lots out of this course.",
    "Yes, everyday classes means language skills facilitated. Engaging instructor",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The pay-off is tremendous, although it is very difficult to notice improvement throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend the course to people who would make the time learn the language because it requires a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in learning French. It goes over a lot of grammar and adds vocabulary while forcing you to use both daily in order to learn it and not simply go over it. The fact that it meets every day of the week can be exhausting at times but it's effective in getting you to do French every day cause you need to be practicing every day. I enjoyed the class (and that's saying something cause I had it at 8 am very day) so I do recommend.",
    "Yes I will recommend this course to another student"
