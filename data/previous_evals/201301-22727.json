   "comments": [
    "It's not necessarily an introduction to Islam, but it's a great building block if you want to know more. It's especially applicable to our world today, when there is so much conflict in the Middle East. You learn so much in such a short time it's unbelievable. I would completely recommend this class to another student, but only if you're willing to put the work in. Take it if you're willing to do all the reading and be mentally invested.",
    "A phenomenal course. Very well designed: the syllabus leads to a comprehensive dealing with the concepts of Islam and modernity and the relation between them. Take this course. You will learn loads.",
    "Education, yet very challenging class. If you are willing to do the readings and continue to participate with the chance that you could easily be called out for interpreting something wrong, go ahead. It's a humbling experience, but amazing nonetheless. You really do learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in studying exactly what the course's name says, \"Islam and Modernity.\" It provides excellent insight into the interaction between the two. However, just as a warning, it is in no way an introductory course to Islam. Though some of the inter workings of Islam are necessarily discussed, that is not the focus. It definitely deals more with the interactions and encounters of famous Muslims\/Muslim movements with the world. Regardless, the course was interesting, as is Professor Griffel, who is intelligent and funny, but focused. The only part that is difficult is keeping up with the readings at times when the semester gets busy.",
    "This is a fantastic seminar that will both familiarize you with the religion of Islam, as well as allow for you to explore the elusive concept of modernity. In the end, you will consider the ways in which this two intertwine.The readings are interesting and informative, truly important for anyone who is remotely interested in Islam and the modern world. The Professor is inspiring.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in Islam, the Middle East and Muslim world, current politics, or philosophic discussions!",
    "This course is fantastic and definitely worth taking no matter what you are interested in. It is especially good for students interested in International Relations (like me) who want to understand the tensions that exist within Islam and the modern world. It is also great for those looking for an interesting side class that want to dabble in something foreign to them as this course teaches you about Islam from the basics and does not presume you have any knowledge of the subject. Only take it if you are interested though because its hard to get into and once you're in it it can be seen as a lot of work if you aren't genuinely interested.",
    "Take it, take it, take it! You will learn so much about the \"other side\" of the War and Terror and it will help to dispel any misconceptions you may have about Islamic Fundamentalism, whether you are Muslim or not.",
    "Take it! Even if you know nothing about Islam! I learned so much and enjoyed writing my final paper so much!",
    "I would 100% recommend it. It was challenging and a lot of work but very rewarding. Reading the newspaper after taking this class, I feel like I am more knowledgable about the war in Iraq and current events relating to Islam and the Middle East."
