    "People are very polarized about this class. Either they think it is OK or they hate it with all their might. The class is taught very dryly, so don't take it just for fun. Everyone who wasn't an astro major left on the first day of shopping period and never returned. That said, I soon got over the method of delivery and learned a huge amount of astronomy from this course.",
    "Well, this class is required for majors. But if you're not a major, there are so many astronomy classes that are way better. So, only take it if you really have to.",
    "It's required, so my advice would be to make the best of it. The lectures are dry, but the material is useful for understanding ApJ articles. There isn't any homework, and the reading is not necessary (everything you need to know is covered in lecture). The midterm and final are essay questions on the major topics covered (see the syllabus). The final paper is on any topic related to the syllabus - it felt like writing a review article and was fairly time-consuming. Other than that, Prof Larson is a stickler for attendance, so beware.",
