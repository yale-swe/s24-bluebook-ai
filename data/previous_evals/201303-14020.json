    "Pretty boring class sessions, and the readings were often hard to follow\/synthesize into the rest of the class. I took the class to improve my Stata skills though, and they did increase, so I guess that's good. There's a lot of potential for this class and I feel like we just barely tapped it.",
    "Fascinating material but be wary. Professor Martin Wittenberg is very knowledgeable and intelligent but this didn't translate to effective discussions.",
    "The course covers some important quantitative measures and studies, and it is a good way to learn more stata skills after Lloyd's Applied Quantitative Analysis. Be careful though because this doesn't directly build on things from that class (there aren't a lot of\/any regressions, for instance). You'll learn a bit, but it also probably won't be the most engaging course.If you want to learn research skills you plan to use, maybe think twice if you don't want to just do stata.Also mostly focuses on (income) inequality, rather than other measures of well being more generally.",
    "You'll learn some interesting things about South Africa, and get better at Stata, but you'll also suffer through some majorly dull moments. Your call.",
    "This class sounded very interesting. However, since it was the first time it was taught at Yale, I think there were quite a few kinks that needed to be worked out.The class focused on two major aspects: theoretical concepts of well-being, mostly centered around a book by Amartya Sen and in-class discussions, and practical applications, centered around using Stata to work with a South African data set. The in-class discussions were sometimes awkward, because people didn't really speak up during the seminars. The practicals were useful, but at times hard to follow. I think the major challenge was that a lot of the material was a bit over our heads, making it hard for us to contribute during discussions or follow the practicals.Professor Wittenberg is a great guy, and it was clear that he tried very hard to solicit feedback from us and improve the class. He was also very patient and helpful if you met with him in-person to ask questions.If this class is taught again at Yale, I think it will get better during future iterations, but the first time was a bit rocky.",
    "Take this class if you need a research design credit or econ seminar- not too much work throughout the process and some more exposure to stata, but do not expect to get too much instruction out of it."
