   "comments": [
    "If you love Korean, why not? It's not that hard of a class and it's manageable.",
    "If you want to continue your Korean, take it! By L5, the class doesn't just focus upon the book and covers extra grammar and vocab which will really expand your understanding. We also had some challenging reading practice.",
    "An excellent course - you'll find yourself able to assemble and express more complex thoughts in Korean (e.g. you'll be able to participate in small debates, write about more abstract things) - you'll get more out of the course if you put in a bit more time than is minimally necessary to do well on the quizzes \/ tests, particularly with regards to learning vocabulary",
    "Small class size makes for great practice speaking. But keep in mind that this class is for non-native speakers of Korean, so you should probably supplement with Korean TV shows to get moreexperience listening to people speak.Of course, though, \u00ec\u009d\u00b4\u00ec\u0084\u00a0\u00ec\u0083\u009d\u00eb\u008b\u0098 always keeps the class energetic and fun. If you're taking this class, you're probably already familiar with the routine. Enjoy it!",
    "Definitely recommended! The class focuses mostly on speaking and the atmosphere is very relaxed - most of the time it feels like we are just casually chatting, but in Korean. Once you get to L5, the different strengths and weaknesses of the students begin to show, but \u00ec\u009d\u00b4 \u00ec\u0084\u00a0\u00ec\u0083\u009d\u00eb\u008b\u0098 (who is as wonderful, caring, sassy, loving, and funny as ever) gets everyone to participate and makes sureno one is left behind. You can really tell how much she loves teaching the class, and being taught by someone as remarkable as her is an absolute pleasure. This is an understatement, but Korean at Yale will seriously make your life happier."
