    "Birgit is a wonderful, understanding professor. She is flexible but brings really great insights to the class. The class subject matter always seems relevant to current events. The people in the class make it amazing.",
    "Substantial amount of reading but the manageable assignments. Birgit is very good about providing helpful feedback. The discussions can get very interesting but that will also depend on who's taking the course that semester.",
    "The course will likely change in the future (I think this is the first year of it), but in general I think it was a good way to go more in-depth with some of the issues in Intro ER&M, and because it's a required class for the major, majors will get to know each other which is really important for the broader Ethnic Studies community. I think the class gives you a really good sense of institutional history of Ethnic Studies, and the classroom is structured around the idea that students get to decide what they learn and how they learn it - it's a beautiful thing.",
    "Take it!! The readings are awesome, the professor is awesome, your other classmates will be awesome.",
    "yes!!! absolutely!! this is an important and fun class",
    "Its so informative, i would take it",
    "I very much enjoyed this course for the readings and for the insights from Professor Rasmussen. I also *loved* the group of people and wish that we could have spent more time together \/ had more time to discuss these topics.I would recommend this class, with the caveat that, at least this year, it lacked certain organization and many times did not feel like a seminar but rather a lecture.",
    "This class, though full of interesting readings (especially once we got past Takaki and the really theoretical stuff), was mostly a book club. The discussion devolved into anecdotes, the professor rambles (interesting, but rambling nonetheless), and the assignment criteria and due dates were totally unclear. This class has a lot of room to grow and could be much better in the future but in this iteration it was frustrating. Workload concentrated at the end.",
    "stimulating conversation",
    "Yes I would highly recommend.",
    "If you're into tearing down the social structure, this class if for you! If you don't understand what that means, you should probably go elsewhere. If you love beautiful, radical, empowered people, this is your jam. It would be a shame to miss such a wonderful class and professor. TAKE IT."
