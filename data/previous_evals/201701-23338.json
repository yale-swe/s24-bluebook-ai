    "critical perspectives on gandhi's philosophy, political theory, and construction of a new state",
    "Prof. Mantena's course, above all, made me realize what an enigma Gandhi is. His writings could often be extremely repetitive, and sometimes maddening in their contradictions, but they provided such rich material for discussion and writing that working with them proved extremely rewarding. The weekly reaction papers also really helped me become more involved with the material: they were challenging, but a great way of preparing myself for weekly discussions. And, of course, the ability to read Gandhi alongside his contemporary nationalist thinkers provided an enormously useful way to think about the contradictions and debates that swirled within the Indian independence movement. Overall, a wonderful and engaging course.",
    "I learned about key debates regarding nationalism, modernity, caste, and religion that animated social and political thought in India around the time of independence. I learned to analyze and compare primary texts by Gandhi and his interlocutors to understand how their ideas developed differently from, and shaped, each other's. Through this process, I gained an appreciation for the uniqueness, and oddness, of many of Gandhi's ideas.",
    "This class is a great overview of Gandhian political thought, as well as that of his contemporaries."

   "comments": [
    "a little more engagement outside of the course as well as actually getting our reading responses back",
    "A major strength of this course were the reaction papers 750 words apiece, a hefty weekly workload, and entirely worth the effort that Prof. Mantena asked us to put into them. A reading response of this length, coupled with readings that could often seem disarmingly straightforward on the surface, really pushed me to probe the depths of Gandhi, Savarkar, Tagore, and Ambedkar's thinking. And the final research project, especially given the amount of support Prof. Mantena showed us, really made me feel like I was capable of doing historical research well. A weakness of this course would be the logistics often (and I think part of this had to do with family-related issues) Prof. Mantena wouldn't get to post the readings until a day or two before the session. This made it really hard to space out the readings over the week, which I usually like to do; sometimes my reading and reaction-paper writing felt rushed. But other than that, I have no complaints; I really loved this class.",
    "This course does an excellent job of teaching students to engage critically with primary texts by leading Indian thinkers around the time of independence. The background provided by secondary source readings, and sometimes by Professor Mantena at the beginning of class, was important to put these texts in context. I appreciated the breadth of topics we covered, such as nationalism, modernity, and caste, as well as the diverse perspectives that we got on these topics. I gained a much better understanding of Gandhi's powerful, and idiosyncratic, ideas by reading them in dialogue with those of Gandhi's contemporaries.",
    "Strengths: For someone who hasn't had exposure to Gandhi in the past, I learned a lot about his political ideology. Also a good, in-depth look at many issues plaguing India today (e.g. Hindu-Muslim divide, caste system) Weaknesses: Class discussions were not always engaging, and sometimes lagged during the 2 hour evening sessions."

    "yeah! she's a great professor",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Prof. Mantena is incredible if you ask insightful, genuine questions (warning: she can tell right away if you aren't) she'll give you feedback that exponentially expands your range of thinking. The class was at an odd time Tuesday nights but what that wound up meaning was that everyone in the room genuinely wanted to be there, which made for a really productive learning environment. Take it if you have a genuine curiosity about India, nonviolence, nationalism, or any combination of the above; it's a fascinating class.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It's an exciting opportunity to learn about how different thinkers have approached key political and social issues in modern India.",
    "For someone who is interested in learning about Gandhi and his counterparts, this class is a great introduction."
