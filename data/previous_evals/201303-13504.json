    "Take it for the readings. Shop around for professors.",
    "A dense reading list but if you want to read the plays and will actually take the time to try and read so you can actually contribute to discussion. With a good class who will actually talk about the plays. Really interesting when we actually got talking.",
    "Excellent class! You get to cover a lot (even though it used to be nicknamed \"A Play A Day\" but you can also get by without doing a lot of the reading - but do it, it contributes to class discussion. TRobs is WONDERFUL. The sweetest man - take it with him if you can!!! He'll fill up a lot of the time talking, but is always open to class discussion as well - he makes great points and has great stories! 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "A lot of reading you don't have to do.",
    "A lot of fun. You read all the plays and authors people talk about: Sophocles, Euripedes, Homer, \"The Cherry Orchard\", etc. A great substitute for the literature of DS without committing your entire schedule to the DS curricula. Take this class! You'll pick up on so many references and it will force you to read all the literature you've always wanted to but didn't (and then some).",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to another student. The material covered in 129 is fantastic--it really is a treat to getto spend a class primarily on the Greeks and Shakespeare (if you're into that)--but it is treated only superficially. We spent an average of a day per play, and most of class was devoted to the professor lecturing, rather than discussion; in other words, if you're looking to dig into these plays and discuss them for more than 15 minutes or so, this isn't the class for you. The workload is very reasonable as long as you enjoy reading, and Robinson is a generous grader--he's a genuinely nice guy, too, and even though I didn't like his teaching style, I appreciated how welcoming he made the class.",
    "I would probably recommend that they take the course but with a different professor."
