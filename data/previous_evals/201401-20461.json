   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course--it is at once very manageable and very interesting. My friend and I, who are classicists, took it on a whim, but it was probably one of the most helpful courses I have ever taken in terms of getting a feel for the material culture of a civilization. I know that some people in the class probably didn't do all the reading and therefore the class was probably very, very manageable (the only assessments being two oral reports and a 6-8 page final paper), but I would definitely recommend doing all the reading because it is incredibly interesting and a good way to maximize your learning experience. A lot of what I read in this class also pertained to the Homer class I was also taking this term, so I also appreciated the multidisciplinary approach to Homer that I ended up getting from my classes this term.",
    "Worlds of Homer is a great class to take if you have some interest or background knowledge in the epics and mythology. Some of the people who take it are Classics or Archaeology majors who know a lot of it really well already, but it's not an intimidating class because of the environment that Professor Foster sets up. I learned a lot, and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I really, really enjoyed this class. Readings aren't too much, lecture is interesting and there is always discussion so it is half seminar style. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Yes. It offers a new and interesting perspective on classical Homer and its implication on ancient\/modern societies. I especially enjoyed the discussion on how one tradition is passed down through time and how it interacts with other cultures along the way. A great introduction to ancient Greek art and some archaeological theories.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn more about the cultural context and background of Homer's two most famous works or if you are particularly interested in Mycenaean or Minoan art.",
    "ARCG 235 is a great class that anybody would be lucky to take. The professor is engaging and easy to understand. Professor Foster is clearly an expert in the field, so learning from her is an amazing experience. The workload consists of readings and a few important assignments. The material itself is entertaining. Definitely take this course if you are can."
