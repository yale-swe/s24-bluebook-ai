    "Playwriting is a class about PLAYWRITING. Every week, you read one-three plays and discuss them in class. You also do a short writing assignment based on a style\/genre of theater you discuss in class. The class culminates in the writing of a one-act play! I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to anyone interested in theater\/writing. Donald Margulies is wonderful and this class will make you think about writing in a whole new way.",
    "Playwriting is a wonderful opportunity to read beautiful plays while developing one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own artistic sensibilities. If you love plays and writing, the work is never a chore and always a pleasure. If you take this class, fully recognize what a great opportunity you have before you and fully commit to making the most out of your experience.",
    "A wonderful playwriting workshop where you read so many of the greatest plays ever written and then apply those expert techniques to your own work so that it may blossom and grow over the course of a semester. Takeit take it!",
    "DUH I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CLASS.DUH YOU SHOULD TAKE IT IF YOU GET IN.DUH MARGULIES IS A PULITZER-PRIZE WINNING PLAYWRIGHT WHO WILL READ YOUR WORK AND GIVE YOU 100% CORRECT FEEDBACK.",
    "This is a great introduction to the art of playwriting. As a professional playwright himself, Professor Margulies has a great deal of experience and knowledge, and does an excellent job of teaching it to his students. Class meetings are always structured and informative, and I found myself often eager to do the work outside of class. I would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "If you are serious about playwriting, even if you have limited experience, take it. The course requires a lot of work and your hard work and time will maximize the rewards. This course, if taken seriously, will probably become the academic focus of your semester."
