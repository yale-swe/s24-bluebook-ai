    "You should ABSOLUTELY take this class if you get into it. And you should take it Cr\/D\/F. Even knowing that you'll dedicate your life to the class and do more work for it than any other. It's worth it.",
    "Writing About Oneself has been the most extraordinary academic experience of my life. Anne Fadiman is simply the best, both as a professor and mentor. Further, the students in the class are amongst the brightest, most talented, and most interesting at Yale. I recommend that anyone with even the slightest interest applies to this class. If you don't think that you are a writer, Anne will prove you wrong. And if you get in, drop anything else on your schedule to take it. The workload is heavy but it is enjoyable and well worth it. If you're lucky enough to take this class, you'll find that when it is over, and the only thing left to do is write the course evaluation, you'll be wishing that you could go back in time and do it all again.",
    "I mean, nothing more really needs to be said. This is why we go to Yale. You get one hour conferences with her one on one for every piece. Your writing will actually improve! Even if you generally do WR classes in another genre -- take this. It will be worth it. Yale -- give her a teaching prize or something! I know you're reading this!Apply early, apply now!",
    "Believe the hype.",
    "If you get in, TAKE IT. This was my favorite class at Yale so far, and I know that I will use what I learned about writing and about myself for the rest of my life.",
    "An excellent course. Anne Fadiman is a stellar professor, and I lament that not all Yale professors put the time, thought and Love she quite clearly employs into constructing her class into theirs. On top of this, Anne spends time with her students and gives detailed and thoughtful responses to all work handed in; she takes everyone's improvementon as a personal mission of sorts. Please take it \u0097 it will improve your writing (even if you are a writer of Yale's haut niveau) by leaps and bounds, and more than any other prose writing class, will give you the skills you need as a writer.",
    "Students write 1,000 words of autobiographical prose on a different theme every other week and a 3,000 word final essay, and read from major autobiographies and memoirs, beginning with John Stuart Mill and including James Thurber, Vladimir Nabokov, Joyce Maynard, Elizabeth Wurtzel, Dave Eggers, and Joan Didion.The greatest opportunity this class offers, in my opinion, is the chance to write a perfect essay--with Anne Fadiman's coaching and advice from the class, a student can write an essay about which she feels confident not a word could be changed to improve it.My greatest regret about this course is that I took other classes this term, which prevented me from spending my time exclusively on Writing about Oneself.",
    "Absolutely. But take note--this is not the class for you if you like the idea of \"writing about oneself.\" It is an extremely rigorous, often emotionally-draining writing workshop. There are about 100-200 pages of reading a week, and either a 1000 word essay or an (often equally as long) peer critique due each week. Even if you take the class credit\/d\/f (which Anne encourages, to make sure you are exploring topics and experimenting with forms you might not otherwise), you will want to work harder for the class than any of your others. Anne puts so much time and thought into planning the readings and class discussions and that's waht invariably makes her students want to work hard for her in return. She also fosters a very familial, comfortable, and confidential classroom environment. Never before have I felt so comfortable talking about anything and everything in front of a group of peers.",
    "If you have the opportunity, you would be hard-pressed to find a reason not to take this course. The only one I can think of is that you hope to take Anne's fall-semester course (Advanced Nonfiction), since Anne does not accept students into a second course after she has taught them. This class will whip you into shape and make the work-out delicious. Each week, you read a short, older work, and a short or longer more recent work. Sometimes, the author of the latter will come to class. Anne divides the class in two, and each week, you either write a 1000-word essay or an informal critique of your current partner's latest piece. At the end, you write and revise a longer piece (2500-3000 words). The discussions are great, Anne is fantastic, and the atmosphere is wonderfully supportive and constructive."
