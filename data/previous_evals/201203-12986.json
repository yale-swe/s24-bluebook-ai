   "comments": [
    "Good class. Lectures get boring sometimes and no one goes to section. The option to write a term paper (it can be about anything, even llamas) instead of taking the final exam is a great option.",
    "Fairly disorganized, but very interesting. I would only recommend this course to another student if its organization improved.",
    "Eh... I don't think I would recommend this class. The professor is knowledgeable, but not engaging and quite disorganized. There is a lot of material and the midterm was way too specific... Overall, I don't think I learned as much as I should've.",
    "Ancient Civilization of the Andes is a great class! If you are even at all interesting, I think you will find it fascinating. The class begins with the Preceramic period and ends with the Incas. We do not spend a lot of time on the Inca Empire, but don't let that dissuade you! Professor Burger is amazing and keeps the class very interesting.",
    "Yes. Going into the class, I was not interested in learning about this, but I found andean history very interesting and there is lots of cool stuff, like violence, and technology, and great leaders. I loved the pictures and the architecture. Because of the class, I really want to go to Peru and do work there!. Professor burger is a really nice guy too",
    "If you are interested in archeology and this region of the world it is a good class and I would recommend it.",
    "Latin American Studies 232 01 is an interesting and engaging course in which the majority of the material is learned independently and then enriched or completed by the class lectures. Doing at least some of the readings for each class will be crucial- I found the Treasures of the Andes textbook to be most helpful.Expect to gain a broad understanding of the pre-Incan societies, cultures, religions, and lifestyles of Peru and the other Andean regions, and their manifestations through the pottery, textiles, and architecture that we still see traces of today.Although this course does not highly emphasize the connections between the ancient civilizations of the Andes and its modern day societies, one will gain a better appreciation for the lifestyles of the indigenous peoples of the Andes, as well as for the relations between the peoples of the different geographical regions of the Andes. This has been my main take-away from the course, and is why I would recommend it to a student who is considering taking it.",
    "This class is definitely taught from an archaeological perspective. Each culture studied is examined through the sites and remains of the society being take this class if you are expecting a regular history class with dates, people, and battles. If you are interested in archaeology though this is a great class."
