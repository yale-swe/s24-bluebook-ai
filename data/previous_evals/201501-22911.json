    "Math 345 changes every semester so that it is not the same course twice. Any course taught by Van Vu should be good, but be sure that you took 230-231 and not 222 or 225. I took 225 and aced the final, yet was woefully under-prepared for this class. I spent a lot of time each week trying to figure out what the PSETs were asking me to prove, which was more difficult than many of the proofs.",
    "This was a really fun class. Van is a great guy and good lecturer. Only psets and a single presentation, and the psets were very manageable. This was the algebraic version of the class, so you should come in with a good background in linear algebra; I'd say that the graph theory expected could be picked up without taking 244 (though 244 is a good class in its own right).",
    "Great class with interesting material and a wonderful professor, although the pace was slightly slow.",
    "It's hard to summarize math 345 as professor Vu changes the content each semester. This semester we did algebraic methods in combinatorics. Professor Vu is a very good lecturer, and he presents the material in an interesting way. The psets can be rather challenging, and there isn't a textbook for the course, but if you work together with your classmates the material is doable. I would take again given the opportunity (and I may do so next spring).",
    "Combinatorics and Linear Algebra stuff. If you like the content, you'll like the course."
