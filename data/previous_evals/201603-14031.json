   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned about how to analyze religious texts and make comparisons between texts. I also learned how to develop motifs across many texts.",
    "I learned to evaluate how I read literature in different ways. This course widened my view of the rest of the world and gave me more analytical tools.",
    "I learned a lot about three main religions in India, Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism, and how those three religions are portrayed through different texts. I also learned how to read difficult religious texts, and discuss them with my peers.",
    "In this course I have developed the skill of analyzing literature (specifically Indian literature) in a religious and secular context. I also have learned a lot about a culture of which students are rarely afforded the opportunity to learn about, and finally, I have been able to work on my analytical writing skills.",
    "In this course, I learned how to examine a religious text not for its historical content, but rather for its value as a literary piece of art and the insights it provided into how East Asian cultures were structured. I also developed crucial compare-and-contrast skills when looking at texts from different religions commenting on similar subject matter. One of the most useful skills (in my opinion) that I developed while taking this course is the ability to question a text of authority - to recognize that it has faults and is not always correct in describing codes of conduct. Yet even when challenging a text, one can also respect its value as a piece of art and a celebrated code to live by. In this way, a reader can reject a text for themselves, and yet respect it for others.",
    "I learned about a wide variety of ancient Indian texts from Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu tradition. Some skills I developed were developing necessary associations between certain gods and their qualities (e.g. Kama and love) and also selecting important passages in long readings. I expanded my love for ancient literature in this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this class were that it gave students a wholesome view of Indian religion and a deep understanding of early religions like Buddhism. Its weaknesses were that it didn't explore these ideas through many media other than literature. The course could be explored if we explored more music and film and looked at how these religions present themselves in current Indian life.",
    "I improved as a writer with the weekly responses and and the papers helped me think differently. I would have liked it if we spent more time on each text, all the texts are very dense so it would be nice to spend more than one week on one book.",
    "There were a lot of connections made in this course between the different readings and religions, in terms of central themes which I appreciated. I would say one was the class could be improved would be to assign less reading because it was hard to get through all the reading all the time, and when I couldn't finish the reading I felt like I couldn't engage in the class as much.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is the small seminar class because we can have very dynamic and open conversations.",
    "This course was very strong in facilitating the intrigue of students who were unfamiliar with the subject matter. In reading a variety of texts, from religious codes of conduct, to histories of major figures in each religion, to contemporary narratives, students were given a wide variety on how religion was perceived in society and how others reacted to it. I also really enjoyed how the course was structured - in placing more focus on class participation as opposed to tests and a high level of other graded pieces, students were able to be more engaged in the subject matter without stress. I don't have many suggestions on how to improve the course, as I felt it was structured in a very good way to teach the material. My only recommendation would be to spend more time in the museum interacting with physical copies of the texts - the one day we visited the Yale Gallery was my favorite class period by far, and it was truly incredible to see images of the stories we had already read.",
    "One definite strength of the course was the discussion, discussions were always very interesting and engaging. The course was very fast paced, which works for some but not for others. Some of the texts were very difficult to get through, so maybe the course could be improved by substituting other translations into the syllabus.",
    "There should be some kind of prompt of discussion for each class. Also, all viewpoints should be acknowledged and appreciated instead of fact-checked.",
    "Some strengths of this course were its attention to essential subjects in Indian literature (including gods and heroes) and the variety of perspectives explored in different texts. A weakness at the start of the course was a lack of exposure to Indian music or artwork, but this was resolved in the 2nd half of the class."

   "comments": [
    "I would, because it is a good introduction to humanities courses at Yale, and the small class setting really facilitates getting direct and helpful feedback from your instructor.",
    "This is an amazing course, take it if you can. You will read very thought provoking translated texts and the discussions are very interactive. Professor Granoff is amazing and will give you very helpful feedback on your writing and she really knows how to engage the class. We also explore artwork and music in addition to rich texts. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes I definitely would if they were interested in the material.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about eastern religion, especially Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, but I also would recommend to anyone interested in learning about a foreign culture.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students! Not only it is a great introduction to religious studies, but also it was just a genuinely fun and interesting class to take. Although it was slightly reading-heavy, the texts were enjoyable and relatively quick to get through. And Professor Granoff is an incredible professor - she is engaged, brilliant, and so passionate that it is nearly impossible to sit in her class and not be excited about learning. I hope to take more of her classes in the future.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who has good background knowledge of the material. Otherwise it is very difficult to understand and interpret some texts and hard to get into unbiased discussion.",
    "I would highly recommend this to another student. The professor does an excellent job showing you the most exciting and interesting questions posed in ancient Indian literature. Anyone with even slight interest in Indian culture and writing should take this course."
