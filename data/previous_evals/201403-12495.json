    "Opera is a wonderful overview of the four hundred year history of opera that is accessible to those (like myself) who have little to no musical background. Professor Tomlinson draws from a broad base of knowledge and is thus able to look at these operas through a number of compelling lenses: historical, philosophical, even anthropological. His enthusiasm is infectious, and he is extremely devoted to his students as individuals; he is as happy to talk about your interests\/your academic plans in office hours as he is to discuss the upcoming paper. The class rewards those who immerse themselves in the works that are covered; I could imagine someone having a less positive experience with the class if they only gave the operas a cursory glance or viewed the excerpts only as much as is required. Really, though, the \"work\" is a treat; it was nice to settle down at the end of the day with a smattering of Mozart or Verdi, and it was even more rewarding to write about them in the papers, which were an absolute joy.",
    "Take this class! Even if you don't know anything about opera, I promise that within a few weeks you'll be really excited about it. Professor Tomlinson is wonderful -- the class is a blend of lecture and discussion and not only does he give great lectures, he's really attentive to each student. The workload is super manageable, and a lot of it is just watching opera, so it's a lot of fun. I described this class to my friends as my \"candy class\" -- not because it's not substantial and challenging (it is), but because it's just so much fun.",
    "Take this course! I had heavy experience with orchestral coming into this class and really wanted to learn more about opera, and this was the perfect course. Tomlinson is an incredible lecturer. Homework is light, usually some fairly easy reading and watching an act of an opera. I too saw the earlier reviews where people complain about Tomlinson's grading. I think he's a fair grader (I'm expecting about an A-\/B+ in the class based on my first couple essays), and during the essay writing process he is always available to talk to. I actually feel like my writing has improved from his commentary. He's very insightful, and knows his stuff.",
    "If you are interested in opera even a little bit, regardless of whether or not you've ever seen one, you will probably love this class. I certainly did! Professor Tomlinson is enthusiastic, engaging, and incredibly knowledgeable. Lecture was always a treat. (Don't miss a class if you can help it!) The workload was reasonable as well, with weekly readings and operas to watch and re-watch, and just three papers over the course of the semester, all fewer than ten pages in length. This means, of course, that they each factor in a lot to the final grade, but there's always the option of taking the class Cr\/D. Take good notes in class - mine were very helpful when writing the papers.",
    "Like opera? TAKE THIS! This course does not go in depth into any particular opera, and this course most certainly does not require anything more than a general understanding of musical form and music theory. The reading is fantastic, the operas are incredible, and you will come out of this course overflowing with knowledge. The essays are short and rather manageable."
