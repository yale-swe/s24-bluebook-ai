    "The homework always too longer then I thought it would but there wasnt so much of it that I felt over burdened all the time. At times it was unclear what you were looking for and took a group of us to figure it out. For the final project it would have been helpful to have examples of a balance sheet and Income Statement that had more then just a few accounts on them (or were we supposed to consolidate the accounts for those documents?)",
    "Excellent course and instruction",
    "I could have used more homework assignments in the second half of the semester to cement my understanding and practice of the topics such as depreciation and payroll. The homework assignments before the midterm were very helpful in doing this.",
    "I thought most of the assignments were good, but I thin the final would could be streamlined. If we were all given an excel file with tabs for each of the accounts for the ledger with the name, #, and starting balance in it it would have saved HOURS of tedious time (and silly data entry errors) that didn't actually teach us anything.",

Jeff's willingness to reply to our e-mails about ANY classes at any hour of the night is appreciated - his generosity did not go unnoticed.",
    "The instructor welcomes questions both in and after class, which is very helpful and highly appreciated.",
    "He went above and beyond to make sure I understood the material. Also, very good at making himself available especially with his other work demands."

    "I feel like I learned a lot. I may not use this knowledge for a while but I am sure when I am in a position where I will be looking at financial documents I have at least have the vocabulary to basic knowledge for what I will need as a TD&P.",
    "What I learned in this class had huge ripple effects in my understanding in other classes, especially Theater Organizations. This was a huge gap in my learning before Yale, and I am very thankful to have these basic principles under my belt now - I'm not sure how I operated without them before.",
    "My knowledge in accounting that I gained in the past contributed greatly in this course. It's exciting to learn more about the actual process of making the Income Statement and Balance Sheet on top of that.",
    "While I struggled with the material I actually gained a lot from the class."
