   "comments": [
    "I gained significant knowledge of the history of science as well as knowledge about historical methodologies.",
    "I learned about some of the important works in the history of the history of science as well as where modern conversations in the field have been heading. I found this course to be very useful for situating myself in the field at this moment and understanding a bit more about what kinds of conversations I would be coming into if I were to publish an article on these topics.",
    "This course did truly give me a better understanding of the issues\/themes at stake in history of science as a discipline - not only at this moment in time, but also since the field has been founded. I was given the space to both take these ideas as they were as well as think about how they are relevant to my work and interests.",
    "The level of conversation in this course was always high and Debbie came to class with such insightful and challenging questions for us to work through alongside the questions we developed on our own. Professor and students worked collaboratively to maintain and build on certain overarching questions about the status of objectivity, developing a stranger's account, and shifting definitions of science\/pseudoscience\/parascience throughout the semester. The syllabus was extremely well-organized, in the sense that it felt like we really were actively building on our conversations each week and incorporating previous conversations into each new text we encountered. This should obviously be the goal of any graduate level course, but I thought that this was actually achieved and well-executed in Debbie's course."

   "comments": [
    "This was an excellent course. My only suggestion is to explicitly address what methodology means to historians as early on as possible, since there seemed to be a fair bit of confusion among the students about this.",
    "I think the course was especially useful where it engaged with the current conversations and concerns of the field, and the history that led to those concerns. I did not always understand why we read certain works and not others, although clearly this is partly a function of limited time.",
    "I think that the overall structure of the course was really wonderful - I liked that we were reading several pieces of books or articles for each week, rather than just one book a week as I think it gave our discussions more depth, but I will say that there are some more \"classics\" in the history of science that I feel like we should have read and discussed and I would have liked to have done that as well.",
    "Read Kuhn."
