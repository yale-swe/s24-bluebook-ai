    "Anth 419 is an amazing class. Every reading, every session blows your mind. But there is a LOT of reading, so don't take it unless you're willing to read at least 200 pages per week, and actually read them.",
    "ANTH 419 is a critical look into all aspects of public sphere theory. You'll study linguistics, anthropology, ethnography. You get out what you put in. You can choose to do 12 precis (1,000 word critical assessments of the reading, due each week on Mondays at 9 am) and automatically get an A (not as easy as it sounds but also not as bad as it sounds) or you can do 10\/12 and write a term paper. But really, I did the 12 precis option and I felt like I learned a lot about how to synthesize really complex arguments and interpret them. As an English major, I felt like I'd gotten starts on this kind of thing from English, Lit and History classes -- but really, learning it from this perspective made me feel like I got an important part of my education.",
    "It was a mind-blowing, eye-opening experience. I've yet to take a course at Yale that has questioned the very foundations of the nation-state framework that we operate with today, to question its origins, explore its implications and expound on its potential future. If you are interested in an intellectual, academic journey, this is the class for you. Take a look at the syllabus, it's dynamic! Professor Bate is brilliant, wonderful and very engaging. He is a wonderful discussion leader and his responses to questions are always thorough. The one potential draw-back is that this course involves a lot of work. One has to submit a response paper every single week. But it is soooo worth it. First off, you actually learn to digest academic work a lot better, you learn to summarize this work and critically analyze it. The response papers facilitate discussion and it's great to get feedback.TAKE IT!!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a good amount of work, but important and well chosen readings make for good discussions.",
    "It's somewhat irrelevant now, because this is the last year Prof. Bate is teaching at Yale and without him, this course will never be the same, but - course is fantastic. If you've never taken a class on language before, this is a great one to take. Has very interesting readings. Hopefully you get a class that has good discussions - can really make the course.",
    "Definitely. Especially because it allows one to compare public sphere theories from around the world.",
    "This class has been one of my favorites at Yale. If you like thinking about society and the ways that people come together to create communities through language, you just have to take this. Even if the other kids in the seminar suck (unlikely), Prof. Bate makes it all worthwhile.",
    "Definitely. A non-stressful but intellectually provocative course.",
    "The class studies the relationship between languages and societies, between public and private, between ethnicity\/nationhood and vernaculars. But it goes far beyond these dichotomies, engaging with Hannah Arendt, Watsuji and Heidegger's influence in Japanese thoight, and the development of the Sanskrit cosmopolis in pre-modern India.Next year Professor Bate is adding China and its social imaginary to these topics, and I am sure that this class will become even more (if possible) appealing to those students who wish to learn about languages, nations, public sphere and their links.",
    "yes",
    "I recommend taking this class to anyone who is interested in linguistic anthropology or sociolinguistics. It is a great WR credit and the information is very applicable to other courses in sociology and political science."
