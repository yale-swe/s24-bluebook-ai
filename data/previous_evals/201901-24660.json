    "I really learned a lot about the hallmarks of good risk communication, both in terms of crafting messages as well as evaluating communication from others.",
    "Main learning was damage control for corporations during times of crisis. Risk communication seemed secondary.",
    "I learned about how people conceive of risk and what the best strategies are for communicating risk to different audiences. The class has a heavy focus on communicating environmental disasters and other crises to those affected by those disasters, from the perspective of a government administrator or a company executive.",

    "I really felt that the more interactive aspects of the course were the most valuable, for example practicing crafting an opening statement for a public meeting, and watching and critiquing videos of existing communications. I think more of those elements should be incorporated into the course going forward. I don't really feel as though there were any weaknesses with the course! I really enjoyed it.",
    "Andy is a practitioner, which is really helpful. However, the course could easily be condensed into half a semester course.",
    "The course is very laid back and I enjoyed Andy's teaching. I really enjoyed his use of videos and clips to illustrate communications. Those videos were great teaching tools, because they illustrated the concepts we were learning and showed them applied to \"real-world\" scenarios. We also tied in the themes we were learning to current events, like the Boeing accident. The course could be improved by expanding the definition of risk communications to other circumstances - both from the communicator and the audience side. For example, it would have been interesting to explore how best to communicate risk from a colleague to a colleague, or a student to a school administrator."
