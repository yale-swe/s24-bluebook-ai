    "PSYC 270 is a neuroscience lab course. Every session is split between an hour or two of lecture and two to three hours of lab. Lectures are boring, and I'll admit that it's hard to pay attention, but you can keep up with the material by doing the readings and asking Professor Donegan lots of questions (which he loves). The lab portion of the class is really interesting, and it forces you to really appreciate the foundations of neuroscience. I recommend this class to anyone on the neuroscience track in psychology. You have to take either this or Greg McCarthy's research methods lab to fulfill a requirement, and this is by far the easier option. I've heard that Professor McCarthy's is more engaging and exciting, though, so it depends on what you're looking for.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 270 to neuroscience majors pursuing a BS. It is a reasonable workload, and it really teaches you how to think critically. Rather than just memorizing facts, you will come away with an ability to think critically and skeptically. The labs are really informative and a great supplement to the lectures. They are a really great way to learn all of the concepts. The class really encourages you to discover the principles of neuroscience on your own rather than just memorize something the instructor says.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 270 to another students looking to fulfill the research methods requirement for neuroscience. The workload for this course is very minimal. There are only two exams and a final paper. The first half of the class every week is lecture-based and the second half is lab-based. Professor Donegan is very nice but he is not too engaging.",
    "This class is basically a requirement for psychology majors in the neuroscience track - my recommendation would be to take it sooner rather than later. The lab component is deeply interesting, but a lot of this class will feel like review if you've taken other neuroscience courses here (especially neurobio).",
    "The class was well-structured and taught, and topics built well on each other through the semester, starting with the introduction to neuroanatomy and experimental techniques. It was interesting to be given the chance to learn how to acquire data from different experimental preparations and approach findings with a critical perspective. The notes for each experiment were helpful outlines and provided the information needed. I would make sure to speak with Professor Donegan at office hours, to make sure you understand the topics using the right concepts, before experiments become more complicated.",
    "I didn't really enjoy this course. The first section with the sheep dissection was fun, informative and felt useful. But after that, I wasn't really sure what I was supposed to be learning about or what experiments I was conducting. It felt more like a class about animal neuroscience than about research methods. In fact, I learned very little to anything at all about how to design a study, how to collect data, or how to conduct research overall. The tests were pretty fair, but the lab reports were often tedious and it was hard to determine what Professor Donegan was looking for. The labs themselves were also pretty long and boring. But Professor Donegan really cares about his students and the class and will help you with whatever you need.",
    "I would not particularly recommend Psyc 270 to another student. I was under the impression that behavioral neuroscience would be about studying brain function and behavior on a more macro scale, but instead we ended up studying action potentials a lot and learning about the different factors that could affect it (e.g. external potassium concentration, temperature, etc.) I therefore didn't feel like I ended up learning a lot about behavior, or at least not on the scale I expected to. The way the course was structured a lot of the learning was also self-directed and knowledge was supposed to be acquired by thinking about the mechanisms that might explain the results obtained in different experiments throughout the course. I didn't particularly enjoy this kind of learning process, because I oftentimes felt like I was left in the dark or guessing about what mechanisms could explain my results. It also felt like we didn't go over the labs enough in class, and when they built on each other, I felt like I had still not acquired enough information to completely understand the next part, which was really frustrating. Other than that though, Professor Donegan is a good professor. He really cares about what he's teaching and about getting us to think in an analytical way, and frequently made himself available for office hours. I just didn't personally like the way the course was structure. Overall, I would recommend this course if you're on the neuro track and want to learn more about action potentials and behavior on a more micro level. However, I wouldn't recommend the course if you have other interests, and if you are more interested in another subject for your research methods course. Even if it's not neuro, you could discuss that option with the DUS.",
    "It was a intro research methods course where you learn a variety research method practices. The first third of the course is about the anatomy of the brain. The second third if about electrophysiology. The final third is about the actual neurological research practices with animal models.",
    "Well-organized course about an engaging subject matter. Very approachable professor and TF. Uncooperative annelids."
