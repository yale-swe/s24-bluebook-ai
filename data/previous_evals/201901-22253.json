    "how to read early music notation, history of renaissance music",
    "Early music is such an interesting topic and is often really hard to come to grips with unless you have a professor as wonderful as Grant.",
    "Learned some repertoire from the 10th-16th centuries.",
    "I learned a lot about the middle ages and about baroque music. I learned how to swing in strange meters and my sight reading\/singing improved.",
    "learned about early music and learned how to sing it",
    "I was able to learn how to play baroque guitar. It improved my music reading abilities greatly and I was able to develop an ear for early music. It also taught me a great deal on how renaissance music was composed as well as the techniques used in their composition.",
    "I learned so mch about early music and theory!",
    "I learned a lot about medieval and renaissance French music and how to perform it.",
    "How to read early music notation and understand the underlying theoretical system",
    "Improvisation skills reading in different clefs music history",
    "Learned how to play viola de gamba! Also learned about early music forms and stuff",
    "I gained much deeper knowledge of the theoretical and practical underpinnings of the performance of early music. Learning concepts like the Guidonian hand and the origins of the solfeggio syllables was particularly fantastic! I also was able to learn the lute, which was abso-lute-ly wonderful.",
    "Never having played the viol before, I learned SO MUCH! I can honestly say that it changed my playing of modern music for the better as well, which is very exciting. I also came out of this course with a genuine and stronger love for Early Music, which I feel much more confident in now.",
    "I was taught the early developments of my instrument, and thus how to perform in era playing. We learned the techniques of French medieval music."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is incredibly fun if you are a musician. The fundamentals of early music are important for a musician of any era.",
    "I felt that we did not have sufficient sectionals, and did not spend nearly enough time on diction\/pronunciation. People were not forced to take down pronunciation notes, and thus, there was an inherent limit to how good we could ever sound as an ensemble no matter how many times we ran a piece.",
    "It is fun, could use more work just to keep the things I learned on my mind during the week.",
    "I wish we did more in-depth analysis of the pieces. It felt a little too elementary at times.",
    "It is a great practical course that allowed me personally to improve my reading abilities. The course might sometimes study pieces that do not have readily available transcripts for guitars specifically and that might have been challenging. It is however a fun and instructive course. The music we play is simply beautiful.",
    "A lot of fun",
    "This is a really great class that accomplishes all it sets out to do.",
    "The strengths are the enjoyable social atmosphere and direct demonstrations of ideas being taught",
    "Unusual music for a classical musician: good exposure to different repertoire. Not very organized. I wish we had known the full concert program before we started the semester, so we could have rehearsed more efficiently.",
    "Strengths- everything Weaknesses-some of the sopranos sound bad and weak, I think w need some better ones. Also I think the new viola de gamba players should have more rehearsal\/lesson time or should get to practice outside the class. Also maybe split more time between singers and instruments, I think we get accomplished that way instead of waiting for the singers to perfect things\/vice versa. But it is overall great!",
    "The course's great strength is that Grant Herreid manages to assemble so many students to what might otherwise be considered a very niche course by making it accessible, open, and entertaining, but also focused, informative, and precise. The organization of the TA was also impressive, and highly necessary (with a large group of students, there's always a someone who forgets their music and needs a helping hand). It is also a great testament to Grant Herreid's dedication and generosity that he is willing to spend many additional hours beyond the official course time teaching students a variety of early instruments.",
    "We ended up spending time on learning more material than what we performed. While it was lovely to get to learn more tunes, I felt it took time away from preparing for the final concert. That being said, I felt that the pieces we learned were well contextualized, and it was clear the Professor had a deep passion for the material.",
    "Perhaps the course could meet more than once a week in reduced times."

   "comments": [
    "A great credit: relaxing, not too challenging, and a lot of fun!",
    "If you have singing experience and want a fun, easy, low-commitment class, absolutely take this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a student who loves to sing and has at least some working knowledge of theory\/sight-reading.",
    "If you want an easy credit and want to learn some interesting rep, then this is a good class. But if you are looking for a challenge or for high-level music making, this will probably leave you disappointed.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in music, this is a great course.",
    "yeah totally! If you are interested in singing\/playing early music then this is the perfect class for it. You get to see very cool instruments",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in early music.",
    "Yes! Such a great and unique class to take",
    "Yes",
    "Take this class. You really won't regret it. No matter which semester you take it in, you will learn something new and have a blast while doing it.",
    "This is my favorite class at Yale.",
    "Yes! I thoroughly enjoyed it & its a very different learning experience than what Ive had in other classes. Its a hidden gem",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to performing early music.",
    "You are stupid if you are a musician and don't take this course. Take it as a fifth or sixth or seventh credit. It's one of those easy courses where you don't need to put in much work to get an A but you come out learning a ton! One of my fave parts of Yale!",
    "This is a really brilliant course. It may seem very niche at first glance, but anyone remotely interested in music can have an excellent time learning from Grant. You have the opportunity to learn more about a subject that you don't often encounter, to learn a new instrument, and to work towards a performance at the end of the semester. I really can;t recommend this course enough!",
    "Yes! I had such a wonderful time learning the viol. I would recommend it to any cellist.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned the many values of the origins of the stringed instruments. The difficulty and the variety that the early discoveries have enforced into the modern day instrument is fascinating."
