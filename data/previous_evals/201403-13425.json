    "Yes take it I have already told a bunch of my friends they would love it, this is the type of class that all sorts of people can enjoy and get something out of and sarah really lets you make projects that explore your individual interests.",
    "Awesome",
    "Learn about how to shoot, edit, analyse video",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Fav class at Yale so far. Learn how to work a camera and edit videos! practical and fun skills! yay!",
    "Definitely take it if you've ever been interested in making video art or even short narrative film, and definitely take it if Sarah is teaching!",
    "If you're interested in experimental \/ art video, this course is the end-all be-all (which is good, considering it's really the only course in its areaexcepting perennial offerings in Film Studies). Prof. Lasley is great, and you'll walk away with a significant knowledge of the history of art film, the techniques of digital filmmaking, and your own practice and interests as an artist.",
    "Wonderful summary! I recommend it to anyone who's interested in video art. Give me my grades now",
    "The clich that a passionate teacher can make any subject interesting might not apply, since youtube.com doesnt really need a professor to make it fun. Yet that watching and making video is our generations pastime is only part of the reason this class is worth taking; the other is Sarah Lasley, who lives for this medium, and is dedicated to teaching how to rigorously and intellectually critique and create. In her 12 or so years in video (shes still young & cool), she has learned how to grasp and express the conceptual and formal crux of a piece with clarity and humor. Her background is in video art, but she has integrated pop cultural artifacts into her curriculum (and her work, which you should google), and treats a music video destined for VEVO with the same analytic rigor as something meant to be watched in an art gallery. That said, Sarahs primary aim isnt to help you launch your web comedy series or make your friends music video (she will with convincing). This is still an art class. She will challenge you develop a comprehensive method of evaluating any video on the web, and to make work thats complex and self-aware. Even though this class was introductory and full of non-majors simply interested in video, I saw the highest level of discussion and creation thus far at Yale, and Im a major in my third year. The high quality of the work produced in the class produced reflected a desire to make video from the start, which only strengthened over the semester with Sarahs influence. While lots of classes lose steam, this one built up. Youll want to stay after class time and the semester to continue the discussion, and shell make herself available to do so."
