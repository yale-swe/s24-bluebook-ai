    "I would recommend taking BENG 467. The class moves at a fast pace, but you learn a lot and the workload is not too high. You will have the opportunity to choose a novel project related to systems biology to work on an present.",
    "A good introduction to the field of systems biology and its possibilities. Although we were faced with a number of logistical issues this semester, especially with the snow cancellations, Professor Levchenko is a great (and sometimes hilarious) guy, and created a comfortable environment where we could learn about fairly complex processes in a manner that made sense. He and the TF were very supportive, especially on the final project, and if you do decide to pursue the field further.",
    "If you are interested in Systems Biology a worthwhile class to take. There is not a ton of work, and a great BME elective.",
    "This class is an interesting introduction to systems biology, though it can be a bit disorganized at times. If you don't mind that, this class is definitely worth taking. Professor Levchenko is great and his lectures cover a variety of interesting topics over the course of the semester."
