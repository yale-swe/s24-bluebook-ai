   "comments": [
    "If you are looking for a Sc credit and are willing to put in time reading and memorizing information, then take it. Its very doable.",
    "This class has little to no homework, but is an eternal struggle to memorize hundreds of vocabulary terms and concepts.Be prepared for semi-boring lectures\/powerpoints.I find the topics somewhat interesting as a geology major, but I do not find it to be a \"rocks for jocks\" class.Danny Rye is great.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to both science majors and non-science majors alike. Provides an excellent introduction to a topic few Yalies bother studying but very important in understanding our natural systems and climate.",
    "This class covered really interesting material but lectures tended to be pretty dry and thus difficult to pay attention to. The work load is pretty light and tends to be one the most interesting aspects of the class. I'm glad I took this class, but I'm not sure that I would tell friends to take it unless they were already interested in Geology.",
    "The class itself is not the most exciting, but Professor Rye is super nice and genuinely cares about the subject and his students. If you find the material interesting, it might be worthwhile. But if you are looking for a gut or a really engaging science class, look elsewhere. This class is meant for people with an interest in the material.",
    "If you're interested in a broad foundation for further study of climate science or geoscience, this is a good one - it covers a great deal of material in many different formats and a relatively short time. Make sure, though, that you're prepared to take seriously a lot of detailed mineral identification, map drawing, etc.",
    "There is A LOT of memorization involved.",
    "Geology and Geophysics 110 01 was the most influential class I have ever taken. If you know you like Earth Science, like me, and know its what you want to do, this is the class that will either strengthen that desire or shatter it. For me, it made me yern to go to college and learn more. This class made my previous dream a reality. I would truly recommend it for anyone who has any interest in our Earth.",
    "I would only recommend this class to a prospective Geology major. Anyone looking for a science credit should consider other classes. The lectures are very long and not inspiring or engaging. There is so much material covered, which makes it difficult to understand things without getting lost. The tests are quite difficult and require a LOT of memorization.",
    "NOOOOOOO. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. IT CONSISTENTLY MADE ME SOOOO ANGRY; I PROMISE YOU IT WILL BE BAD FOR YOU MENTAL HEALTH."
