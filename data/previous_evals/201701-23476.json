   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about how fine-grained and difficult urban politics is. A masterful politician has to balance a whole host of different and often competing interests.",
    "I learned how social changes can begin at the city level.",
    "Mayor DeStefano has very clear learning points for the class. He constantly links back to the importance of social capital and legitimacy to civic life and action. These insights are grounded on his twenty-year long experience as Mayor of New Haven. I definitely came away with a better appreciation of New Haven's history and current social and economic context, especially on issues of immigration, policing and the Yale-New Haven relationship. We also read urban theory texts from Jacobs, Mumford and so on.",
    "I learned a lot about true leadership in this course and how to bring out the best in people and groups. I learned about the very difficult choices cities must make in areas like policing, housing, etc. and what's at stake in these conversations--morally, socially. I really highly recommend the course -- mainly because it is an absolute privilege to learn from Prof. DeStefano's experience.",
    "learnt a lot about the role of policy makers in the city and the way that citizens and the city interact with one another",
    "This course was particularly helpful in developing a robust sense of how complicated and intricate a city's decisionmaking apparatus is and how various players or interests factor in to achieve a set of aims. The recurring question \"what are we trying to do here\" helped build a clear sense of the aims of urban governance.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of cities (not only New Haven, but more generally cities' role in United States history) and the way that cities function. I also developed the skill of thinking critically about problems in New Haven, and I explored creative and pragmatic solutions to these challenges, always taking the time to weigh a gradualist versus idealist approach.",
    "What it is like to have to apply academic learning and intellectual debates into real-life situations where, unfortunately, not everything is possible. But where one can still retain values or guiding principles!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: DeStefano - a man with a wealth of political experience that had plenty of wisdom to share. He was a bit opinionated at times, but you have to respect his positions. Weakness: Not enough discussion. I wish we could have engaged in more debates. If this is hard to foster (which it always is) Destefano could opt for more of a lecture format, because he really does have a lot of nuggets of wisdom to share.",
    "At times, it was mostly DeStefano talking and students didn't participate as much. DeStefano is good at connecting with his students and drawing them into the conversation.",
    "Weaknesses: Class discussion wasn't always the most engaging. The discussion didn't always refer back to the readings, sometimes because of the agenda set by the professor and also because not everyone seemed to have done the readings. Strengths: Mayor DeStefano is someone who really knows New Haven and is experienced with politics. Even though class discussions may not center on the readings, you still get takeaways about the city and politics. The road trip to Fair Haven and meetings with community organizations was an amazing opportunity to understand the city and immigration better too.",
    "Strengths: Great course setup\/syllabus. The way we move through topics really makes sense. I really appreciated Prof.'s focus on core values: social cohesion, social capital, legitimacy of institutions. REALLY appreciated his stories about the actual work of governance and how you CREATE cohesion\/capital etc. through leading in a certain way. Sometimes prof Destefano was self-deprecating about talking too much about himself, but honestly I think that was probably the most valuable part of the course. Weaknesses: I wish the readings were better. Many are simply newspaper articles\/or popular books for general audiences about various issues though there are a few really good readings --e.g. the New Yorker article about the urban drug market in New Haven\/elsewhere. DeStefano should maybe ask some of his colleagues (academics) what better books to assign might be.",
    "more group work - it was interesting to learn about other peoples' hometowns the readings were really interesting - keep those",
    "This is an excellent course. The one change I would recommend would be a more charitable case for urban renewal alongside all of the criticism of it. Yes, it was bad and hurt a lot of people, but the classroom discussion of it faltered because there was no defense of it being made, in the texts or in the class.",
    "I found learning from Mr. DeStefano to be an enjoyable experience. As a former politician, he brings a fresh perspective to the course subject material that you can't find with other Political Science professors at Yale. He is pretty frank with this students, and often states his opinions as facts, but I found that he was pretty receptive to students staying they disagreed with him. Another strength of the course is the breadth of material that we cover, ranging from policing, to immigration, to education. One weakness of the course that I think could easily be changed is the amount of class time dedicated to discussion versus listening to Mr. DeStefano speak. Although I found his to be a very engaging professor and speaker, I think it would have been helpful to have a little more time for members of the class to go back and forth between each other discussing the readings. For example, it was really helpful to break into those smaller groups a couple times to synthesize the readings.",
    "John DeStefano is an excellent lecturer and is also very frank and prepared to engage in discussions about New Haven. If you are interested in this city, take the course. However, the readings sometimes felt either unnecessary or superfluous. Maybe classic 20-page academic articles that better illuminate the topic, accompanied by short introductory lectures at the start of class, would be better than long reports or short news articles. The long reports were informative, but perhaps suggested selections from them would have made certain weeks more manageable."

   "comments": [
    "YES take it. DeStefano was mayor of New Haven for twenty years! He has a wealth of experience on the ground that few in this city can claim. He is very opinionated and his grading is really really tough...but I learned a lot from the course. The bad grade was totally worth it! Take the class :D",
    "Yes! It's a nice way to learn about issues related to New Haven from someone who grew up and lived in the city. The field trip to Fair Haven and seeing the community through his eyes was a very interesting experience! The downside is that the classes can get a little dry and he could overtalk a bit.",
    "Take this class DeStefano is the definition of a people's champion, despite harboring some slightly dated views on certain topics. That said, he listens, digests feedback, and is willing to change is mind (if you can convince him to). A great guy, and, broadly speaking, a political genius.",
    "YES highly.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, and the opportunity to be taught by one of the finest recent historians and change makers in New Haven today.",
    "yes. you will learn a lot from john de stefano and your peers in this course",
    "This was an excellent course that built a deep knowledge base about new haven issues and connected them to broader urban policy theory and planning theory. Lots of reading Jacobs, Caro, Mumford, etc, and lots of discussions with Prof. DeStefano that start with \"when I was mayor...\" Those discussions are, in some ways, the best part of the course, so listen up when that happens.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in municipal policy. The class exposed me to many subjects related to the theme of running a city government and I couldn't be happier that I got to take a class like this from someone like Mr. DeStefano, who has the experience of running New Haven for twenty years. The readings can be pretty heavy, but are usually fascinating, as they relate to the place that we call home for four years.",
    "Yes! If you can get in.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, would 100% recommend. No bullshit in this class - everything was honest, direct, and to-the-point. DeStefano is completely up-front about the triumphs and regrets of his administration, and is willing to engage any conversation topic. Papers are on current systematic problems in New Haven (and Yale) and you will learn so much about not only the history of this fantastic city, but on the numerous ways people have fucked it up, and on how it could be fucked up less in the present. This course reminded me why I love New Haven, and is a must-take for anyone interested in urban planning or city government."
