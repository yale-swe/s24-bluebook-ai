   "comments": [
    "ENGL 114 is a must. If you feel like you are not the strongest of writers, like me, then this is the course for you. It will teach you how to write and how to think. It will certainly be a highlight of your Yale experience.",
    "I would recommend engl 114 ways of living to another student. It is both an interesting and fun course to take. You will learn a lot and have a lot of in depth conversations during class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although this section requires a lot of work, the benefits from taking this class reach far beyond just this class.",
    "Absolutely. Ways of Living is an odd topic for a class, but most of the emphasis is on writing\/argumentation skills, not on specific topics. The readings are obscure but minimal. Prof. Cornelius is EXCELLENT- calm and collected, very encouraging, and very accessible. All in all a great English class for anybody.",
    "English 114 is a great course in developing and refining writing style for academic work. While there are different subjects. The focus is on writing and argumentation. Definitely take this class if you want more confidence in your writing.",
    "ENGL 114 is a great introductory writing course that heavily emphasizes the basics, for example, the structure of an argument. The workload is manageable and through the four essays, you really become a better writer."
