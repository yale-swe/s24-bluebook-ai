   "comments": [
    "If you're taking this course it's probably required. It is what it is and most of it will probably be review. Homework is long and exams are fair.",
    "No. I have learned all these things as undergraduate. I think most Yale graduates did.",
    "I would summarize that it is a survey class that covers vector calculus, ODE, PDE, and Linear Algebra, and complex analysis all in one class. It is fast and good as a review for people who have seen the material before.I would recommend this course to other students, because the materials covered in the class should be basic knowledge for graduate engineering students.",
    "Well....it's a REQUIRED course for PhD students. That means you always need to take it whether you like it or not. Generally I don't recommend taking it. If you have really good mathematics background, you don't need it because it is too easy; if you do not have and want to learn some math stuff, the subjects covered in this course are just too shallow.",
    "It's a great review class. Look at the syllabus before taking the class to find out how much work it's going to be given your background.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is basic maths and it covers a lot that could be applied in whatever research area.",
    "It's basically a survey course of a lot of engineering math including linear algebra, ODEs, PDEs, and complex calculus. I think it was a good refresher coming from a physics\/math background.",
    "Well, the way the class is now, it's definitely a useful class for most engineers in the sense that it provides at least a background in foundational engineering math. As I discussed above, adding a computing element would take the class from being a \"rite-of-passage\" type class in gaining background knowledge, to being something of practical value for future classes and projects.",
    "I will recommend the class",
    "ENAS 500is basically a fast-paced overview of all the math you probably will want to know and many things you'll probably never use (unless you are in a highly mathematical engineering discipline). I would not recommend it if you are not from an engineering background, but it is a good review if you are.",
    "Sure. The knowledge is helpful for all the engineering students.",
    "I would tell a student its a good survey of math concepts. I think it was taught well and would recommend the course& professor to a friend.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wishing to brush up some concepts or as an introductory math course for people who have not seen this kind of math as undergrad.",
    "This class covers all the topics that one may possibly need\/encounter in engineering. Much emphasis is placed on learning to apply a variety of methods to problem solving, as not one method necessarily better than the other. I would only recommend this course to people who are in engineering, as I do think that it is necessary for each engineer to have a grasp of the mathematics used to evaluate various physical phenomena.",
    "Yes",
    "ENAS 500 covered covers all (most) of the important mathematical topics for engineering. I would recommend all engineering and applied science to take the course since it will be useful more or less in all student's research.",
    "A review of undergraduate maths courses. I find maths courses always useful.",
    "ODE, PDE , EIGENVALUE\/FUNCTION, Matrix Algebra, beginning complex analysis up to Cauchy and deformation theorem.",
    "It is still not that useful for engineering students. Too many proofs and not enough example problems. Homework is often not assigned till right before exams. Exams are very long.",
    "It is a decent review of the necessary background, but don't expect it to be interesting."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Unfortunately, no.",
    "Because my background is in electrical engineering, I have seen about 90% of the material covered in the class. So to me, this class did not contribute much in terms of new material, but the materials covered are highly essential to my research.",
    "Honestly, this course does not really help me to deepen my knowledge. But it does help me to recall some knowledge I learned quite long time ago in myundergraduate year, which is good.",
    "Not that much.",
    "it contributed a lot.",
    "Honestly it was more of a foundational sort of thing than a class that will directly inform my research, but I think for many people (myself included) it will come in handy many times throughout their academic career.",
    "This course definitely helped me theoretically understand several important mathematical topics. While it went very fast through a ton of topics, providing at least that cursory intro should be fairly valuable in the future.",
    "The course deepened my knowledge of mathematics used in engineering. However, it did not contribute at all to my research.",
    "Use of expansions to solve diff eqns",
    "I don't feel that this course deepened my knowledge of my engineering discipline, but it did allow me to review some concepts that I had forgotten. One of my friends in the course was very helpful at explaining the concepts in a way that helped to deepen my understanding of the meaning behind the math, but I generally have a difficult time with math until it is put into some sort of context. At this point, the math I have learned has not contributed to my research, but it could in the future.",
    "Solving the differential equation is basic in engineering area. And the knowledge I learned from this course helps me to solve these kind of equations in different ways.",
    "I needed to review some linear algebra& complex analysis, mainly because what I had studied previously was more proof based. This course helped me practice problem solving effectively.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of my discipline by helping me see how to mathematically model some of the topics I am currently studying. I believe that it has provided me with the background necessary to seek after the resources I need to model my own work. It has only slightly contributed to my research so far, and hopefully it will be of more help down the road.",
    "Excellent",
    "The course is useful for my research. Mathematic is very important for all engineering and science studies.",
    "YesDifferent methods",
    "Math will always have an indirect effect on my research into nano energy techs. In particular, theory will be much more tractable because the methods in this class are fundamental to most numerical and statistical analyses."
