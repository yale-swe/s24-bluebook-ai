    "Every single Yale student, regardless of major or area of academic interest, should be required to take English 120. I transformed as both a writer and creative thinker in this class, and also felt like I was able to work through some personal issues of mine through the essay topics and themes that were discussed. It almost felt like a twice a week creative therapy session. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Professor Hopper is fantastic if you can manage to take it with her.",
    "DEFINITELY take English 120. I was very nervous, but it ended up being a phenomenal experience (just as I was told it would be). The structure of the class is great and really helps students learn about writing and then apply skills to their own writing. I would recommend taking the class with Dr. Hopper, as she creates a great classroom environment. Thanks to Dr. Hopper, each student was able to explore his\/her own writing style with the support and guidance of classmates. While she was sometimes very slow to return papers, comments were helpful and thorough.",
    "Hopper is amazing. Take this with her and you will be shocked at how your writing changes.",
    "English 120 is a really valuable class regardless of what you intend to major in. It gave me a lot more confidence in my ability to write essays, and the essays I wrote for the class represent some of the writing that I\u2019m the most proud of out of all the writing I\u2019ve ever done. The readings are fun and of manageable quantity, and the class involves a lot of writing but none of the essays were unpleasant to write. Professor Hopper creates an open, friendly atmosphere in her classroom which was great for critiquing each other\u2019s work. She is not the world\u2019s most engaging discussion-leader, but she is friendly and very conscientious, and did a great job of varying the structure of the class so that it never felt stagnant. She is definitely a good choice of professor to take 120 with.",
    "Totally. All the writing and revising is good for your soul. (The draft+revision structure is also nice if you, like me, are not usually the kind of person to complete and then revise a draft.) All the practice does help; I found myself writing with much more fluency by the last few essays. Meanwhile, the reading is a lovely change from the reading for other courses. Also, the last essay is shorter and more lighthearted than the other essays, which means that this class gets more chill at the precise point when all your other classes get more intense.",
    "English 120 involves writing 5-6 essays, each with a rough and final draft. You have about a week to write each essay, and everyone has at least one essay workshopped by the entire class. The course really did improve my writing, and I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially someone who isn't super confident in their creative writing abilities. I will definitely be able to apply the skills I learned in 120 to other areas and projects, and I am so glad that I decided to take the class."
