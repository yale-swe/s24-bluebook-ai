    "A fun, creative class that can really be what you make of it. I would highly recommend this class to someone who wants to try a different kind of work and is willing to do it on his or her own time.",
    "you make it what you make it, really chill, lots of great crit discussions, and lots of freedom for you to explore the sculptor inside of you, daphnie is so much fun and there are great resources including metal and wood working stuff thats definately available for ya",
    "Sculpture as Object is wonderful. As a non art major (and someone who has never really dabbled in visual art at all), I learned a ton and had a lot of fun doing it. The projects were wacky but always enjoyable. The workload is essentially what you put in, and how devoted you are to your work. Daphne is awesome, totally chill, and so fun to be around. I highly recommend the class if you want to dabble in conceptual art!",
    "I recommend this class to a student who is excited about having free reign to carry out their own ideas and is not intimidated or annoyed with a lack of teacher direction or organization. To someone that is confident in their own work and their ability to critique themselves.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. As a non-art major, this was an excellent opportunity for me to explore aesthetic ways of thinking and creating without committing having to go through hard technical training.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would highly recommend this course",
    "no.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student."
