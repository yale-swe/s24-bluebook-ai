    "I cannot think of any better way that I could have been taught on these concepts. Os and Mark did a fantastic job on using scientific literature and a fully interdisciplinary approach to engage us in discussions, direct us through the assignments aimed to apply the concepts. A weakness may be the organization of lab sessions, but I guess the logistics was embedded in the mixture of undergrads and grad students in the same class."

    "its an okay course but assumes a great deal of knowledge, and is not super well organized--most of the work is based on a group project and the amount you get out of this entirely depends on your TA--ours was terrible and we learned very little."
