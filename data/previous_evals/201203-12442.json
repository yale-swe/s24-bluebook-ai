   "comments": [
    "This is a great WR. Not really too much writing and the class itself is interesting. It provides a new perspective on history you've probably already learned. The tests are really straight forward also. If you're looking for a WR and don't want to step into the English department, I would take this class.",
    "Only take if you are deeply interested in topic, lectures themselves are not interesting.",
    "This class was fantastic! But, be sure you're interested in the topic. As a geology major, I found it eye opening and helpful. The readings are long, but usually hold your attention. The midterm was tough but fair. My only complaint is the fact it has a final and a final paper, but if you get a good start on the final paper (which they push you to do) it's not too bad. Take it if you're interested in environmental issues\/climate change and want a good foundation.",
    "I would recommend the course to any EVST major who is looking for some foundational knowledge before taking other course. Also, taking it at the same time as other environmental studies courses really helps to put everything in context.",
    "I would not recommend.",
    "The material can meander a little bit without following a clear path other than chronology, and the lectures are not very interesting. I would recommend this course to another student if they like participating in section discussions.",
    "I would recommend it, offers a lot of interesting and worthwhile material to learn about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "EVST 120 was a fantastic overview of Environmental History. You definitely take away an understanding of the major themes in US Environmental History with knowledge of the important events and names in this part of US Environmental History. The material itself is inherently interesting and Professor Sabin does a good job picking interesting reading materials and anecdotes for class. If you like the environment and you like history, then you should take this course.",
    "The class was great and I would recommend it to another students if they are interested in how the environment played a role and how it was influenced throughout history. Great class!",
    "I would recommend this class because the material was interesting, and the work load was not too heavy.",
    "Great class that glosses over really important aspects of history, you learn a lot and it is definitely not a waste of time. Definitely an intro class, so for this reason it works well as a starting point on the topic. I enjoyed writing the paper.",
    "Yes.",
    "Good overview of the general forces and trends that have created environmental problems and opportunities for improvement.",
    "EVST120 is a survey class on *American* Environmental History--not the environmental history of the entire world (although it can be argued that anything \"local\" in the environment is still part of a larger whole). If you're looking for a class that offers a broader look at global environmental change starting from prehistoric times, Global Environmental History with Professor Harvey Weiss is the class to shop."
