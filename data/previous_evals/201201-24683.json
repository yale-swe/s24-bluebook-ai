    "Great overview of basic structures. One of my favorite classes at Yale, and Prof. Moon is the coolest guy at this school.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course if a student is interested in the material. I would warn however that if you have a lot of math and physics background that it might be a little redundant or easy.",
    "A good sweeping introduction to how to think about buildings structurally. The focus is on statics which is pretty digestible, and it will help you conceptualize how structure should look on your own designs (if you are an arch major). If you aren't an architecture major, or seriously considering it, I wouldn't recommend the class.",
    "This course was a really pleasant surprise in the architecture major. Structures introduces you to all of those little details about architecture that we otherwise don't talk about in the major, like how do you make your buildings actually stand up? The material is accessible and Professor Moon is quite funny in creating scenarios for you to analyze. It's a lot of fun for a QR - some assignments have you building and testing your own simple structural designs. It's a good class for architecture majors to take, and non-majors can get something out of it as well.",
    "Fantastic class. Took it as a non architecture major with interest in architectureAlso a great science credit for non science people who like math and physics",
    "I would recommend it. It's tougher than other science\/math credits, but I felt like I really learned something.",
    "An overview survey - a lot of material, not too much depth. But it's good to know.",
    "It's a great class to get an overview of how structures work in relation to architecture."
