    "Incredible breadth of knowledge gained from this class. Not much detail but a broad overview of current biotechnologies.",

    "General overview of biotech techniques",
    "A lot of industry knowledge in the biotech industry",
    "The ability to talk about drastically different concepts from one lecture to the next. There is no fluidity in this class.",
    "This class was a great introduction to the business and the science behind modern biotechnology and their use in research and industry.",

   "comments": [
    "Amazing course, doesn't need to be changed",
    "It is rather disjointed. Because each professor does not watch the previous lectures so each one sorta starts fresh. Could be improved by having the professors all on the same page.",
    "I loved the guest lectures - there should be more of them! Section was a bit unhelpful as it was basically just a discussion of the papers.",
    "Great course, very interesting, amazing guest lectures.",
    "A huge weakness of the class is lack of organization. It is nice to have so many professors lecture about what they are interested in, but as a function of having multiple lecturers the class is really poorly organized. There were multiple times throughout the semester where both students and TAs just did not know what was going on with respect to which paper assigned for the weekly discussion section, to what the format or content of the exams would be. Definitely the organization of the class needs to improve.",
    "The main strength of this course is the diversity of topics taught, the main weakness is the lack of depth.",
    "It was kind of absurd that nearly every single lecturer\/guest was a white man - i feel like there is more representation of biotech in the world and it would be nice to see that in the classroom. It would also be great if the lecturers talked to eachtoehr at all so there was some kind of cohesive point to the class. I really liked sections because it showed how what we had learned about that week was applied",
    "I think the lectures could be more connected and well organized for guest lectures.",
    "This class has no strengths. It is run by a committee of professors and you dont go into enough detail in any of their lectures. You can never quite get a rhythm.",
    "The guest lectures were great and the array of topics was good but the different teaching styles was sometimes a bit hard to keep up with.",
    "strengths: yannick jacobs and joseph wolenski weaknesses: talking about $$ in biotech all the time",
    "Would love to see one woman in biotech in this course. The material could be interesting and engaging but I was honestly too confused with what was expected of us \/ the level of detail expected when concepts are being thrown at you on a superficial level and later tested like they pulled the exam out of a hat"

   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in biotechnology or medicine or biotechnology start up.",
    "Yes it is a good overview of biotechnologies. Just be aware that each topic does not fit with others.",
    "Yes, it is an excellent course that teaches a lot of the business-side of biology and technical applications of it.",
    "Absolutely",
    "This class has so much potential, but falls somewhat short. We definitely learned about some super cool things in biotechnology, and also got to learn more about the business side of biotechs. There were some really interesting guest lecturers which added a lot of value to the class. But the class is so disorganized. There were multiple times throughout the semester where students really had no idea what paper was required to read for the weekly discussion sections, and the paper would be emailed out a few hours before. There were no practice exams, and you essentially had no clue of what to expect for the exams. The same goes with the quizzes. Additionally, some of the professors had material overlap which sort of defeated the purpose of having multiple professors. I also feel like sometimes rather than learning about cutting edge biotechnology, we just ended up being sold on the research that whatever professor who was lecturing does. But overall the class was interesting, and a pretty solid way to fulfill the 350 and above requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course but only if you like variety over depth, because you'll learn a lot about several different courses, but you won't learn them in depth.",
    "This course is a very high level overview of biotech with an obtuse grading system, unclear what is on the tests or how the lectures go together, and mostly if not all white male profs which is just sad in terms of representation. If thats your thing, go for it. Ita not a lot of work but i have NO idea how i did so ya know ... this class has so much potential to be a truly phenomenal class but it just doesnt quite live up to it, but i do believe this could be an amazing experience",
    "Nope.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in science and\/or research.",
    "if you have to",
    "No. Do not take if not required. I learned absolutely nothing from the lectures and I went to every single one actually trying to learn. Just a complete mess of a course taught by men who should just stick to their respective technologies\/businesses."
