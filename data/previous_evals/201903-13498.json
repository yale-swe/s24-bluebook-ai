    "The Professor is incredible and cares about each of his students, the readings are enjoyable and the assignments are well thought out and really stretch your skills.",
    "I loved the course. The readings were fantastic and highly manageable. The discussions were incredibly well guided. The writing exercises were engaging and productive. The final project of writing a short story was the perfect culmination of the class.",
    "I loved the format of this class. We would read literature, and talk about how the authors choices could inform our own fiction, instead of analyzing symbolism and whatnot. The end of class when we were workshopping everyones stories was really fun and I feel like I learned the most about writing fiction from this portion. I did think, for the beginning of the class, that there were too many books assigned in too short a period of time. The short stories were by far the most helpful to read (because we were writing short stories), and I felt like the number of books could be cut in half.",
    "The strength was the clarity in which we learned about the basic elements of fiction. I also loved the workshops, which were really productive through Professor Sexton's leading questions and format, in which we each gave a suggestion for improvement and an area that we liked. One way to improve the class might be to cut down the reading a little bit. Sometimes when I read an entire book and we only had time to go over a couple elements of that book it was a little frustrating."

    "Yes! It is an enjoyable course. You can skate by doing little work but will get a lot out of the class if you put in the time.",

    "Yes! The course is amazing! Professor Sexton is fantastic! The readings were really great and the discussions incredibly engaging. You will learn so much about fiction and how to write it. It was a really rewarding experience.",
    "yea",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is an amazing class to take Cr\/D, and as a senior, I liked engaging with creative material and expression in a friendly environment. If writing fiction is something you have always wanted to try, go for it!"
