    "I wouldn't recommend taking it if you are pressed for time or plan on doing a lot of extra-curriculars.",
    "French 110 is pretty much what is to be expected of a beginning language class. There are both oral and grammar lessons. It is quite a bit of work each week, but if you stay on top of your lessons it is too difficult. The instructors are very easy to work with and I would definitely recommend taking it if you have any interest in this language.",
    "FREN 110 was a very great class. Professor Vysosias is a really great instructor. You finish the course with a good range of vocab and the ability to use different tenses. There is a big workload: a weekly test, weekly composition, daily homework, and a final - but if you're interested in learning the language take the course! It is a very fun class.",
    "French 110 is a fantastic course! The Yale French department is really one of the best in the world. The professors are all amazing (Vanessa Vysosias is particularly wonderful! Very sweet and kind!). I had heard rumors that L1 French was insanely work-intensive and was hesitant to take it, but in reality, the workload is not that bad. If you manage your time well, it's completely do-able. That being said, I wouldn't recommend taking this as a fifth class. You'll learn a huge amount in just one semester and it's a great experience!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you're truly interested in learning the language. You need to have a real desire to put in the time and effort to learn French. So long as that's true for you, it is a great course. You'll quickly learn and become comfortable and confident speaking French.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student. It requires a lot of careful listening and reading to get the vocabulary, but it was an enjoyable course."
