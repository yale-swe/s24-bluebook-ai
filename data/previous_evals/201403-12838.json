    "The workload for this class is really uneven. You get two solid hours of homework every single day during units where a novel is assigned, but otherwise it shouldn't take more than an hour\/day. I felt like I got better at grammar, writing, and reading by the end of this class, but my speaking skills haven't improved that much. There aren't too many opportunities to practice speaking during class. The grammar we covered is basically the same as L2.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. French is a beautiful language and the 130 program at Yale is really efficient, well taught, and well organized.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, as I feel like a much more confident writer, reader, and speaker of French as a result of having had it. It was extremely fun in addition to being incredibly rewarding.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to further enhance their knowledge of the French language.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes if you want to learn a lot of French fast and don't mind working hard to do it."
