    "Yes take it if you want to draw a figure that looks human",
    "A great class to learn about figure drawing. It's better if you have art background, but you truly dont need it, they work with you whatever level you're at. They will push you, so if you're not prepared for that then this is not the class for you, but if you're serious about wanting to improve wherever you're at, this is the class to do it.",
    "This is an ok course. It is mainly technical, and there's not a lot of opportunity to be creative until the very end. Although the course load is on the light side, you get much more out of it if you put more in, so don't take this course unless you plan on putting time into it.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone who both enjoys drawing and wants to improve.",
    "This is a great course and I'd definitely recommend it! The class is really enjoyable. You definitely get out what you put in. If you put in a lot work into the course, you'll improve a lot over the duration of the semester. Professor Villalongo is a great professor, and I'd recommend anyone to take a class with him!",
    "I would only if you love charcoal. And repetition. I did learn a lot about figure drawing through practice but had to go through some frustrating times in this class, so much so that it stopped being enjoyable about a few weeks in. But you do get to work with a real model, which is a huge plus."
