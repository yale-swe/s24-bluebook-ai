    "Take it if you are interested in analytic\/intellectual drawing and a lot of work.",
    "Only take this class if you really loveto draw or you are applying for the major. Victor is a great professor, you'll learn a lot from him. However, the assignments, especially towards the end of the year become more and more time consuming-they will take all week every week by the end. Its a great class to learn to sketch and present ideas like an architect, that said, don't take it unless you have to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for architecture students. It has a large workload which is why I would not recommend it to people not interested in architecture. However, it is a great class for those interested in architecture and teaches you how to really look at things and draw what you are seeing.",
    "Not an art class. Rigor before beauty.Take it too seriously and you won't have fun. Treat it lightly and you won't get anywhere. Yin Yang relationship going on here.Build good relationships with your TA's and you can't lose.Procrastination really hurts in this class, especially towards the end. Start early, don't get caught up in only producing finish drawings that are immaculate. Focus on the process, think about what you draw and why you draw it. DThis class is pretty expensive. Drafting supplies aren't cheap.",
    "I would recommend it only to students interest in pursuing the architecture major or who love drawing.",
    "This is a very intense drawing course. I would only recommend it to those thinking about the Architecture major.",
    "Only take if you plan to be an architecture major.",
    "Dear sophomores: Please don't do this to yourselves. You are a valuable human being with many years ahead of you, and many friends to make. Please don't cage yourself off from Yale so soon. You will be on the seventh floor until your eyes bleed ORANGE! You will only know two things in your life-- drawing and models. You will be a robot in that your livelihood will depend on how much you produce wek after week after week. Having said that, it was one of the best semesters of our lives. If you have good people in your year, and take as many guts as you can then it will be a blast, but DO NOT DO THIS!!! LOVE YOURSELF!!! But it is your decision... but MAKE THE RIGHT ONE AND RUN!!!!!!",
    "Expect the 10 hours per week and try to do the most of it; that's how you learn to draw.",
    "It\u0092s an intense course, as you will often hear. I love to draw and I don\u0092t mind staying up all night finishing a drawing or having to work over a single drawing for hours on end. The workload is quite heavy, but I believe that any student who takes this class can learn to enjoy perfecting their skills in visual representation. The TAs were incredibly friendly and helpful, but most of what you learn will be self-taught, or gleaned from your classmates during reviews. It was awe-inspiring to see everyone\u0092s progress throughout the semester, and you will get to know your classmates pretty well (especially during the weeks you have group assignments).One problem: the class shifted too drastically from mere visual representation to a synthetic form of analysis and conceptualization. It should be a more gradual learning experience that culminates in the final project (which I thought were in principle very appropriate to cap off the semester. But as usual, students were pressed for time, and were still uncomfortable with generating a compelling argument through their drawings within a short amount of time).Yet, as much as people complained about how certain assignments were pointless or tedious, I think you can make each assignment your own and just have fun with it. If you take the class, know that you are expected to produce a lot each week. But don\u0092t turn into a machine, just to get things done. Drawing is a skill you work on the entirety of your life. It\u0092s beyond the scope of a single class, so you\u0092re really taking the course as just another step in the process.",
    "Overall really liked it - workload was hard (10+ hours per week for me), but expected and manageable in comparison to other courses I've taken at Yale. Also, I'm slow and didn't have much drawing experience, so I'm sure some students got by with less. AND you're drawing, not grinding through a problem set or paper, so its hard to say that those 10 hours cut purely into work time. I felt like we had more helpful instruction from the professor and TAs than in the analytical model, and I really think my drawing improved by the end. They would give concrete, useful suggestions that you could incorporate into your next project, as opposed to the more vague, frustrating rambles you will receive in other critiques.Most importantly, you end the class with a gratifying portfolio of drawings that you put time into and can be proud of. So, I would recommend this class even for those not planning on majoring in architecture. I'm probably not going to do the major and took both this class and Petit's analytical model class out of interest\/just in case I had a change of heart, and in retrospect I wish I had taken this class and not taken the model class. It was fun - and if you want to take an art(sy) class at Yale this one is great if you don't already have natural abilities. I'm not a good drawer and I was able to produce some great projects.",
    "I would totally recommend, because it teaches you something that you never think of.",
    "It is an intense architectural, not figure drawing course. I would recommend this course to another architecture student. There is a right and a wrong way to draw architectural drawings, but there is also room for artistic, creative, interpretation. I enjoyed this class most of the time.",
    "This class is not a challenge to your intellectual abilities, if anything, it is a little bit of an insult. Victor has ideas about what drawing types (and architectural styles) are valid, and he prefers that you work within those parameters. That being said, you must must break these guidelines if you want critical feedback from the work. In a review for a huge class like this, only the interesting\/stunning\/different pieces get discussed with any depth or rigor. That being said, you need to have a reason to break the rules. Most people (myself included) did not always defend their bold choices well, in which case, you should have just done the assignment.This class is only difficult to schedule, not to find subject matter. The assignments are not challenging, the professor has low expectations, and the level of rigor is disappointingly low. However, it's a lot of work. A lot of time. It is difficult to see improvement, and the nature of most assignments is geared towards those of us who cannot draw at all, leaving the more experienced students bored. You'll spend a lot of time on drawings and yet, the reviews seem forced, mistimed, and disjointed.Make sure you get a good TA. If you feel there are better TAs than yours, GO TO THEM. Just go to both sections if you want to find the best TAs. In our year, there were clearly two more experienced and vocal TAs, and at the final review, it was clear which studentshad worked under the more rigorous (dare I say more talented) TAs.That being said, this class has a section and final, even though both are not scheduled with the registrar. This inevitably caused problems.It is a fun class. It won't kill you. The hard part in being critical is that everyone is so nice. Victor is a wonderful person if not yet an excellent professor. He is kind and understanding. All of our TAs were beyond kind, even if not ultimately that helpful. Good luck everyone! It's a good class, just know that you must work diligently on improving your weaknesses and do not rely on this course to push you too far--push yourself! Draw Draw Draw!"
