    "none to speak of, really",
    "The studio aimed to coordinate with a preliminary sense of techtonics. The organization was generally tight to the building. Landcape and planning were much less of a priority. This allows for open ended interpretation for the students and the teachers advised accordingly.",
    "I found that I could integrate much of what I was learning in my elective courses and prior requirements in landscape and structures into this studio project.",
    "There was an encouragement to take a rigorous approach to landscape as part of the formal concept, and these attempts were continually evaluated."

   "comments": [
    "the most valuable part of this studio was the pin ups with outside critics. especially as a form based studio, the expertise comes from individuals that all approach it differently. it was really helpful to get feedback from a broad range of individuals as each of the students worked very much in their own way, the unique view point of multiple critics gave us more to work with.",
    "desk crits were extremely valuable. pin-ups, especially the trip to new york tended to be less helpful and extremely energy intensive. it was nice to see the critic's office though.",
    "Pin-ups and desk-crits were equally valuable. I think we could have pinned up a few more times throughout the semester, as it would have helped pace how we developed our projects, even with outside experts."

   "comments": [
    "the studio as a pedagogical tool could have been different by incorporting more of a required digital approach as well as required means of representation. if the studio stuck to its interest on fabrication and digital tools, then we should be able to say i designed this with x program and plan to fabricate it with x technology. however, as the semester moved forward, that became more loosely designed and ultimately somewhat vague by the end.",
    "The written proposal for the studio was provocative and entirely appropriate as a pedagogical tool. The problems we encountered conceptually and spatially were perfect for the skills we all, as students of architecture in the 21st century, are being required to develop."

   "comments": [
    "my expectations for the studio was to focus on form and incoporate ideas from the bauhaus. i felt that i did this relatively well but wanted to be pushed further. i was expecting more from the instructors in terms of thinking about form differently and refering me to examples and techniques, however that failed to meet my full expectations.",
    "I hoped to further develop ways to attack a design problem and learn to become more facile technically and intellectually. The studio provided a good forum for this."

   "comments": [
    "I was shocked by the inability of Brennan Buck to teach or engage in the development of student's work on a critical level. More often than not his comments left at \"no\" , \"no that is not a good idea\", \"maybe\", \"ok maybe, I don't know\" even after probing for further explanation, is completely unacceptable at graduate level nor at the standard of education one might expect at such a prestigious institution. Presented to the studio as a digital resource, I was unimpressed with his inabilty to field student questions either generally or specifically and witnessed several occasions in which Brennan's suggestion was to instead ask the full-time student (in another studio), Ryan Welch, whom was not compensated at all for his generosity in subject matters thought to be Brennan's area of knowledge. Based on my experiences with Brennan, I would not recommend taking his studio to any other student. If I were to mention some kind of strength, I would remark at his ability to lend no design insight during the semester's one-on-one desk crits and express any manner of disappointments and inabilities of the student's during midterm and final reviews.His non-confrontational personality allows him to hide behind the authority of the jury panel which looks poorly on the school.",
    "the strengths of the studio head was being incredibly available and present to respond to our work, the weakness however, was an inability to look beyond the comfort zone of each student. it would have been better to get feedback that pushed the design beyond the students given strengths and suggest another specfic dimension of the work that pushed it beyond its predetermined potential.The assistant teacher was also very present and available but was often tentative about giving an opinion that differed from the main studio head."
