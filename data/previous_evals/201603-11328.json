    "I was able to investigate further into the complex process of utilizing reverse genetic approaches to uncover novel genes with potentially important roles for salamander limb regenerations. This was the semester that \"clicked\" for me, as all the techniques and steps started to paint one big picture where I could point out each protocol or step and tell the reason for it. Understanding it more comprehensively not only made the project compelling but gave me much more insight into the molecular biology field.",
    "Conducting research 20 hrs\/week at my lab this semester really gave me the opportunity to delve in depth to an individual project at the lab! I learned to take initiative in a research project at lab, working independently on many aspects of the project as well as gaining a better understanding of the background of my research topic.",
    "I learned how to write a grant proposal. As a prospective graduate student I think this is a very useful skill to have."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the program is that it allows the students to have a great research experience before pursuing a career in graduate or medical school. The weaknesses of the program is that the participants do not really interact until the end of semester presentations. If there is a general meeting at the start of the semester for everyone to meet or a midterm updates meeting or dinner would be great!",
    "Lots of time in lab. The two credits offers you an alternative to taking more classes if you are ahead in your major requirements and just want to focus on research. The requirements are easy, even though I think the end of term presentations were an unnecessary hassle. Most students were still in very preliminary stages of their projects, and attendance of the sessions was sort of useless considering there was really no time for discussion or a chance for any sort of elaborations and questions. Furthermore, many students were in very specialized research projects and it was a bit disorienting shifting through so many various topics in a single sitting."

    "I would definitely recommend the intensive major, since you get two credits per semester, so you don't have to take as many classes senior year. Plus, 20h\/wk is not as much as it seems, and to be honest you can't really get anything accomplished in the 10h\/wk you would do in the normal major, so you get a lot more out of working the extra hours. The only downside is it is difficult to schedule things because you're working 9-5 and you really have to try to schedule classes\/jobs\/extracurricular either early in the morning or in the afternoon so you don't have to go into lab then leave then come back. If you're willing to put in the work, I think it's really worth it.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend the intensive thesis. You are able to get plenty of work done in the 20 hours\/week. Your experience of course depends entirely on your lab",
    "Yes absolutely!",
    "Yes! Take this course! Especially if you plan on having a heavy semester or need to travel for interviews. Having the opportunity to work in the lab really gives a flexibility that just taking classes does not!",
    "If you are interested in attending graduate school, I think this is a good course to take."
