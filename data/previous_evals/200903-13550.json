    "Question 2: The readings for the class were quite helpful. They often covered aspects of a subject that we did not have time to discuss in lecture. My only complaint is that some of the readings are a bit out of date. Newer articles are available that could be used instead. Updating the readings is especially necessary for topics that have changed significantly since the economic recession.Question 6: The assignments for this course were very well-designed. Professor Gentry gave us freedom to explore topics that interested us, and he did not waste anyone's time on work that did not contribute to our understanding of the subject matter.",

For someone without a background in finance or law, this was a great introduction to these fields. I now feel much more confident when talking about the the legal issues that affect the topics I study.",

    "Nothing. This class was great",
    "Class participation\/interaction.",
    "too many readings and many of them not essential. i think if you assign fewer readings, people are more likely to actually do them. when the syllabus looks impossible, people just give up and don't read at all.",
    "I thought that in the latter half of the class, examples of applications of the various legal tools were not varied enough. They generally tended to gravitate towards climate change, alternative energy and land use.",
    "Update a few of the outdated readings (only a handful of articles, but should still be done each year.)",
    "Sometimes the lectures were not specific enough, with not enough examples. Also, the lecture slides often made very little sense and I would have preferred it if Prof. Gentry just talked to us instead of leaning so much on the powerpoint slides. His lecturing is really very good but the ppt brings it down.",
    "This course was so helpful for me, but class topics were little different from what I expected in advance from the course name. I considered this class would focus on financial issues, but in real focused on legal topics. So, it may be better to change the course name or not...",
    "- the way the course is taught. I found, more often than not, that the instructor was talking and there was very little class participation. Sometimes the lectures were long winded.- A few case studies describing the practical aspects of the concepts taught in class could have gone a long way.",
    "I think I found the course very interesting. however a little focused version of the course will help students to understand legal perspectives of organization, investment, natural resources more deeply.",
    "Too many readings, overwhelming.",
    "Better clarity on expectations for take home exams. Perhaps make them more structured, at least for the midterm. The concept of introducing students to the kind of work that analysts do via the exams is a noble one, but the course may be too large and diffuse to make realization of that goal practical.",
    "N\/A",
    "Use more current examples...less of the stuff from the 80s and 90s",
    "Break out sessions",
    "No suggestions.",
    "more discussion in class.",
    "There are some topics that are much better suited to fitting into what Brad wants out of the midterm and final paper than others. I think Brad and the TAs should do more to pull out who is not on the right track in their initial problem statement that we turn in at the beginning of the semester. I like that Brad wants us to explore things we\u0092re interested in, but I think there\u0092s a certain point where this stops. I chose my topic, but by the end of the semester, felt like I was forcing a square peg into a round hole to complete the final paper. I kept thinking that other topics would have allowed me to be more successful \/ coherent in writing my final paper and this should have been suggested to me earlier on. We knew what the final exam question would be early in the semester, but the problem was that we didn't know what we were going to cover up to that point.Longer running case studies could be helpful in pulling lectures together. Brad did a bit of this, but many become shorter anecdotes. Perhaps a larger case study (describing a deal involving a company (LLC orlimited partnership?) that\u0092s going into a deal (contracts) that involves carbon credits (property law) and real property assets (property law), and addressing investor risks therein \u0096 ETC ETC) \u0096 something like this that was referenced repeatedly could perhaps help bring the concepts together and allow students to see what Brad finds important about the transaction from a legal standpoint.",
    "I think the class could be helped by a discussion section that was not voluntary. I think it would be great to get people from SOM and FES talking about the issue of private investment in the environment.",
    "There should be more check-in and interaction throughout the course...only 2 assignments was too little to get maximum benefit. Maybe an every other week section would be good?",
    "The white slides with pure text and few pictures were hard for me to stay focused on. A lot of the subject matter is really dry, and I really need another educational tool other than lecture and powerpoint to understand it (more real-life stories, maybe videos or something).",
    "I think a few more assignments to keep us on track would have been better. Easy to get lost in all the material.",
    "The slides are so important but often provide repetitive information, could be more succinct in defining the legal tools more specifically.",
    "More analysis as opposed to text-book style lectures.",
    "I would have liked to see more assignments throughout the course to ensure that students indeed did pick up on the important concepts and ideas of the course, even before the midterm and final. There was a great deal of material covered. Sometimes I was not sure what was more important or more useful, or what issues I should keep an eye on regardless of their utility in my field. My schedule prevented me from attending the group TA sessions, which perhaps could have filled some gaps. In short, I was never sure of my progress in the course until after the midterm evaluation, and presently I am wondering if I have maintained my performance, since at the time of writing this, I have not yet read my final evaluation.",
    "more practical examples",
    "I think this course is rather useful for just about all F&ES students - understanding property and private investments is key to understanding society, how conservation works, etc. However, I think this course is an example of how many F&ES courses are either stretched or shrunk to fit to a 3 credit, semester-length schedule. In this case, I think the course would have been more effective, and ultimately useful and enjoyable, had it been half a term."
