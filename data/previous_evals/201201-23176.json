    "Yes--not way too much work, but interesting and chill.",
    "English 127 is a sweet class. You'll read a very wide range of things (from Walt Whitman to some current 21st century novels,) but each one is a pretty good read. It is more reading-heavy than writing-heavy as a course. Professor Berger is also great. Our section for some reason only had 5 students, but he still kept seminar interesting and high-energy. Knows how to relate to individual students well. If you want to take an English class, take this one!",
    "English 127 is a great introduction to American Literature: anyone would be interested by at least one of the texts on the syllabus and class discussions were often compelling and in-depth. The twice a week seminar format provided the necessary time for text analysis and discussion, but seminar was often repetitive and seemingly unproductive, the only progress being accounted for by new pages of reading for next class. In sum, I would recommend the course: the workload was manageable, the grading fair, and the texts\/ syllabus interesting. Prof. Berger is inviting and easy to work with and I would take another class with him in the future."
