   "comments": [
    "I learned how to think as a historian about questions of archive, sources, theory, and methodology.",
    "I feel like I have much greater foundational knowledge about different time periods and subjects in African American women's history. I find myself referring to things we've read and discussed outside of the classroom often. I also enjoyed familiarizing myself with the Beinecke.",
    "How to think critically about archive; general historiography of African American women; historical method; how to formulate critical historical questions; skills for being in the archive; how to have cross-disciplinary conversations.",
    "archival research, critical thinking, finding voice in classroom discussion",
    "The ethics of reading and writing about the archive of slavery. Black women's historiography. Intersectionality as an analytic.",
    "I developed knowledge on African American's history and women's history in particular, a field I had very little insight on before taking this course. I also gained skills in closely analyzing primary sources and learning to use archival sources intelligently. I specifically appreciated the opportunity to learn how scholars have approached studying histories of sexual assault that focus on African American women, especially in the wake of the Christine Blasey Ford hearings.",
    "A strong historiography in Black women's history (mainly political and sexual).",
    "This course was a great survey of African American Women's History that balances history and historiography. I feel like I am leaving with a good sense of the major thinkers, arguments, and methodological approaches within the field. It was a great course for both those with great familiarity with the subject matter and those who aren't specialists but are looking to get a strong introduction to the subject."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class is excellent, theres very little if anything I would change. The duration of a supportive classroom setting and the formulation of class presentations are part and parcel to its success.",
    "Class discussions were always vibrant. The Beinecke visits were helpful and I like that the final essays were structured around them. I also like that we could work on our final essays all throughout the semester. The only issue I ran into sometimes was not being called on because more outspoken people were talking and feeling overwhelmed by the amount of readings that dealt with sexual violence.",
    "Strengths: variety of authors introduced; level of classroom discussion; professor's facilitating skills; student presentations Weaknesses: the class was a little too big. Could have benefited from strategic use of small groups.",
    "This course was well designed and well taught. Professor Feimster is great at challenging and supporting her students to engage with the text in a way that is rigorous and creative.",
    "The course had a broad range of texts and I liked that we read articles rather than monographs, which allowed us to get access to a wide range of scholars. I think our seminars were well run and I appreciate the presentations by my classmates. One difficulty of the course was it sometimes felt like class discussion was more focused on bringing out disparate points from the text rather than fostering a true discussion.",
    "I would have preferred to read more of the full books and the majority of the semester the class was dominated by two people who took the conversation into places it was hard to understand or at times enter. I think in the future since this course brings in multiple disciplines there should be an opening question from the professor to give more people the chance to participate. And perhaps heavier facilitation.",
    "I think that the strength of the course was the readings that were chosen, and the span of history covered. I do think I would have preferred to read full length books, or to have more of a mix where some weeks are selections of articles and others are full length books. Sometimes it was hard to get really deep into a discussion because we had to switch from one reading to the next."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! For those interested in learning to theorize from the ground about the lives of Black women, I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The class looked at black women from multiple angles, eras, and disciplines and would be beneficial to almost anybody.",
    "Yes, especially those historians seeking to work on fundamental skills--how to deal with the archive, different modes of writing, etc.",
    "Yes. It is an excellent course.",
    "Yes. I think that overall I gained a lot from this course and it was important for me, as an African history student, to see how gender, race and sexuality have been analyzed in the American context.",
    "Totally! I think the course is a phenomenal entryway into a history that is often untaught in other history courses.",
    "This course delivered on the promise of its title. I feel like it gave me a solid background in African American Women's history that I could go on to build out in a number of different ways.",
    "Most definitely. It covers a range of questions and issues that I think are historically interesting, especially in a moment where theoretically, socially, and politically, questions of how race and gender operate are increasingly important."
