   "comments": [
    "My language skills developed tremendously, and I also learned a ton about science and religion in Modern Spain. We had lots of reading, but it was a good amount overall, and the necessary amount to become a better reader.",
    "This was a really great class. It was essentially a lit seminar in Spanish, which can be hard to find in our Spanish Department, so it was ideal! Every class was an opportunity to improve your spoken Spanish, and there were 3 essays throughout the semester that we got extensive feedback on. Plus, obviously a large part of the work is the reading outside of class--by the end of the semester my reading was SO much faster and better. If you're looking for a way to improve a bunch of Spanish skills, take this class, but be ready for the steep learning curve for reading at the beginning of the semester.",
    "This class taught me about Spanish literature around the turn of the 20th century. It was an interesting seminar class that provoked me to use critical thinking.",
    "My command of Spanish significantly improved. I hadn't taken a Spanish course in a year, so my Spanish was a bit rusty--but after taking this course, I read, write and speak better than I ever have before. I never knew much about the history of science in Spain before I took this class. I was worried that there might not be much material to cover, but there actually was more than enough. Now, I feel I understand a subject which I never even knew had existed.",
    "I learned a lot about the scientific culture (or lack thereof) in Span at the turn of the century. I also gained a lot of insight into the different ways that a culture's literature can reflect shifting attitudes on various themes, and on the value of fiction as a primary resource.",
    "This class was great for gaining confidence in reading and writing lengthy works in Spanish. Additionally, since the class is discussion-based, it was a great opportunity to just get some good weekly practice in, and I found that very helpful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class is very, very well run. Perhaps a bit more conversation about Catholicism in Spain would be good, but overall the material was great.",
    "I think the main strength of this course is that it facilitates discussion in Spanish, and allows students to improve verbal skills and reading skills. The only weakness I can think of is that sometimes the shorter nonfiction readings weren't as interesting as the fiction, but the solid selection of short stories made up for it.",
    "I enjoyed how few students were in the class, as it forced me to stay engaged and interested in the material. The material was also very interesting, as it is relevant to modern debates.",
    "Especially considering that this was the first year it was offered, the class was really well done. The vast majority of the works we read were enjoyable and well-written, and the supplementary readings were interesting and informative. I especially liked Miau and a few of the early short stories (El crmen cientfico y El destripador de antao). There aren't too many of them I would remove. The only one I might suggest changing is Mecanopolis, which I didn't feel was as well-crafted as Unamuno's other work, Amor y pedagoga. I think it might be interesting to see some more interchange between different authors of the time. From my final paper research, it seems that many of the writers we studied corresponded extensively with each other (for example, Prez Galds y Leopoldo Alas Clarn). Most of the secondary sources we read were recent analyses of the material. Perhaps you could throw in some commentaries from contemporary authors. It would be especially interesting to see what the different authors we read thought of each other's work. As far as the structure of the class is concerned, I don't have many criticisms. The teaching was excellent, the grading was fair, and the class was well organized. The only suggestion I might make is to assign slightly less reading for the Thursdays before a paper is due, to encourage the students to focus on the paper. Students could be asked to bring a draft\/outline of the paper to class, and for the last few minutes of the class, could split into pairs and give each other feedback.",
    "I thought the class was overall very strong, though I found a few of the readings, especially from Miau, to be a little difficult to get through. I think the course would be improved with a reading list that eliminates Miau in lieu of another novel.",
    "The class covers a great range of material, and has a good balance of out-of-class work. I honestly don't have much constructive criticism, except to say that I personally didn't love Miau as much as the other works, and if another novel comes to mind which might serve in its place, that might be an interested switch."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Prof. Harkema is so kind and helpful, and the discussions were really engaging. It was absolutely a hard class, make no mistake, but totally worth it. The authors you get to read are incredible and super challenging and rewarding.",
    "Absolutely. The class is all about discussion, and it's a great dynamic. Great material, too.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this class! The subject is pretty interesting, but what I most appreciated was that Profa. Harkema let the discussions go in a lot of interesting directions, so we didn't spend all our time just debating science and religion. Profa. Harkema is a really lovely person, very willing to help at office hours, and open to new ideas. Take this class! The reading is definitely a substantial time commitment, but totally worth it. Do all the readings to get as much as possible out of the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It helped me use conversational Spanish while learning about an interesting topic.",
    "When I first saw this class in the BlueBook, I thought, \"Science in Spain?\" Germany had Bohr and Einstein, France had Pasteur, but Spain... Actually, as I came to learn, science has a very interesting history in Spain. Spain did produce a handful of great scientists, such as Santiago Ramn y Cajal, who created the field of neurobiology. In this class, you'll get to read one of his short stories. A few days thereafter, you'll visit the brain room at the medical school library to see his original drawings and research! I took this class at the same time as Neurobiology in the MCDB department, and the overlap was really interesting. This class mainly focuses on the reception of Darwinism in Spain. Although Darwin's theories arrived in Spain fairly late, many of the great Spanish writers of the late twentieth century read and debated his findings. Many of the stories you'll read are centered around the effect of Darwinism (and social Darwinism) on Spanish society. Although this was the first year that SPAN 309 was taught, it felt like it was the twentieth. The class was very well organized and all of the material was interesting and cohesive. Out of the two novels and seven short stories we read, there was only one short story I didn't like. Everything else was wonderfully written--especially Miau, the largest novel of the course. In addition to the primary texts, Profa. Harkema assigns several secondary sources, which explain the background and put them in context within the history of science in Spain. Profa. Harkema is a wonderful and dedicated teacher. She leads interesting class discussions and knows the material inside and out. She is also very available outside of class. Take advantage of her office hours! Before I wrote each paper, I went to her office hours to run my ideas by her. Every single time, she helped me refine them and gave me very helpful suggestions. Meeting with her substantially improved the structure and thesis of my papers. The class is a decent amount of work, but it's not outrageous. There's a lot of reading, and some of the books are quite difficult (note: DO THE READING). There are two short essays (one of which was a dialogue) and then a 10-15 page final research paper. Make sure to stay organized and manage your time well, as Profa. Harkema doesn't really like granting extensions willy-nilly. I recommend outlining the final paper before reading period, so you get a head start on it and can go over your ideas with Profa. Harkema.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have a strong interest in the subject matter, and are willing to speak up in class. When I took it there were only eight people in the seminar, so everyone really needed to contribute to the conversation. I thought the material was fascinating, and enjoyed the class a lot, but don't take it if you're just looking for an L5 class to complete your language requirement. It's definitely not an easy class, and I'd imagine that, without an interest in the material, the class would feel like a lot of extra work. Profa. Harkema is great!",
    "This is a great class, especially if Professor Harkema is teaching it. The works covered are interesting to read and discuss, and Professor Harkema assigns a fair balance of work which accounts for the time you'll spend reading outside of class."
