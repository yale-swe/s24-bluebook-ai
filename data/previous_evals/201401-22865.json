   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student not only as an opportunity to think about social and religious constructions of space and they waythat gets mapped out onto imagined and actual landscapes, but also for the theoretical material that has a more universal application. This class is definitely suitable for students of Art History, Religious Studies and South Asian Studies.",
    "The seminar explores a broad range of media through the lens of landscape. Spanning a variety of periods, the course content is really exciting visually and intellectually. Sears's broad knowledge really enables her to dissect imagery and text through a critical approach that provides a great foundation for engaging discussions. I would definitely recommend this seminar to fellow students as both the expansive content and freedom of the term project makes the seminar an endeavor rather than a task.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for both specialists and non specialists. Professor Sears is great about encouraging non specialists to participate and to bring their own unique approach to the material. Any student interested in landscapes would benefit from this course."

   "comments": [
    "This course definitely helped me think through various theoretical frameworks and analytical categories related to space, pilgrimage and religious mapping. This course helped me think through possible materials I could use and perspectives that I could employ in thinking through a dissertation on sacred space and pilgrimage.",
    "As an outsider the seminar really made apparent the entrenched conventions my own school has instilled in me while also enabling me to overcome these through exposure to different methods of interpretation and research. The seminar was really essential to the development of studio project in architecture as the content and discussion enlivened the topic and enabled me to approach my own discipline and work from a unique standpoint.",
    "This course exposed me to new methodologies that I will absolutely use in my own research. Overall, I'm thrilled I took this class!"
