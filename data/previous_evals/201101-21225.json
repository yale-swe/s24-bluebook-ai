    "A course that focuses on the notion of impurity in Qumran and Rabbinic literature, which also re-evaluates many assumptions underlying the study of each corpus.",
    "It was not always clear to me how the guest speakers contributed to the topics of the class and they were very hit or miss. I was often unclear on what the larger narrative of the class really was, and what the professor's position on purity from Qumran to the Rabbis really was.",
    "If anyone is interested in both Qumran and Rabbinic tradition and in how they understand the cannonical book, I would be happy to recommend this course very strongly.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, but I think the issue is somewhat moot since the topic of the Ancient Judaism seminar changes every year, and this class will not be taught again."

   "comments": [
    "Before the course, my exposure to Rabbinic literature was slight. The course was most rewarding!",
    "This course helps me to understand how Qumran coummunity interprets the legal passages in the cannonical book and applies it to its life.And it was very interesting that there is a strong connection between Rabbinic tradition and Qumran community.",
    "Since I am not yetat all certain what I am going to write about for my dissertation, I am not sure whether the course will be relevant to my research. But I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to write a paper on the history of a law in the second temple and rabbinic periods, and that experience was quite valuable in terms of training me for future research. I learned how to think about legal history, and the precise issues involved in using the sources that we have available in order to try to trace legal history in this time period. This was an area in which I lacked any training, and I was really glad to start to learn about it."
