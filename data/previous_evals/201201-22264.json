    "PLEASE, please take this course. If you're not lucky enough to be placed in it, switch into Greg's section. I've read from past years' evaluations that Greg's section single-handedly makes DS worth it, even if you happen to hate your other sections. I thought it was a bit absurd when I read it initially. I now realize I was the absurd one. Although I loved my Lit and H&P sections this year, I would agree to take DS again in an alternate world where I disliked my other sections if I could be in Greg's section again. His lessons transcend the classroom and infect your attitude towards life itself. Greg has endowed me with an appreciative, careful, analytic eye; I am incredibly thankful for all he has taught me.",
    "Good mixture of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics. Introduction to modern philosophy.",
    "Ganssle is great. He's an awesome guy that knows a lot about philosophy but always remain cool and humble. He is willing to let students drive the discussion, but also willing to step in with a helpful clarification or gentle correction. His enthusiasm for the subject matter carries over into the students and makes the class a true joy. Take this class and take it with Ganssle.",
    "It is brutal if you dont like philosophy",
    "Ganssle was my favorite DS teacher. He really really taught things, and constantly impressed with his philosophical knowledge and awareness. He focused on getting us to understand the difficult concepts. He balanced instruction and student-motivated discussion perfectly. I wish I could take the class again!",
    "Second semester philosophy is a vast improvement over first semester philosophy, and well worth waiting for. It is very work-intensive, though ... the ideas are complex and require lots of time and thought to get much out of them.",
    "Reading isn't as interesting as first semester, but still a great class.",
    "The second semester of directed studies philosophy begins with Descartes and takes you through into the 20th century. This course not only continues the survey of Western philosophy begun in the first semester of DS philosophy, but also continues to improve your ability to think and write analytically about philosophy. Particularly in this second semester you will come to see how different philosophers found different answers to many of the same philosophical problems like the role of skepticism, the role of reason, or the basis of ethics. This course is a significant amount of reading, but what you gain from that reading is a kind of immersion in Western philosophy. I highly recommend this course not only to people interested in philosophy but also to anyone interested in pursuing study in the humanities in general. The knowledge of philosophy that you gain from this course will not only change the way you read literature and other texts, it will also help to improve your analytical writing and thinking by teaching you how to critique and write about philosophy.",
    "I loved DS, both the philosophy section in particular and the overarching program as a whole. You are given the chance to study a huge range of works in a small seminar setting with other students who are really smart and have similar interests and then listen to lectures given by people who have studied the works for years. Also, the DS community is so supportive and fun. I would definitely recommend DS!",
    "It's a great course for life really, and you'll come away with a better understanding of yourself and humankind. Is Hume right in that reason is just the slave of the passions? Is there a morality independent of our societal conventions of the time? These are important questions you will ponder and discuss, which I would recommend everyone do at some point or another."
