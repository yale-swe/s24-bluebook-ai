   "comments": [
    "This is a great class. It demands some level of constant attention, which can be a different sort of challenge. However, the class is a lot of fun and the knowlede you walk away with makes it well worth it.",
    "Definitely take it alongside MUSI 350 if you can - the two classes complement each other well and both will add to your knowledge and understanding of the time period as a whole. It's a fun class and you get to do a lot of singing in class as you work through different pieces.",
    "Fantastic. This class is beautifully designed for maximum learning and maximum fun. Essentially, you spend the semester writing counterpoint exercises outside of class (2-3 hours of work per session). Then, you often sing your own homework exercises as a class, as well as real 15th century motets. The practical approach for getting into early music is extremely effective, and I left with a much improved grasp on the aesthetic of that style. Highly recommended for composers in particular.",
    "Take it! You get to sight-read a lot of beautiful polyphony and write really neat pieces. A fair amount of work, but I love Prof. McCreless."
