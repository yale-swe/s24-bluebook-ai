    "Only take it if you want to be lectured to.",
    "This is a valuable course but not one to be taken lightly - you will have a lot of reading and be directly challenged on it in class. It is a course on the broad themes in the title, not on the nitty-gritty of how to write good journalism, but the reading list is great and the professor is extremely engaged. Though I felt challenged (and sometimes stressed!) throughout the semester, I look back and realize that I've learned and thought about a lot of important issues because of this class, and I am glad that I took it.",
    "A fascinating look at how difficult it is for a democracy to survive. A sobering and, in many ways, necessary course.",
    "We learned about the public sphere - reading Seyla Benhabib, Hannah Arendt, Gordon Wood, and Thucydides. We then read many writers, including Jay Rosen, Frank Rich, Monroe Price, Paul Starr, on the state of journalism in America. We also heard from Paul Bass, the founder of the New Haven Independent, as we considered whether online media could take the place of print media. The course is relevant for anyone who cares about the fate of public discourse in America. Professor Sleeper is the most engaged of any professor at Yale I've had so far!",
    "A very difficult course to summarize in a few phrases. One of the more academically, politically (and morally?) intense seminars at Yale, taught by a true intellectual iconoclast. This is not an idle credit, nor is it quite like any other class in the Blue Book. Although the workload is manageable, be prepared to devote a great deal of thought to the issues at hand, as Sleeper expects a great deal from the class, and rightly so. Discussions are impassioned, current yet classic, and often, truly enlightening. While deviation is permitted and encouraged, the class has a distinct civic-republican \"thesis\" \u0097 the Sleeper canon \u0097 that permeates all the material; be prepared, and keep an open mind, and the rewards will be ample.The class is about much more than journalism, liberalism, and democracy, more than even their synthesis. It's a truly deep and courageous grappling with some of the most powerful personal and public forces at play today: education in the best sense of the word. If you can stomach loads of ideology, equal parts theory, and a lot of time spent in thought and discussion,take it: you surely will not regret it.",
    "I would recommend this for journalists and non-journalists alike, if only because the clear thinking required in the midterm and final take-home essays (as well as to participate in discussion) are skills that are useful beyond the realm of writing and journalism.",
    "This class was very enjoyable for me and reminded me how much I care about the basic liberal, republican values that underpin our American democracy, as well as how important good journalism is to keeping our democracy functional -- and how truly miraculous good journalism is. Journalism is a public good, so it is not only vital to our democracy but also perennially undervalued by the free market, as you'll find out in this class. If those things are important to you, then you'll get a lot out of this class. Professor Sleeper is a true teacher who devotes hours and hours each week to emailing the class, emailing individuals, and reading and responding to people's posts on the classesv2 forum discussions that are a vital part of the class. The readings are never too long, but they're always great, and you have to post intelligent thoughts about them and really know them well for the midterm and final - so you have a great intense experience of really getting to understand what all the authors are saying. I heartily recommend this class. The secret to success in it is not getting intimidated by Professor Sleeper's intensity and instead, allowing yourself to get absorbed in the importance of the themes you're studying!"
