    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. This is the best course I have ever taken at Yale. The combination of educational theory and classroom observation provides so much insight into the realm of education, and Professor Cole-Taylor keeps the class engaging at all times. I had some of the best discussions at Yale in this seminar, to the point where the students would meet together outside of class just to keep the discussion going.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale with the best professor I've had at Yale. It challenged me intellectually in a way no other class has and helped me grow in my thinking on education and more generally. What this class will be like next semester with a different professor remains to be seen. This is a subject that is very interesting and the structure with observations, readings, and a seminar are great for exploring that subject. But the class under Cole-Taylor was so much more than that.",
    "If you're the least bit interested in education studies in any context-- from a theory perspective, from a policy perspective, from an \"I'm not sure if I want to be a teacher\" perspective--yes, absolutely. It'll be hard, but it'll be unlike any other class you've taken or will take again.",
    "If Yale had a rigorous and comprehensive Education Studies program, this would be the core class, serving as an intensive entryway into all other aspects of the educational world.",
    "Schools, Community and the Teacher is, without a doubt, one of the best courses at Yale. You learn about extremely interesting and relevant theories and ideas, and the chance to get to go into New Haven schools and observe a high school class is a one of a kind experience. Professor Cole Taylor put so much effort into making sure that each and every class was enjoyable, informative, and well-thought out. It is such a shame that Yale is losing her, as she really is one of the gems of this school.",
    "This class is the best class I've taken at Yale, and this was my last semester as an undergraduate. I have no idea what it will be like without Linda, who is the best person and such an amazing teacher. Good luck to you guys trying to figure out whether the next version is worth anything!",
    "Schools, Community, and the Teacher was perhaps the single best class I have taken in my 3.5 years at Yale. It was not perfect, but as taught by Professor Cole-Taylor, it came damn near close to it. By combining intense analysis of educational philosophy (theory), in-school observations (practice), and constant self-examination about our educational beliefs, Professor C-T gave us a truly invaluable experience that has indelibly impacted the way I think about education in America. She is herself an exemplary educator who is clearly very devoted to her students. It is extremely unfortunate that she will no longer be teaching at Yale, and she has left very large shoes to fill. This class was phenomenal in large part because of Professor C-T, but I would still encourage anybody interested in education to check out the course next semester, especially if the observation element is maintained. The workload is significant, but it is all incredibly interesting and relevant - I did my most meaningful work in this class.",
    "Given thatProf. Cole-Taylor won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be leading the class next semester, I cannot say that I have an opinion. The structure of the class so hinged upon her knowledge and experience with these readings and actual classroom praxis. This type of material has the potential to disintegrate into a very \u00e2\u0080\u009cfluffy\u00e2\u0080\u009d education class with little valuable content. If Prof. Cole-Taylor were still leading the seminar, I would absolutely say that it is worth taking. It was the best class I have ever taken at Yale and cemented my decision that I want to pursue education professionally. That said, under a different professor, I cannot make any guarantees that this will be as valuable of a class."
