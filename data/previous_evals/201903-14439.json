    "As an aspiring teacher, this course made me think more critically about education than any other course ive taken at yale. It was challenging and you have to put in the work to do the readings well, but it was 100% worth it to get out of it a much better sense of my own educational philosophy",
    "Recent trends in educational reform; common themes within the history of education; concerns about education, the way it is instituted, and the political outcomes of how education functions",
    "This course challenged all of my assumptions of every aspect of American education: Intelligence Testing, the ends of college and university education, meritocracy, the challenges of education reform, etc. I learned to think about the study of education in a far more critical way than ever before.",
    "You are pushed to gain your own interpretations about the content of what you are reading about. You gain a very brief historical understanding of the educational system as well as critical insights on education."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: fascinating readings; interesting class discussion; unique assignments Weaknesses: not so much feedback",
    "This course is rather vague in what you learn, it's often interesting but a strange piecemeal of things that you can actually pick up on. Given the niche material and small size the class is also often overrun by a few students with strong opinions and obscure knowledge that can be hard to follow along with unless you are a student with a lot of experience in the subject",
    "This is a fantastic course. It really made me reconsider a lot of the beliefs I held about our education system. I do wish, however, that it included a little bit more about possible solutions for some of the problems we learned about.",
    "Mordechai Levy-Eichel is one of the single greatest instructors I have yet had at Yale university. His uniquely irreverent approach to academic life and personal concern for the well-being of students makes him singularly approachable. The readings he assigns are reasonable and engaging. Moreover, he is EXTREMELY welcoming of a true diversity of opinions and makes sure to both respect and challenge students, whatever their proclivities may be (our class had students ranging from traditionalist conservative to revolutionary marxist, which made for truly riveting and thought-provoking discussions). The course focuses us all to think harder about ourselves.",
    "Strengths: The readings were very interesting and the class itself is open for discussion which allowed us to go into deep conversations on what we were most interested in. Weaknesses: There are not many graded assignments and exams (1 midterm assignment and 1 final to be exact) which makes sense given the content of the class. However, it was difficult to know how you were doing in the class as a student.",
    "Great professor, wide variety of perspectives, challenged assumptions"

   "comments": [
    "Very much so! Professor Levy-Eichel is an amazing teacher",
    "Yes, this course is great for a student who has not yet been introduced to academic dialogue on education. I didnt know what to expect, but it made me realize how political, economical, and hierarchical education can be. This is something definitely work learning about for a semester.",
    "If you're interested in a critical look at your own privilege (in attending Yale) and the complex and deep rooted power structures and social mechanisms in place that make higher education so all-powerful this is the class for you.",
    "I strongly recommend this course. Mordechai was fantastic, and the course was incredibly engaging. I loved this class.",
    "Yes. If you are at all interested in the fundamental question of the Humanities, i.e. what does it mean to be human and what is a life worth living, this course will do wonders for you to rethink your Yale experience and ask what it is that you truly want.",
    "Absolutely. This course will get you to think more critically about education than any Ed Studies class.",
    "Absolutely. Challenges preconceptions about education- important as a student at Yale"
