   "comments": [
    "A good class if you want to know anything and everything about the soviet union. Neat perspective, debunks a lot of myths that you always hear. I think that if you're looking for a pretty easy class, it's a taker. Not quite a gut, but easy enough that you can still understand stuff without putting in tons of effort.",
    "It's an interesting exploration of some of the issues in the post-Soviet landscape. Don't expect to have a detailed understanding of post-Soviet history, but rather the course is about learning the anthropological approach and discussing general trends. I learned some things, but as a person with no particular interest in the countries of the former Soviet Union, it didn't do all that much for me.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, no matter if you are just curious about the region or are an anthropology major. I come from a political science background, so I found that this course provided me insight on the \"on-the-ground\" factors that are incorporated onto the states' policies. The workload, consisting of mainly readings, and midterm and final essays, is flexible enough that you can determine how much you want to get out of the course. That said, I would say to make most of the course material assigned.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It gives a new perspective on the history of the Soviet Union while completely debasing what you think you already know about the area--which creates both a difficulty in understanding the material and enthusiasm about discovering a new perspective. Definitely a must if you've never taken a class with Professor Rogers or an anthropology class. A really great introduction to anthro classes in general.",
    "Definitely recommended.",
    "After the Soviet Union is a really great class! I would definitely recommend taking it!Its one of those classes that changes how you think about the world.As my first class in anthropology and my first class related to the region, I had no problems and learned so much. The reading load is not heavy at all (it's all quite good and will enhance the class -- just do it) and the assignments are quite fair and manageable (a take home midterm and a two takehome essays for the final).A class that, without too much effort, gets you analyze the news more critically and break down stereotypes related to socialism ... as well as stereotypes related to capitalism and democracy! In fact, especially for political science majors, this is a great and necessary complimentary view.",
    "tl;dr summary: good lecturer and material, goes over much of post-Soviet states. If interested in the region, take! A unique perspective than polisci or history courses for true understanding.This course covers pretty much Soviet Union 1980-2010, and looks at a range of topics dealing with... life! Rogers introduces anthropology for the first-time course-takers (like me) very well, and I came out convinced that anthro, like political science or history, has much to offer in the analysis of a region.Douglas Rogers is also a great professor. Engaging lecturer who walks around the room and complains about \"not being able to walk around\" in a smaller classroom (we were in Rosenfeld 109, even though there were only 20 people). Sections were sometimes disappointing though.If you want to learn about the Russian mafia, read about revolutions in Georgia\/Ukraine\/Kyrgyzstan, make \"second economy\" jokes, or hear about why people hang meat out of windows in Siberia instead of using their brand-new refigerators, take this!",
    "Definitely take it if you meet the following preconditions:- strong interest in the area. this includes Russia as well as Central Asia and Eastern Europe.Actually that's pretty much it. Don't take this class if you're not ready for lots and lots and lots of pretty random and detailed information about post-Soviet life. This isn't a history class and the readings can get...um...dry. But if you're interested in the area, absolutely take it because you learn a lot.",
    "This is a great class and I would encourage anyone interested in recent history and life in Russia to take it! The section was useless but the material was great.",
    "You've seen comments like these before, but take them seriously: I only took this course because two other courses fell through during shopping period. I only wandered inside the classroom the second week because I'd heard good things about the professor - not because I was particularly interested in the Soviet Union and Russia. Sure, you'll learn interesting sociological theory, but make sure you're really interested in the subject. Otherwise putting in effort will get harder and harder.",
    "After the Soviet Union is a great introduction to cultural anthropology. The course teaches you to find nuances in people's daily realities and to view the conventional historical\/political narrative critically. Of course, there is a lot for Anthropology veterans to learn too: Professor Rogers presents interesting and worthwhile details about Soviet and post-Soviet life. He is a brilliant lecturer. While the course seems unstructured, you get used to it as the lectures progress. (It is not organized linearly but around topics such as \"religious transformations,\" \"crime,\" \"the oil industry,\" etc.) Also, start work on the take-home final early (it consists of two 6-7 page essays). Take the course!",
    "A terrific look at the less discussed side of Socialism: the lived experience of people in the Soviet Union. Course provides a good mix of historical and anthropological detail, while also helping students think through the subject from new vantage points. An important compliment to traditional classes on Soviet and Russian history and politics.",
    "While I would recommend this class if you're interested in Russia or a \"non-western\" narrative about socialism and its aftermath, I would say that anthropology as a field can sometimes seem frustrating and hard to pin down. Nevertheless, the class is very interesting and well taught.",
    "Great overview of the discipline of anthropology and the issues pertinent to the Soviet Union. The readings were really interesting and I came out of the course feeling like they had all worked together (with the lectures) to knit a good understanding of post-soviet Russia."
