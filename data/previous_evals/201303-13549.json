    "I understand that the class needs to build up slowly because the student body is very mixed (FES-SOM), however, I would rather create workload at the beginning of the semester (when no one is as busy with other classes) in order to speed up the process of getting everyone up to speed regarding business concepts, environmental management and sustainability trends. If everyone works harder at the beginning then everyone can get further by the end without having to work on a paper and a presentation while working on similar heavy stuff for other classes.I find the reading responses useful, do not change that.I would rather make everyone do presentations about what they find regarding their research paper as a midterm evaluation. Perhaps, they need to submit a 10-pager draft before hand in order to get feedback before the presentation (which doesn't have to be exactly at the middle, but one or two weeks after fall break). That way, you have the last half of the class with enough time to work more on the final paper. Perhaps a first draft submission before the end of classes.Why do I think this is better?I think that if you can speed up the process of getting everyone on the same page as early as possible, you can get to the good stuff (the last 5-6 concepts) earlier, and then, you have more time to work on the paper. More time to work on the paper allows for more feedback loops with TAs and Professor, which improves the quality of the final deliverable.A way to speed up the process is by getting rid of the 5\/7 case reports and make 4 early case reports mandatory and go for quality over quantity.Too much quantity gets tiresome and dilutes the quality.",
    "At the beginning of the semester, assignments were returned promptly and with good feedback. However, as the semester progressed, we did not receive our papers back in a timely fashion. It took over a month to return our midterm papers, which were returned only after multiple requests during winter break.The field trip was poorly executed and two students were turned away due to their Chinese citizenship.",
    "Question 8: I field trip to Skikorsky was excellent, and I hope it is continued for future students.Question 2: The case studies were an *excellent* method to learn course material, and I believe were more useful than the actual readings.I do emphasize that I would have benefited from more work with At Risk software, including additional lectures and an option to do another assignment similar to the Intriergy case. I found that monte carlo simulation was useful in two other courses I took this semester.",
    "Way too theoretical. I would have liked to see more practical applications: Company A has a problem, how would we fix it? What metrics would we use? What would be your first step? (Rachel Mak interacted this way with the class about her experience at BR and it was the most applied part of the class). We never even discussed what environmental managements systems in corporations were and what they did (besides GE mentioning it in passing).",
    "Very frenetic and uneven assignment schedule, often assignments were due back to back (Monday and Wednesday), then followed by a lull, with a week where nothing was due. This is not conducive to meaningful learning when students are merely rushing to meet seemingly arbitrary deadlines. There was a consensus in the class about the futility of Case #3, which was brushed over in a rushed presentation and in the end to just amounted to mere busy work.",
    "The course is an interesting overview of many Environmental Management tools. It is quite up-to-date, which makes the syllabus interesting. However, it sometimes lacks of depeness in tackling issues.It is well structured but requires over average work between reading requirements, and responces, class assigments and the final paper (considering it\u00c2\u00b4s multiple presentations)",
    "The @Risk case should have had more class time dedicated to its content and software. Nedal should have had more office hours sessions for this case. There were too many overlapping readings and cases assignments. The course would benefit from more depth and focus on particular readings and concepts.The course would be much better if it were smaller (<20 students). Having to work exclusively in groups on writing projects proved frustrating. And in a class in which writing was the only unit of work the instructors put no emphasis on the quality of writing.Also, there was a lot of kool-aid to be drunk in this course. No one questioned the general thesis that corporations are our saviors. Most students expressed shock and indignation at the mention of anti-capitalist or anti-militarist ideas.With all that said, Prof. Chertow is a good lecturer and the course material was interesting.",
    "Much of the class was based on very theoretical content. It was well-taught, but I'm not sure if I can really apply the concepts in the real world"

Working with risk modeling is interesting and the concept was helpful to learn, but actually learning a tool (@RISK) seemed to be a lot of work that wasn't necessarily additive to the course.",
    "Carefully planning a consistent assignment schedule. Perhaps look at the syllabi of other professors who consistently have an assignment due every class or once a week and do not cluster the deadlines of multiple assignments.",
    "There could be a more clear flow between topics. Concepts appear in isolated ways sometimes, and overall link in the final assigment takes effort and imagination",

    "This is obvious, but the field trip needs to include all students.",
    "The term projects were very inconsistent in success.",
    "Most of the readings were helpful, but they were extremely hard to complete on a regular basis. It might be helpful to separate the readings into required and suggested readings so that students know which ones are the most important for each lecture.",

That could be toned down in following years.",

We suddenly were given a run through with no prep in the middle of one class, were told it was due the following week, and then the TF who had the most knowledge about it wasn't accessible for help. Extremely frustrating",
    "Instructor: Nedal Talal Nassar \u00a0Nedal is clearly a very smart guy who knows a lot about the subject but we were never told how grading was done and it sometimes felt a little arbitrary. I got the best grades on the assignments I spent the least time on and it felt like in order to get a good grade, we needed to keep repeating things said in answering prior questions. Grading varied greatly between Nedal and Rachel.",

    "Good to complete assignments.",
    "VERY different levels of engagement from first year students and third year joint degrees.You may want to limit 3rd year joint degrees from taking this class. They have no incentive to help with the final project.",
    "Advantages: sharing information. Learning from other group members' experience. Disadvantages: finding time to work together. Some group members were more dedicated to the assignment than others.",
    "If a work group refers to a group project, then yes, I participated in several. They were mostly good, except for one (a case study) where a group member didnot contribute equally and was unresponsive to emails and late to group meetings. The main group project that I worked on was a solid group effort and everyone was equally invested.",
    "Benefits: shared workload made it less stressful at times, especially during heavy workloads from other courses. Learned how organize in groups to complete an assignment well.Disadvantages: Shared workload means inconsistent capabilities and approaches to work assignments. The quality of assignments can decrease dramatically as more people participate in the work group. I also felt that my learning was inhibited in groups because a) if someone in the group understood material XX they were usually the person to work on XX for the assignment and b) This division of labor meant we all focused on one piece of the assignment and had little exposure to the rest of the assignment.",
    "For cases: You are never graded on your own work so you don't know where you stand in terms of learning and group work was not useful because we did not really have time to discuss anything but simply wrote out a designated section of the case.For the final project: Group work was very valuable as we all had different strengths and weaknesses and had enough time to discuss and debate the issues at hand.",
    "some group members didn't pull their own weight on projects which made for an uncomfortable work setting and less productive than it could have been. the positive side is that you get to learn what's it like to work with a diverse group of people, which is a realistic preparation for the real world.",
    "Advantages - You could split the work up and each work on your relative strengths.Disadvantages -It resembled musical chairs, since the groups for weekly assignments were not set for the semester. Juggling the groups for assignments and the final assignment became onerous as the semester progressed.",
    "Assigments were groupal. Groups varied from one task to another, and team dynamics were very dependent on members and backgrounds. The fact that FES and SOM students group contributes to diversity but requires extra scheduling efforts.",
    "Group work helps develop leadership and management skills. It is very frustrating, however, because groups often compromise the quality of work--too many cooks!",
    "There was a lot of group work integrated into this class. Working with groups on the individual cases was challenging at times, in terms of personality differences and coordination challenges, but generally it enhanced learning. Working with a group on the final project was a great experience. We had an excellent group dynamic, that facilitated deep learning and commitment to the project.",
    "The advantages are shared workloads and learning how to work with other people. The disadvantages are that we may have spent more time on logistics than actually discussing the work itself at times, and you don't learn all of the material sometimes (particularly with the final term project)."
