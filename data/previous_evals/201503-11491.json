   "comments": [
    "A must take for micro people! Awesome!",
    "Great to deepen your knowledge in microbiology.",
    "The course is basically an introduction to bacteria and their pathogenesis. I'd recommend it to someone who was interested in bacteria or just wanted a background in them.",
    "It's a course with a lecture and a paper discussion for several important topics related to bacterial pathogenesis. It really helps to give you an idea of the important aspects of bacterial pathogenesis and also helps you think about research articles critically. It's great for your own research as well, and I would recommend it, especially if you intend to work in bacteria related labs.",
    "Yes, it was a great class.",
    "It was a great course that introduced me to the department and improved my skills at reading papers. I would definitely recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "Best course. I learned A LOT from it.",
    "It made me understand the dynamics of bacterial communities and their relationship to the host.",
    "I'm not sure how much it will contribute to my research, as I may not focus on bacteria, however the concepts that I learned as well as many of the experimental techniques can possibly be applied to different situations. Also, the background in bacteria and learning how to effectively read papers will definitely help with future research.",
    "It helped with reading and understanding research articles, and more importantly knowing how scientific research worked and what a strong argument is for a certain topic. It also helped in introducing us to some areas of research that is related to our lab work but we were previously ignorant to.",
    "I thought the selected topics for the course were great. Some weeks we had two papers assigned, and I thought it might be nice to pair a \"seminal paper\" with a more recent paper on the same topic, rather than two recent papers. This might help better orient us to the literature."
