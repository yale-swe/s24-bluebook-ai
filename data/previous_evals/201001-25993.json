    "If you don't take it, you will be cheating yourself out of learning.",
    "Second semester H&P is basically a summary of the past 500 years of political theory. We start with Machiavelli and move through the greats--Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, the Federalists--and end with Hannah Arendt's analysis of WWII and the holocaust. It was my personal least favorite of the three DS classes, but that's because 1) I'm an English major and 2) DS is fabulous. I still really enjoyed this class, and HIGHLY encourage you to take DS. The grounding I now have is phenomenal.",
    "You cover a lot of thinkers at a very rapid pace--besides Machiavelli, you spend one week per author. For this reason, it's sometimes difficult to feel like you've covered a book in much depth. However, by the end you have a great panoramic view of the way people have looked at history and politics throughout the last 500 years. Lectures were consistently the driest for H&P out of the 3 DS classes. Steven Pincus is the toughest professor I've had so far at Yale--you have to do a study question the night before every class (this is part of your grade) and discussions consistently kept you on your toes. However, he takes time to respond to every study question and he's really a brilliant guy--his book on the Glorious Revolution is considered the pivotal book on the subject. Prof. Pincus' \"big idea\" he wants to impress is the importance of historical context when analyzing political philosophy--you can't \"read the context out\". I was unconvinced at first, but by the end of the semester he had made a strong cumulative case.In short, if you're up for a challenge and want to learn a lot, Pincus is a good bet. His essay prompts are sort of average, but he's a pretty easy grader.",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides students with a good understanding of the author's positions. Professor Pincus leads a challenging but rewarding section. The reading responses force you to read the text closely, although they are time consuming. In section, Professor Pincus constantly encourages you to push deeper into the text to understand the author's core assumptions and ideas.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student, especially under Professor Pincus. Sections are always intellectually challenging and very informative.",
    "The second semester of DS H\/P is pretty intense - you do a lot of reading, and you don't have the big overlap with Philosophy the way you do with Plato's Republic first semester. However, the readings tend to be more interesting because you can really see the ramifications of the context they were written. Professor Pincus places a great deal of emphasis on historical context, which is helpful in understanding why the writers thought the way they did. Pincus assigns a LOT of extra work, but it's usually worth it, and it'll help you get a lot more out of the class than you might otherwise, since second semester can seem a bit disjointed at times. You'll probably start off not liking Professor Pincus, but by the end of the semester you'll appreciate his teaching style, which is heavy on the Socratic method, and realize just how much you've learned from this quite brilliant professor.",
    "This course was a basic overview of Western historical and political thought, and I would highly recommend it as a strong foundation for any major.",
    "Gets off to a great start with Machiavelli, but then the trifecta of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau gets hard to keep track of since they all write about the same thing, just different views on it. The Federalists are one of the high points of the semester, but the absolute winner and crown jewel is Arendt. If you skip everything else make sure you read her."
