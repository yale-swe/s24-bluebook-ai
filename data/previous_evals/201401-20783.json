   "comments": [
    "If you are a native Chinese speaker who is interested in improving your Chinese, it's definitely worth it to take this course (really any Chinese courses at Yale). The class has it's own rhythm that you have to get used to, but once you've mastered that it's a predictable pattern. The textbook lessons will simultaneously teach you Chinese and current Chinese concerns, which is good enrichment.",
    "If you are a heritage speaker looking to grow closer to fluency in Chinese, definitely take this class. You're Chinese reading and writing will improve, even if the process is painful (dictations, anyone?) Another perk: everyone in both sections who applied for the summer Light Fellowship received one. Not sure if that's purely coincidence (there are at least 5 or 6 going, from two sections of ~8).",
    "CHNS 163 seems like a standard higher level language course. It's great for those who really want to advance their Chinese language ability. It is quite a bit of work though, so you definitely need to invest yourself in order to learn the language.",
    "It's a very enjoyable class where you'll learn lots of Chinese language as well as historical and cultural background, with well-paced workloads that are manageable and occasionally even fun, but don't fall behind, or the previously well-balanced weekly assignments will turn into monsters as you scramble to gain language proficiency designed to be gradual but steep in a short breadth of time that leaves you awkwardly semi-proficient and grasping at straws.",
    "If you've taken CHNS 162, CHNS 163 is very similar in structure but with a completely different set of topics. While the previous semester focused on daily life, this semester is far more focused on Chinese politics."
