    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a great class for strengthening your french comprehension and speaking skills. Although I'm still not completely confident in my speaking skills, I definitely am more so than I was before this course",
    "L3 was a continuation of the the grammer series and a lot of it was review and focusing on the perfecting writing, speaking and expanding vocab, things like that. I don't feel like I learned anything completely foreign or new but it helped make grammar structures PC and imparfait stick to my head. There was still quite a bit of work (nightly grammer sheets and readings\/movies) so you have to put in the work if you want to see any improvements in your french. The bi-weekly tests occurred during your class time which was totally better than the L1\/L2 weekly tests. And classes met every day. So L3 french in your life every day which can get a bit annoying. But if you really want to keep up your french, you should probably take it.",
    "Pretty much the same as any other French class at Yale. Consistent workload (about an hour a night) with frequent tests. You learn a lot, but you have to put in a solid amount of work.",
    "I would summarize French 130 as a rather easy class with a predictable work schedule and manageable workload.",
    "I would recommend French 130 because it provides a wide foundation of French and a good balance between writing, listening and speaking.",
    "Grammar-wise, French 130 covers the imperfect, passe compose, subjunctive, imperative, and a few phrase nuances such as prepositional usage. Vocab is learned through reading books like Petit Nicolas, L'Etranger, and Monsieur Ibrahim et les Fleurs du Coran. This course also devotes a lot of time to aural and oral skills.While the material is not too difficult, French 130 does have an intense workload, probably about an hour a day if you complete all of the assignments.",
    "Yes definitely, I think the French program at Yale is better than most"
