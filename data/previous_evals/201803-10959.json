   "comments": [
    "The biggest thing was learning how to write a realistic story, in its details, use of language, and plot.",
    "I was able to develop a better process for revising my writing, as well as learning how to provide more useful feedback to other people on their writing.",
    "Skills: fiction writing, using criticism constructively, asking questions that yield helpful feedback, giving constructive criticism on other peoples' writing, imagining a story world, editing, being specific, being vulnerable (i.e. reading out loud \/ letting other people read your work). This class really improved my fiction writing, but it also strengthened my writing in other courses. It also pushed me intellectually in a way I hadn't expected it to. Deciding what to write about and how is extremely difficult, and, I think, generates mental dexterity that can be applied elsewhere. Insights: pretty much anyone can write fiction if they try hard enough.",
    "I learned a lot about the craft of writing fiction, such as how to use meaningful sound, work with an unreliable narrator, vary summary and scene, and experiment with different lengths of temporal distance. I also became a much more astute critic of fiction because much of this course was spent reading my peers' stories, analyzing them, and offering constructive feedback.",
    "I greatly improved not only as a writer, but also as a reader and critic as I read my classmates' stories every week.",
    "I learned different techniques to write fiction: using narrative distance, meaningful sound, etc.",
    "I extended my background in perspective, playing with time, scene vs. summary, rhythm and sound, and dialogue. I also learned how to participate in a workshop.",
    "I became more comfortable and confident in writing fiction.",
    "I learned to structure short stories, build out story worlds, and craft characters. I learned to pose questions -- rather than answering them -- with my stories. I learned to experiment with my voice, and fiction was a particularly fun vehicle because the narrator can be totally distinct from the real-life author. The whole class was structured to teach us how to write more persuasively, in a way that draws the reader in, and all of the techniques Prof. Gaige taught were extremely helpful toward that end."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Our class bonded well and by the end of the term was able to give one another clear feedback on our work, and engage in lively and fun class discussions about our work and other readings. Professor Gaige was instrumental in cultivating this open environment. Weaknesses: Sometimes the writing exercises were a lot to handle for just one week. I might suggest making each exercise shorter or giving us 2 weeks to do each.",
    "The workshop format of this course was great--it was really helpful just being able to listen to people discuss your story and get feedback. As we got further into the course, people got more comfortable being honest about what they thought and I thought it ended up being more beneficial to be workshopped later in the course. The exercises and the readings were all great--the one part that I didn't love were the student presentations on George Saunders story because they ended up just being entire class discussions. I would have preferred we had just done that from the start.",
    "Strengths: Professor Gaige, peer group, frequent exercises, readings showcased strategies to improve our own fiction, edits from classmates, considerable time to revise our stories. Weaknesses: I might have liked to workshop our second stories in the same way we workshopped our first. I spent a lot of time on this class, but I definitely would have been willing to spend more.",
    "The main strength of the course is that it throws a lot of writing at you. Exercises and readings every week, then once you get into the meat of the class, you're working on your long story and critiquing three a week. The improvement I'd suggest is that the course was very discussion based, with Professor Gaige sometimes sitting quietly as the students discussed amongst themselves. The course could use a little more instruction, as traditional instruction was often limited to only the last half hour.",
    "Strengths: lots of writing, useful techniques. Weaknesses: not enough workshopping, not enough individual attention from the teacher.",
    "I feel that we could have discussed the literature that we were reading more to talk about tools of a writer.",
    "I felt like there was not enough feedback about grades throughout the semester; we only received checks and written comments on our writing exercises. I also felt that we could have read more diverse authors; we never read a piece written by an LGBTQ author and few pieces by people of color.",
    "The writing assignments were well conceived (I particularly liked the opportunity to write a second short story) and the course was paced very effectively. I thought the readings were very well chosen -- they were diverse, and each was a helpful model. The workshop format is always great. I wish we had more time to revise our short stories as part of the class. I might have traded one of the initial exercises for a chance to build in revision a bit more formally to the course, or I might have re-structured the second half of the course to give more time for revision. But, mostly, I think I'm saying that I wish the course were longer because I'm not really sure what I would cut. I thought the course was extremely strong."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you love writing!",
    "Yes--it's a helpful creating writing course in a pretty standard format. The class is pretty dependent on the other students, so be aware that even if you have a great professor, you'll need to rely on your peers as well.",
    "Definitely. Professor Gaige is extremely accomplished and insightful, but not condescending. This means that you get the full benefit of her thoughtfulness and time. Having a world class writer read your work is not an opportunity anyone should pass up, but I think Professor Gaige is even more helpful than most excellent writers. In my class, the majority of the students are very good writers and critics. If your group is the same (which it seems like it would be), then you'll really benefit from working with them. It's also a really low risk environment to experiment with fiction writing and creativity. People wrote about a wide range of things, and the class was always respectful. Because of the kind environment, people were also not afraid to tell other students when a component of their writing was bad (important!).",
    "Take this course if you're prepared to do a lot of fiction writing with relatively little guidance and engage with your peers' writing as much as with your own. You'll get kind of a general prompt, or often no prompt at all, and then you have a week to come up with 5ish pages, or much more if it's for one of your two \"long short stories.\" Most of the class time--I'd say at least 80%-- is spent discussing other students' short stories and giving feedback and criticism. This can be fun, but it can also be exhausting, especially after 2 hours. I was expecting a course with a lot more specific guidance and advice on the elements of writing fiction, and one that analyzed what makes great short stories work. You will read lots of published short stories in addition to your peers', but certainly no more, and about half the time, we didn't even get around to discussing them in class because workshopping took the whole time. This will be a fantastic class for you if you're self-motivated, inspired, and proactive, and if you have the time in your life to devote to making the most of this course. You get out what you put in. Absolutely NOT a good fifth class\/gut, even if it seems kind of fun and easy for the first week or two.",
    "Many of the students were non-experienced non-english majors who simply wanted to improve writing. I'd recommend this course to any student who isn't already on a busy schedule. The skills gained in fiction writing are applicable to all kinds of writing, and this course is a great exercise in creativity.",
    "Sort of. If you are very serious about writing, take this course, but only if you will be dedicated enough to hunt down the professor and dedicate a lot of time to editing.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in creative writing regardless of skill level or background. It is exciting to produce a lot of work. I didnt always feel like I was getting the most comprehensive feedback from Professor Gaige, especially on my exercises, but she definitely is very knowledgeable and more helpful in independent meetings outside of class.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to improve their skills in writing fiction.",
    "Definitely take this course, even if you don't consider yourself a \"writer\" or if you've never taken a writing class before. Writing fiction is such a fun and helpful way to think about the world, and writing persuasively (the goal of the course) is one of the most important skills you can learn for any career. Writing is also such a challenge, and if you're really willing to dig into the work, you'll get a lot out of the workshops. Professor Gaige is also a fantastic discussion leader and advice giver, so I would highly recommend taking the class from her if you can!"
