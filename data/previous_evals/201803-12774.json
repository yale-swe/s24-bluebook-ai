    "US environmental law",
    "Understanding of broad US environmental law.",
    "Great overview of U.S. environmental law and the different legal philosophies that influenced the legal structure of environmental statues.",
    "Through this class I was able to gain a wide breath of knowledge on many different environmental laws and policies in the U.S. I now have a basic foundation of knowledge regarding which U.S. laws govern particular environmental issues.",
    "I learned a great deal about the successes and failures of U.S. environmental law, and how they could be improved. There was also interesting analysis on the philosophy behind law and policy and the processes that contribute to their evolution.",
    "I gained a greatly improved understanding of the history and background of the environmental law and policy that was created in the U.S., how each individual statute functions, and how this system has influenced global law and policy.",
    "I learned more about how politics and the law have shaped the landscape of environmentalism and policy in the United States. Additionally, I understand more about aspects of the law that affect environmental law, including the takings clause, administrative law, and Chevron deference.",
    "I learned policy analysis and legal research skills. I also learned foundational information related to US environmental law and policy.",
    "history of environmental law",
    "A comprehensive overview of environmental law and policy in the United States. Knowledge about major statutes.",
    "Overview of the major tenants of US environmental law. You'll understand how the different laws work, and 'how the sausage was made' in terms of developing and administering laws.",
    "I learned an overview of environmental law in the United States, including the basics of US law and administrative agencies, the history of the creation of environmental law, and a lot about specific environmental statutes. I learned how to think critically about legislation and how to improve existing statutes."

   "comments": [
    "I had some familiarity with particular statutes related to the environment, but each class allowed for greater in-depth discussion of the issues. This class exceeded my expectations for knowledge gained, and I feel the topics will be relevant to my future career.",
    "Very well.",
    "Pretty similar",

    "Met my expectations.",
    "I would have been interested in some more skill building activities such as memo writing, but in the end what's most important is having a broad foundation of knowledge that covers the major aspects of environmental law and that is undoubtedly what I came out with.",
    "Quite well.",
    "It aligned relatively well. It was useful to understand how environmental law impacts public health and how public health research impacts environmental law. It was an interesting dynamic to explore.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained aligned well with my expectations.",
    "I was hoping to learn more, have a forward looking course that included the pros and cons of foundational laws and current debates.",
    "Had a basic understanding coming in, and the insights built on that knowledge well.",
    "As expected",
    "The knowledge I gained in this class aligned well with my expectations. I was pleased with how much I learned about specific environmental statutes. I think the only thing that didn't meet my expectations was that I was expecting more mention or consideration of climate change and this topic was really not often brought up during lectures."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is a large amount of reading, but most of it was relevant and helpful for discussion. The opportunity for discussion during each class meeting could be improved.",
    "Readings are long and sometimes unclear of certain points trying to be made for non-law students.",
    "Good background information of US law But would be much more rewarding if there are assignments during the semester instead of just one big final exam",
    "The instructor is knowledgable, but the classes were 3hr long and there were not many opportunities for participation. Also, there were no assignments, papers, workshops ao any other forms to work with the contend taught in class.",
    "Strengths of the course are the depth of knowledge of the professor. Weaknesses are student engagement.",
    "Assigned textbook is clear and relatively concise. Lectures are a nice supplement and the personal anecdotes help contextualize the law into practical applications. Would appreciate more mini assignments throughout the semester instead of one final that comprises the majority of the grade for the class.",
    "Professor Elliott assigned an appropriate amount of reading and it was always provided the right amount of background on an issue and interesting debates happening within its scope. The reading was a big strength, but obviously the lectures were more important. Prof. Elliott was would point us to the most relevant sections of the readings and expound on the topics that are most current\/matter most. Stories about his personal experiences were especially insightful. If I had to pick a weakness I would say there could be more chances for participation, but at the same time the professor would keep things on topic whereas students like to steer things towards their particular interests that have less relevance for the rest of the class.",
    "Strengths - the lectures are quite interesting Weaknesses - students are completely unaccountable for their reading(s) until the final exam, which provides very little incentive to engage with the course material. This made our course discussions somewhat boring; the same few students continued to have 75% of the questions and comments, because everyone else either had no idea what was going on, or no desire to chime in.",
    "The strength of the course is that it provides a survey of significant US environmental law. A weakness of the course is that the content is very broad. Lecture powerpoints could be used to underline key concepts that may be missed in class because the course proceeds at a very fast pace.",
    "Needs to be more forward looking and practical since F&ES is a professional school. We also never received any feedback or grades.",
    "I liked the long lecture format.",
    "The course could be improved through more hands-on learning. It would be good to get some hypothetical cases or something of the like and think through how cases actually play out in a way that we might experience in our career. The course should focus more on 2018 and a little less on 1990.",
    "The course was almost a review of the history of environmental law, rather than a look forward. It was useful to learn how laws were developed and amended in the past. I think it would've been more useful to include a look forward by including more information about current legislation, proposed legislation, and climate change considerations. The course was a three-hour lecture for one day a week with no assignments, which might not be the best approach to learning for some students."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Do the readings so that you actually engage with the course material.",
    "Understand that you will be receiving a broad overview of major environmental laws and that's about it.",
    "Take this class if want to learn about the fundamental environmental law in the US",
    "don't take this class",
    "Do as much reading as possible to give class concepts context before arriving.",
    "Required core class for the Environmental Policy Analysis specialization",
    "Take in-depth notes on the readings and go easy on taking notes in class. I think I learned this too late, so I ended up trying to transcribe too many lectures when I should have been sitting back and thinking more critically about what was being discussed.",
    "Do all the readings and engage in the discussion; it's the best way to get anything from the course.",
    "Try to re-read the course material with the lecture notes in mind,",
    "unless you can learn from a professor standing at the blackboard for three hours, this isn't the course for you.",
    "Do the readings and come to class ready to engage.",
    "Do the reading.",
    "Great for foundational understanding of US enviro law, you'll get schooled on the classics, which is useful. Not cutting-edge or modern in terms of content, but that ends up being kind of appropriate given the topics covered.",
    "I would say that if you are determined to get a lot out of the class that you should make an effort to do all of the readings that were assigned. Professor Elliott will go over material covered in the reading assignments- if I didn't read, I think I would've been a little lost during his lectures. His lectures are somewhat unstructured and a little bit rambling (especially because there was only one lecture for three hours on Monday morning), so make an effort to pay attention for the lecture, take notes, and review the notes you take after class for the material to really sink in."
