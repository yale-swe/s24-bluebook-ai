   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course and this professor wholeheartedly.",
    "Professor Jung's course on death in the medieval ages was a good introduction to the subject. The lectures for the most part are enjoyable and interesting, and professor jung gets very animated when she discusses the interiors of churches; it is enjoyable to see someone so excited about what they do. Not much work, and the exams and paper aren't hard, though the grading can be a little pedantic. I would take again.",
    "This is a wonderful class! This area of art history is so neglected, but so meaningful and worthwhile! I highly recommend it, to any art history\/ literature\/ or history major. Every lecture was a joy to attend. However, if you have taken many classes on Medieval topics, much of this class may be review. It does not assume background knowledge.",
    "Being a Divinity School student, I would most definitely recommend this class to a colleague. For me it was a great way to bring the academics with spiritual discipline. For example, studying the crucifixion during Lent was a phenomenal meditation practice for me. I think Divinity School students also don't get enough art history and the impact of visual culture on faith.",
    "I would recommend, especially if you are taking it with a friend, it since the material is very interesting and it is conducive to studying with a partner. Professor Jung is very passionate and clear and has a great sense of humor. It was the first art history class I've taken and it made me want to take another one.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Professor Jung's passion for medieval art is so tangible and this enthusiasm really opens up the misunderstood world of the middle ages. She is also very accessible and I encourage meeting with her in office hours. This class easily became one of my favorite classes taught by the history of art department. The subject matter can get a bit gory\/we talk about death a lot which may be a turn-off for some.",
    "Any class w Professor Jung is a must-take! If you have any interest in medieval art or religious art, this is the class for you! And if you are looking for a cool, fun humanities credit, why not take one where you get to learn all about death and the apocalypse?! The class had 2 exams, a paper, and a final, but the exams were all really straightforward. Prof Jung is a really amazing lecturer with a great sense of humor and a lot of passion for the course and she cares about her students a lot. If you pay attention in lecture, you're set for the writing part of the exams. There is a bit of memorization of the images, but Prof Jung is very clear about which pieces you need to know and which ones are supplementary and she gives you all the information you need to study for the exams in her slide lists. If you can, have Michelle for a TA. She's super helpful and willing to meet with you about anything from going over exams to helping w ideas from lecture and she really guides you through the final paper process. This was the best class I took last year!"
