   "comments": [
    "amazing",
    "Very informative lectures on aspects of public health that are sometimes overlooked. This semester the class was very large, so the discussion style suggested in the syllabus was not possible and it seemed more like a typical lecture where you are talked at",
    "An easy course. Interesting topics covered. Half the classes were interactive and kept us engaged.",
    "Strengths: No time spent out of class (besides final), easy Honors Limitations: Topics and lectures are a little dry",
    "Send the reading materials well in advance",
    "great",
    "Classes themselves were interesting; however, the course itself did not facilitate much learning. Lectures were on very specific topics. I would have loved to see more epidemiological methods incorporated into the course that could be applied more broadly to public health.",
    "This course was enlightening and had plenty of exciting in-class discussions. It was a seminar format, so students would need to have completed the readings in order to properly engage.",
    "I liked the guest lecture style of the class but I personally did not find many of the speakers very engaging.",
    "Some lectures\/lecturers were extremely dry.",
    "The course was informative, and the students could learn quite a bit if they pay attention. However, given the lack of assignments, it might help to improve student engagement by having weekly reading assignments to turn in, a midterm, bi-weekly quizzes, etc.",
    "The course covers a diverse array of topics related to environmental and occupational medicine. It does not require much work outside of class until the take home final, and the two instructors were very knowledgeable about the topics and were engaging in lecture.",
    "Dull but fulfills the EHS requirement. Guest speakers could've been far more interesting--would've been great to spend more time learning about occupational health issues among marginalized populations, but that was barely one lecture. Other lectures talked about different types of rocks and chemicals, which I found too specific and pretty boring.",
    "I realized that I didn't have to go to class after a couple weeks so I never went after that. It was really easy and almost no work except a couple of hours spent on the take-home final.",
    "This course was pretty good There was a great variety of speakers. Of course, many students are not EHS students and take the course as an EHS elective, and the professors did a great job selecting speakers on a variety of topics so that everyone would have at least a few lectures that sparked their interest. When the grade is based entirely on one paper and participation, it would be better to have more opportunities to participate or to have a sign in sheet for attendance. I am not confident that the professors know my face to my name since the class size was large and many lectures were led by guest speakers, which leads me to question my participation grade. Overall, I thought highly of this class. Some speakers were better than other and some were more engaging than others, but that is to be expected.",
    "There were some really interesting lectures (9\/11, lead, radon, healthcare workers) and some which I thought were a bit boring. This is a very laid-back class - almost like a seminar. Although this is dependent on the instructor (there were guest speakers), I think more in-class group discussions would improve the overall class experience. In general, the class was not very engaged, though this may differ from year to year. The lectures based on certain chemical exposures were a bit dry, so more discussions for those would be very helpful. The aforementioned lectures which I found interesting were the clear strengths of the class, and all had a common denominator: either Mark or Marty delivered them.",
    "I enjoyed the lecture style of the course. It was a good introduction into occupational and environmental epidemiology. I may recommend assigning a few homework questions every so often to keep students engaged.",
    "inspiring course, many interesting topics",
    "This course is excellent. It is very low stress and even though assignments are not assigned until the end, I came out learning so much more than other classes with twice the workload. The lecture models and case studies were very cohesive and relevant. Would highly recommend for anyone needing an EHS requirement!",
    "not a well designed class - not intriguing as a core class for those with no background or interest in this area. needs to be more engaging and relevant and have better flow of material",
    "Interesting material put presented a bit dull (might have to do with the class being larger than previous years)",
    "Excellent",
    "Interesting topics but definitely not discussion oriented. It may have been more interesting if we had more in-class activities.",
    "A little too big for discussion, so it was very lecture-based",
    "Material is interesting, could be presented better. Also they should demand more from the students. This course was a breeze.",
    "The course covered a variety of topics. There were no assignments other than the final. The two main instructors, Professor Russi and Professor Slade were very animated.",
    "Strengths - Having guest lectures was nice, as it allowed us to hear from different people in the field Weaknesses- Most lectures did not have a lot of discussion between students and speaker, and the class is very long so it was hard to stay engaged.",
    "Generally enjoyed the course. Felt that the class period was sometimes a little too long and could have been shorter. Felt stretched for content in some cases",
    "No work besides the final. Russi and Slade are also two of the best lecturers in YSPH.",
    "Poor organization Professor doesnt care",
    "Certain topics were very sensitive and could have been addressed more appropriately- such as the 9\/11 and Department of Defense lectures. I don't think it was necessary to watch the events of 9\/11 in class, as the video could have been triggering for students who might have been affected by the events. In the future, a link to the video should be emailed to students to watch on their own time prior to attending class. The videos of the bombs being set off and military personnel perishing also may have been triggering to students. Overall, course was good introduction to occupational exposures.",
    "The class did cover a broad range of topics within environmental and occupational health with leaders in their respective fields. Unfortunately, many of these lectures were not really engaging and left many of us struggling to connect with and get an in-depth understanding of the topic. Perhaps incorporating a greater discussion\/participation element in the course would make it more approachable and engaging to students.",
    "I strongly believe that this is how a good class should be taught. The professors were extremely compelling and knowledgeable lecturers. Their guest lecturers were also extremely interesting. The class was a great way to learn about Environmental and Occupational health as well as apply Epidemiology 1 concepts. My one suggestion is that they do a 10 minute break in the middle of class. The professors started to do that towards the end of class and I think they should continue to implement this. My other concern was that the World Trade Center lecture could be approached slightly differently. I recognized and appreciated the honest attempt to be sensitive, but giving the students an option to leave right before presenting leads to a sense of shame. \"I SHOULD be able to sit through this\" was the thought most of us were left with when we saw nobody getting up to leave. I think the best way to deal with this particular lecture in the future is by sending an email explaining the lecture and providing the students the opportunity to decide not to attend in person prior to the lecture.",
    "Good overview of major topics on epidemiological issues in occupational and environmental medicine.",
    "i didnt learn anything from this course. i sat in on lectures that werent aligned with my interests at all. all we had to do with write a final exam, and that was the only time i had to engage with the material and learn anything. waste of my money to enroll in this course and i wish it was more interactive",
    "Interesting primer into the basics and essentials of epi and environmental health. Would be nice to have a more overarching theme and relation between courses. Seemed like a random assortment of topics that had no real flow from one to the other.",
    "I appreciate that there was a wide variety of topics covered. The long length of a class session also allows for deeper discussion. I would've liked to have some progress report or other assignments due at earlier points in the semester so I could gauge how I was learning the material and possibly adjust if I wasn't; having 100% of your grade being based on the final paper is a little stressful.",
    "Overall, the course had some interesting subject matter, that is not covered in my other classes. It was interesting to hear about issues and topics in environmental and occupational health, which may be useful in the future. I felt the course was geared more toward small groups, so it would be helpful especially if the class is as big as ours was, to split people up into small groups for the rest of the semester. I enjoyed the classes where it was more interactive and involved small groups. I felt the first class session could have reviewed the course more, especially since I had trouble understanding the importance and relevance of every class and topic to the overall field of environmental and occupational health.",
    "Too many guest lecturers and the course was not structured very well"

    "Instructor: Mark Bernard Russi \u00a0Dr. Russi's lectures were those that I got more out of from the semester in relation to the other lectures. The discussion component was helpful in our understanding of the topics. One critique would be that his background in medicine made some points that he made difficult for those students without medical knowledge or application.",
    "Instructor: Mark Bernard Russi \u00a0Excellent in almost every single way. Extremely interesting and clear. One tiny thing is that he should try to write a little more legibly on the chalkboard. I know this seems small, but the majority of his lectures are brilliantly presented without slides. This makes what he writes on the board more important and it would be nice to know what he wrote, especially if we didn't quite hear something he said.",

    "Instructor: Martin David Slade \u00a0Poor",
    "Instructor: Martin David Slade \u00a0Dr. Slade was very insensitive when discussing topics that were potentially triggering and very alarming to a number of students in the class. His approach to and discussion of the topics he covered were very off-putting in that they often were brash and minimizing of events and situations that made us uncomfortable. Occupational health can have substantial and sometimes detrimental impacts on workers and other related groups and individuals. Minimization of such trauma and impact is irresponsible as an educator and practitioner.",
    "Instructor: Martin David Slade \u00a0Also an excellent instructor. I think he presented very well. My only concern lies in his World Trade Center case study. I wish he had given the students a bit more information on what the lecture would entail (footage of the attack on the World Trade Centers) prior to class so they can decide whether or not to attend without their peers watching them get up to leave.",

    "It's fine. If you can find a more interesting EHS course, do that. If not, this is okay.",

    "The only assignment in the course is a take home final. Come into the class each week, listen to some interesting lectures, and take some notes and you'll be good to go. A low stress class that is very informative.",
    "If you are looking for a laid-back elective lead by incredibly nice professors, I recommend taking this course. The workload is very low, as we have no homework assignments or a midterm. There is one take-home final which is essay-based, and it's honestly fun to write. I will say that I could not relate to several of the occupational exposures being discussed, but they were nonetheless fascinating to learn about. Mark and Marty are two of the nicest professors I have met at Yale, and they make up for some of the more dry lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was interesting and provided a good taste of what occupational and environmental health is.",
    "you can learn many epi cases with various topics",
    "I would not recommend",
    "Excellent. Workload is small but a lot of knowledge is introduced",
    "Highly recommend for a solid overview of epi issues scholars find in occupational health studies!",
    "Basic EHS course to learn about various environmental and occupational health issues. Doesn't go into extreme detail. I would recommend it if people were thinking of looking into these fields.",
    "Unless it's smaller, I don't think I'd recommend it to another student. It's less engaging in a big setting",
    "I would recommend this course, it is a fun class with lots to learn",
    "Yeah, take it.",
    "For a class that fulfilled the EHS requirement for SBS students, it was very straightforward.",
    "I think this class is helpful in that it highlights a sector of public health that not many think of.",
    "enjoyable course with lots of diverse subject matter. Very approachable for someone without a science background that has an interest in occupational health",
    "Definitely take this.",
    "If you want to learn, take a different course",
    "The course requires very little outside work, which is definitely a benefit if the student has a busy semester otherwise. But I did get very little information or knowledge out of the course itself. I would not recommend the class to another student based on my experience and the knowledge I got out of it. The backloading of the grading in that the only assignment for the class is a take-home cumulative final exam made its completion stressful and difficult, though the discussion of the final exam by the instructor during the last class session did make it more approachable.",
    "I strongly believe that this is how a course should be taught. Compelling and knowledgeable lecturers who work through the material with you. I also liked how there was no homework except reading. All you had to do was read, come to class, participate and absorb the information. The formula is simple, but this was the class I learned from the most this entire semester. The final was also extremely reasonable and fair. It adequately evaluated you on the concepts and themes of the class without feeling too challenging. I recommend this course for anyone interested in the topics and\/or need to fulfill the EHS requirement.",
    "Good learning opportunity with applicable topics. Easier course.",
    "Seems like public health 101. A good course to meet the environmental health rec.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a seminar-style class and discussion, or anyone who is interested in learning about occupational health but doesn't have a very specific topic of interest.",
    "The course covered topics important to environmental and occupational health and included guest lectures covering a range of topics. I would recommend this class to students looking to get a general overview of environmental and\/or occupational health.",
