   "comments": [
    "To anyone interested in historical linguistics, i would really recommend the course. Likewise (at least if the TA stays), anyone looking for a relatively easy class. People looking for a broad introduction could also gain a lot.",
    "NO.",
    "Summary: An overview of the elements of language and how they relate to the historical study of languages and language families. Includes information on sound change, morphological change, the comparative method, internal reconstruction, and dialectology.Recommendation: I would definitely recommend this course as it was. Unfortunately, though, Prof. Insler will not be teaching it again, so it is hard to say anything of substance about the course in the future. Try it and find out.",
    "Overall, this was an interesting course. Some of the homework assignments were frustrating if you didn't have any background in linguistics and thus didn't have a good grasp of some of the more fundamental ideas such as phonology and morphology. Although it is a little bit of a stretch for someone who hasn't taken linguistics, it is quite manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Prof. Insler (though I don't know if he'll be teaching it again). The class has the potential to be quite dry and boring, but Prof. Insler really brought it to life. I took it as a social science person looking for a humanities credit, and certainly fulfilled my needs there. The workload isn't bad at all, with moderate amounts of reading and a weekly problem set. No papers. I took it having already taken Intro Linguistics, but don't feel intimidated if you haven't taken that yet--most of what was needed (e.g. phonology, morphology) was reviewed in class. It's quite an interesting subject, which, like most linguistics classes, makes you think twice about your language use.",
    "A relatively easy course for someone with linguistic experience. Maybe an engaging class for someone's first taste of linguistics.",
    "Historical linguistics is a survey course about the changes of language and the ways that they occur. We studied Phonological, morphological, and semantic changes, as well as the methods we go about predicting change, reconstructing previous languages from what we know about how language changes, and so on. I really enjoyed this class, and I recommend it, as a humanities credit, as a linguistics class, or just as a random class that seems interesting. It was my favorite class this semester! The readings, homeworks, and even the final were interesting.",
    "Historical Linguistics provides an introduction to how languages change over time. Topics include sound changes, morphology, reconstruction of dead languages from their descendants, and philology (the study of texts to analyze the languages in which they are written). The teaching was excellent, and the material was very interesting. I highly recommend the course to anyone with an interest in languages.",
    "112 is a great intro course to the humanities side of linguistics. It is very different from most of the other science and theory-based linguistics classes. It was refreshing.I recommend this to anyone who wants to see what Linguistics is like.",
    "This class gives a good introduction to many of the topics in the wide field of historical linguistics. Nothing is done in amazing depth, but many topics are covered. I left feeling like I had a good basic understanding of the field, though I'm probably not going to take any further linguistics classes.The class was fun and very little work, so I would recommend it to people who feel that they are interested.",
    "this class is fun, the material covered is quite interesting",
    "I would recommend this class. Professor Insler is an interesting guy--it's a pity that he's retiring."
