   "comments": [
    "A wonderful class! Professor Keil is a great lecturer, and he clearly cares about the subject material that he teaches. You will (almost unintentionally!) learn how to think critically about studies and issues within developmental psychology, and you will be provided with many compelling and memorable studies that you'll be able to use to discuss developmental issues. HIGHLY recommend taking this course.",
    "If you want an in-depth look at developmental psychology, this class is great. Prof. Keil is a very experienced researcher and teaches quite well. The workload is quite a lot but the course is interesting and useful.",
    "You will learn so, so much. This is fantastic for those interested in psychology (like me), but not so ideal for someone who is unsure about how much they are willing to invest in the course. If you want to do well, you will have to do the readings (readings cover 90% of the lectures, lectures cover 60% of reading, so if you don't like overlap, definitely read the textbook). Exams are a set of 5 and 7 essay prompts selected from a list of 30 for the midterm, with an additional 30 for the final (so you will have to be prepared to write any 7 of 60 essays). The paper is a solid amount of work (~4000 words), but you will have to prepare sections of it for weekly working group meetings and thus the main effort is spaced out over time (also, you get to choose the topic).",
    "This course is very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about childhood development. It does require a lot of time commitment, especially in preparing for the midterm and final. It is overall a very good course.",
    "I recommend this class only if you are absolutely interested in the topic.",
    "Definitely take the class if you have any interest in the material! Absolutely a great Psychology core requirement. There's a substantial amount of work around the midterm and the final, but otherwise workload is manageable.",
    "PSYC 140 is a great class, even if you don't think you're that interested in developmental psychology. I took it cause I had to, but ended up loving the material. There are weekly working group meetings which are not painful as long as people come prepared, and the TFs do a great job of getting you started and helping you write your big research proposal paper at the end!",
    "PSYC 140 is an interesting course that goes through the basics of developmental psychology. The material is captivating, but the format of the midterm and final necessitate cramming; a list of 30 questions given a week before the midterm, 5 of which will be asked in class; each takes about 30 minutes to prepare. An additional list of 30 will be given a week before the final, and 5 of those will be asked on the final, in addition to two from the midterm list. Despite this format, I would recommend the course to a fellow student interested in anything about psychology. It's amazing how complex and fascinating development can be, and Prof. Keil's course illuminates this through numerous studies and conceptual ideas.",
    "I would highly recommend!! This is one of the best psychology courses at Yale! Do not be put off by the large workload. It's totally manageable if you stay on top of things and you get so much more out of the class for putting in the work. Professor is terrific. TFs are great (Rick is the man!) and the unique section format makes section something you look forward to. This class I worry is underrated and many psych majors are missing out on some of the most important material in the field. Seriously, in many ways, developmental psych is what makes it all hang together.",
    "A good class. Particularly interesting to write the final paper on a topic of your choice. The tests take a lot of preparation but are a fair assessment of the course material.",
    "A good overview of developmental psych. While some material was familiar to me as someone who has already taken several intro psych\/cogsci classes, I always left lecture having learned something new and interesting. Would recommend for psych majors, people interested in the mental lives of children, or anyone who wants to know why reading at a young age makes you nearsighted, what babies think objects are capable of doing, or whether human gender roles are apparent in other primate species.",
    "I don't understand why more people don't take this course -- the subject matter is really interesting, Professor Keil is really great, and the workload is totally bearable. I understand that some people might be turned off initially because it seems like the class might require an extensive time commitment, but all of the course components are totally manageable. The weekly working groups discussions are really interesting and help you get a good grasp on the lecture material through guided discussions. The working groups are also super helpful once you start writing your paper. The paper is a bit long, but Professor Keil has you work on it in stages throughout the semester so it doesn't feel like a lot of work. Plus, you get to design your own study for the paper which is a really interesting way to apply what you learn in the class. The exams take a bit of preparation since he gives you possible questions ahead of time, but that makes them easy one the time comes to actually take the test. I think that anyone, regardless of their major, would benefit from taking this class to learn more about child development.",
    "This was a great course, and Professor Keil was a wonderful professor. I wish I had kept up with the readings and studied more throughout the semester instead of trying to cram before each exam. There was a lot of overlap between the textbook and the lectures, so Keil did a good job of reinforcing the readings with every class. He's quieter and less dynamic than some of the other professors I've had, but he's still a very good lecturer and takes questions well.",
    "Good class! A little redundant if you've taken a lot of psych. Professor Keil can be dry and 75 minutes can be a little long, but he really knows his stuff and you learn a lot. Also working groups instead of section is fantastic.",
    "The course is well done. Well organized, well taught. Not a lot of work besides right before the midterm and the final. One thing to consider is that the way the class is designed, your grade is based on 1) your weekly debate responses (which by attending working group (section) you are more than prepared for), 2) midterm and final (for which he hands out a sheet of essay questions, 30 for the midterm, 30 more (60 total) for the final, and you will prepare by using the book, not by using your class notes), 3) final paper (which you will prepare for in working group and not by using class notes). So basically, this class is designed in such a way that you really shouldn't ever go to class if you could use the time doing other homework because what is required of you for an A is that you attend working group, you turn in your weekly responses (300 words), you do well on your midterm and final (which you study for from the book), and you do well on your paper (which you prep for with the book, with the internet and with your TA)",
    "Yes, I will recommend this course to other students. It's an interesting and practical course to understand children and ourselves. So it's a good way to learn how to influence others, especially children, in a constructive way.",
    "This class is a great comprehensive overview of all the psychology from before birth to just before adolescence. It is incredibly interesting (we were all clearly at our coolest when we were babies) to look at human development in this way, and Professor Keil is the best."
