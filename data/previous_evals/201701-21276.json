   "comments": [
    "A lot of work, similar to CHNS 130, but you get used to it very quickly. In fact, this is a strength, because it reinforces your knowledge, and makes it that you are constantly engaged with the course.",
    "The teachers are incredible but the workload is too much. It caused me so much anxiety and stress daily. I couldn't focus on my other courses as much as I would have liked due to the twice daily quizzes and intense busy work. I learned a ton but found it hard to juggle this with 3 other classes.",
    "The professors really care about their students and offer extra help and support when needed. The material is interesting but fast paced",
    "I am very good about learning to read and write the characters but I could always do better with speaking and keeping up with online assignments.",
    "Great professors.",
    "This class focuses a bit too much on memorization, I feel. Instead of doing oral presentations on essays written in class, projects that include group conversation could be more beneficial to learn how to communicate properly. Overall the class was very educational and enjoyable. The teaching is phenomenal and the textbooks used facilitate a good education of Chinese."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the teachers are phenomenal. They make the learning very easy!",
    "Yes. This is probably the fastest way to learn Chinese outside of visiting China. Keep in mind that it's a ton of work.",
    "If you want to study Chinese take this course! It is a lot of work but the professors are incredibly supportive and helpful",
    "I absolutely loved the teachers and would recommend this to anyone serious about learning Chinese!",
    "Definitely the most work of any of my classes- daily quizzes that require 1hr+ of studying plus another 30min-1hr spent on homework each night. That being said, my chinese improved a huge amount in the course of the semester. If you're taking this class, i would only do a 4-class courseload (did this course as my fifth class and it was very stressful).",
    "Take this course if you've taken Chinese 130. If you test into Chinese 140 there is a strong reliance on material specifically learned in 130 so you may have to play a bit of catch-up."
