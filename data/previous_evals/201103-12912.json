   "comments": [
    "The readings are fun; the workload is not too high (3.75 hours of class a week plus about 6-8 hours of homework a week, I'd say); and you learn quite a lot of Japanese. There isn't that much opportunity to get speaking practice in class, unfortunately. Keep in mind that this is a 1.5-credit class (though it certainly is less work than some 1-credit classes I've taken). If you meet the prereqs for this and want to study more Japanese absolutely do so. Murata and Seto senseis are quality.",
    "It's the standard fare of the Japanese department here. Studying for Kanji Quizzes is an absolute must, since they are a mainstay in class. Make sure not to forget the little things like your self-evaluation reports, etc., as everything goes to showing your commitment to Murata and Seto sensei's curriculum. Take it!",
    "Yes it's a wonderful language class at Yale!",
    "It's basically just like JAPN 150 in terms of having readings and discussing them in class, plus grammar and kanji. Kanji tests every class were difficult at times, but you get used to them. This class definitley improved my reading and writing skills, but there was not too much concentration on speaking\/listening.",
    "Great intensive Japanese course for someone who is serious about the language. The workload is manageable and is consistent throughout the semester. The readings are interesting and it is a fun class environment.",
    "Seto-sensei and Murata-sensei are a great duo in teaching the class. However, I wish there were less focus on reading and more on speaking and listening. Maybe it is just because it *is* a higher level class so it is difficult to allot time to speaking when it's so crucial to read higher level texts. Expect a lot of kanji memorization and reading comprehension practice. Also, even though the opportunities to talk in class aren't a lot, it's a good class to take if you want to maintain your Japanese and really want to be able to read real texts.",
    "One of my favorite classes this semester. This class focuses mostly on reading; for homework we read newspaper articles, short stories, and other authentic Japanese materials and discussed them the next day in class. There are daily kanji quizzes, for which the number of kanji you're expected to learn is significantly upped from previous courses. They can be a bit difficult at times, but you'll definitely see your reading skills improve. Murata-sensei and Seto-sensei are both incredibly funny and friendly and make class something to look forward to. And there's no final, which is another plus.",
    "Pretty much a continuation of previous years' courses with daily kanji quizzes, homework readings, questions, and grammar. The daily quizzes got tedious and took a lot of time but other than that, not an impossible class at all."
