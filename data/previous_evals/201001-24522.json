    "This course is amazing!! You study a series of colonial texts (\"colonial\" referring to either the colonial period of American history, or to colonial power relations) that are paired with contemporary texts that respond to colonial themes and tropes (examples of pairings include Mary Rowlandson and Sherman Alexie; the Salem witch trial documents\/court records and The Crucible). The course blended the historical and literary quite well. The makeup of the group could affect the seminar's dynamic a lot (we had a closely knit group of five, which worked great for us, so it's hard to predict what it would be like in othersituations since this is the first year it's been taught). Work includes manageable weekly readings and reading responses (which aren't intense -- just graded on the basis of whether you do them, and a way to get thinking about the texts). In addition, each student chooses a colonial text of his\/her choosing, and writes an academic essay on that text, accompanied by his\/her own creative response to it (some people responded with poetry, some with prose, some with comic book strips, some with pamphlets, some with teaching curricula -- the sky is the limit!). This component of the class was so cool -- the point of the course was to see how contemporary authors respond to and incorporate colonial themes, and what better way to think about this than by doing it ourselves with our own creative responses to a colonial text we've researched? Professor Brander Rasmussen is an amazing teacher -- extremely friendly, accessible, and knowledgeable on a wide range of subjects. Don't miss out on this class!! There should be more like it at Yale.",
    "This is a magnificent seminar that I would recommend to all majors!If you are an American Studies major TAKE THIS CLASS!!! The reading list is absolutely wonderful and the workload is very very fair. It was nice to be in a seminar that did not assign an inordinate amount of reading because it meant that we had time to really analyze each document on our own and time to really discuss them individually in class. Each week we would look at a colonial document (such as a captivity narrative) and then the following week we would look at the contemporary document that addressed that very colonial documnet (such as a work of fiction or a poem). Every week we had a reading response due which was easy to do but also a great way to begin thinking about the works at a deeper lever. We read awesome works, and reading the original documents that would later influence and catalyze popular contemporary works (such as Beloved and the Crucible) made reading the contemporary works so much more interesting and insightful. At the end of the course we had a final research paper due that addressed a colonial document of our choosing. It was very fun to do. What made it even better was that this final project had a creative assignment portion to it (we had to respond to the colonial document that we chose in whichever fashion we wanted--some wrote poetry, one girl made a series of cartoons, another a series of travel brochure). What I am getting at is that the final project was really fun to do! Also, Professor Brander Rasmussen is absolutely wonderful! Awesome professor who really knows her stuff and made discussions very interesting. Take this class!",
    "Amazing course! One of the best courses I have taken. A seminar, but not too much work, and the professor is flexible about the final paper toipc (I wrote about comic books). Professor Rasmussen is incredible, and the material is surprisingly waaaaay more interesting than you would think from the title.TAKE IT!!!!NOW!!",
    "yes!!"
