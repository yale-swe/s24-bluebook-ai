   "comments": [
    "I would summarize the class as a research based approach to a developing field of linguistics. Take this if you are interested in the brain. The final project is also very interesting -- developing your own experiment. The course is also very cumulative, which is helpful when studying for the exams. Theres also no final!",
    "Good course that actually requires you to THINK. (as opposed to many biology-oriented science classes at Yale). Take it if you are up for a challenge.",
    "Since this is a very specialized course, I'd only take it if you know you're interested in neurolinguistics. You'll be reading a lot about aphasias, which means a looot of reading about Broca's area, Wernicke's area, etc.",
    "This class is great - you learn a LOT about past and current research in neurolinguistics, understanding the progression of different theories for yourself. The homeworks are pass-fail, so you just have to complete them - but the class is usually small and you've GOT to be prepared and have read the readings (which are sometimes long) carefully, because Professor Pinango will expect you to be able to answer questions! She is really great at explaining things and making the material interesting, but you might not like her teaching style if learning about things that aren't clear-cut isn't your thing. There isn't always a straightforward answer - it's about learning how to analyze and think deeply about the topics. The two exams are pretty straightforward, as long as you pay attention in class. The final paper (designing an experiment) was sort of tough in that we did it at the end of the semester and didn't have THAT much direction... But again, you have a lot of room for creativity and independent thinking with it, and that was fun. I would definitely recommend this class if the topic interests you!!",
    "This class is tough, it's a lot of work, it's intimidating and you really have to stay on top of all of the work. Don't come into this class thinking that you can get away without doing the reading REALLY CAREFULLY, because Prof. Pinango has no problem calling you out in class.This class will be difficult if you don't have a linguistics background, and you will definitely have to put more effort in if it's your first linguistics class."
