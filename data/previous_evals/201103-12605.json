   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course, or any other course with Professor LeVen. As a bridge course, this class focused on learning how to read Greek with some fluency and therefore included some review of grammatical concepts. However, there was also a generous amount of discussion of the texts as literature. Professor LeVen has high standards for student performance, which means that a course with her will make you improve your Greek. (This is wonderful and most appreciated.) She accommodates the course's demands to students' needs, though, and is never unfair. She's also a delightful person to have as a professor. She has a good sense of humor, cares about her students, and is very easy to contact by e-mail or in office hours.",
    "I would not recommend this class if you are already taking Latin. I would also not recommend it if you do not have a great amount of experience with the Ancient Greek canon. Get yourself in good stead with Plato, Homer, and Thucydides first. Lucian spends a lot of time satirizing these authors, so it would be more fulfilling to encounter them first.",
    "This class is awesome. You'll learn a lot, and Professor LeVen is amazing. Lucian is also a fascinating guy. If you're on the fence about this class, don't be: take it.",
    "Definitely. Professor LeVen is wonderful and Lucian is fairly straightforward. Just be prepared to look up a lot of vocabulary."
