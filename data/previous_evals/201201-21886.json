   "comments": [
    "I actually wouldn't recommend the MB&B major to a fellow student in my situation. The major is not so undergrad focused, and the professors are not very articulate. I entered biochemistry thinking that this would be organic chemistry of the cell, but it ended up being just an incredibly difficult course in molecular biology (the first half of this course was more traditional biochem, but also very detail-oriented and not so much about chemical principles).",
    "A course in genetics mixed with a course in certain parts of cell biology. That said, taking cell biology in advance or at the same time is very helpful. It's a great course that exposes you to some of the fundamental experiments in biochemistry. There is a great deal of work that has been done that I had not previously been aware of.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Joan Steitz is one of the most accomplished, eloquent, and humble scientists out there, and it is such a pleasure to hear her lecture. The material is completely manageable if you don't put it off until the last minute, and the exams emphasize the scientific process over rote memorization. You'll learn a lot of really cool concepts, but more importantly you'll learn how they apply to real life experiments. This was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale!",
    "It's a large volume of information, but it's possible to do well. The exams are generally pretty fair. I found it harder than first semester.",
    "Really great course; fairly tough with lots of material, but the tests are for the most part fair and focus *heavily* on analysis of experimental results that are given. Make sure you know how to read a gel! Readings in the textbook are totally unnecessary. Make sure you come to class though since some of the slides aren't comprehensible without annotation and the group problems are really good practice.",
    "It's a pretty awesome class. I don't know if it would be as good without Jsteitz, but the material is ridiculously awesome. it's mindblowing. biochemistry is awesome, and this class is a fantastic way to learn it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course! It's very helpful if you do any biochemistry research.",
    "Incredibly difficult course but also incredibly worthwhile. You learn a ton about how scientific research is actually conducted\/the way we know all that we do in the owls of biochem. Definitely worth taking but be prepared for some challenging exams.",
    "I think I would have to say that I am happy that I took this course. It was very painful while in the midst of the semester but now, the amount of material that I feel I know (or at least was exposed to, haha) is incredible and I really feel like I became a much better scientist as a result. This is not a class for the faint of heart, because it will destroy you rather regularly. I liked the attendance policy since it rewarded the dedicated students and the problem sets were never THAT long, usually. Exams were really really hard because they didn't really test what you had studied, but rather your ability to analyze the results of experiments presented in figure-format (ie no explanation, just a random gel). In this regard, it is not a traditional science class. Overall, if you are really serious about being a scientist, this is a class you should take (or perhaps it will help you figure out if you want to be a scientist). For me, it really solidified my interest in biochemistry (so glad I chose MBB over MCDB) but I do think it's intended as a weeder of sorts, to get rid of the more casual scientists. If you take this class, just try your best and be glad that you have the opportunity to learn from such amazing scientists and people (how Joan Steitz does not have a Nobel Prize yet is beyond me). You will get through it, but it might be a rough semester.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class! Be warned it is far from easy. Mostly because there is so much material and because the caliber of the students in the class is so high. But it's a great class. Incredibly interesting and I found Joan Steitz in general to be a good lecturer. Schlieker I did not enjoy as much.",
    "If you have to take it, then be prepared for tons of studying and memorization - this is one of the toughest classes at Yale, but taught in a very organized, interesting, and digestable manner.",
    "It's a difficult course that teaches you about DNA-RNA related processes at the molecular level. The tests are not pure regurgitation like the MCDB biochemistry course. It is more likely that you are given data and asked to draw conclusions from them, which is the main takeaway from MB&B 301. \"What are the data? What conclusions can you draw?\"There is a lot of reading in the Voet&Voet textbook and oftentimes the assigned readings are taken out of context, so they don't make sense. I would not recommend this course for non-majors.",
    "You learn a lot about nucleic acids and the history of the research field; the class emphasizes a lot on hands-on applications, such as experimental approaches and data interpretation, so it's not just a class for memorization and therefore much more interesting. Definitely take it if you are interested in biochemistry.",
    "If you don't have to take it then don't take. You go to lectures not knowing a thing about pseudogenes and you leave not anything about pseudogenes until you cram the night before the exam. I felt that primarily I had to teach myself the material. Also, the exams are hard. The 60% of the final exam was pretty much an IQ test and the remaining 40% random facts that were obscurely mentioned in lectures.",
    "Great class to learn about biochemistry and to think about the field experimentally. I'd recommend it if you're interested in the field.",
    "The class is hard. You're taking it because you have to. But it's pretty interesting. Just like the information is really dense.",
    "A tough class. It seems like all the smartest students take this class and the professors run through the material so quickly during lectures that the only way to keep up is to make sure to review the lectures after class. Professor Schlieker was the biggest weakness for me because his lectures weren't as clear as Professor Steitz's (but then again Prof. Steitz was the best science lecturer I've had at Yale). The class itself was all right. The quizzes in class were good even though it was hard for me to have grasped the concept that quickly in class to be ready to take the quiz. But it forced me to pay attention in class. I felt as though there was a lot of material to study for each exam but I think it's important to speak with the professors and TAs about HOW to study for the exams. They are certainly not only about memorizing details. Once you do that you should be fine.",
    "This class was an incredibly worthwhile challenge. The course material spans some of the most important concepts, from both a biological perspective and a biological perspective. This is evident in the sheer number of Nobel Prize winning research that we cover. This class will be your first real intro to how science is done, and how scientific research builds on itself, more so than any lab course at Yale. Joan Steitz is an amazing professor, researcher, and person. It is great to learn about some of the material from the very person who discovered it. There are a few ways I can think of for the course to improve. First, the slides need to be reorganized in a much more logical order. When I studied for tests with friends, this would often be the biggest challenge. It was often difficult to get the pieces to fit together (e.g. is this slide an example of the previous slide's general mechanism, are these two slides separate things, is this slide's experimental conclusions contingent on the previous slide's experiment, etc.). The slides themselves can also be worded more clearly, and extraneous details MUST be removed, since there is already an insanely vast amount of material that students are responsible for. Also, more resources need to be available, such as practice midterms and a practice final. All that said, the course is not as scary as some people might make it seem. It can be an enjoyable and rewarding process, as long as you put in the time (AT LEAST a few days, or even a week, of studying before each midterm). Also, this class will teach you that primary scientific literature is your best friend. It might sound daunting and like more work, but going to the primary literature for p-sets was a life-saver.",
    "This is a really work-intensive, and tough class. Only take it if you really love the material, and the rest of your schedule is fairly light. Sometimes I felt like the course was pointlessly detailed, but I definitely learned a lot.",
    "This is a good class--I think you end up learning a lot. It's quite different from first semester. I thought first semester emphasized principles more, while second semester was very detailed and also had a large experimental focus.(I probably liked first semester a little better, but in the end second semester is probably just as useful.) The Voet and Voet textbook is extremely detailed; I would recommend that you do the reading if possible, but make sure you go through the lectures first so you know what in the textbook you can skip over (which is quite a bit...crystal structures, etc.) Professor Steitz is super knowledgeable and its a privilege to be in class with her. Overall: this class will be pretty hard, but you should take it!",
    "One of the most difficult classes I've taken, but incredibly interesting. I loved learning about the research behind the information we learned, complete with the experiments and their data. Chances are if you're considering this class you need to take it for the major, but either way I would recommend it!",
    "MB&B 301 is a study of the biochemistry of nucleic acids. The course's pedagogical style relies heavily historical experiments and experimental strategies and analysis. Its content and style is very relevant to a wide range of biochemical research.Different students approach this style with different attitudes.For some, the historical approach allows them to experience for themselves the wonder and the a-ha! moments of science.For others, the historical approach is a chore: \"Is this really the fastest way for us students to understand RNA?\"Your attitude will only determine how pleasant the course is - not how instructive it is. Every student will leave the class thinking more like a scientist than before because of their new attentiveness to seeing the logic that connects data to conclusions.",
    "If you are taking this class, you probably have to for your major, so this review isn't really gonna sway your decision much. BUT if you want to take it just for fun, its a good class. This class goes more in depth about processes you probably know well (transcription, translation, replication, etc.). It requires lots of memorization, and I'll probably forget the majority of the things that I learned in this class, but that's ok!!",
    "If you're taking this class, you are mostly likely required to do so by your major. Let it be known that it is not quite as fun and awe-inspiring as first semester, but you are definitely going to learn a whole ton of biochemistry, and biochemistry is very interesting.A big focus, the heart of the course I would say, is teaching the students how to think critically on an experimental basis in order to see how this science has been built up in key areas. The focus this semester is on DNA and RNA, and the proteins involved in related processes of DNA replicaction, transcription and translation. There is a lot of material, and the tests are hard, but you can do it.",
    "This course isn't like biochem I. It's harder, less cohesive\/organized, and more experiment-oriented. You need to be more independent in this course. You also need to think like a scientist: you can memorize every detail from every slide of every lecture, but if you can't think critically about experiments, you'll have problems in this course. At times, that can be frustrating. That said, I learned a lot about DNA\/RNA in a lot of detail.",
    "MB&B 301 is very informative and fair, but the material is a bit more challenging than MB&B 300 (first semester). Very genetics heavy, with focus on performed and potential experiments as applied to what you have memorized.",
    "As this course is only required for a MB&B major, I only recommend it to people who major in MB&B. It's a challenging class, and you need to spend a lot of time and effort to learn all the materials presented in class. If you only want to study general concepts of biochemistry, this class is beyond that scope.",
    "Lots different from first semester but you spend a lot more time problem solving. Our final exam involved analyzing lots of gels. Class is hard but you learn a lot",
    "The most difficult but rewarding science class I have taken at Yale. Regardless of what my grade is, I know that this class has made me become a better scientist.",
    "A fantastic course, the midterms are fair. The fall and spring Principles of Biochem have been my favorite courses at Yale.Prepared to become very comfortable with the idea of recognizing what the data in an experiment are, and what the possible conclusions can be. Some of the test questions have data and gels taken from actual scientific experiments, and you get to analyse it the same way the original authors would have.Some more helpful tips:-keep an extra copy of the quiz from each lecture (don't worry, it's not graded, its basically a way to keep attendance). They are fantastic study guides before midterms. Make sure you have the answers written down, though, since they don't post them.-section with Dave Rawling is great.",
    "A very, very difficult course, but ultimately very rewarding. Don't expect to get a good grade, but you will feel like you've mastered biochemistry.",
    "I would recommend this class, it is harder than MBB 300 but also more interesting. Struts and Schleiker are both really good teachers",
    "This is an extremely difficult course. There is more information in this course than I have learned in any other course at Yale. I would recommend this course because it is all great information to know. It is just like four semesters squeezed into one.",
    "Take since you need to as an MB&B major, but since you'll benefit from it. It's great, and if you pay attention to the lectures and study repeatedly you'll do well.",
    "It's a great class that will teach you a lot if you put the time into it. Do NOT fall behind.",
    "You'll learn a ton in this course, but what are the data? You learn a lot only due to how competitive the class is, and how hard you must study as a result. Overall quality is lower than first semester, although the material is pretty interesting. Among the weaknesses: unclear powerpoints, mandatory attendance, and too much information to possibly remember for the final exam. Some of the worst explained topics were DNA supercoiling and the Holiday junction. On the plus side, the grading of problem sets is more fair than first semester.",
    "Take it if you are very interested in biochemistry or genetics (almost everyone in the class took it because they had to for the MB&B major). It is worthwhile to go through the textbook readings after the lectures for anything that you don't understand, as it explains everything pretty well.",
    "if you like biochemistry, this class is exactly that. it essentially covers the biochemistry of critical prokaryotic and eukaryotic processes, with some auxiliary topics such as immunology and cancer biology. having to learn biochemistry for a class (which essentially involves memorizing all the information that would have been otherwise really interesting in smaller, unobligatory doses) can be really frustrating, since there are no real unifying principles in biology, so you just end up memorizing functions of protein subunits and the order of protein-protein interactions. it was a struggle to get through, but i feel like a better person after having taken it, and i do feel like i have a better background in biochem now.",
    "This is a very difficult and competitive course. This should only be taken by someone serious about MB&B, but that being said, it is a good course and you learn very useful information.",
    "If you have to take it, yes. I do not think it is the best taught class.",
    "Keep up with the reading. I read voet&voet and used some of the figures from lehninger. If you're an MCDB major but heard that MB&B was better taught, it's not worth an extra semester of the course."
