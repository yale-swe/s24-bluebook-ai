   "comments": [
    "The class size was too large to get too much out of it. Would be better if limited to 15 students. Too many undergraduates.The lectures given by the professors were good but the guests, although impressive, didn't contribute much to the overall course.I think the instructors assumed that more people will actually have a career in global health and, as such, tended to be very critical of what we did. While good for those who are interested in these careers, for those who are not, it is a difficult course to justify doing the amount of work required.",
    "The main strength of the course was the practical skills it provided us. The group presentations were probably the most nerve-wracking, unpleasant assignment I've ever had, but they were a great experience to have. All of the speakers we had were fantastic and so relevant for the course. The main weakness is the disconnect between the theoretical content of the lectures and the assignments. It was during the midterm and group projects that I realized how difficult it is to define an appropriate problem, objective, indicators etc. These concepts had seemed so straightforward in lecture, but we really struggled with them in the assignments. It would have been nice to have more practice with them throughout the course. I think it would have been helpful if each theoretical lecture had a practical application for the last half hour of class. Another recommendation would be to space out the assignments more. There is so much work in the last few weeks of class. It would have been nice to either move the presentations to a little earlier in the semester, or have the midterm due earlier and have some other earlier deadlines for parts of the final paper to make sure we're on track. The final paper was really sidelined in the last couple weeks as we prepared for the presentations.",
    "Strengths: great professors and invited speakers, well planned and coordinated.Weaknesses: the class is new, and many students may not be familiar with the class content.Improvement suggestions: the class will be more interactive if you ban laptop use",
    "I really enjoyed the course. The interesting subject matter is a strength, as well as the outside speakers. I also enjoyed the presentation assignment. Perhaps we could have more presentation assignments, as that portion of the course seemed to mimic what we would face in the real world.I feel like the midterm and the final paper as the only assignments could have been improved. I would have much rather had to write smaller papers (perhaps 1-2 pages) each week or every other week so I can get more feedback on applying strategic thinking to global health. From working on the final paper, I felt that I was either getting it correct or completely off base.",
    "Great comprehensive approach, but some difficulties related to catering to an audience with varying backgrounds.",
    "this course was interesting and all in all very good. as it was a new course, it suffered some growing pains but i think it's on its way to becoming one of the greats. the guest speakers were a perk, as was the experience, knowledge and care of the instructors. sometimes i feel like we lost focus--especially during the two sessions with the workplace psychologist--but i learned a lot of things i believe will be applicable in the real world. i know the course was supposedly half undergrads half masters\/upper level but to me it felt overrun with undergrads. while i appreciate some undergrads, at yale my experience is that they have way too much self confidence (hubris might be the word)that is rarely backed up by quality work or insight. i know the course is meant to blend people from different experience levels and backgrounds, however, it might be helpful to open the class up to other graduate students throughout the school?",
    "STRENGTHS: Knowledgeable and energetic instructors; high level guest speakers; group presentation activity; coverage of leading global health topics with up-to-the-minute readings from both academic and gray literatureWEAKNESSES: Not enough time spent working through examples of strategic problem solving together in class (MDG and Haiti examples were too quick). Some elements of the strategy process remained sequentially unclear (how do you set a SMART objective without some idea of your strategy?). Criteria for evaluating strategies were not a part of the assignments; these merit more attention next time. Also, distinction between general 'strategic thinking' and 'grand strategy' in global health should have more discussion.IMPROVEMENTS: Consider splitting group assignment into two elements: (1) strategy design process, in which groups present to instructors as an 'internal audience' all the steps in their process; this would be to assess students' understanding and application of the strategic problem solving approach; then (2) strategy presentation to policy maker audience, in which groups present to a panel of entirely external members (not instructors, although could be other Yale staff, students, etc.). In this presentation, students are trying to make their best 'pitch', which need not necessarily include each step of the strategy design process. Instructors could be in the room to grade the presentation but the actual substantive questions would come from the external panel members."

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0I really enjoyed Professor Bradley's lectures. I would have liked for her to have given more lectures on the strategic thinking portion of the course, however, as that is something that we are not exposed to very much.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0She did a great job.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0obviously great--focused, organized, direct, offers insightful sharp comments without being hurtful, genuinely cares about students and the direction of this course",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy brought the perfect mix of gravitas and enthusiasm to the course. On the one hand, she set high standards for students in their group presentations and written assignments, and emphasized the lives and dollars at stake when students were imprecise or unprepared. On the other, she was open to input and new ideas from students during her lectures and actively participated as a 'student' when guest lecturers came to the class. Her evident passion for the subject matter was inspiring as was her demonstrated investment in and vision for helping students become leaders of strategic change.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Fantastic! Not only were each of the instructors excellent, but I loved that all three of them came to each (or nearly each) class. In all other team-taught courses I've taken, the instructors only come to class on the days they are lecturing. I liked that the instructors all complemented each other in terms of their style and expertise.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0The class was well taught!",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Professor Curry was great.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0She did a great job; very sensitive to student needs.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0leslie is great--smart, organized, approachable and funny.",
    "Instructor: Leslie Curry \u00a0Leslie is an exceptional instructor. As a lecturer, she is energetic and clear. Her perspective on selecting appropriate indicators was one of the most valuable aspects of the course. Leslie is also adept at giving constructive feedback on assignments, pointing out both strengths and areas for improvement. She brings a terrific positive spirit to the classroom and to one-on-one conversations with students.",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0Fantastic!",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0The class was well taught!",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0Professor Skonieczny was also very good. He offered an interesting and unique perspective. I felt like sometimes his lecture slides could have had more depth (although this is understandable, given that this is the first time the course is being taught). Nevertheless, he seemed like he really cared about us learning the material.",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0He was a good instructor. Seemed the least involved, but I know he doesn't have a teaching background.",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0mike is also great--i wish we had gotten the chance to hear more from him",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0Mike's contributions to the course were really valuable. His real-world experience working on global health strategies and policies was a great resource, and lent particular weight to his comments. His 'tales from the DC trenches' were great ways to think about how the theoretical material we were reading could make a difference in practice. Mike's presentation style was smooth and easy to follow; it was a good example for us in practicing our own group presentations."

    "Interesting class although only recommended for those who have lighter course loads or who are interested in a career in global health or health consulting.",
    "I definitely recommend the course! Considering this was the first year it was taught, it was a very good course and I'm confident it will be improved in the future.",
    "I would highly reccomend this cource!",
    "This course is great overall. I learned a lot, although I wish there were more opportunities to practice what we learned (other than simply 3 assignments) and more feedback. Given that this is the first year, I feel like they will iron out some kinks and make it better next year.",
    "Covers many issues related to global health, coupled with the strategic problem solving framework.I would absolutely recommend it to others.",
    "you will learn to apply strategic thinking to public health problems (sorry sort of self explanatory)yes i would recommend it--especially if the number of undergrads is reduced.",
    "This course will teach you the principles and steps in strategic problem solving, as applied to global health issues. It gives a solid overview of the leading issues in global health (MDGs, HIV\/AIDS, tobacco control, etc.). The course features guest lectures by some VERY high-level policy makers and academics, which are great 'real-world' views on how global health strategy is made. The course instructors are high energy and class discussions require high levels of participation. There is also a major group project at the end of the class that simulates a professional briefing to global health policy makers.The course is probably best suited to undergraduates (juniors and seniors) or first year MPH students. Other students with limited background but strong interest in global health would also enjoy and benefit from the class."
