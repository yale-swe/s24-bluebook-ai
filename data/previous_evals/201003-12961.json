    "I was disappointed by the class.At first the faster pace was fun because you don't stay too long on any one thing. Then it becomes obvious as the material gets harder that the teacher moved on entirely too fast. The class is intensive, but that's not excuse, the teacher could have made it more manageable.The lack of organization makes the syllabus almost random, and that's why the class was a problem. Farina will have you do 150 words of vocab, and then only 30-40 the next night. He truly doesn't know how to spread out the workload.In addition the professor adds a bunch of wacky, useless assignments that end up adding extra time to your already over-Italian-ed schedule. It ends up being busy work rather than any real language practice.Please take this to heart. I went to the first class with the highest hopes. I even woke up every morning for the first months at 5 am to study before each daily quiz. After a while, it gets ridiculous. You'll get pissed off more than a few times throughout the year because the teacher makes the class more work than it has to be.If you can't show up every day and flatter his ego, you'll have a hard time surviving the class.Not once did this guy ever have a planned grammar lesson, not once did he write something clearly, with some semblance of order, on the board. Instead you get chicken scratch and random rules to remember.You learn it on your own with any mistakes you make, then you get quizzed and graded on those mistakes, and then you do endless grammar drills that only further entrench the mistakes you learned. Only AFTER you blow a quiz does he care to correct or actually TEACH the grammar.he also adds random extra busy work. example: No homework over thanksgiving break, but a 8 minute presentation, random class project, and a novel to read four days before the final exam.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IMMEDIATELY! You will be able to speak Italian coherently by the end of the semester, which is a pretty amazing feeling. The daily quizzes aren't bad, and the majority of the workload is really the time spent in class, but it is completely worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. It is challenging but worth it. The class is demanding. It requires 10 hours of class time a week plus homework and preparation for class. Yet if you are up for the time commitment you will be so rewarded by this class. Not only do you learn so much, you have an enjoyable time doing so. There are certainly mornings when the class seems too long, but overall, I was always glad to be there.",
    "A huge challenge, but worth it if you want to either get the language requirement over with fast or want to immerse yourself in the language.",
    "This course is intense for a reason and I would only recommend this course to someone very interested in learning Italian. I love the language and if you are interested in taking Italian and do not mind meeting for two hours everyday, then I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Intensive is the perfect word to describe this class. Although at times exhausting, you finish one semester able to communicate and write in Italian."
