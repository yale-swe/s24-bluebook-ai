    "Physics 608 with Professor Appelquist is the best taught required class for first years.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any students who wants an introduction to the advanced topics of quantum mechanics. The course is challenging, but allows one to appreciate the scope of the discipline by connecting topics like path integrals and the Dirac equation to already well known classical results.",
    "Fantastic course, true eye-opener.",
    "PHY608 is a difficult class which require a strong commitment. Homework is heavy.You should take PHY608 only if you really like QM... or if you have to take it."
