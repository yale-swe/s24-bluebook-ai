   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I feel like the Professors can really make or break the class, and Professor Larsen really made the semester enjoyable and gave me a love of Philosophy. I feel like I've learned a lot from him.",
    "Yes. Take it. It has been the best educational experience of my life.",
    "Philosophy will probably be the most difficult of the three DS courses, because it'll be unlike any other class you've encountered unless you're one of the rare few who was exposed to philosophy in high school. Nevertheless, philosophy ended up being my favorite DS class and I'm even considering becoming a philosophy major... we'll see.The two most important authors you'll cover this semester are Plato and Aristotle; the other authors are not really that important in comparison. Aristotle can be difficult to deal with just because his language is so confusing, but I promise that the ideas will start to make sense the second time around.Once you start getting the hang of philosophy, it's absolutely mind-blowing and addicting. It teaches you a different way to THINK, and even if you come out of class hating philosophy and never wanting to take another course again, you will still have gained valuable critical thinking skills that you'll appreciate at some point in your life.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student with a strong interest in all the humanities. I would summarize this class as the weird and often misguided theories of dead white men.",
    "The Directed Studies Philosophy section is what one would expect - a survey of great philosophical works of the Western cannon. The course's only weakness is an inability to cover each work in depth. However, I still found the course extremely rewarding, and it has affected the very way I think.",
    "DS Philosophy is an overview of the Western Philosophical tradition. It covers a lot in one semester, and a lot of the material is daunting, but by the end if you read most of the assigned stuff you will crystallize enough info to have a pretty good idea of what the philosophers said regarding different ideas.Only take DS if you know you like to read and you have enough time to do DS and have a social\/athletic life. It can take your life over if you let it, so it's also important to know when you have to read things and know when you only have to \"read\" things. Overall, if you can reconcile those two things, I definitely would say to take it; I feel like I should know everything it teaches, and that its curriculum is important knowledge to have for the rest of college.",
    "Fast-paced overview of ancient and early christian philosophy. Discussions were interesting, but tangential and often did not contribute to an understanding of the basic premise of a work. The majority of the lectures contributed NOTHING to the understanding of the average student who is new to the material, but were also extremely esoteric and tangential--clearly written for the benefit of colleagues rather than students.",
    "As far as DS goes, this course has perhaps the lightest reading, though it is in many ways just as difficult as Lit. or History. Perhaps this course offers students the most opportunities to think imaginatively and creatively about the given texts. I had a very good experience with Philosophy overall.It also could be said that Phil. contains three mini-courses: Plato, Aristotle, and Christian philosophy. You really do devote about a third of your time to each.",
    "DS Philosophy in the first semester is a fairly thorough look at the work of the major philosophical thinkers work (Plato and Aristotle) that will form a foundation for philosophy in later centuries. Though it is a lot of reading, if you are at all interested in an introduction to philosophy, this course is probably a good choice.",
    "I would recommend Professor Larsen to others. As I said above, my experience with this class was not all together positive, but I don't think it was due to Professor Larsen--more to the people in my section. Overall, he is great in office hours and as a professor in class (...when we gave him a chance to speak!)"
