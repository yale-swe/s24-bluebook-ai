    "Great",
    "Awesome class if you love books and want to learn how to do letterpress printing. We go into some background on printing and books (including a paper to compare two books held in the Yale collections), but most of the class is dedicated to making 3 projects: a card, a broadside, and a small edition book. It's very time consuming, but definitely worth it in the end.",
    "Great class. It can be a bit hard to finish course work on time due to restrictions on press time, and the final project will probably set you back a chunk of cash, but a really neat seminar altogether.",
    "I would definitely recommend Art of Printed Word!! Take it especially if you've never had experience with letterpress printing! It's a really fun class and the work is very rewarding. Although the projects are time-consuming, it's work that's fun to do and entirely different from that of most other classes. Throughout the semester, you work on three letterpress projects and one paper comparing two books. Many of our classes were held in various libraries on campus, which is great because it makes you aware of many resources Yale has to offer. Again, if you can, definitely take this class!",
    "A MUST-TAKE. This amazing seminar is an introduction to letterpress printing (with a lot of interesting forays into book arts, graphics, the history of printers at Yale and elsewhere, and more.) You do three projects- small cards, large broadsides, and a final book project. Richard Rose is incomparable- a genuinely great guy, super knowledgeable about printing and book arts, and has a lot of interesting anecdotes, tips for printing, and recommendations of great book stores in the area. You will spend a lot of hours in the press room working on projects, but you won't even notice it. Letterpress printing is an awesome (and vanishing) skill, and the chance to formally learn about hand-printing is an opportunity practically unique to Yale. Richard is amazing, the course is amazing, you should certainly take it."
