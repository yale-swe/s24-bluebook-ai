    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a05 stars for Austin! Very gifted teacher - knows how to listen well, redirect people's comments to the topic at hand without them feeling stupid, and move the class in a specific direction. I think he will make an excellent professor. He is also incredibly kind.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0I cannot sing enough praises of Charles\/Austin Rivera. He was engaging in section (which happened to be at a tough point in the day to keep everyone's attention), and always available to meet about papers or questions. Section was always a productive and fruitful complement to the week's lectures.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Austin's clarity has been extremely helpful as well as his capacity to really listen to each one of us and discern what was most important for us to understand and remember. His capacity to synthesize the ideas and organize them so that it would be easier to keep them in mind and confront them with those of others was of infinite value. I was usually left with the impression that I understood the materials I know there is a bit of illusion in that - since there are always more nuances - but at least I have been given the possibility to remember the main issues\/concerns\/points of debate, and that is not a small thing. During the term, we were asked to give feedback. My main remark was about the fact that our questions put on canvas were not always addressed (at least not explicitly, although we could get our answers, on our own, during the section) and Austin truly listened to it. Our group was a very lively and most interesting one so, again, 50 min felt like 15 min and a lot (if not everything) was usually covered. An enormous thank you for this outstanding quality of work.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Austin is excellent at managing a class against and agenda. He encourages appropriate participation across the group and is free with his time to help explain material and coach. The section is a central feature of this course and Austin is a very good teacher in this format. I learned a great deal from the well-facilitated exchanges with my talented classmates.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Loving man. His sobriety in handling the material as is appropriate. An able teacher both in section and in the one wonderful lecture he gave. Offers good clear clarifications in section. Seems to really care for the students and for the God he loves and seeks to serve.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Austin was an outstanding example of an engaged, helpful, and knowledgeable teaching fellow. His sections were always well-organized, making good use of the weekly discussion questions submitted. He will go on to be a very successful instructor.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Austin is easily one of the best Teaching Fellows I have had since coming to Yale--8 courses, all with a TF. His sections were wonderfully prepared, and thoughtfully presented. He encouraged questions and always answered them concisely and appropriately, but still managed to have time to cover everything he had planned to present. He was particularly adept at leading discussion in fruitful directions and encouraged the class to get to know one another and trust and benefit from different view points. I did not know most of the people in my section so this was particularly helpful. I also liked the way he began every section with a prayer, similar to what Prof. Beeley did--but touching on each of the topics to be covered in section as well in thoughtful ways. He is extremely well organized, and clearly knows the material in depth. It was hard to put forward a question that he couldn't respond to fruitfully, even though without definitive answers. I also liked the way he made time to meet with section members to discuss paper topics, or to clear up questions after the section. I never had the sense he was rushed or put off by any question of concern. Extremely well done! Keep him as long as you possible can as TF!",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0He was excellent at outlining the overview of whatever we had been learning that week and I appreciated his help in discovering resources for my research paper. Furthermore, I appreciated his encouragement of class discussion and participation, and his lecture on Origen's spiritual exegesis was one of the ones that stuck with me for the entire semester.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Well-communicated areas of importance in the course. Engaging in class. Prepared us well for major issues \/ subjects that were discussed in exams.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Excellent at condensing complex theological concepts and facilitation class discussion. Group activities were very helpful and selected texts helped spur conversation.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0-Made himself available to meet with students to discuss difficult content, paper topics, etc. -Did a fantastic job leading our all-too brief discussions for section. -Provided helpful feedback on work and exams.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Mr. Rivera was a great T.F. He commanded the material well, as did he command control of the sessions. He was energetic, and a good lecturer. Students would benefit having him as a teaching fellow.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Austin did an incredible job facilitating and leading discussions in sections, which always helped us gain a better picture of readings and lectures of the week. He was also very accessible through email. His one-time lecture on Origen was amazing too!",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Excellent. Well-organized, embraced thoughts other than his own and successfully clarified any questions we brought up in class. Also knew how to facilitate lively and instructive discussion, which is a rare trait in any teacher. THANK YOU for all your hard work this semester.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Austin was always well prepared for section, and has wide knowledge in the topic. He encouraged class discussion, and encouraged students to come up with their own answers to questions with his assistance. Sometimes the section pace felt a bi rushed if we were bogged down with a certain topic, and it then seemed like another topic wouldn't receive due attention. Overall though, Austin was friendly, articulate, wise and well-organized.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0Brilliant. Austin has a talent and a gift for teaching. He is as natural in front of 40 students as he is in front of 12. I maintain my above mentioned skepticism about the ubiquitous presence of TFs in graduate courses, but if there has to be a TF in any course, the students should hope for Austin.",
    "Instructor: Charles Augustine Rivera \u00a0-Consistent preparation for each discussion section -Thorough knowledge of the subject material and ability to convey it clearly -Patient, friendly, and effective in facilitating discussion",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0Daniel did a nice job of summarizing complex concepts covered in lecture. He allowed students to ask questions and engage with the material. One criticism would be related to the online discussion posts. They were not utilized in section.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0Strengths - earnest, thoughtful, smart, kind, knowledgeable Weaknesses - I would have liked to see him direct discussion more - sections were a little shapeless. Also, there were a few areas where he did not seem fully familiar with the material (e.g. Augustine).",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0Very good at leading discussions; relaxed, thoughtful presence; didn't try to accomplish too much in sections was always open to student questions, comments.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0Danny was very clearly knowledgable in all of the subject matter, but many times I felt like his teaching didn't actually help us learn. He employed the socratic method so often that I was never really sure what he was actually teaching, and what of the discussion was just conjecture. It would've helped to have had clearer learning objectives in each section.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0Danny was very kind and responsive to emails, but I did not find him to be a particuarly effective TF. Often in section we would ask questions and they would be deflected back to the class with the question \"what do you think?\" While this is likely sometimes a helpful mechanism, often it is not. I was told that section was supposed to be the time when we synthesized the material from the week. Too often I left section feeling like we had not done that and instead had spent 50 minutes talking about minor, relatively unimportant portions of the material.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0Danny seems like a very sweet and decent human being. As a leader of a discussion section, however, Danny seemed uniquely unqualified. To be fair, even the most skilled discussion leader would have found directing our group like herding cats. That being said, Danny did little to keep us on track, or to help elucidate the often dizzying aspects of the theological debates in question. One had the unfortunate sense that he was as lost as we were. I have no doubt that Danny will make a great researcher or scholar, but when it comes to teaching there is much that he could stand to pick up before he finds himself at the front of a classroom. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh; I'm just trying to be honest. Again, Danny seems like a very sweet person. But his section was an utter waste of time.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0He was great at encouraging us to think of and look for the answers for ourselves, but the problem is that it worked only sometimes. And when studying for the exams, I felt like some of those topics could have been covered more clearly and in depth in section. The way section was set up was to help us engage with the material, which was great, but it didn't necessarily help us learn what we need to learn for the exams.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0Danny was always prepared to lead section, more than willing to answer student questions and made himself available to meet outside of class. Very generous and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0I thought the sections were well-planned, especially on the tougher weeks when there had to be a didactic element as well. Danny answered questions, helped guide discussions, and was good at fostering an environment that I was excited to participate in. Sometimes the sections took a little work to get rolling it seemed, not sure if some of them could have used more planning to alleviate this. Overall, though, I don't have any strong criticisms.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Eastman \u00a0Danny seemed a little timid at the beginning of the semester but appeared to grow more comfortable as the semester went on. His introductions at the beginning of the section were usually very helpful in summarizing the main points of the week. Sometimes, however, it seemed like more structure was needed during \"catch-up\" sections."
