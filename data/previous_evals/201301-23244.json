    "It is a course worth taking",
    "Take this class to improve how you organize your thoughts on personal statements, and to read some really interesting model essays.",
    "I was told in the beginning of the year that Engl 120 was a must-take, if not in the freshman year, then at least in sophomore year. People made a huge hype about the big-name Engl teachers like Strebeigh and Ehrgood, but honestly, we're at Yale - all the Engl classes are going to be pretty good.I went into the class thinking it would help me in writing papers for other classes. It doesn't really. All the essays (For McCabe, only 5) are personal, so they don't directly contribute to improving your writing in research or argumentative papers. The class did, however, teach me to think more carefully about the words I type and the sentences I craft for the papersSo yes, I'd recommend the class (especially because the weekly readings are all very interesting) but I don't think it's as necessary as all the upperclassmen make it out to be.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it; it's definitely one of the classes that people should take in their stay at yale",
    "Definitely. Learn how to write something other than an analytical piece.",
    "I was constantly writing, but the organized syllabus and rhythm helped a lot. There was either a draft or revision due every week. The drafts had to be good or else the revision would require way too much work. Definitely see residential writing tutors for outside help because they can help you organize thoughts."
