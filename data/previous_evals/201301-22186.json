    "Very good senior seminar in economics.",
    "ECON 471 is an enjoyable introduction to some important topics in cooperative game theory. It's a fascinating field with a lot of literature and research, and Professor Dubey is brilliant and clearly an expert. The workload is very fair, and Professor Dubey makes a big effort to keep assignments reasonable. He makes himself available to students and is a very personable and engaging lecturer. However, you do need a pretty solid background in economics, game theory, and mathematics to really benefit from this course. I would recommend taking at Linear Algebra before enrolling in ECON 471. The lectures, also, can sometimes be disorganized, and we covered a fairly small amount of material in great depth. It's a good course with an engaging professor about an interesting topic. Enter with the right motivation and math background and you could get a lot out of it.",
    "A math class, not an Econ class. Dubey is a ridiculously good lecturer, funny, and wise, but does not engage with the class or make himself available to students.",
    "It is a class on cooperative game theory, which is a bit different than the competitive game theory course taught by Professor Pollack. I would definitely recommend it, mostly because Professor Dubey is awesome. I will warn students however that the proofs discussed in the lectures are sometimes difficult to follow if you aren't familiar with linear algebra or haven't taken many classes with proofs.",
    "Pretty easy, 3 problem sets for the semester, an easy in-class midterm, and a final paper due at midnight toward the end of exam week. Don't start the term paper too late though or you'll end up turning in a crappy 8-page one at 1 AM.",
    "This class was great. True, I didn't understand what was going on for a good portion of the semester, and I was definitely not mathematically ready for the proofs we would go over each class. That being said, Professor Dubey is wonderful, very engaging and quite helpful when it came to writing the final paper.",
    "An interesting econ seminar, probably different from anything else you've ever taken.",
    "It's a great class. Very chill, very interesting. You learn cool things and it is not too tough. Professor Dubey is fantastic.",
    "Great class, clearly taught by Dubey and pretty easy. The only downside is Friday at 9 but a great Econ seminar overall.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "I would recommend Economics 471 (Cooperative Game Theory) to students looking to complete the senior requirement in economics and who have enjoyed past courses in game theory. Students who have taken Economics 159 should not just assume that this is a continuation course; the field of cooperative game theory has many differences from the noncooperative game theory taught in other Yale courses. This course, as taught in spring 2013, covered one- and two-sided matching, core, Shapley value, voting games, cooperative bargaining, games of transferable utility, the Shapley-Bondareva theorem, and other topics. It was also lower workload than other economics courses (three problem sets, an in-class midterm exam, and a term paper of flexible length). Although the class is on Friday mornings, Professor Dubey would teach enthusiastically and with passion to maintain interest among students in the class. This course is absolutely indispensable to anyone with a broad interest in game theory and a willingness and desire to learn much of the theory of cooperative games.",
    "I think the main strength of the class lies in the material\/topic, so unless this is an area that naturally interests you, there's no point taking the class. The class itself is really interesting and fun (probably because as a cog sci and econ double major studying behavioral economics and decision making, this is super up my alley) and the professor is amazing. I hope Yale hires him (he's currently a visiting professor only). He makes the class very stress free, which is important, but at the same time you do learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in a slightly more mathematical\/algorithmic approach to economics. Prof Dubey walks you slowly through the algorithms and calculations so there is really no mathematical background needed--you just have to feel comfortable seeing long equations on the board every morning. The class was very nebulously structured so if you're someone who has to have a perfectly defined syllabus in front of you from day 1 then this class is probably not for you. The workload was extremely light though--three homeworks, 1 midterm, and 1 paper. Almost everyone did well on the paper and if you collaborated on the homeworks you could easily do well on those as well. Thus because of the loose structure of the class and low workload it could be easy to receive a grade slightly lower than you think you deserve just because there aren't that many opportunities to distinguish your performance from your peers.",
    "yes if you are an econ major",
    "Great class! As far as economics seminars go, it is easily one of the best (in my opinion). Not only is Professor Dubey incredibly smart, he is incredibly helpful and accessible to students. The class format is also very nice - lectures with a few problem sets, a midterm test, and a final paper each making up a third of the grade. I would definitely recommend this class."
