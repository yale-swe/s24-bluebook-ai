    "130 is tough. It's a lot of work, and you need to do it all. Not as hard as 110, but harder than 120. Curriculum-wise, it's what you'd expect: More grammar and more vocabulary to memorize.",
    "It is a course that will force you to become better equipped with the language. You focus on writing and more importantly reading. It's a great introduction to more advanced Arabic.",
    "It's a steep learning curve for most like the L1 class was, since this course focuses heavily on reading comprehension and inferring word meanings from context. Tests include reading passages that can be somewhat difficult, but with practice, by the end of the semester they were totally doable. I'd recommend the course with Sarab- she really cares about the subject and her students as well.",
    "Arabic 130 is a very predictable course given the way L1 and L2 went. It's nice because you actually start learning more practical communication (long-form writing, more complex syntactical structures, useful vocab for describing social issues, etc.), but you definitely won't be highly proficient and independent when you leave the class, unlike something like Spanish, where you might be functional in another country or full-language classroom by this point. Professor Al-Ani is the best Professor the Arabic program has, so I definitely recommend continuing the language if she is teaching it.",
    "130 is kind of a leap from 120 in terms of reading and vocab because we look at real-world Arabic texts instead of those designed for learners. In order to really understand the texts, it will probably require some extra vocab studying. The class is Arabic only, so no speaking in English. But, again, it will take some out of class work to develop comfort in speaking. Especially in dialect. Regardless, if you see yourself using Arabic in the future, take the course!",
    "I would recommend it! I learned a lot!"
