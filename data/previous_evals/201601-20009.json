    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura Carlson is a genuine, authentic, and kind theologian. It is an honor to have been taught by her.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was a great TF. She managed discussion well. She had exercises that were helpful. She encouraged us to listen to each other.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is constantly keeping herself in check and make corrections in her approach as she teaches her lessons and speaks to me about the material. She is innately modifies the lesson as she progresses through her objection in section. It is apparent she enjoys her work and seeing students learn the material. There is constantly verbal praise and affirmation as she develops her lesson during section.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Ms. Carlson is truly an exceptional and deeply devoted scholar. However, she as teaching fellow needs to be trained to understand and appreciate the value that all students bring to the class. She lacks experience in dealing with adult learners, as myself, where she is guided by personal biases rather than being impartial. Her partiality is obviously made apparent when she grades papers and exams. Her arbitrary and non compromising attitude hurts her credibility. I may not be as versed as she is in biblical studies, but as a successful 54 year old man in my own rights, I know the difference when Im treated as a third class citizen.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is quite enthusiastic and knowledgeable. She exhibits an awesome humility which is endearing. This makes her approachable, kind, and extremely fair. I find her sections to be so informative as she is always well-prepared. She engages with the material in a scholarly yet simple way that learning is made easy and natural.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is great, and she did a wonderful job of leading section. She was outstanding.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0The TF system at Yale is compromised by a shortage of TFs that fit the teaching area they are placed in. My experience with some has been dreadful. Yale would be embarrassed if they saw what was going on in some sections. BUT NOT SO WITH LAURA. She is magnificent! So very highly intelligent. Her section classes have a purpose and specific goals. She is sensitive and engaging. We all think the world of her. She was incredibly attentive to grading papers and responding to email questions and request for guidance. She always responded within minutes. She knows the OT area cold. Students says publicly things like :I love Laura.\" I hope one day she becomes a professor here. She is a true super star!",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura was a fantastic teaching fellow, who clearly cared about material, but who was also confident enough to allow for discussion to occur organically. I appreciated her writing student ideas on the board because it felt as if our ideas were being listened to.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura, was so helpful. This semester I faced some serious family issues and she was there to help me. Any time i emailed her, she did not act as if she did not want to be bothered. Her patience and help was very important to me. She really cleared up a lot of things for me in section. Her ways of engaging the material, topics, and text was very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is one of the top four or five TFs I've had in 10 semesters at Yale and Harvard. Her enthusiasm and energy, command of the material, support of students' original thinking, and genuine excitement about students' ideas is inspiring. It's also clear that she thinks about how to include the voices of students who aren't as outspoken or extroverted.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is absolutely wonderful! The amount that she is able to get done in a 50-min section is incredible. Her planned activities are always so well thought-out, and she gets us thinking in really critical ways and building off of each other in an edifying way. She is great at facilitating discussion and is just generally very warm and fun.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Sharp-Carlson, what a duo! These two were a great compliment to each other! Laura engages the room, brought out questions and left nothing unanswered. I have nothing negative to say about Laura and I can find no weakness. Keep her as long as you can! Laura Carlson is an asset to Yale and would do well to teach immediately. Don't let her go!",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is such a pleasure to work with. She is smart, knows her stuff so well and is so passionate about the sessions content. In fact, her enthusiasm is contagious! Sections were well organized and everyone had a fair chance to participate. Take home points were always part of the class and Laura was available for questions throughout the semester as needed. It is important to feel the assurance that a TF is knowledgeable on the thematic content they are to guide us through, and Laura is certainly on top of the topics discussed each week. Also, Laura's feedback on exams and papers is clear, pertinent and thoughtful. It is feedback that we can act on for future reference. Laura is a great asset to this course and any others that are lucky to have her as a TF.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura's comments on my exegesis were substantive, considerate and very helpful. As was her help in determining my approach. She clearly loves what she does and is very good at getting others to that same level of appreciation of the subject material. She is supportive in helping us learn and she made herself available as needed. I am grateful to have had her as a teaching fellow this semester.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0She is smart, knowledgeable, focused, and fair.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0She was incredible. Always prepared and made the information accessible. What an amazing TF!",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is a fantastic TF, the best I have had at Yale. She makes room for all voices and ideas and encourages strong section participation. She knows her scripture, too, which is very important (my TF last semester was not as strong in scripture and the class suffered as a whole). Laura was always available for talking over paper topics or class material. I will miss her!",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is truly fantastic and will make an amazing professor. She is extremely knowledgable, kind, and appropriately critical. She did an excellent job both encouraging our section and pointedly challenging our ideas. Her academic guidance is unlike any other I've had in a TF. I've tried, and I'm not sure I have anything critical to say about the experience.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is an amazing TF -- she is very knowledgeable of the subject matter, and has a genuine enthusiasm for teaching. I don't have any suggestions on improvement.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0I wrote a really thorough and positive reflection on Laura Carlon's work last term. I was delighted to have her as my TF again this year. I cannot believe how fortunate I was to have had OT sections with her for the whole year. She helped me to love the OT and to appreciate it fully. The combination of Prof. Sharp as lecturer and Laura as TF made the term wonderful for me.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura is simply outstanding. Her leadership of discussion sections was engaging, informative, and never failed to elicit enthusiastic and on-point discussion from the class. Her manner is engaging and inspiring, and the academy will be the better when she takes up a professorship.",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura rocks! She is approachable, friendly, really knowledgeable in the field, gives great feedback on papers and tests. I love her",
    "Instructor: Laura Katherine Carlson \u00a0Laura's comments on papers were invaluable. She had a clear lesson plan for every class and facilitated healthy, rich discussion between us.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark seemed very nervous about teaching a graduate class, and his nervous energy seem to pass into the students in our section - sometimes it felt like a struggle\/quite stressful. But the content of the conversations were interesting and sometimes fruitful. Mark's instruction would improve by being conducted more calmly, and making sure he makes clear what he is asking the section to discuss. Occasionally, his nervous energy also translated into making comments which weren't necessarily relevant or appropriate to the discussion we were having, and seemed to throw people off. That being said, it was clear that he had put a lot of time and energy into thinking about section and trying to make it useful.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Sometimes felt disorganized, but Mark's enthusiasm was great.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0I thought Mark did a really good job involving everyone in discussion and I found his comments and guidance about the paper and the exam helpful.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark is super enthusiastic and really excited about having engaged discussion. But he's also not an Old Testament scholar, so I think the students in Laura's section were given a significant academic advantage over those in Mark's (I say that having heard everyone's rave reviews of her, and having gone to one of her sections).",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0I was REALLY frustrated that the TF was not a biblical scholar, that's just not okay at the graduate level at the the divinity school. I also did not appreciate when he would say \"your God, not mine god,\" I respect the fact that he is an atheist, but again this is a grad school at a div school.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark was very energetic (sometimes I found it to be a little much) and always willing to have further discussion and help students beyond the time of section. Sometimes Mark talks a little more than he should (like during exams). This is not necessarily directed at Mark, but Mark does fit in this category. I find it rather distressing that for so many of my classes here at YDS I have had TFs who are not studying in the field they are the teaching fellow for. So in Mark's case, having a TF who is not getting a PhD in something related to the Hebrew Bible - or just the Bible in general. I've also had a TF for a history class that was a Hebrew Bible student.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0I appreciated Mark's enthusiasm but I also felt like he wanted to do too much during section. It felt like we were pressed for time in section. Also his email communication was not very good.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark had a lot of energy, and that was really good for a friday morning section. Sometimes his questions seemed to be looking for an answer, but that improved over the course of the semester. He was respectful of diverse views and he did a good job of challenging the conversation when we all were in agreement.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark is enthusiastic and funny, able at leading group discussions. Some find his style a bit much, but I appreciate his enthusiasm, as it made section bearable. I do think I would have benefitted from having a TF whose expertise is in Hebrew Bible, but I get that doctoral students are stretched thin as it is.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Strength: Tremendous enthusiasm and passion for the material and for teaching. Mark made every member of section feel valued and heard. Weakness: Sometimes inarticulate in asking questions of the class and in conveying what was wanted in answers. More \"practice\" (and perhaps preparation) might address this issue.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Great job.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark was very enthusiastic and kindly in his facilitation of section. I think a few deep breaths before teaching woods be helpful. Also, think about not telling students something is really hard. It is meant empathetically, but can also be a little disempowering. Calmness in exam admin is also recommended. The final was much better than the midterm.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark offered the opportunity for much discussion, bringing up interesting and engaging questions regarding the topic. Improvements might be made in giving more time for student to think through the questions that he offers, being comfortable with a little more silence before moving to the next thought or question.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark needs to (and does) work very hard to clarify his intent and expression so that his ideas are accessible and helpful to students. He is clearly very intelligent and capable, and has many opportunities to hone his pedagogy to become helpful and beneficial to students. Given Mark's enthusiasm for his work, I am sure he will lean into these learning opportunities. I look forward to hearing over the next several years about his growth as an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark was terrifically energetic, engaging, and seemed genuinely excited by the material and excited to be in conversation with us as we learned.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark was great and really went out of his way to connect with students.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark is an enthusiastic and energetic TF. I enjoyed the discussions in section and think that he facilitated these discussions well. He was flexible about meeting to discuss assignments.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0I admired Mark's enthusiasm for the course and for our course sessions. He was always open to the different ideas we brought to the table, but I felt like I would have liked a little more structure to our sessions. Often times we started the discussion with an open ended question, which I valued but also wished we walked away with some more concrete feedback on the material.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark did a nice job leading the section. The section was really primarily class discussion - which was good and probably the purpose. But I probably would suggest space for more teaching or questions about the lectures -- particularly with Isaiah.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark's enthusiasm for his teaching was helpful to a degree. He is positive all of the time, so a more critical voice and eye about his expectations and the magnitude of what we are doing would have been helpful. His test proctoring was not helpful for the way that his frequent talking and writing on the board distracted me from many trains of thoughts, especially while trying to recall much information. Better communication would be key about how to prepare for section more specifically would be helpful. At the time of my evaluation when my grade has already been posted, I have not received any feedback on my paper.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark ran a very engaging Section; he challenged us to perform, to seek deeper insight. He motivated thorough preparation, encouraged participation and sparked discussion with his range of experience in biblical text. He added meaningfully to my journey through OT. He seemed charmingly disorganized from time to time which added to his humanity.",
    "Instructor: Mark Joseph Holum \u00a0Mark was super personable, very approachable, and did a good job of getting us to dig into the material."
