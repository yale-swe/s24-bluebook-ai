   "comments": [
    "I learned the actual principles behind many aspects of language that I had thought about but had not previously studied.",
    "I learned a lot about the discipline of linguistics, since I had no exposure to it going into the course. More specifically, I learned how versatile the discipline is. It has application in almost every humanities and STEM field.",
    "The class provided an overview of major areas of linguistics. We learned some methods for linguistic analysis as well as the relevance of the field in understanding larger issues.",
    "This was a pretty broad introduction to linguistics, covering phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. Overall, the material was pretty interesting to me, and served as a satisfactory introduction to this discipline.",
    "I learned about the innateness of language in humans, language development in children, basics of phonetics, phonemics, morphology and syntax, and linguistic prejudice. The part about linguistic prejudice was especially valuable, and changed the way I thought about the way people speak and what it means in the context of social inequalities.",
    "I learned about the basics of linguistics like phonetics, morphology, and syntax.",
    "This course provided a really great overview of the main fields of Linguistics, though we did skip over Semantics :'( (even though this is Prof. Barros' area of expertise). We learned about solving phonology problems, drawing morphology and syntax trees, etc. Although the class was called lllusions of Language, the \"Illusions\" part was only briefly introduced in the beginning of the course and then squeezed into two days at the end rather than a continuing theme throughout the course. I think this course did sufficiently teach me enough to make me develop an interest in Linguistics though!",
    "I learned to analyze language on a deeper level. I think one of my favorite aspects of this class was having everyday phenomenas that I had never noticed in the past brought to my attention. I think the class was overall effective in providing short introductions to different ideas in linguistics.",
    "understanding of the basic principles and concepts of linguistics, and a greater appreciation for variation in spoken language.",
    "I learned about syntax, morphology, and phonetics.",
    "I developed knowledge about linguistics.",
    "This is a great introductory linguistics course. The theme \"Illusions of Language\" isn't so much of a focus as it is a nice sounding title. However, Prof. Barros won't be around anymore, so this might be different in future courses.",
    "Intro level knowledge of linguistics. Phonology, syntax, morphology, phonetics, and also linguistic prejudice.",
    "This class was absolutely incredible. I'd never taken a linguistics course before, and Professor Barros introduced us to all the components of linguistics (phonology, phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) in a really engaging and fun way.",
    "This class was a great introduction to linguistics in general, although I felt that we spent too much time in some areas (such as syntax) and not enough in others (pragmatics). Overall, it was definitely worth taking as it established a foundation of linguistic knowledge that I can easily build upon in the future.",
    "This course was a good introduction to basic concepts in linguistics. It was interesting to learn about phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax, but also within the context of society and psychology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The interactivity of the lecture varied from class to class. Some days I felt very engaged and other days I struggled to pay attention.",
    "I liked that the class was structured in such a way that it walked us through each sub-discipline of linguistics (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics), although we didn't get to the last two. However, our readings mainly consisted of textbook readings, which at times got monotonous. I wish there was a bit more of an exciting\/unique take on the intro course.",
    "The class and material were both interesting. At times the pacing felt a bit slow, but class was enjoyable.",
    "The lectures can be a little confusing, and I usually learned the concepts through participating in office hours or getting corrections on my p-sets. However, some lectures were fascinating and I definitely learned quite a lot in each class.",
    "I liked how this course was structuredwe started with how language develops in children and how language is inherent in humans, and we ended with linguistic prejudice. And all the basic of linguisticsphonetics, phonemics, morphology and syntaxwere sandwiched in between. Sadly, we did not get to cover semantics or pragmatics, but nevertheless I had a lot of fun in this class and I felt that we covered enough depth with the other topics. I think less time could have been spent on phonetics, phonemics and morphology, and more time on syntax. But otherwise, Im pretty happy with how this course went!",
    "Strengths: a solid overview. Weaknesses: Participation was not always invited.",
    "The focus on different fields of Linguistics wasn't that equal (skipped over much of semantics and the theme of Illusions was not consistent), but it was still a really good overview of Linguistics as a field, and I learned a lot. The problem sets were enjoyable too!",
    "This course would be easier to follow if the lectures weren't so reliant on repetitive slides",
    "A strength of this course is the material is reasonably interesting, and most of the people in the class were genuinely interested in linguistics. Weaknesses of the class were the read off the slide lectures and the lack of organization. I also think the class spans to much material so the professor is forced to give us a little bit of everything.",
    "Matt is great at making material accessible and understandable. There is lots of support from both Matt and the TA.",
    "This was a great class that taught me about language. It got kinda boring but that's to be expected from an intro class.",
    "Fun but disoraganized",
    "It was very interesting, but I wish the slides were more helpful.",
    "The lectures were great. Homework was manageable.",
    "Love this class! Lectures sometimes got off topic, but usually because people had questions and a sort of class discussion started.",
    "This class put a unique spin on intro linguistics by bringing in several linguistic illusions, and it worked really well. The illusions added an extra level of engagement to an otherwise simple intro course, and it helped us observe linguistic phenomena firsthand instead of just reading about them in a textbook.",
    "I would have liked to have been able to cover more concepts. On the other hand, I feel like I was able to develop a good basic understanding of the topics we did go over. This course have a good overview of what is studied in linguistics, as well."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class because it's not particularly challenging. That said, if you don't put in some effort on some of the psets it's easy to see your grade go down.",
    "I would recommend this course. Although the class is at times boring and monotonous, Professor Barros is really good for the most part and linguistics is a fascinating subject that has countless application. The class is also not difficult, but you still learn a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in linguistics.",
    "Yes, for sure -- this course serves as a great introduction to linguistics, and is suitable for those who want to major and also for those who just want to learn about the subject.",
    "This is a really fun class to take! It focuses on interesting questions of linguistics, such as how language develops in children and how linguistic prejudice continues to leave detrimental impacts on society. Certain topics covered in class can be gutty (its not too hard to get an A) but the topics are still interesting and there is a lot of room to go deeper. It can get pretty difficult toward the end, especially with syntax, but it shouldnt be bad at all if you do all the readings, come to class, and do a little bit of practice outside of required p-sets. Overall, this class is very chill (workload increases a little bit at times but its still much less than my other classes), and classes feel like discussions rather than lectures. Also, Matt Barros is so nice and helpful (he can come across as a little bit disorganized at times but I really liked him)! That said, if you want a little more intensive course, you might want to choose LING 110. What makes LING 106 interesting is its application of theories to the real world, and unfortunately that means that we have to spend less time learning about the theories.",
    "Yes--a good introduction to linguistics if you have little to no background knowledge about the field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this for anyone curious or even mildly interested in Linguistics! It is an excellent overview of Linguistics as a field, and Professor Barros was clear in his explanations and really approachable if anyone needed extra help.",
    "This class was not the best as far as structure and content. It is quite (like very (basically everyone got an A on the midterm and the final)) easy to get a good grade, but I don't feel like I retained much information at all. This class may be worth it if you are into linguistics and want to study other topics on your own. Otherwise, this class gives you too little of everything. Professor Barros is extremely approachable and helpful, but his lectures are not very interesting. I often felt that he was reading straight from the slides. Take if in love with linguistics or need an easy class otherwise you may find a more interesting class elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend this to everyone - you will gain a better understanding of how language works, and how we use it. Very accessible no matter what your major is.",
    "Yes! This class is great, especially if you want to learn about cool things we don't immediately notice about language.",
    "If you're interested in getting an introduction to linguistics, definitely!",
    "Yes, very cool course if you are interested in linguistics. The professor and TA are very helpful. Office hours as well as comments on psets give good feedback and direction. The lectures are very engaging and everyone has a good time talking about language and stuff.",
    "Absolutely! This class was phenomenal, the human capacity for language is mindblowing, and if I weren't a senior, I would be taking so many more linguistics classes in the future.",
    "This class is great for anyone who has some interest in linguistics. It was a reasonable workload and pretty straightforward, but the simplicity could be boring for someone who is looking for an in-depth ling course. The titular illusions of language helped make the class more engaging, but make no mistake: this class is not purely a study of linguistic illusions. Illusions were sometimes mentioned to illustrate concepts, but they definitely weren't the focus of the course. Even so, the class was interesting and enjoyable, and Matt is very knowledgeable about his field of study.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, if you are interested in learning about linguistics and some psycho-linguistics. The breadth of the course is good since it doesn't just focus on one part of linguistics. Even though the problem sets are complex sometimes, it is interesting and the process is kind of fun."
