    "This class is humbling and deeply fascinating. If you get in, you should certainly take it.",
    "Great course. Perhaps more niche than students realize at the outset\u00e2\u0080\u0094the course's material really falls in the sweet spot between meta-ethics and applied ethics. This means the type of questions you'll be discussing in class are at a very particular level; if you're looking to pursue foundational (i.e., meta-ethical) or concrete issues, the fairly narrow scope of the class may frustrate you. That said, the class has a lot more depth than your intro-level course. I usually left class glowing with that part befuddled, part exhilerated I've-got-to-reread-my-class-notes-and-think-some-more-about-things feel. The course dealt with ideas the way geometry treats diagrams: takes them apart, susses out their underlying meaning, and pieces them back together. It makes for good intellectual training even if philosophy isn't your chosen field.",
    "Great course! Very low on history, very high on intuitions: an interesting approach to ethics. It won't give you a set of ethics, but it will put you in a much better place to think about them.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It WILL kick your butt. Not because there's a lot of reading (there isn't, and I found that the supplemental readings were basically optional), nor because there are a lot of papers (just three, two 5 pagers and a 10 pager), but because the standards are so high. I grew a lot, I hope, in trying to meet those standards, and while he is tough (like, really really really tough), Shelly will go out of his way to help you and support you. This is a class that is actually about DOING YOUR OWN philosophy. It felt like training."
