   "comments": [
    "Yes. Pretty easy workload (one book per week), good lecturer, sparse writing assignments. the only annoying thing is that you have to do a reading response (200 words) every week.",
    "Make sure you take this course before leaving Yale! If you are not an English major and are petrified at the thought of stale ideas about American Literature, this course is for you. The concepts are not always easy or comfortable, but you will get plenty of support to get through them. You will be expected to do a fair amount of work (make sure you do the reading!) but it will feel rewarding in the end.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It was a new look at the types of novels that most students have probably encountered at some point in high school and college so the material was always interesting because it challenged us to approach the books in a different way. It was basically a more nuanced literature course.",
    "Take this course! Interesting material and relatively lax graders.",
    "take this class! the focus on race and gender is not so overwhelming that it clouds the beauty of the literature (one fear i had going into this course) and the professor's analysis of the literature is simply amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone who's looking to read some interesting books. However, it's the type of class that you already have to be invested in the material in order to really enjoy it. Don't take this class if you HATE literature, because it will probably not make you like it that much more.",
    "Simply the best.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, especially if you have the time to read all the novels. They are novels that should be in every American lit class but aren't!",
    "An interesting class for non-english majors looking to read some great literature. The syllabus is filled with good stuff, the professor is interesting, and the work load is relatively light. Read one excellent novel a week, and write two papers plus two short assignments and you're done. The midterm was actually really interesting and it's easy to find something to talk about in every novel. This class would be an easy fifth class or a great credit\/D (you can pass with zero effort), but it's absolutely not a gut and you should intend to actually do the reading. You'll enjoy it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The books are really interesting the I always wanted to attend lecture because I knew I was going to learn something important and insightful about them. The work isn't bad either.",
    "Race and Gender in American Lit is a great course if you want to read a lot of books that are really important in American Lit and in the study of race and gender. Professor Rasmussen is an absolute delight, the workload isn't hard, and you should definitely take this class!",
    "This was an AMAZING COURSE. I LOVED it. I learned so much, read amazing books, wrote great essays, and really felt like I grew as a reader and as a writer. I had an amazing professor and an amazing TA. I don't just write stellar evaluations on everything, this course was just one of a kind. The readings are fun and not too long, although you will be reading a book every week (some weeks she'll give you a break with shorter readings though). Still the reading is totally do-able and so are thew writing assignments. This was a fantastic course.",
    "Yes. One of the few good intro-level courses."
