    "Take this if you don't mind a poor structure but interesting material. Sindelar is very smart and caring and kind but sometimes struggles with organization and time management in class which can be frustrating. Final paper is tough if you're a senior and feeling checked out from school. All in all a very chill senior seminar. Don't expect to have your view of the world completely changed, but you will learn some interesting things and the environment will be enjoyable overall!",
    "For sure. It's interesting and Jody is amazing",
    "Yes. But be ready for lectures to be a little disorganised. Workload is definitely manageable. Weekly assignments, a presentation and a final paper",
    "As far as econ senior seminars go, it is a decent option. The subject matter is pretty interesting and the workload is relatively low, but the connection of the addictions material to economics is not always clear. This makes writing the final paper kind of challenging because they expected a pretty high level of economics in the paper. But overall, it is was a fairly enjoyable class.",
    "Yes! Good senior econ seminar that isn't too quant heavy.",
    "Yes -- especially if you're considering going into a related field!"
