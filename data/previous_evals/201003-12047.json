    "The class had a good mix of speakers from all different disciplines and was a relaxing way to spend a Wednesday afternoon.",
    "This is a required course for senior cog sci majors, and worth it.",
    "Cool people talking about cool things. and it's required to finish the major.",
    "Yes, if you're a cog sci senior, and you'll enjoy the presentations and getting to know other seniors in your major.",
    "I mean, it's required, so my recommendation doesn't matter much, but it's fun. I looked forward to it even though it was my 4th class on Wednesdays.",
    "Well, if you're a major, you have to take it, and if not, you can't. But if you are a major, don't dread this requirement. Its an easy-going, fascinating course, and you'll learn a lot.",
    "As major requirements go, it's pretty good.",
    "This class is required for all Cog Sci majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to all cognitive science majors.",
    "The first semester of this course could be called \"Greatest Hits of Yale Cognitive Science.\" Each week, a different professor comes in, you read 2-3 of their papers, and you discuss a new topic. Our discussions ranged from compositionality in language to chimpanzee meat-sharing to the neuroscience of autism to meditation and drug addiction. Super cool."
