    "The fieldtrip was very useful but the Teaching assistant was hoorible and was very authorotative and spoilt the entire trip by constantly hanging out with her own friends and creating a click group. She was constantly very irritant and talked about the rest of the students beahvior among her click group. My entire fieldtrip, I couldnt help but feel like I was in Hign School and I ended up crying. I couldn't help but feel that I paid to expereince such pain. However, some of the students were vey considerate and helpful.The instructor was clearly doing all the work while the teaching assistant was \"hanging out\" with her friends. The entire while I kept asking why did the school give the opportunity to a student who clearly didnt require the financial support and who didn't appreciate it.",
