   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a fascinating subject, and you're probably not going to have another opportunity to learn it. That said, if you're like most people taking this course and haven't any prior exposure to QFT, what you get out of the course is going to depend very strongly on how much you're willing to put in. Free field theory is pretty easy to digest, but after that you will need several passses through the material to really end up with a good grasp of what's going on.",
    "This is a very difficult class, but offers great insight into modern physics. I would feel like my physics knowledge was incomplete without having taken this course, and I'm an experimentalist.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to other students, if for no other reason than the fascination of the material itself.",
    "Supremely interesting course! Be prepared to put in some work if you want to get a thorough understanding of the concepts.",
    "This class is really interesting and really hard. Take it if you want a challenge and\/or want to understand qft.",
    "Definitely recommend if Goldberger were teaching it--I can see it getting much harder and more miserable with a bad professor though."

    "Not directly relevant to my research, but it underlies much of modern physics. It's very empowering to be able to read a paper on the phenomenology of some hypothetical BSM fields and be able to follow along with a derivation of observable effects from a given interaction.",
    "This course illuminated the theory behind some of the most beautiful theories of modern physics.",
    "While I can't currently see a direct connection to my research, this course significantly deepened my understanding of fundamental physics.",
    "This helped me understand the theory that particle physics is based on.",
    "Know how to read Feynman diagrams now. So that's useful."
