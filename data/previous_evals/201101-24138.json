    "Yes, although room 212 is oriented the wrong way for seminars. The third floor conference room or 7th floor room would have been so much better.",
    "Everything was good.",
    "Throughout the semester we were given full access to the best resources we could possibly ask for - from books in the library to personal access to each visitor we hosted.",
    "The resources for this course were adequate and in term of research the myriad of connections that the Yale library has to periodicals was extremely helpful. My only suggestion would be to look into expanding the topics available in the professional practice section of the library."
