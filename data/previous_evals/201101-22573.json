   "comments": [
    "Interesting books that will make you think about ethics more. Far from comprehensive, however, as moral realism is a HUGE area. I would REALLY REALLY have liked there to be a survey course on the moral realism debate and shit like cognitivism, ethical naturalism, etc.",
    "Definitely take if you're interested in studying modern moral philosophy.",
    "Great introduction to recent works in ethics. A really rare opportunity at Yale. But don't expect incredible things from Darwall.",
    "This class essentially comprised of reading three contemporary ethics books and discussing them. These books were very interesting but not at all easy. If recent work in ethical theory is something you are interested in, and you don't mind some difficult reading then I would certainly recommend this class.",
    "Be warned that this class can be VERY difficult if you have little ethics background. The readings are tough, and the seminar tends to be run on a grad school level. Darwall is brilliant, although he does not use class time to explore what the readings said - instead he goes right into objections and counterarguments, so make sure you have a firm understanding of the material before class.",
    "I enjoyed this class thoroughly. Darwall's seminars aren't the most organized, but they manage to build this wonderful sense of camaraderie. The sense is that we're all in this together, trying to figure this out, and Darwall is right there with us, and maybe this time we'll get it, and who cares if we're a class or two behind schedule, or if we've spent the last 50 minutes on this one point, because dangit this is philosophy and we're going to do what it takes to get it right.The readings in this class were fun, too. it's cool to be reading contemporary philosophy, and to be reading it with the professor as opposed to be being it by the professor. That's not to say that Darwall doesn't do any teaching, because he does, but its very fresh for him, and that makes it fresh for the class. overall, I had a blast.",
    "This course was a graduate-level seminar on three recent books in ethics: Self-Constitution by Christine Korsgaard, Life and Action by Michael Thompson, and Beyond Consequentialism by Paul Hurley. The discussion focused on the content of the books, which covered questions focusing on the nature of action and the foundations of moral and ethical truths. I would highly recommend this course and other seminars like it to advanced philosophy students with a strong background in ethics and meta-ethics."
