   "comments": [
    "We learned about journalism, yes, but we also learned about Italian culture, and mostly politics. I loved all the movies we watched, they are a great way to learn about culture\/journalism from an Italian perspective.",
    "I recommend this course--Prof. Iacovella is lovely and it's a really fun way to look at culture.",
    "Take the class!! It is not very hard and you will enjoy it a lot! You will learn about Italy&Italians through the eyes of the journalists. You will also improve your writing and communicating skills! A very good class choice :)",
    "I enjoyed the course. It was a great way to continue my Italian while learning something new about Italian culture. The workload was always manageable, and I really enjoyed being forced to peruse through Italian news each week, particularly since that's one of the main ways I can stay in touch with the country. But really, the course is definitely secondary to Professor Iacovella- she was much more crucial to making the course enjoyable than the syllabus or subject matter. She even took us out to an Italian pizzeria which was quite lovely."
