   "comments": [
    "Very heavily math based. Only really take it if you have an interest in mathematics or are thinking about majoring in Computer Science.",
    "Take it for a medium-paced introduction to discrete math. Probably a whole lot better than the math department version. If you've already had logic, sets, and linear algebra, there will be review.",
    "This class starts out super easy and then as the harder proofs come along stays boring and slow. I'd recommend taking the math class, unless you've never seen this material before.",
    "Probably taking a more in-depth probability or linear algebra class would be better, unless you're specifically doing the CS major.",
    "This class very superficially covers a lot of topics. It is probably one of the easiest transitions into proofs because most of the time before the midterm is spent on basic concepts of proofs like induction, contradiction, and logical notation. The problem sets took 8-10 hours, which was rather high given how little material was covered in a given topic. Class wasn't particularly exciting, but Professor Angluin covers the material (with some digressions).",
    "This course covers a lot of ground, quickly. I think that the material was a really great survey of the sort of theoretical math that is really fun and dare I say even practical (well, if you're a millionaire world champion poker player like the TF). I hadn't taken a math class in a long time, and it took me a while to get used to writing proofs. Problem sets took me about 9 hours each, but that's because I'm slow. I usually felt like I was solving a puzzle or riddle, which was a nice switch from the super tedious psets I'm used to. If you're really into math, you may find the speed of this course frustrating, but my guess is that Angluin is a far better prof than the one in the corresponding math dept discrete class.",
    "A heavy course in terms of reading dry material from a textbook and trying to apply many new techniques over a short time period.",
    "You're taking it because you have to, right? Compared to what I'd heard about how bad discrete could be, this class was really easy. I think Professor Angluin doesn't go into the more advanced topics as much as some of the other professors who teach it. If you're an applied math major, chances are you'll have seen most of this material elsewhere, which makes it really boring for a long time but also easy. Problem sets were a decent length (averaging about 7 hours) with thought-provoking but doable questions, and the exams were very manageable.",
    "CS 202 is essentially a discrete math course. The material is really interesting, and the professor makes the concepts easy to understand.",
    "This course is designed to give you a taste of the basics of many different subjects -- if you like problem solving, puzzles and logic games etc., then this course is for you. It is really fun!",
    "Mathematics (from Greek\u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1m\u00e1th\u0113ma \"knowledge, study, learning\") is the study of quantity, space, structure, and change.[2][3]Mathematicians seek out patterns[4][5]and formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proofs, which are arguments sufficient to convince other mathematicians of their validity. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry. However, mathematical proofs are less formal and painstaking than proofs in mathematical logic. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932), David Hilbert (1862-1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. When those mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning often provides insight or predictions.",
    "I chose to take CPSC202 instead of MATH244 because of the instructor, and I think I made the right decision.",
    "Interesting subject matter, but poorly taught class. Read wikipedia for 10 hours and you can learn it all, no joke. Don't take the lecture unless you have to (CS majors).",
    "If you're a CS major and don't want to deal with discrete, it's fine. Otherwise, you'll probably want to take more in-depth math.",
    "CS 202 is a class for anyone who is interested in college-level mathematics, or in CS. For the former, it gives you a good transition from high school mathematics, while for the latter, it provides some useful and (in some cases) essential tools.",
    "annoying, math 244 is probably much better. this class has a lot of proofs in the homework, which really just doesn't do it for me. class pace is slow, which also really doesn't do it for me. textbook is boring and seems to be flooded with not-so-relevant information. (maybe this is not shocking) but still, it was annoying.take at your own risk.oh, also, frustrating because you cover so many different topics but don't feel like you've learned much about any of them",
    "The class is boring and random, although it has influenced the way I think. Topics are scattered, and class is hard to sit through without pulling out your laptop.",
    "If you are thinking of taking this class you're probably a computer science major (If you're not and your sole interest is in the Math, you should really consider 244). Two important things I learned, unfortunately too late: first problem sets are a big portion of your grade and they're quite challenging and interesting. You might be tempted to do them all on your own. DO NOT. Always go to the TA sessions weather you know the answers or not, for all ten psets, every week. Second actually do the assigned readings in the text book before the psets and you'll be a lot more comfortable come exam time. Keep these in mind and you'll actually enjoy the class.",
    "This class was really useful for me in terms of developing mathematical intuition. Professor Angluin does a great job of helping you understand underlying concepts instead of just rules and formulas, which is really important for proofs.I did feel like it might have covered too many topics in not enough depth. For example, everything in the probability\/counting unit was covered in my high school math class. If you have a lot of math background, Math 244 might be more satisfying.",
    "If you have to take this or MATH 244 (you are a cs major), I would take this class- it's not that bad. The psets aren't terrible and the TFs are very helpful. It starts out really easy and gets a lot harder in the end. If you take MATH 222 or equivalent beforehand it will probably be a breeze.",
    "I would say don't take this course unless you have to. The topics jump all over and are depicted as boring and tedious. If you aren't familiar with discrete math coming in, you will have to learn a lot on your own, because the lectures are not that helpful or interesting, while the problem sets are very advanced.",
    "This class is good if you have to take it for your major.",
    "Yes - It's required for several majors so you probably have to take it.."
