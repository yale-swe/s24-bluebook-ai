    "A bit of a disaster this year. Lectures were unintuitive, and full of sketchy math. Problem sets were vanilla, with problems straight from the book. Pop quizzes on Fridays were annoying. But the standard content is pretty interesting, and the course was pretty easy, so taking it is not a huge loss. If you're taking this out of interest, do consider 439 or learning on your own.",
    "Take it if you have to. I think this class has the potential to be good if taught by the right professor. Too bad all the good ones are teaching the lower level classes. Why? I have no idea.",
    "Just read the textbook, you don't get anything out of the lectures. But study for the Friday quizzes! The exams can be difficult if you don't see the trick to each, though.",
    "Tries to be a rigorous introduction to quantum mechanics, but ends up as a mathematically unsatisfactory course in calculations. The professor reads off notes and stumbles on a lot of simple mistakes. Take this if you need it for your major, or if you're looking for an advanced science credit and you're good at computing integrals and stuff. Quizzes are easy, homeworks are primarily from Griffiths, which is okay, but a lot of boring calculations. Midterm and Final are harder than quizzes, but basically like timed homeworks, and they're open book\/note, so not hard if you know what you're doing.",
    "Absolutely not. Firstly, Prof. McKinsey is very dry and the material is just okay. There are much much much better ways to spend an elective at Yale. If you don\u2019t plan to go into physics, but like studying it this is not the course for you. One reason that I became a physics major was because I wanted to learn quantum - I can now say that it was not worth it. Though I can now tackle a simple problem in quantum mechanics and go through the very tedious math to get an answer I still don\u2019t have a conceptual understanding and certainly couldn\u2019t communicate what I\u2019ve learned. As I\u2019m not planning to study physics after undergrad this is a very big let down since I will never encounter a quantum problem again, but the conceptual\/philosophical take-aways could have been very impactful. If this is what you\u2019re hoping to come away with, take another elective and read about quantum on your own.",
    "Good first semester of quantum mechanics, covering Schrondinger's equation in one dimension, formalism (Hilbert spaces and inner products), and both time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory. McKinsey isn't the most engaging professor--he's prone to doing lots of algebra on the board without first telling us where he wants to take it. However he's quite nice and helpful at office hours, I hear. The homework isn't too heavy, but the exams are tricky.",
    "You will learn a lot in this class, but it might be in spite of lectures rather than because of them. Griffiths' textbook is great, but Professor McKinsey had a difficult time conceptually motivating the pages of tedious integrals we would do, and it often seemed as though he were seeing the lecture notes for the first time in class. Length\/difficulty of the problem sets varied wildly from week to week, from 5-15 hours. Midterm and final were difficult, but open book, which I liked.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this course to someone who does not require it for the physics major. We spent the entire semester going through about four chapters of Griffiths, and not with any particular depth or clarity. Lectures were not clear, and usually less helpful than just reading the textbook. Problem sets were often tedious exercises in the use of Mathematica. If you are not a physics major, but you are interested in continuing to study physics, consider taking E&M instead. If you still want to learn something about quantum mechanics, you would do just as well to read a decent textbook on your own.",
    "Quantum is required for the physics major, so you generally have no choice in whether or not to take it. The material is interesting, and I found it more fun to learn about than classical mechanics simply because quantum is something different. The problem sets were often just heavy on algebra and annoying mathematical manipulations (which got sketchy at times), so you shouldn't expect any profound realizations from doing the homework. McKinsey is also not a great lecturer. The lectures were often hard to follow, even though they were basically regurgitated from the book (Griffiths is great, actually. Wouldn't have survived without it). As a physics major, you have to take this class but otherwise you might want to consider taking something different",
    "As a physics major, you basically have to take the course (unless you take PHYS 439, which I can't really speak to). The class with McKinsey wasn't well-taught, and the class is really not about quantum mechanics and just about whether or not you can do algebra. Odds are, you can, but I'm not sure how much you enjoy doing tedious algebra and integrals for a semester. I guess it's good preparation for higher-level classes. I wasn't that impressed, but since it's from the textbook, most of the material you can teach yourself.",
    "If you're not doing intensive, save yourself the trouble of getting through this class and just take the one semester applied physics class",
    "Not the worst way to get an advanced physics credit for the math major BS, which is why I took it. Most of the homeworks are easy \/ extremely calculational, but exams are kind of random and tricky because questions are often ambiguous. Anyways, you do learn something and get to practice solving quantum mechanics problems. Unfortunately though, the pace was really slow for most of the semester and the professor wasn't the best at responding to questions. Shop it and see, but don't let this stop you from being an intensive physics major if thats why you're reading these reviews.",
    "I mean, it's necessary if you're going to be a physics major, but it's definitely not a great course. Though the lectures are boring, the problem sets are pretty reasonable. Take it if you have to.",
    "This is not a good course. Expect to spend most of your time working integrals by hand without needing to have a clear sense of why or what it is exactly that you're doing. It picks up in the end, though.",
    "Phys 440 is the first-part of an introduction to Quantum Physics. It mathematically motivates some of the most fundamental results (e.g. the Uncertainty Principle), and deals with the generalized cases of perturbation theory. The course follows the Griffiths textbook very closely and attending lecture rarely seemed helpful as it frequently consisted of long derivations. While I do feel that I have learned a good bit of material over the course of the semester, I would recommend at least shopping Phys 339 if you're interested in Quantum Mechanics. Though condensing the material from 440 and 441 into one semester, I've heard the faster march through the material and professor are better.",
    "Very difficult, very time consuming, and a very great class. You work hard and you get a lot out of it. I feel I just know WAY more than I did going into class; and that's how you want to feel at the end of physics class. Dr. McKinsey is definitely a great professor; I would recommend physics students take more classes from him.",
    "You'll learn the material that's covered, but unfortunately that's not much. The class moves really slowly and is usually more tedious than difficult. Although that might make it more accessible to non majors I guess.",
    "Physics 440 should be really fun, with a good professor. Do not take the class with Prof. McKinsey unless you are required to do so.",
    "Do. Not. Take. You may have to as a physics major but otherwise it's a sad shame that this class is so bad because Quantum Mechanics is a fascinating subject.",
    "There are a lot of things that could be improved about this class. McKinsey is not a great lecturer, and you really don't get through all that much material, only covering about 4 chapters of the book total. The textbook is great, though, and really clutch for filling in the gaps that will inevitably exist after lecture. The board is generally full of arithmetic mistakes, to the point that unusual results due to the strangeness of quantum mechanics are tough to differentiate from simple errors. That being said, I came out of this class understanding a lot more about quantum mechanics than I did before, which I suppose is the goal.",
    "If you are a physics major with sufficient math background, consider the graduate quantum sequence instead, which I did not realize was an option until after having taken this class.",
    "Physics 440 is taught from Griffiths. It's a snail's-pace slog through a bunch of integrals with seemingly no physical intuition to back them up. You should also note I screwed up the final exam because I am an idiot. I might have to drop out after I see this grade..."
