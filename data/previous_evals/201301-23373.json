    "Take this class!! If you are interesting in chemistry and biology and would enjoy the correlation between the science and the laboratory techniques\/ research opportunities in these fields, this class is incredibly interesting. It is a unique opportunity in which you have lecture, and then apply what you learn to perform lab techniques (NMR, Liquid\/Gas chromatography, Mass spectroscopy etc) You learn myriad lab techniques, how they work and why they are important in their respective fields.",
    "Take this class. It's two hours, three days a week, plus some interesting work outside of class. You'll learn a lot of practical skills, you'll learn how to think through the scientific method, how to use machines at the cutting edge of the field...plus, you get to hang out with Andy and Gillian, who are great people. I looked forward to going to this class in the mornings.",
    "One of the most amazing experiences I've had at Yale so far. We learned about the theoretical underpinnings of techniques used by real scientists in the lab, and we then were able to apply those techniques to identify the structure of our unknown antibiotic molecule. A truly incredible experience with the best of instructors. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this class--even my struggles with 2D NMR results for my antibiotic compound--and I only wish I could have the experience again.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in having a truly unique undergrad experience in the sciences. You'll have unparalleled attention and guidance from your instructors who are experts in their fields. The material you learn in lecture will be bolstered by your research in the lab. What's more, you'll conclude the semester with a strong sense of spectroscopy (a fundamental method of organic chemistry research) and of accomplishing something \"big\" - whether that's assigning the structure of a molecule that was once a compound on a petri dish or of discovering a new molecule altogether.",
    "MCDB 167 is an advanced chemistry course designed for students who are interested in having a real research experience early in their education. Students are encouraged to ask questions and design ways to answer their own questions. Guidance is gladly given when needed and encouragement is given constantly! This class is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Microbiology, Chemistry, research, etc. and anyone who is interested in gaining useful life skills."
