    "If Frame is still teaching this, TAKE IT. The class itself is fine, and an interesting QR, but Frame made this class so good that I didn't resent the QR requirement that made me take it. He's a clear lecturer, good at explaining things in understandable (but not evidently dumbed down) ways, and he tells interesting stories and (wonderfully) bad jokes.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. If you're at all interested in iterative and recursive patterns in nature and the universe, take this class, you will like it. Also, being taught by Frame is enough incentive to take this class, regardless of how interesting the material is.",
    "I'm a physics major, and took this course because I've always been interested in fractals. As far as difficulty level, 290 would clearly have been a better fit for me, but I really wanted to take a class with Michael Frame as well. It was worth it. Even though I rarely had to struggle to understand anything and the problem sets took me 20-30 minutes\/week, I loved this class. Frame is absolutely phenomenal, and I unequivocally recommend it.",
    "This class uses no calculus to teach you about fractals. And life. And beautiful things that are everywhere. Take it if any of these things (lack of calculus, fractals, life, beauty) mean anything to you at all, which is to say, you would really miss out if you didn't take fractal geometry.",
    "Great, not-too-difficult math class that tackles a different kind of math than probably anyone has seen coming out of high school. Not difficult, but cool new ideas. Michael Frame is absolutely adorable and really fun - hopefully he teaches this class again.",
    "Where do I even begin? Professor Frame is the most phenomenal professor I have had. He is incredibly inspiring - it is rare to find a professor who both loves what he teaches and loves to teach. Beyond the technical math of the course, he instilled an appreciation for the beauty of mathematics and a wonder for the world. He has a wonderful sense of humor and is very caring. He also has imparted life lessons to us that remain dear to me. I did not expect to like the material very much, but I took the class because of Frame. I soon discovered, however, that I was completely wrong about math - we learned rudiments of how to grasp the complexities of the very universe, from bacteria to parallel universes, through the area of fractal geometry. I have left this class completely awestruck and appreciative. This class was a complete and utter joy; even though I did not always understand the complex math, Frame's fascination with the subject had a true impact on me. I will not look at the world the same way again. Thank you, Professor Frame.",
    "I'm a non-QR person. Fractals is enjoyable and it's hard (I don't think the \"QR gut\" exists at Yale). There are some interesting self-contained fractal concepts, but the concepts will likely have minimal relation to your everyday life. To be honest, besides brushing the rust off my algebra, the most valuable aspect of this class were Prof. Frame's occasional anecdotes that give you a candid, often humorous view into the professional world of brilliant mathematicians at the world's most prestigious institutions. For whatever reason, I though it was incredible interesting. But back to the math: It's hard. I struggled. I worked hard. And because I worked hard I think I'll end up with a grade I'm happy with. But if you don't you probably won't be as happy.",
    "Good and interesting way to fulfill a QR.",
    "Take this class. If you can't do math, do it. This was a QR for me and I was scared but I am so glad I chose to do it. Wonderful professor, fascinating material. This is a worthwhile experience.",
    "I would say that Math 190 is not an easy course, and can be boring at times, but that Professor Frame is an inspirational and great teacher. Overall, I recommend the course.",
    "Yes absolutely. It is a great way to fulfill your QR in an interesting and real topic.",
    "This class is a lot of fun and very interesting. It is real work and not always very easy, but it is manageable if you go to class and keep up with the homework and everything. The class website is also a truly incredible resource whenever something isn't clear.",
    "TAKE IT. Frame is an absolute gem. He's adorable and funny and loves his work so much that it's a bit contagious. The material is not difficult and, for the most part, interesting. Also, it involves many pretty pictures.",
    "If you want to learn about how ridiculously magical the world is, take this class. If you don't know what a fractal is, you need to take this class. It is not the hardest math class ever (at all), but it is still very fascinating and worthwhile. Michael Frame is an amazing, wonderful person and I think this is the class he has the most fun with. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to spend a semester with Professor Frame and fractals. Best way to fulfill a QR requirement with only minimal amounts of complicated math.",
    "Don't take it expecting to glide through the material--it gets pretty complex and mind-boggling at times. That being said, fractal geometry is a very rewarding and aesthetically pleasing form of math, so be prepared to enjoy the work you'll be doing. At least, that's what got me through the class. That and the AMAZING professor.",
    "A not so quantitative math class but not a gut. Homeworks due every week. Going to class and a fair amount of review is necessary but it is open note midterm and final.",
    "For a non-math person like myself, this was a great QR option. It's not a gut, because the homework involves work and you'll actually have to do legitimate math, but it's a lot more fun than the average math course because of all the interesting applications for fractals and because of how truly beautiful fractal images can be. If you're someone who is really into mathematics, you'd probably be happier in the more advanced fractals course, but if you're a humanities kid who is looking to get something more than an easy A out of their QR requirement, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take it! Not an awful QR and the tutor is great and Professor Frame is hilarious!",
    "It's really really really easy. It's also an interesting subject, but unfortunately the class doesn't go that deeply into the material because it's designed for people who lack any sort of mathematical skill (aka liberal arts majors looking for a QR who freak out when they see an equation); it could be a lot more interesting than it is.",
    "YES! Be prepared to work, but you will understand everything at the end, especially if you see the tutor or go to office hours. But beware of the final...it's harder than most things we had on the midterm or in homework.",
    "Take it. Do it. Absolutely. Not because it is a \"gut\" (it isn't). Take it because it is a branch of mathematics which you probably haven't even heard of before and which is fascinating. The mathematics you need to know for the course are very basic and don't extend beyond knowing how to work with logarithms. The heart of the course is in the concepts and their applications. Each new subject is incredibly interesting, and it just gets better as the course goes on. If you need a QR, or just want to take an interesting (really!) math course, this is the one.",
    "Fractals are really cool, and they're everywhere. That said, learning about them is not easy. There's a lot of relatively complicated mathematical concepts which I learned how to do but didn't really understand. I didn't really leave the class with as full of an understanding as I thought I would, but Professor Frame is really friendly. His lectures are just confusing a lot of the time.",
    "Best class at Yale for developing critical thinking skills and life lessons. And the jokes at 3:20 are amazing, always. A truly wonderful experience I could not recommend enough to anyone.On a less romantic note, it's not much work, the midterm and final were open notes, and problem sets take less than a couple of hours each week. Go to lecture because Frame is a gem, but you don't really die without lectures after the 3rd or 4th week (because it gets confusing as all get out and so you're kinda better off just learning it yourself).Take fractals so you can look at pretty pictures all day!",
    "Yes. Take it. Take is with Michael Frame, if you can. It is fairly easy (although some of the problem sets are tricky). Take it to study with Michael Frame, and to learn from his view of the world. Fractals are very cool and an important, expanding area of study. But take it to learn from Michael Frame. You will find very few people in the world with his attitude towards life. If you can absorb anything from him, personally, taking the class will have been worth it. An incredible experience.",
    "Great course, really cool material, if sometimes hard to grasp because of the 'foreignness' of some concepts. Workload is very light, tests are very fair, very rewarding. Fantastic professor, unique Yale experience. TAKE IT.",
    "Take it! It's the most fun math class you can take. The real-world applications make it worthwhile.",
    "I definitely would recommend it to anyone because the material was really engaging. If you aren't great at math, this course is probably a great fit because it requires thought in but not expertise in mathematics.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Not too difficult, really fascinating, whether or not you're into math. Take it.",
    "This is a fun math course, with not a lot of calculus involved. I am using this course to get back into the swing of things mathematically before taking Multivariable because I have not taken a math class since BC in high school. Professor Frame cares more about his students than any other professor at Yale, and he is always eager and willing to help you learn the material. A very great class overall, and about a mathematical discipline that is relatively new (began in the 1970s).",
    "I would absolutely recommend it! As a non-math major, I still felt very comfortable with the subject material. The subject of fractals is interesting in general, and Michael Frame is the best math professor to teach it!",
    "Take Math 190 taught by Michael Frame; youwill love the course and it is essential for a liberal arts education. Frame's explanations make the concepts readily comprehensible, so that the workload is more than reasonable for those not mathematically endowed (like me). Moreover, the inspiration I derived from Frame's lectures inspired me in all areas of my life, while the background of the subject itself reshaped my understanding of how the world works. Even if the fantastical (and beautiful) world of Fractals, or a graphical study of the dynamics of chaos doesn't interest you (and it really should), you will enjoy this course for the brilliance of the professor. Frame is more interested in any field than that field's specialists and it is a great experience to consult him for the midterm project (not necessarily a major undertaking, but the most fun I've had in studying at Yale.)",
    "This course isn't easy (it was definitely more difficult for me than I thought it would be) but Michael Frame is fantastic. The material is pretty decent, especially the first half of the course. Some of it is tricky, but if you take advantage of office hours and the tutor it should be manageable. The exams aren't easy, but they're incredibly fair.",
    "Please take this class. Please. It will change the way you think about professors at Yale, the student experience, and the world. For real.",
    "YES!!! If you can take this class - or any class at all - with Michael Frame, you absolutely should! He is the best!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 190 to another student. Even though this course is not intended for math majors, it is not a gut. The problem sets are challenging and the work is always interesting. Michael Frame is amazing. Taking this course with a calculus background might be helpful, but not necessary.",
    "If you're a \"math person,\" be aware that it will probably not be as math-y as you would like. But if you're interested in fractals or in the interplay of math, nature, and art, you will probably find it stimulating anyway. If you're not a \"math person,\" definitely take it. It will show you some amazing applications of math and is really not hard, especially with the amazing support system of Michael Frame and the course tutor. It's worth taking just for the professor, though- he is really inspiring and entertaining and kind, and makes the class even more fun than it would be already just from the material.",
    "I would without any reservations recommend that a fellow student take this course. This is one of the few courses that transcends subject. This course can and does captivate people of all academic interests and it is incredibly rewarding.",
    "Not the easiest QR you could take, but the topics are interesting until they become so incomprehensible that everyone stops going to class because it's pointless because you can't follow what's going on in lecture anyway. Professor Frame is FANTASTIC though, and I don't regret taking the course.",
    "Fractals. Fun class. Take it if you want a non-calculus QR.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! It doesn't matter if you like or don't like math or if you are good at it or not, this is just an awesome class. Michael Frame is one of the greatest teachers I have ever had and is an inspiration. The lectures are engaging and funny as well as just really really interesting. There is a lot of looking at pictures so if you are a visual person this class will be really easy. The problem sets are fairly short (particularly if you understand the material) and the exams are all open note. If you go to class and take good notes you are basically guaranteed to get an A, and you will never look at the world the same way again.Once again TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This is a great choice for someone interested in patterns, mysteries, and taking a math class that both won't take over your life but will be constantly fascinating. Take it from Michael Frame -- he's an inspiration.",
    "It's not too hard if you always go to class and keep up with the problem sets and go to the help sessions, and if you understand what's going on the problem sets aren't time-consuming - Professor Frame just wants to see that you understand, he doesn't want to drill you. The material is inherently complicated, so even in its simplest form, like it is in this class, it can be hard to grasp and seem like gibberish. I would recommend it as a QR, though - way better than Philosophy of Physics in terms of workload. GO TO THE TUTOR! It makes the whole class way easier and accessible.",
    "Fractal Geometry is awesome!!!! If you are not amazing at math but want to learn something cool, this is the class for you. It is not easy, but if you are a logical thinker it should not be too hard. It is also much easier if you pay attention in lecture. The midterm and exam are also open note!",
    "yes, especially if you need a QR. it's very manageable.",
    "Frame is the man, there is no question about it. He tells jokes every class and generally tries his best to make it as enjoyable as possible. However, I feel that I was a tiny bit misled by the evaluations of this class. Because this class is meant for non-QR majors, Frame will often choose not to delve into the deep mathematics of the field, and thus Fractal Geometry can sometimes feel informational: you learn a bunch of ways to compute different things like dimensions of objects, etc but may not gain a deep understanding of how or why these processes work. I suppose that\u0092s what the Math 290 Fractal course is for, which I now have an interest in taking. If you\u0092re looking for an easy way to fulfill a QR credit, I guess this class would fit your bill (although the final had a bit of challenge to it).",
    "This is a great class! Professor Frame is an engaging lecturer, and the subject material is good for people who need a QR but don't want to do a conventional math class.",
    "The best math class I've ever had! Michael Frame is an amazing teacher, both in and out of the classroom. I'm so grateful to have learned from him. The math is accessible and, since everyone starts at the same point with fractals, well-explained. It's also very interesting--Fractal Geometry is a wonderful class to fulfill a QR credit because it's neither a gut class nor advanced math. You will definitely work and learn in this course and see the fruits of that. And the subject is fascinating! I highly recommend taking the class.",
    "A great class for a non-math major looking for either a QR credit or something interesting to branch out into. The material is fascinating, yet not unreachable.",
    "It's fractal geometry, which sounds a bit goofy, but basically, it is pictures of math. So it's actually a lot easier to understand the math if you aren't so heavy on the abstract side. And if you're also big on the abstract side, it is really helpful to see how complex the pictures are, and it gives you an idea of how much there really is to explore mathematically.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's a great way to explore higher mathematics without taking much higher level courses. The work load is fair and the tutor makes the information more accessible.",
    "This course is a good way to get a QR, but it was harder than I thought it would be. I so enjoyed getting to have Professor Frame as a teacher. He is a wonderful educator and a wonderful person.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Whether you need the QR or not, Professor Frame makes it worth it.",
    "This class might change your life. Take it. The subject matter is breath-taking from start to finish. Worst case scenario, take some other class with Frame.",
    "MAT 190 was really a delightful course. I happened upon it in part by accident, but I'm sure glad that I stayed. It's a great introduction to the study of fractals for all those interested, and Prof. Frame was really engaging and friendly. The course generally seemed to be well-tailored to the interests of the students (i.e., this particular semester) which is great. The website offers of course a huge huge wealth of materials that are helpful for understanding various concepts, although the frames sometimes were a little frustrating, web-navigation wise. However, this was just a small hiccup; everything was really great.I highly recommend this course to anyone with the time to take it. It's a reasonable amount of work that can be very rewarding if you are committed to it! I knew some peers who didn't really care about learning, and just wanted a QR credit - that's one way to go about this course, but you won't end up as happy as you could be. I took this to fulfill a credit but I really learned a lot and enjoyed myself. I even got to apply some of the things that I learned to facilitate a better understanding of the world, plus it was even helpful trivia for some job interviews!"
