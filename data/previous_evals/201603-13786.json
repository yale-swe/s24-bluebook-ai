    "Everything related to sound engineer prospective. The Handover on every class is very helpful.",
    "The class served as a good \"catch-all\" in regards to basic sound equipment and technical concepts as well as the requisite paperwork to document a sound design. The technical investigations (amps, speakers, etc.) were especially helpful to investigate and explain terminology that incoming students may take for granted (total harmonic distortion, true diversity, array theory...) but lack a thorough understanding of. It was extremely useful to see not only the instructor's approach to paperwork, but also my peers' paperwork. Seeing a variety of organizational styles was helpful in prompting me to reconsider the effectiveness of my own organizational systems."
