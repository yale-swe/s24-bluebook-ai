    "This class is to be avoided.",
    "How would I describe this class? It makes you feel like Ariosto's Orlando trying to make it up to the moon to find his scattered brains. I wouldn't recommend it in its present state to anyone. It's too disorganized, too all over the place, the reading is impossibly heavy, the class is always late at night, the professors don't know how to interract with each other, the students model their professors. I say take the syllabus, appreciate it for its wonderfulness, and do the reading on your own time. You'll get a lot more out of it, I promise.",
    "I would summarize the class as painful. I think it was painful for everyone involved. I would not recommend it to anyone in any field, despite there being some useful material in the syllabus. I feel like the class did the opposite of what it intended to do--i.e., forge an interdisciplinary approach to studying the Renaissance. I understand the extreme challenges posed to the professors in teaching this class and I am sorry to have such a negative view of the course, but I do believe that it needs to be reevaluated in its entirety.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student as a way to gain a knowledge of the Italian Renaissance which is both broad and in-depth. Although students who are specialists in the field will particularly enjoy the opportunity to research on any number of topics related to the Renaissance, students in related fields will also have the chance to expand theirknowledge of their thematic interests.",
    "I would recommend this course to students with strong interest in humanism and politics in the Italian Renaissance. I would not recommend it to students who want to learn about art, literature, or religion in the period."

   "comments": [
    "I don't specialize in the Italian Renaissance and so this wasn't helpful at all, either for requirements or for research. I thought it would be good background information to have, and I got a lot of information out of this course, but it's not clear I'll ever use it and the professors didn't seem to understand that a lot of us were using this class as a survey. They assigned too much reading and we never got to discuss any of it and nothing was integrated or summed up. Also, never -and I mean NEVER - assign a 300 page book and two 50 page articles for a MAKEUP last class during reading week when we're all madly writing papers. Seriously, how did you expect anyone to do the reading?",
    "This course gave me the opportunity to do more work than I would have otherwise with a body of scholarship related to my own research, but in a different geographical and chronological setting."
