    "As mentioned above, I think adding in more from the perspective of Board members would be helpful for us to understand these topics from different angles. The 4 minute time constraint for the final presentations seemed quite unrealistic and didn't allow for thorough presentations or discussions. I would recommend planning for at least 10 minutes per student, so that there isn't a rush at the end. Or perhaps plan to spread the presentations out over the course of two class meetings."
