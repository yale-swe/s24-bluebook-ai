    "Class about anxiety of influence and linking Jonson Marlowe and Shakespeare. The first one is bloody difficult and I think people enjoyed the least. But Marlowe is fabulous. Professor is amazing and the course is very relaxed, but fascinating at the same time. Take it if it is being offered.",
    "Awesome class! Really cool to read Shakespeare in the context of his contemporaries -- Kastan is the best, Carla is also awesome!",
    "Take this class! Professor Kastan is brilliant\/phenomenal\/charismatic\/etc. etc. for one, but the structure of the class is fascinating as well: while most students are well-versed in Shakespeare, barely any have engaged with Marlowe, let alone Jonson, and the class challenges you to think critically about what makes someone a universal\/timeless playwright. Most people in this class were super smart and had a lot of Shakespeare experience, which could be daunting at times, but also just made discussion all the more interesting.",
    "Great way to put Shakespeare in context AND evaluate Marlowe and Jonson in their own right. Assignments and syllabus are both great, and discussion can be fantastic.",
    "Yea it was great and the information was interesting",
    "If you're an English major you're a fool not to take this class. Kastan tends to teach one junior seminar per semester, and it changes every now and then, so what I would really advise is take whichever one he's teaching. Either you'll learn a huge lot about Shakespeare, or you'll learn a lot about Shakespeare and also a lot about Jonson and Marlowe. It's also worth reading Marlowe and Jonson (especially w\/ Kastan) because it colours Shakespeare and makes him more exciting. More human, too, apropos of a New Historical perspective. Also, when else are you going to read Jonson? It's really hard, and really different, and you'll probably be smarter if you take this course. Maybe more frustrated and more anxious about historical predecessors, but maybe smarter, too.",
    "Yes - a good class and a good syllabus; especially fun to read the works of playwrights later eclipsed by Shakespeare. The workload was reasonable (a play a week + one critical article) with two shorter papers and a longer final.",
    "Loved this course! Loved Kastan! Loved Carla!",
    "Certainly take the course if you can. A seminar with Professor Kastan is a wonderful experience, and there's something quintessentially \"Yale\" about it. He, better than anyone else, combines a real depth of learning with absolutely sparkling wit in the most engaging and entertaining way. You will learn a lot from him, and have a lot of fun.",
    "Interesting reading list and refreshing angle. Would probably recommend having taken at least one of the Shakespeare lectures beforehand; it's not required, but enough of the class comes in already well enough read in Shakespeare that any of his work is pretty fair game in discussions. Discussion often evolved into what I call Storytime with Professor Kastan you learn a ton listening to him ramble, so that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it often felt a little like a lecture conducted around a seminar table."
