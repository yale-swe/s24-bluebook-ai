    "This is a very hard class, but you will learn a lot.",
    "Very useful for your career. Somewhat painful in the interim. Take it anyway.",
    "A great class for graduate students who need a lot of specific information about a wide variety of eukaryotic mechanisms. Also gives you a good background in relevant literature for various fields. I would recommend it because there is bound to be something that will be relevant to your thesis project.",
    "This is definitely a must take course for everyone! A very nice course that you can learn a lot!",
    "Excellent course. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student working on yeast or anything more complicated. It also could be a good enrichment opportunity in general because over the semester I definitely learned material that made seminars more enjoyable because it gave me background that I didn't have previously.",
    "Very helpful in preparing you for future research. Experimental approaches were outlined to approach specific problems that would be very useful in research. Will definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend it because you learn a lot and they emphasize experiments on how you would learn something over straight memorization.",
    "Great course to dive into the specifics of every cell bio course taught in an undergraduate curriculum.",
    "Extremely difficult, but has good content.",
    "yes to learn the basics althogh I would audit it because the exams were super stressful and did not help with anything in the long term",
    "I would summarize the course as a good, comprehensive survey of eukaryotic molecular biology. I would recommend the course to other students because it provides a solid background to cellular processes."

    "Indispensable. I won't work in these fields myself, but my graduate education would not have been complete without it.",
    "This course was extremely relevant to my thesis research, but also gave me a great amount of background on slightly different fields that will help me be well-informed and understand the literature.",
    "Yes, we knew more about mechanisms of the eukaryotes.",
    "I learned a lot of experimental techniques that will be very helpful to keep in my back pocket throughout grad school.",
    "good to gain overall knowledge of biology.",
    "This course contributed to my education and research by providing me a solid background in eukaryotic molecular biology and filling in gaps in my understanding of key cellular processes."
