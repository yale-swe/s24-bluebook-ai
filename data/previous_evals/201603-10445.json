   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class as it provides a good bio foundation.",
    "I honestly would not recommend Biol 101 to a fellow student unless they absolutely have to take it and they'e serious about doing science in the future. Apart from preparing you for reading scientific papers, this class really doesn't have much to offer in terms of things you haven't seen before in a good AP Bio course.",
    "Yes, you need to take this intro bio course. It's mandatory, and it gets better from here.",
    "A solid introduction to how our cells work and the processes and experiments that lead to breakthroughs in genetic understanding.",
    "An introductory course to the biological sciences. Has weekly quizzes and problem sets, but overall a manageable course for first semester.",
    "I would not recommend this course. if you're pre-med or need it as a prerequisite for a major\/ course, then you have to take it, but otherwise, I would not take this course.",
    "It was a pretty good class. The workload was spread out and the materials easy to follow. Overall it's not a bad class whether you have to take it or just want a science credit.",
    "Take this class for the pre-med requirement, other than that no reason to do so.",
    "I haven't taken any other bio courses, but if you want a strong foundation in biology (which is crucial for any science major\/important for people in general) then I think it's the only way to get it at Yale. I didn't take AP Bio so it was all new to me, some people it may be review \/ not worth your time. It would be nice if Yale had two bio courses, one for people with no background and one for those with a strong background, but since they don't, bio 101-104 seems to be the only way to get that foundation.",
    "Biol 101 is more than a typical introductory biology course. It's well structured, interesting and a great way to be exposed to a wide range of phenomena. It involves a lot of analysis.",
    "If you've had AP Bio, the material will mostly be familiar. The quizzes are kind of annoying, but they help you stay on top of the material so that the final doesn't feel overwhelming. Prof. Koelle is an okay lecturer - pretty clear, just kind of dry sometimes.",
    "Take this class if you like science, but if you are not planning to major in a science or go to medical school, there are better classes with lighter, more manageable workloads that you can learn at a better pace.",
    "You unfortunately have to take this if pre-med or majoring in biology. This course is not challenging or especially interesting and a lot of it is review from AP\/IB Biology. The course's attempts at making you an independent thinker and a \"scientist\" just are not successfully implemented and you will waste a lot of time on \"learning strategies\" that could have been spent on more interesting, in depth biology. The instructor and TFs are good but the way the course is designed is pretty terrible.",
    "you will learn a lot of biology. definitely take this class and don't be intimidated by all the science-oriented, pre-med type students who take the class, but be prepared that there will be an assumption that you're super interested in high-powered scientific research, even if you're just taking the class to learn about biology.",
    "I would caution others against taking this course simply to learn biology.",
    "Required and at times a hassle.",
    "mEH, YOU HAVe to take it.",
    "I would recommend 101 because it covers a wide variety of topics in biology necessary for many areas. Biol 101 is a very advanced broad biology class perfect for students wishing to dive quickly and deeply into the field.",
    "Bio is a fine intro to biology. Do the work carefully, do the readings when you can, etc. etc. Actually do the work and the grading is very generous.",
    "Pretty good class",
    "Many students have to take this class for pre-reqs or for pre-med. What I have to say is try to find the things you enjoy about bio in this class; otherwise, it can get boring. Also pay attention even if you hate it. The lectures do prepare you for the test (to an extent), but skipping lecture\/not taking notes does you no good. After lecture also reread your notes and think a lot about why and how questions. Unless you are really interested in biochemistry, there is no need to take this class. Take an ecology or environmental class that you are perhaps more interested in.",
    "BIOL 101 01 will teach you about the basic principles of biochemistry that will help you better understand material you learn in more advanced biology courses. If you took AP Biology in high school it is probable that you know most of the material. However, this course has an emphasis on scientific reasoning and problem solving that may not have been present in your high school biology course(s), but will be very important if you continue to take biology in college. I would certainly recommend this class as an excellent introductory biology course.",
    "An introductory course to the basics of molecular biology. I favor this course for the science-type as it does still require a fair amount of effort to do well. I would not consider this \"just getting a science credit\" course for someone who is not interested at all in the field of study.",
    "Generally, I feel that I benefited from BIOL 101. I think the modulated structure is a good way to cover a lot of material while still exploring some depth by reading literature and highlighting certain important concepts that will inform other areas. I would recommend the course as a good way to transition into science coursework with more rigorous expectations. The quizzes keep you responsible for staying on top of the information, and I feel like I've learned what I need to know as a foundation in this area.",
    "Take Biol 101 because you have to for a pre-req or for the pre-med track, but otherwise, there's much more out there that you should explore instead. The class can be brutal, with weekly quizzes and difficult grading, but the final exam is fair and evenly covers all topics discussed in lecture. The teaching is very robotic and impersonal because the lecture is so large, but you can't expect much more than that from a basic, introductory class. The material is expansive but shallow, so you end up knowing just a little about a lot.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit, do not take this class unless it is required for your major or you are pre med.",
    "It is exactly what you think it will be. It is a basic biology course- nothing more, nothing less. I would only take this course if it is a prerequisite for your major or you are very interested in the subject. There are weekly quizzes so there is quite a bit of work weekly, but it doesn't build up which is nice.",
    "BIOL 101 is a great introductory Bio module. It is very similar to AP Bio, but that doesn't mean you can get away with not studying if you took AP Bio. The weekly quizzes are challenging and tricky, but the TA's are great and the professor was fantastic too. It was very manageable and engaging, especially the section about HIV\/AIDS and Zika. I would highly recommend this course, especially over Gen Chem (another pre-med course) because the lectures are so much better taught and the problem sets are more interesting.",
    "Remarkably basic in substance and incredibly uninteresting to anyone who has heard of biology before. A disappointing introduction to the biology department.",
    "Take it only if you need it as a prereq.",
    "BIOL 101 introduces students to the \"key concepts\" of biochemistry and biophysics, while also preparing them for research articles, experimental designs in the laboratory and for future biology courses. For most STEM students I do not believe this course is a necessity because of its huge focus on the aforementioned subjects and due to the fact that many STEM students may not find biology\/research of particular interest to them. But for all Pre-Med students and biology\/biology-related majors this course is certainly needed. To these students, I recommend this course.",
    "BIOL 101 01 is a fast-paced course, but managable if one takes advantage of the outside resources such as enrichment or peer tutoring to supplement normal study habits. Must study hard for the quizzes, and be able to solve problems quickly. Answers must be thorough and precise, have to be careful about adding unnecessary details to the responses. Overall a good course!",
    "An introductory Biology course- you get out of it what you put into it (aka study and do the readings to do well on weekly quizzes). You can just study lecture slides and do well too!",
    "Biol 101 is a very fast paced course that you have to stay on top of in order to do well in, but it is easy to succeed if you put in the effort",
    "I would summarize this course as a rehash of AP Biology, with more of a focus on proteins and molecular biology. I would only recommend this course to another student who is heavily considering majoring in STEM. I do not believe this course should be taken if its not for Distributional Requirements or a Major Requirement.",
    "Quiz point distribution usually focused on specific key words rather than concepts.",
    "I recommend Bio 101 to students who have an interest in biophysics and biochemistry and want to be exposed to a well-taught intro course.",
    "The material is relatively interesting, as far as biology courses go. It was surprisingly less focused on rote memorization than expected and focused more on understanding the concepts and applying them, which made it a lot more interesting than standard AP Bio courses. Unfortunately, the grading is nitpicky and arbitrary. The course purports to have a philosophy of \"if you know the material, you can all get an A,\" but the graders don't seem to share that sentiment. Many students have approached their TAs about docked points, only to have their respective TAs give the practiced answer that although they can't figure out why the answer is not complete, \"they don't have the rubric in front of them,\" and that if one student was graded unfairly, it's ok because then everyone would have been graded unfairly so it evens out. Overall, take the course if it's required, which is probably why you're taking it anyway.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is a requirement for most STEM majors, but otherwise, it is fairly pointless if you have placed out of it.",
    "Good course, in general. If you have a strong background of biology and especially biochemistry, the class will be very easy. If you don't, you can always sign up for the enrichment sections, but you should know that the course moves really fast from one topic to another (even though not in great depth). I would recommend it if you are interested in biology and of course if it is a prerequisite.",
    "BIOL 101 is a necessary course to take if you're going to be a bio major or if you are premed. The AP class I took in high school covered basically all of the material we learned though, so it was a bit frustrating to have to learn a lot of this material again. I think it's tough because taking AP helped me a lot in this class (but also made the class kind of tedious sometimes), and I can definitely see how someone who hasn't taken AP might struggle with the pace of the course, so it's hard to say who to\/whether I'd recommend it.",
    "BIOL 101 is an introductory biology course that is a great transition class from high school to college. It is taught very well, and I would recommend this to another student that needs to or wants to take biology.",
    "It is a basic biology class, and one of the better done modules in the sequence. Do not really recommend unless you need it as a pre-requisite.",
    "I would not recommend BIOL 101 unless you are really in love with the subject, and even then there are probably other classes that are more worth your time!",
    "I think biology 101 is an interesting class and serves as a good introduction to biology in general. The class is more work than I was expecting and takes a lot of memorization, but overall most of the concepts are pretty straight forward. For an intro science course, I think biology 101 is good, and actually sparked my interest in biology in general.",
    "Nice introduction to the biological sciences through the perspective of biochemistry and biophysics. I would recommend this course, especially because it is required for further academic choices.",
    "It's very fast paced and the weekly quizzes are stressful, but it's okay and easy to get a decent grade if you study. Much easier than 102 (although I've only been in 102 for a week).",
    "BIOL 101 is a course with great structure. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend unless it is needed for your major. It is not a very fun or particularly interesting class unless it is required.",
    "Definitely recommended for science majors to take this course. It will give a throughout understanding to biochemistry. Professor Koelle is really provoking deeper thinking to some concepts through offering \"professor challenges the class\" and mandatory Q&A session. And even for non-science majors this course will also be very valuable as it trains students for logical thinking and information analysis.It is not too hard to understand the course as the outline and key points are listed clearly in the lecture slides.",
    "Most people take Bio 101 only because they have to. I would say, though, that for a prerequisite course, it's pretty good and satisfying! The whole thing was just very clear and organized. That doesn't mean it wasn't difficult at times, but overall I liked it.",
    "It's in general a transition from the high school perspective of biology to a college level perspective. You gotta do it for most STEM majors\/pre-med, and it's pretty simple material, so you'll know if you need to take it.",
    "BIOL 101 is a very well-organized course, which is really helpful especially for first semester freshmen. It was always clear what we needed to do and what we needed to study, and Professor Koelle is a strong lecturer who cares about his students. The weekly quizzes are admittedly frustrating with sometimes arbitrary grading -- you could get the right answer but lose points for the wrong wording, which made this the most stressful portion of the class; remember though that this grading system affects everyone, which means it ultimately affects no one. You're probably taking this course because you have to, but you'll survive without too much struggle.",
    "It was better than Bio 102 and slightly more organized, but still rather bad for an intro bio course.",
    "I would certainly recommend BIOL 101 to a student looking for an engaging introduction to the subject. Obviously, it is a prerequisite for many majors, but it is also an enjoyable class to be a part of.",
    "very organized course, the quizzes are challenging but it serves as a good introduction to basic biology.",
    "Easy if you took AP Bio",
    "Yes!! Great class. Basically a review and continuation of AP biology.",
    "It is an important foundational class, suitable for major and non-majors alike.",
    "This class is okay. If you've taken AP Bio you won't learn much new material. The lecture is well organized and the slides are easy to follow along with, and the reading helps you understand anything you missed in lecture. The quizzes take a couple of hours of revision the night before if you've been exposed to the material, and probably longer if this is your first time seeing it. The quizzes were graded pretty harshly and points were taken off seemingly randomly.",
    "Solid class. Good introduction to sciences at Yale.",
    "As good as an intro bio class can be. Take it because you have to and be thankful it is as engaging and well taught as it is, but not a course to write home about.",
    "Yes it is a nice intro into biology which has a very manageable workload.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 to other students if they are considering pre-med or a science major like MCDB. It is not that hard for those who took AP Bio in high school and, if you are willing to put in a lot of effort, it is manageable for students coming in with no AP Bio experience.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The professor is easy to understand and the material covered is graspable and interesting.",
    "BIOL 101 is great! The hardest part is keeping up with the material because it moves quickly and there are weekly quizzes that are more comprehensive than simply spitting back facts. Even so, Professor Koelle ensures that everyone keeps up, and the course builds upon itself, which is super satisfying and made me excited about bio!",
    "If you took AP Biology in high school, then BIOL 101 is review of that and builds on the knowledge from that. You should take BIOL 101 if you're interested in biology and have a good background in biology (AP Biology).",
    "BIOL 101 is a very good introductory course to college level biology, and I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, If you have passion for bio this class will help you explore the subject and really learn to think like a scientist. I absolutely loved it.",
    "This course was a starter course for the rest of Biology and lacked any depth for further understanding, instead focusing on more memorization than anything else. I wouldn't recommend this course for a student not required to take it, as I do not believe it helped me better understand the topics at all."
