    "This course is ideal for quants. If you are not (as I am not), you will suffer terribly. I took this course purely for intellectual curiosity, and I disappointingly ended up learning very little. There is nothing \"introductory\" about this course. If you're not already extremely comfortable with abstract math (e.g. equations consisting of all variables) then you will have a difficult time. For example, at one point Professor Debs was working through a problem on the board and turned to the class, saying, \"And as you can see from the equation this would obviously graph as a downward-turning parabola.\" If you're not the kind of person who can look at an equation and see how \"obvious\" that is, you shouldn't take this class. Take the similarly titled course \"Game Theory for Political Science instead. It's much more accessible.",
    "I learned a bit about strategical beliefs and rationality of actors in these theoretical games.",
    "I learned how to find pure, pure-mixed, and mixed-mixed Nash EQs and Baysian EQs. I also learned how to solve oligopoly, divide the pie, and sequential bargaining games. Finally, we learned about game theoretical frameworks with which to analyze preventative ward and bargaining theory. We learned about the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis and how it vaguely applied to credible threats.",
    "The course does make you think about decision making in International Relations, which I found myself applying to everyday life. This course was very difficult and every problem was a challenge. This class is more focused on game theory than international relations, because it is difficult to build a foundation to later apply to international conflict. The problem sets for the class were very difficult, but they were not weekly. It forced me to challenge myself.",
    "I way to view decisions I thought were more subjective in a more objective lens.",
    "I knew absolutely nothing about game theory coming into this class and have come out with a very solid understanding of the foundations of game theory. It was a much more quantitative course than I had originally imagined it to be. We often discussed how to apply models learned in game theory to real life international relations situations, which was very interesting.",
    "I learned more about how we can quantify parties' preferences in a situation such as war, oligopoly production, and in simple matters. Also I gained further insight into the historical framework of the 2003 Iraq War and how it defined what each country involved valued in this exchange. It also defined the utility assigned to each outcome of the war and helped me to explain how the Iraq War started. Unrelated to the actual coursework, I saw the value of practicing the material repeatedly before exams. It really helped solidify the material in my mind and was essential for me to survive this class.",
    "I learned a lot about game theory, critical thinking, and mathematical analysis to instances of communication and cooperation.",
    "I gained a new perspective on why people\/countries\/etc. make different decisions and if these decisions are rational based on the other decision markers' actions and the expected utility\/economic models, rather than using psychology to determine actions.",
    "The class covers a variety of topics in Game Theory - with a focus on different types of equilibria. It also demonstrates how each of these topics are applicable to real-world settings, specifically international relations and war.",
    "I learned about the complex mathematical representation of games, wars, and competitions. I also discovered that game theory wasnt right for me.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of game theory, applied at times to an international relations context. The course was very interesting and challenging, but it gave me a new set of tools to think about strategic interactions and problem solving. I greatly enjoyed this course. I did not need it for the global affairs major since my class does not require it, but I still found the course immensely beneficial. It definitely added a foundation and tool set to a major that can at times feel too open-ended and un-guided.",
    "Not much, even though I did pretty well on problem sets and exams. Nothing about this course is well-structured or pedagogically sound. I doubt anyone in the class will remember anything weeks from now.",
    "I did not develop any knowledge, skills or insights by taking this class. All we did, the entire semester was to compare numbers and calculate fractions. That was all the skill-building. In terms of knowledge, the class had nothing to do with international relations. As a Global Affairs major, I do not understand at all what we were supposed to learn from this class. Perhaps one insight was that some (that is very limited) interactions could be modeled with mathematics, but that is not useful for anything unless you want to go into academia and write papers. I mean, after all, literally half the class dropped out after the midterm."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course should be taught with a \"crawl-> walk-> run\" methodology, as opposed to the \"crawl->marathon\" methodology that Yale QR courses love to use.",
    "I believed the class was very well taught. Both the professor and TF were engaged and responsive to students. One of the weaknesses of the course is that there is very limited access to solved practice problems. Math textbooks, for example, have tons of worked out examples or at least answers to questions with which you can check. For game theory, textbooks have at most one guided example per chapter and have no answers to other textbook problems. While you are exposed to a few more practice problems in section, when it comes to studying for the midterm and final, there are very little examples with which to work.",
    "The class does not touch on international relations enough, and it does not do a good job of effectively teaching the material.",
    "This course should have been 75 minutes, not 50. Professor Debs often struggled to cover all the material on his ambitious syllabus in this short amount of time. Also, the assigned textbooks did not do a good job explaining the steps and mathematical reasoning of the practice problems, which made trying to do catch-up work on material we didn't get to in lecture very difficult. Often, Professor Debs's explanations of practice problems were neither clear nor engaging, leaving many students lost but not wanting to sound dumb by asking him to repeat everything he said in the last 10 minutes. Section was very helpful, but it often ran over time trying to cover what we missed in lecture because of time constraints. Molly was fantastic! I enjoyed exploring the case of the Iraq War and applying existing game theoretical literature to strengthen our arguments.",
    "The pace of the course made it difficult to digest. I felt expected to understand notation that we had never seen before in order to understand more complex material. The lacking foundational knowledge hurt my ability to engage with the material. I enjoyed the days we spoke about conflict and applications of game theory. I don't think you need a huge background to understand the basic premise of games which allows us to discuss how they apply to IR.",
    "I loved this course- the instructor was terrific and the material interesting. My one suggestion would be that the answer keys were not intuitive, and it would be nice if they talked through the steps of how to solve things more. In addition, if the steps of how to solve problems were made available on the lecture slides that would be very helpful.",
    "Professor Debs really cares about the subject matter and is also very invested in the students in the course- he learned every single person's name, even though it was taught very much in a lecture format. He was also available outside of class for help with problem sets or with general questions. We were given plenty of time to finish all of the problem sets, although the material covered on them was often much more difficult or pushed beyond what we had covered in class. The tests and problem sets were definitely difficult, and required a fair amount of studying of material that was not in the lecture slides.",
    "Professor Debs is amazingly smart. From writing the paper, I could tell just how respected he is in the field of political science and how much information he holds at his fingertips. It was truly a positive experience of my Yale career to be taught by someone who knew so much of the material. However, that also plays into the weakness; there were times that he was too smart and took our ability to keep up with his lectures as a given. The sections were amazingly helpful and helped to alleviate this problem a bit. Molly was very nice and extremely intelligent. She never had a problem with going over an idea however many times it took for every student who had a question on the topic to understand. On that same note, in addition to being very knowledgeable on the material, Professor Debs seemed genuinely invested in passing on that knowledge to us. During lectures, it was difficult to understand the information. During his office hours, however, he was extremely helpful. But more than that, he was approachable and personable with every student. He knew our names within the first two or three weeks, he never hesitated to make himself available to our inquiries, and he often asked about our lives outside of school in an effort to get to know us better. In summary, although I found it difficult to keep up with him at most points throughout the course, Professor Debs is a brilliant, but also down-to-earth teacher that I had the blessing of being taught by.",
    "I wish it had more references to international relations! I felt like I didn't really learn that much about IR. However, I love math, so it was a nice surprise that this was the majority of the course.",
    "Strengths: Very organized lectures, easily-approachable and accessible professor, interesting for economics majors or more mathematical. In my opinion, an easier QR than Microeconomics if you need a QR credit. Weaknesses: Very little discussion of international relations other than the Cuban Missle Crisis and the Iraq war, concepts seem rushed at times with little explanation of variables\/where concepts come from, unsure how representative this class is to the Global Affairs major as a whole.",
    "I thought the class covered a good amount of material - we studied many topics in depths, but never to an extent that felt unreasonable. Although there wasn't as much focus on international relations as I might have hoped, I was happy with my understanding of the material when we did apply it, so I see why we had to focus on the concepts first. I think a weakness of this class was the difficulty of the Psets- they take forever. Luckily, the grading is generous and they are very collaborative, but the amount of time they took each week was slightly unreasonable. The exams were also very hard but the were graded very very fairly (read - curved well) so it worked out fine.",
    "The sections are very helpful, but it would have been good to perhaps have an extra TA as sometimes I find that it was difficult to get my questions answered.",
    "Strengths: lectures are very organized and sections are helpful. Weaknesses: very difficult problem sets, even more difficult exams, readings that did not help us prepare for the problem sets\/lecture materials.",
    "Strengths: engaging lectures, challenging problem sets, a lot of course support (TAs, professors), clear material, good textbooks. Great course overall! Weaknesses: the biggest weakness is that students were not allowed to see their graded midterms (exams were not returned) and no explanation was given for this. Students often do not remember the exact answers they put down on an exam, so it is difficult for students to look at the posted solutions and identify their mistakes. Other weaknesses - sometimes the problem set solutions were used much more difficult terminology than we are used to from section, and so it was hard to understand how the problems were correctly solved. The lecture slides could also be supplemented -- often times a lot of work was done on the board, and it would be helpful to have this material to refer to when studying and reviewing.",
    "I firmly believe that the course does not have even a single strength. It is absolutely the worst course I have taken in my three years at Yale. Putting aside the fact that the material was pretty challenging, Prof. Debs' instruction was astoundingly poor, and his expectations from us in problem sets and exams were unduly high. The lectures were ridiculous in their robotic regurgitation of textbook definitions, formulas, and examples. Nothing about Prof. Debs' lectures made the material comprehensible, engaging, or exciting. There was always a huge gap between what we were \"taught\" in class and what we were expected to do on problem sets. Furthermore, roughly 90% of the course is about game theory as such, and only the rest covers its applications to political science and international relations. There were even a handful of lectures solely focused on purely economical problems and concepts. In short: this course must be either radically restructured, or transferred to the Department of Economics, or cancelled altogether.",
    "I think that the material was extremely dry and lacking in any kind of formal international relations or political science focus. Prof. Debs, while seemingly a good person, was dismissive of the students and was simply a terrible lecturer. I try to be as nice to professors as possible in these evaluations, but there simply is no other way to put it. Prof. Debs did not know how to explain difficult concepts and neither did Molly. We had to do a lot of self-teaching which is hard to do at a fast-pace place like Yale. I did not receive any kind of constructive feedback on any of the assignments. Molly did not point out exactly what steps we did wrong on the pset. Most of the feedback said see the solution (and same with Debs). Further, we were not allowed to see our exams to know what we got right or wrong, which was downright disruptive to the learning process. How is the answer key to the exam is supposed to be useful if someone cannot hold a thousand numbers from an exam paper in their head? The workload was EXTREME. Psets took many many hours and there was very little help from Molly or Prof. Debs. Further, virtually ALL of the pset questions were based on stuff that we did not cover in class. So the psets ended up becoming a lot more self-teaching and 3 a.m. freak-outs. The sections, which are supposed to be the time for our questions, were simply used to teach extra material, which made the class even more difficult."

   "comments": [
    "If you're a quant\/QR type of person, then yes. If not, avoid at all costs.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class if you are interested in International Relations. Before choosing to take this specific game theory course, I would shop the other ones first to see which most interests you. If I weren't a prospective Global Affairs student, I probably would have taken the course in the economics department instead of the political science one.",
    "Never take this class. I only took it because it was a global affairs requirement. The class does not teach anything valuable about international relations and is all on game theory. The name is misleading, and it is the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Honestly, I am not sure who this class is marketed towards. I took it thinking applying game theory to cases of international relations would make the math more palatable (I am a political science person, not a math person), but often the applications to international relations seemed forced and inorganic. It seemed like the trajectory of learning paused for two weeks when we did the unit on the Iraq war and its rationality, given that we did not apply any of the material that we had learned in the past few weeks. If someone wanted to learn about game theory, I'd tell them to take the large game theory lecture. If someone wanted to learn about international relations, I would tell them to take any number of geopolitics classes. The subject matter of this class seemed to not have a clear purpose in terms of the applications of the skills we learned to the subject matter we learned.",
    "I took this class, but it was not a requirement for my major. Most other students in the course were Global majors who needed the credit. I would recommend this course to those interested in both international relations and math, especially to those who are good at logic puzzles. If you are not one of these students, the course will be very challenging and potentially less rewarding.",
    "Yes, it is something different and interesting",
    "This course is engaging and interesting, and I feel like I am a better student because of this course. Professor Debs is brilliant, and this course, while interesting, is challenging. Try to find a good group to work with and don't let the material intimidate you- the tests are fair and doable if you prepare well.",
    "Most people who are taking this are likely doing so because they have to for the global affairs major. I would recommend it, but would clarify that it is a pretty straightforward game theory class, and that it is not made any more fluffy or qualitative just because it is a global requirement- expect to be doing similar quantitative exercises as you would in an econ labeled course.",
    "I would only recommend this course to those who are prepared to put in the required work to do well. They should not view this as simply a requirement for the Global International Security track. It is very difficult and forces you to use a combination of logic, quantitative math, and intuition to understand the concepts covered.",
    "Fantastic class! Professor Debs is a kind, caring instructor who really goes out of his way to make sure you feel comfortable. As a Global major, the game theory was applicable but yet not as easy as you'd think. Overall, a great class if you're willing to do the psets well, and learn the material!",
    "Definitely! I do feel like it has a niche interest though. You have to love math. I'm lucky because I didn't know the course would involve this much math beforehand, but I really loved it!",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student interested in Global Affairs or international relations. Even though it's technically under the Global Affairs major, I saw little connection to how game theory relates to current international relations decisions and we never talked about current affairs; you were just expected to make these connections for yourself. If you're interested specifically in game theory, then yes, take this class, but do not expect to get a deeper understanding of international relations or the global affairs major from this class.",
    "Yes - but with some qualifications. I took this class with absolutely no background in Game Theory or Econ, I hadn't taken intro Econ, and I'm literally horrible at math (I don't do calculous) I did fine in the class, and got a lot out of it! However, I would not have dropped it early on if I didn't have a close friend in the class to help me. The Psets are ridiculously hard, and often don't correlate with what we do in class. This friend would spend upwards of 6 or 7 hours each week helping me with the material, and way more than that for each exam. I did well in the class, and I enjoyed it, especially the real-world applications. So take it if it interests you, but if you're worried about the math and the work, proceed with caution.",
    "Personally, I did not have a very good experience in this class and I would not take it if all youre looking for is to fulfill your QR requirement. The only time I found the class interesting was when it connected directly to historical examples\/international relations, but unfortunately that was only about 15-20% of the course.",
    "A great course for anyone who wants an introduction to game theory. It is a challenging course, but definitely easier than those offered in the economics department. I strongly recommend this course to people who are majoring in political science\/international relations, as it gives you a new set of tools and a new approach to strategic interactions. Professor Debs is a great professor as well and explains the material well.",
    "Absolutely NO. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! It's not worth your energy, regardless of how much time and effort you put into it, or how much you may be interested in the material. Prof. Debs might be a nice person and a talented scholar, but he is not a good teacher. And you need an excellent teacher to learn something as challenging as game theory. I took the course because I am a Political Science major and needed a QR: it turned out to be the worst decision I have made at Yale. I would rather take another PLSC course *and* a gut QR, and have a 6-credit term. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. Nothing about this course can redeem the disaster that it was.",
    "If you are a political science major, I would not recommend this class. For global affairs it is required in the security track, so if you are into security you have to take it. (And the class has nothing to do with IR whatsoever, Prof. Debs showed us a clip from Dr. Strangelove and tried to reduce Iraq War into a mathematical model. But everything else was pure math.)For everyone else, stay away from Prof. Debs and game theory, you will be thankful for it and have a better term. This class literally ruined my term."
