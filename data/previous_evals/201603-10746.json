   "comments": [
    "literary analysis and close reading",
    "I gained so much insight into how classical literature has developed over time and how later works have built upon ideas brought forth in ancient literature. As Professor Robinson has repeatedly said, you leave this class knowing less than you did at the beginning. This is very true because this class opens your eyes to subtle and deeper layers of these pieces that remain unanalyzed if you do not search for them.",
    "The course really helped me learn to read and appreciate drama in ways that I didn't before. I was introduced to artistic and literary subtleties in the works we read that really helped me appreciate them more.",
    "For one, you get the added knowledge of reading through about 15 of the most influential tragedies every written, so there's that. Professor Robinson is also an incredible professor; there isn't too much class discussion, but that was alright, because his knowledge of the material was quite illuminating.",
    "I took the course to be exposed to some of the great canonical works, and I was. However, I didn't expect to enjoy them as much as I did.",
    "I was able to read and analyze great plays, expanding my literary knowledge. I also became better at reading, analyzing, critiquing and understanding novels\/plays better.",
    "A survey of Drama from Greek times to now.",
    "I was able to read a variety of books and writing styles, and had to do so quickly (given the survey format of the class). It was also incredibly insightful hearing what both Mr. Robinson and my peers had to say in each week's discussions.",
    "changed my perspective on the classics. constructed a whole timeline for European literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: intimate seminar style weaknesses: lack of student engagement, professor should be less humble",
    "The strengths are definitely the carefully-chosen selection of books and Professor Robinson, who is so erudite and passionate about teaching.",
    "Honestly I think this is a brilliant course - my only complaint is that there isn't enough time! We rush through so many amazing works, it would be nice to be able to take some more time.",
    "The biggest strength is obviously the professor; Professor Robinson is one of the sweetest individuals you will have the privilege of meeting at Yale. The reading workload is a bit tough at times, but really not too bad; the writing workload is similarly not too bad, though I wonder about the spacing between paper deadlines. The curriculum is quite good; only suggestion I would have is to throw out a couple of the Euripides plays, as four is quite a lot.",
    "The strengths are, of course, the books. There were times when I felt like classroom discussion was somewhat surface level, or at least too brief, but this is necessary in light of the volume.",
    "I think perhaps the class could have benefitted from more discussion between students in class. I felt like a lot fo the time we were just listening to our professor talk about the plot of the play, but to his credit he did try to engage the class in discussion, so it may be our fault that it was so quiet. Although maybe he could try different tactics to engage and get the class to participate in the discussion.",
    "The course was exactly what I wanted out of a classics\/ literature course, and Mr. Robinson was the perfect one to teach it.",
    "This was an excellent course. Professor Robinson is incredibly insightful, and gives a rich historical background to many of the Greek tragedies in the course and weaves their themes seamlessly into the modern repertoire. The course is front-loaded, so you read the most at the beginning with the Iliad. After this, you read one play per class which is very manageable.",
    "the material is selected very well. a great introductory course. however, the class size can be smaller, provoking more discussion"

   "comments": [
    "YEEBOI",
    "Although it is a lot of work, the payoff of this class is far greater. My writing, thinking, and reading skills all improved. I gained knowledge of and insight into important works of literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who doesn't have a great knowledge of theatre or the history of drama, and wants to learn more!! Or to anyone who just wants to read some good plays haha",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. Professor Robinson is great, lectures are fun to go to (even at 9 in the morning), the material is fantastic, etc. Even if you just need a WR credit, like I did, you should take the time and effort to take this course instead of taking whatever guttiest thing you can find; Professor Robinson is really that good. I realize there is some debate nowadays, though not about this course, about the validity and authenticity of the Western canon, and the mechanisms that make these works the \"good\" ones--however, these plays really are quite important, and certainly worth your time. There's something in here for everybody, so take it.",
    "Absolutely, even to a non-humanities major. I have STEM friends who have taken it and 130 and thoroughly enjoyed them.",
    "The reading load is pretty rigorous - 100-200 pages for each class, and class twice a week. Four papers and a final exam. BUT, Professor Robinson is actually AMAZING and so good at humanizing the text, while also pointing out really cool themes and details in them. Also so funny (not sure I would take a 9am non-required course with anyone else) and kind and understanding. Really cares about the students. As someone who thought she would really not enjoy reading books in Western canon (I much prefer books by women and people of color), I enjoyed them much more than I expected.",
    "I believe literature is highly important and this course is a great writing class with plays from a varied time period, from Greek tragedy all the way to plays by Ibsen. This course has what I think is a very good list of works and the professor was great.",
    "Yes I would recommend because it builds a strong reservoir of knowledge, a good base for literature of the world. Comprehensive. Quite a bit of reading but all easy to follow and it felt important that I read these tragedies. Nice to meet with Professor Robinson to review essays.",
    "I am not an English or Literature major, I took this class to have a solid survey of drama, especially Ancient stuff. I would recommend this course to others for this purpose.",
    "Definitely. It is a great course if you are interested in literature or if you would like to improve both your analytical skills and writing skills.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to an individual that wants a basic introduction to the most important tragedies in European literature.",
    "yes, especially for Lit students. the material is really the basis of literature."
