    "Be prepared for the increase in workload in the last few weeks. Review perturbation theoryon your own if you haven't seen. Go to talk with Professor DeMille outside of class if you don't understand, that can really help. Be prepared for tough exams that are too long and where the class average will be low. I rate the workload \"greater\" than average because of the significant increase in work at the end of course. The first course is standard to maybe slightly less than usual for an intensive physics class.",
    "A continuation of quantum mechanics, this class treats more realistic problems than the introductory ones in 440, and as a result is both more interesting and relevant, and more complicated and difficult. You will focus a lot on the fine structure of the hydrogen atom, and effects such as the Zeeman effect. Perturbation theory will be used heavily. Take the class if you feel up to it.",
    "Not all that bad, believe it or not. I found myself enjoying it. Just make sure you give it a solid amount of time and work on problem sets ahead of time. The textbook is great.",
    "If you like physics go for it. Quantum is probably one of the weirdest and most interesting areas of physics there is right now.",
    "This course is wonderful, and easily the best of the 400-level physics courses - you learn about quantum systems that are much closer to the sort of work that goes on in the laboratory these days and generally attain a much better understanding of how QM works, including the various unusual \"paradoxes\" inherent to quantum mechanics. It's about the same amount of work as its prerequisite (PHYS 440), and Prof. DeMille tries (and generally does a good job of) limiting the amount of time you need to spend on this course to 10-12 hours per week.",
    "I would recommend the course to anybody who finds QM interesting. It's well taught, and the material is interesting, I think. It corresponds to the real world a lot more than QM I.",
    "This course is great. Anyone with a background in multivariable calculus and statistics that has an interest in the physical world should take this course. It is a great introduction to the forefront of developments in physics research.",
    "DeMille does a very good job of teaching this class, compared to other professors who have taught it in the past. If you can take it with him, definitely do. His exams and psets are very difficult, but he curves the class pretty generously so do not worry too much about your grade. Odds are you do not have much of a choice about taking this class.",
    "If you're thinking about this class, you probably already know whether you have to take it or not. That being said, take it with DeMille if you can. He's a great lecturer and a fantastically intelligent guy.",
    "If you want to really know how the quantum world works on a basic level, this is what you need. But know what you're getting into. There's a reason most people don't understand quantum mechanics, it's hard to understand.",
    "Topics in the first half of the semester build on themselves: hydrogen atom and various extra components to the hamiltonian. Rest of the semester a little more all over the place. See Griffiths, chapters 4-8. As you should be used to by now, 15 hour pset per week, bringing the frustration of the impossible 6-hour problem every now and then and the joy of finally figuring it out.",
    "This course is a big step up from the first semester. The material moves fast. Definitely don't take it if you haven't taken 440.",
    "Continuation of Physics 441. Decent course but not particularly rewarding for me.",
    "The course is difficult but is also very interesting. If you haven't been scared off by 440 or 439, you'll probably be fine here and should take it. It's not much harder than Demille's 440, so if you have taken it, you know what to expect. Fyi, note that the workload (readings+class time+homework) is intended to be 15 hours a week although your mileage will vary some from week to week and from person to person. Find yourself a group to work in from the start. If you try to do the homework completely independently, you risk spending far more than 15 hours if you get stuck on questions here or there."
