   "comments": [
    "Any composer should take this class. Microtonality is an extremely important aspect of music and it is very difficult to get educated about. This is a unique opporunity.",
    "Definitely try to take 450. It will expose you to a lot of things you probably wouldn't see otherwise. Plus a great place to work on compositions.",
    "This is a class all about tuning systems, timbres, and compositional systems that make use of them. I would absolutely recommend it if you're interested in early music performance, new music performance, or electronic music. The level of understanding you get from this class is really useful.",
    "Definitely take this course if you have any interest in music - the justification for how and why scales are constructed is really interesting. If you have only ever composed in the standard 12-tone equal-temperament scale, take this class for an unusual perspective.",
    "450 covers some very interesting topics relating to tuning systems, spectral music and technology. It is a very specialized topic but horizon-expanding and taught very much in-depth. Highly recommended if you're up for it."
