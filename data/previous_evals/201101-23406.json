    "We had one field trip to the lab. We should have gotten out more to look at diseases and insects and damaged trees. It was a cold spring, but we didn't get out once.",
    "#9: This course would have benefited greatly from more time in the field looking at questions of forest pathology.#10: This is an extremely valuable course for the MF curriculum.",
    "9) I know that there was a strong recommendation to find an entomologist when you become employed in a region and go out into the field with them in order to learn how to ID forest health issues in the field, but it also would have been very helpful for there to be a class trip to Yale Myers or another nearby forest.",
    "#9: This class of all classes at FES NEEDS a lab and field trips! Forest health is a topic that involves the tangible. We should have a lab in which we can touch and observe fungi and insects. We should take trips around East Rock or the School Forest to observe diseased trees. Hearing about diseases and seeing pictures of diseased trees is inadequate.",

    "The guest lectures given by Mary Tyrrell and Talbot Trotter were an excellent addition to the overall curriculum of the course.The discussion around papers on climate change was enlightening, helped the class get to know one another, and enlivened the schedule.I really enjoyed writing the final paper for this course. I struggled with picking the topic because there were no less than three things I actually wanted to research more deeply after learning about them in the class. I wish that more FES courses had us write multiple times throughout the semester, and this course might be one that that would work well for with two shorter papers required--one just before or after spring break and a second at the end of the semester.",

    "Too many lectures that are outlines. Maybe adding case studies and having students develop strategies for dealing with forest health issues.",
    "Field trips. It would be realy helpful to get out into the woods and look at some Armillaria, some adelgid, and so forth.Articles: We read a number of fantastic publications, but I feel that we did not talk about them enough.",
    "this class should have had at least one field trip to the woods. seeing pathogens in the forest would have made the course much more useful. the organization of the class was not very intuitive to me. the lectures seemed to jump around a lot. spend less time talking about the concept of \"what is forest health\" and more time talking about specific pests and pathogens.",
    "The lectures could be reorganized to have less overlap, which sometimes caused confusion. A more structured, repeated method for presenting diseases, pathogens, insects may also be helpful. The varying levels of detail sometimes caused confusion.The extremely opened ended questions on the midterm, while good questions, were hard to appropriately address in the time allotted for the exam. Getting us to write answers is valuable, but I think the class would appreciate questions are of moderate scope.Really, really would have appreciated a field trip to see some diseases\/pathogens in the field! I think theremay have even been a stump on Edwards Street between Whitney and Propsect that had honey colored mushrooms that we could have assessed.",
    "Needs field trips and labs.",
    "I wish we had more opportunity to identify real life forest health issues. For example, I learned a lot of information on certain bark beetles, which is essentially useless since I am not working in areas where bark beetles is a problem. But I was hoping I'd be able to see a tree or stand of poor health and ID the problem and propose a solution. But after this class I dont think I can do that."

She was very helpful organizing things, fixing digital glitches and such on v2, and responding to organizational questions such as timing of assignments. So, in this regard, she was very helpful. With the material, it was harder for her to be helpful because she was seeing much of the material for the first time as we were.",

    "Yes, for better and worse.",
    "I had mixed expectations for this course and the course then exceeded them quite nicely.A few comments:1. Posting the lectures before they are given is very helpful.2. There were some points during the class where we were unclear as to what the next lecture was or what the assignments were. Professor Camp could be more clear and explicit about these and also be better at updating the syllabus in a timely fashion.3. Much of the material in the lectures is memorizable, as in- we should read it, learn it, and then come to class to talk about it. I think we spent to much time learning details in class and not enough time talking about how they fit together.4. The expectations on learning latin names were not clear. We should get a list at the beginning explaining what we needed to learn for the assessments.5. The content on the midterm was largely unexpected. I would have preferred a little more clarity as to what we would be asked to do. Ditto for the final- there was one section on the final where we were asked to identify pathogens as native or non-native. While this distinction was stressed throughout the year, I thought that this section of the exam was out of the blue and unfair.",
    "not really.",
    "It actually exceeded my expectations, particularly because as I applied for jobs the information I was learning I was able to reference in interviews. I pursued two job opportunities that were directly related to forest health issues we discussed in the class.",
    "It did well.",
    "No. I wish there had been labs and field trips. The lectures and class discussions were excellent, however.",

Study up on the Pacific Northwest- Dr. Camp references this region quite a bit and it is helpful to have a basic understanding of what the species are out there.",

Will help you to avoid confusion when any are discussed in multiple lectures and will aid in your studying for the final exam.",
