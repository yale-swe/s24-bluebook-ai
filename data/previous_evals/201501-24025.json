    "Yes. Prof Mahler is really excellent at leading discussion. I think he puts a lot of thought into assigning the readings. He brings in news articles to for us to engage with as well. The readings are generally quite interesting and the workload is just about right.",
    "Interesting, but at times repetitive.",
    "I'd only recommend this if a student has an interest in political science and sociology. The sociological theory can get heavy sometimes. I felt like we discussed \"why\" news gets made the way it is, but not quite as much of the \"how.\"",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. Professor Mahler is such a nice, chill dude. The reading and assignments are pretty manageable and interesting. Not super stressful but you learn a lot.",
    "An overview of the challenges that journalists and politicians face in the process of creating political news. Definitely a mixture between case studies and sociology texts."
