    "Evolutionary Medicine is a fascinating field! The course itself is a lot of work, but you will learn so much from it.",
    "A course that will open you mind to evolution and medicine. Highly recommend",
    "Evolution & Medicine was one of my favorite courses at Yale. Professor Stearns is a great professor who is unbelievably responsive and well-organized. I feel like I learned a lot from the course, both from the lecture material and writing my paper. The flipped classroom works well here and having a small seminar of 8 people meant that we all got a lot of air time. Also it is really nice to be able to eat dinner with Professor Stearns on Tuesdays as it gives you a chance to get to know him outside of class. Overall HIGHLY recommend.",
    "E&EB235 Evolution and Medicine was one of the best classes I took at Yale. It is taught by the acclaimed life history and evolutionary medicine professor Stephen Stearns. Structure of the course: The class meets once a week. We are required to answer questions related to the assigned textbook reading before attending class. For those who learn better through lectures, Professor Stearns has provided online video lectures of the textbook material. In addition to textbook reading, there are also primary literature papers. We typically spend the first half of class discussing topics that we find interesting or difficult to understand. The second half of the class is focused more on creative thinking, applying the concepts that we learned from both the textbook and primary source readings. Class size: ~10 per class (we had two class sections in the fall of 2015). Workload and assignments: Grading is based on one large research assignment (50% of the grade), the weekly questions, and participation in section. The weekly quizzes get progressively harder and longer throughout the course. However, the quizzes assigned in the last few weeks are short and simple, allowing an ample amount of time to work on the research assignment. Most of the research assignment work is frontloaded, which I think is very helpful for everyone. The professor and TA's keep everyone on track, making sure that a complete outline of the paper is completed weeks before the end of the semester. TA sections: I believe the professor meets with the TAs before each TA section meets to discuss what would best help the students. Although some sections were certainly more helpful than others, I would say the quality of these sections have typically been higher than most other STEM sections I've attended so far. Overall, the course was great. It caused a paradigm shift in the way I think about biology.",
    "This was a great class, and I think more than any other I've taken at Yale, changed how I think about something: in this case, medicine. This class had a really good pace, and I appreciated how we had to have a draft done early on in the semester, as it reduced stress later on. It was also interesting how people had different backgrounds, as it made the in-class discussions much more interesting. If you're planning to do something related to medicine, you should take this class.",
    "This class is a great science seminar for students who want the opportunity to really engage with and understand the material. That being said, it can be more work at times (some chapters\/weekly responses can be longer than others, especially with the online lectures), but it balances out by having a great structured end of semester paper that I wasn't panicking at the last minute to finish."
