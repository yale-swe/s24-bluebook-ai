    "If you are interested in learning Classical Arabic, then this is your best\/only option at Yale. However, there is a lot of imporovement needed. This class is small, meaning that if there are a few advanced\/overqualified students, they shape the nature of the class.",
    "The reading is great, although definitely difficult to get used to at first. Once you get the hang of it, though, the stories become much more comprehensible and enjoyable. The professor can sometimes be very lecture-focused in terms of grammar, but he is very interested in getting feedback, so hopefully it will be more interactive in the future. Classical Arabic grammar is very specific and can be frustrating at times, but with practice, it will come to you. Grading can sometimes be a bit harsh, in that every little mistake is a big point off on tests, but they are generally fair.",
    "This class is strictly about reading\/interpretation skills and grammar. if you're looking for strengthening speech skills reconsider taking this class",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with more than a Level 1, Level 2 Modern Standard background. Unfortunately one of the problems of the MSA Arabic that is taught here is that it is done very poorly. This is a great, great course for someone who wants to learn the language, but the problem is, the foundation that should be provided from L1-L2 is totally lacking and so the course is much more harder than it actually needs to be.But if you have the background, or really love the language and will put in the work and ask Matteo for help, then you will feel very grateful and accomplished.",
    "You need to come into class prepared from the day one. Beware that there are some things that you are expected to know that were not covered in L2 Modern Standard Arabic. But, if you are at the proper level, you'll find the class very rewarding. The material requires a lot of work outside of the assigned homework so be prepared."
