   "comments": [
    "Latham leads the seminar very well with a good mix of straight lecture and discussion, and his knowledge of the facts on the ground is nigh-encyclopedic. On a personal note, I could not have asked for a better senior essay adviser. Latham is always prepared to meet outside of class, and my thesis would not have developed nearly as quickly without his ideas.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone; it covers the basics of bioethics enough that you can keep up even if you haven't had previous exposure, but not so much that it is repetitive to people who have done work in the area before.",
    "This is a pretty easy seminar. The reading is minimal and and final paper is mere an expansion of the midterm paper. Professor Latham is a pleasure to listen to and the topics covered are engaging. The books we read are also very good.",
    "Sure",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The workload is not terrible and the readings are interesting.",
    "Knowledgeable and witty professor, interesting and manageable readings, but a lot depends on the other people who take the class. If it doesn't look like people will be committed to doing the readings or bringing something to the table every week, you might as well just read the books\/articles off the syllabus on your own and save the credit for another class.",
    "Suuuhhhwwwweeeeet",
    "Absolutely. I think I might recommend Prof. Latham's lecture course more, but the seminar was great as well. Might have benefited from slightly more structure.",
    "I would recommend Bioethics because it gives you a solid framework for analyzing issues of bioethics. The course material is also very interesting and the workload is very manageable.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student because it allows the student to experience a range of subjects that are controversial in nature and there are nor easy answers to.",
    "Good easy seminar with really interesting subject matter",
    "Yes, definitely. The material is interesting, the workload isn't too large and the issues are easy to engage. It's somewhat of a survey seminar-- the material doesn't build too much on itself at all, which has pros and cons. Worth taking if you can get in, though.",
    "The course was a broad overview of central topics in Bioethics. I enjoyed the structure (alternative philosophy and social science), and thought that it succeeded in being interdisciplinary, which is a hard bill to fill between philosophy and social science. I would have liked to see more intense philosophical discussions. As is the danger in philosophical discussions, arguments would often be more broadly descriptive rather than specifically normative. We discussed the broad arguments about abortion, for instance, but the level of philosophical argument between students was not too intense. Professor Latham, while he was great at explaining the issues and answering questions, and while he would understand our points and respond to them in a way which was clarifying and very helpful, could have pressed us a little more to justify our positions.The course was not alot of work, although I'd encourage you to get help on the papers and work ahead of time on them--Professor Latham is available and very helpful, and generally a good guy.",
    "Bioethics, Politics, and Economics is a great course that evaluates several major bioethical issues in terms of ethical concerns, political history, and economic impact. I would definitely recommend it!Strengths: Professor Latham's familiarity with the material and easy-going manner; the reasonable workload; interesting readingsWeakness: Not enough student participation in class discussions"
