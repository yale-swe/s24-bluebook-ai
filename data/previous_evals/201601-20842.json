    "If you want to learn more about Latin American cinema through Latin American history, this is the course for you. I would recommend it tenfold.",
    "Worth it if you're interested in Latin American film. It is not an easy class.",
    "An excellent class if you're into film or if, like me, you know nothing about film but want to practice Spanish and learn about Latin America in a different way. There is quite a bit of work, but it is well spaced-out throughout the semester, and Margherita is really the absolute best professor. Her connections are amazing, and the optional sessions with directors are mind-blowing!",
    "Great class, less about established\/Hollywood type films and more about the history of Latin American cinema. It's more artsy, avant-garde type films than most popular\/highest box office in Latin America type films.",
    "This class will ask you to watch at least one movie a week, sometimes two. The work is not much, but is left largely to you to choose when to do it; if you procrastinate you'll have a bunch of write-ups to finish at the end of the semester. That said, if you're into film, or Spanish literature, or looking for a different type of L5, this class is great. Prof. Tortora is the most passionate professor I've had here. She's a wonderful human being and taking this class would be worth it just to meet her.",
    "Yes, it is a super interesting class however you do not get to practice Spanish as much in the class. If you have time to watch the movies, you definitely should because they are awesome movies and it allows you to participate in discussion as well.",
    "If you're interested in film and also looking to better your Spanish-speaking skills, then I would definitely recommend this class. It's fun, you get to watch movies, and then there is a final project where you get to make your own movie! In terms of the class, Professor Tortora is an amazing teacher! She personally knows Latin American cinematographers and actors\/actresses so we were able to meet them and discuss with them. Professor Tortora really cared about us and really wanted us to improve our Spanish-speaking skills as well as enjoy Latin American cinema. She knows so much about it and I learned an immense amount from her. She hosted film screenings and we were actually able to meet directors and actors\/actresses behind the films we watched. There is a lot of assigned reading, but as long as you watch the films then you should be fine. And the films are good! You can even watch with friends. The classroom atmosphere of watching film snippets in class and learning about and discussing films and Latin American history was great, and Tortora gave out candy to us every now and then. I would definitely recommend this class. It's a great L5 class."
