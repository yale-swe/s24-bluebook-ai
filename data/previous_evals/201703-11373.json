   "comments": [
    "I learned how to convert sharp criticism into opportunity to improve in an incredibly short time frame. This skill will certainly supplement any profession I choose to pursue.",
    "Grand Strategy taught me so much about, well, strategy. It really shifted my mindset for how politics, history, and the intersection of the two are taught and understood. I learned an immense amount about the subject of my briefing-- even more than I expected coming into the semester. I also am more confident when it comes to evaluating other people's arguments and strategies. 'Is this really plausible' is somethings GS pushed you to think about regularly. It's not just waxing poetic about what we wish would happen. GS shifted my mindset to understand that and I think that is incredibly useful.",
    "I learned to think about the world through a different lense,",
    "A systems-based, ecological approach to approaching problems. Intellectually worth it, even if class is also annoyingly focused on neocon fopo problems. And that's going away.",
    "Valuable insights about the application of grand strategy in today's social and political world. Experiences in teamwork under time pressure.",
    "This course has shaped the way I perceive and analyze the world. I now think of major decisions in terms of means and ends, and feel confident to tackle difficult multi-dimensional problems.",
    "I enjoyed learning what it must be like to work in government, and was taught to think within a framework I had never learned before.",
    "Probably the most practical class at Yale in some ways.",
    "How to effectively work in teams.",
    "How can we uphold the liberal democratic world order? What is an adequate and effective US Grand Strategy towards a resurgent Russia? A transformative program, Studies in Grand Strategy challenged me to grapple with topics and issues of global significance. It taught me to think geopolitically and strategically; to aspire grand ends with limited means. Both personally and professionally I would not be who I am today, had I not been fortunate enough to participate in this unique program.",
    "Basically all skills it's possible to develop, but particularly communication and research!",
    "In GS II, we learned how to exercise grand strategy in real life. From the briefings to the simulations, we grappled with real-world problems and worked together to tackle them. I came away from this course feeling much more confident about my abilities as a leader and strategic thinker.",
    "Enjoyed being in seminar with Jake Sullivan and learning about GS in practice. The latter half was very weak -- the marshall briefs have been dulled so much that they almost felt like a waste of time. The simulation was a waste of time for me. Dinners and cocktail hour are the best part of class.",
    "I gained a greater appreciation for strategic and macroscopic thinking, including techniques for developing strategies as well as evaluating a number of successful & failed strategies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course is incredible. Each seminar and module session was thought-provoking and engaging.",
    "I think this course needs to take a closer look at how grand strategy factors in humanity. I often think GS focuses too much of great geopolitical powers and not enough on the social movement or individual rights side of politics. That said when working in our briefings and in the crisis simulation it quickly became apparent as to why it can be a little too easy to throw those things out the window. You only have so little time and so few resources, how can one juggle maintaining power and security while ensuring rights everywhere. It is hard! As simpleminded as that sounds, I think GS could have done a better job of pushing us to come up with a strategy that accommodated both. Those are the kind of leaders we want to shape moving forward, and I think GS should be more cognizant of that.",
    "I think the course has many strengths, it gives people access to accomplished individuals and summer funding opportunity.",
    "The initial module was disorganized and overly theoretical, due in part to the lack of direct engagement between the professor and the guest lecturer (Jake Sullivan). Had there been more back-and-forth between the two--including direct challenges to each other's worldviews and the use of more specific case studies--students would have been more engaged.",
    "The silent majority of this class found the harsh and unnecessary critiques of the \"murder boards\" to be destructive. It is undoubtedly true that in the real world we will face crisitism and unfairness. You don't have to tell us that, we know it firsthand from tough internships, our bosses at student jobs, the job interviews that reject us, and our parents who struggle to earn what they did ten years ago. We are broken down by job recruitment processes that begin sophomore year and culminate in hostile work environments; the classroom must, therefore, build us up so that we retain the confidence and ability to articulate our ideas and present opposing arguments. If we don't feel safe to argue against our professors, no dissenting views will emerge in the classroom - which is exactly what they are trying to fight against. And if we can't confidently share our views in the classrooms of HGS, there is little hope that we will be able to do so in the real world.",
    "I would recommend a little more clarity regarding grading, particularly for participation and the group projects. I was unsure if my participation in the module portion of the class would make up the majority of my participation grade, or if the simulation and dinner attendance would factor in heavily as well. Otherwise, I think the course was great! This semester has been my favorite of the program, and I think it's a great balance between learning from practitioners in the modules, engaging in real strategy making, and practicing in real time with the simulation. Regarding the simulation, I would recommend making it more balanced between international and domestic issues. This would help incorporate the strengths\/interests of all students in the program, and better engage students with more U.S.-based roles (the Senate, journalists, etc.).",
    "During the briefing process (after week 6), there wasn't much useful, substantial guidance from the faculty. We could have been provided with more tangible resources to tackle a project of this scale and importance.",
    "This has been the best course I've taken at Yale. I wouldn't recommend any major changes which are not already being considered.",
    "The class is at its strongest in the springyou learn from incredibly impressive people and the group projects and crisis simulation are really fun.",
    "Better balance of expertise in different areas. Faculty who actually uses grand strategy to think about a variety of issues in the world today. More student to student debate.",
    "Studies in Grand Strategies has nothing but strengths. The program holistically joins both academic critical thinking and discussion skillls and team work sociability. The 6 week modules with distinguished practitioners and dinners inspired me to pursue a career for the common goood. The briefings and crisis simulation gave an unique opportunity to experience geopolitics as a teamand solve pressing global problems. Truly, its comprehensiveness made Studies in Grand Strategy the most meaningful experience of my time at Yale.",
    "I understand this was a transition year for the program, and I deeply admire professors who dedicate their time to the education of students. This evaluation is intended not as emotional catharsis for its author, but instead as a good faith submission of ideas that hopefully will lead to constructive changes in the program. Grand Strategy was a disappointment. I aspire to work in foreign policy and politics, so I was thrilled to be admitted to the program and was excited to delve into the material. But early in the year, there grew a broad malaise among students with the course. Students should spend part of the fall semester working with practitioners to make their summer research papers actionable. I fear that the financial investment the program makes in the summer research is not quite worthwhile if all we receive is a \"good experience.\" We should also receive guidance in how to make our papers publishable. Global Health Studies does this well perhaps the GS faculty may want to speak with them about how they do so. Class sessions consisted of students pretending to be knowledgeable about the assignments, since they did not read them. The guidelines for the policy brief were initially incoherent and led to significant student confusion. Promised feedback from certain professors about drafts of assignments was often slow in coming, if it came at all. There was a clear tension between the aims of the 'Old Guard' and the 'New Guard' of the program that spilled into class sessions. Ideally, that tension should be worked out in faculty meetings and not disrupt class. Thank you for your hard work, and I look forward to hearing about the program's future.",
    "We did not receive feedback on any of our assignments except the term paper. To date, I still do not know how my team did on our written brief and presentation. The instructors need to provide more written feedback, starting with the first round of presentations.",
    "The interdisciplinary approach is the biggest strength of the class -- having interesting discussions in seminar with real practitioners of GS. I think the 2nd half could be better structured -- I learned more in seminar and semester 1.",
    "As I told Professors Gage and Johnson, this experience changed my life. You simply cannot beat the access to extraordinary professors and practitioners. The dinners each week were phenomenal. The course is always looking to evolve, which I applaud. The tension between the old guard and the new leadership (even before this year) is obvious and most of the time it's more amusing than problematic. Several students have mentioned that the course needs to decide to be one thing or another (old school great power politics \/ military history-style strategy versus new school inclusive, millennial-accessible movements). I don't think it needs to decide, necessarily. I think that the course is navigating both of those impulses pretty well, frankly. Grand Strategy can be both old school and new school. My only real sadness is that I did not get to do every module."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to every Yale student as it forces you to be self-critical and improve your analytical skills within the short time-frame of a year.",
    "Grand Strategy has been a life-changing course. From the modules led by distinguished practitioners to the \"murder board\" policy briefings, I have learned so much from this course and my fellow classmates. We all leave deeply grateful for the experience we all shared together, and only hope to stay involved with the alumni network in future years.",
    "Yes, I would! It is a unique opportunity that you shouldn't pass up. Just make sure to always be critical of the work and the instruction, as high engagement in the class will only make it more worth it!",
    "I would recommend this class insofar as the summer funding provides a unique opportunity to conduct individual research and the opportunities to hear distinguished speakers is valuable. But the group project, through which the team presents to a panel unironaically referred to as a \"murder board,\" is shambolic. The panel judging the briefings intentionally rips apart students' presentations for sport. This does not \"make students tougher;\" it instead makes us scared to articulate dissenting opinions, deferential to one set of academic viewpoints, and less confident in the classroom. In addition, the class as a whole is also poorly administered, instructions are vague and unclear, and expectations are not clearly defined until assignments are returned with arbitrary grades.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The modules, group projects, and dinners are fantastic ways to connect with high-ranking government practitioners and scholars. All of the visiting scholars and full-time staff (Professor Gage, Professor Johnson, Professor Gaddis, Professor Hill, etc.) were very engaging and took the time to help students with every aspect of the program. The group projects and simulation also fostered a great sense of community within the program. I enjoyed bonding with my group members, and learning about the academic, extracurricular, and general life interests of my peers in the program. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale!",
    "Yes. A great experience overall. I believe it will be even better with the new changes.",
    "If you get it, take it. Grand Strategy has been the most rewarding class I've experienced at Yale and my college experience certainly would not have been the same without it. Be prepared to put in lots of work, especially in the second semester of the program, but also be prepared to leave the course with lots of special insights and an excellent framework for solving grand problems with limited means.",
    "Yes, you have amazing opportunities that you will never have again.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. There's a ton to this class that you don't realize is part of the class. Most of the learning isn't even about the stuff directly stated on the syllabus. I would also consider whether you'd want to use 2 credits for this class, but it's worth it.",
    "I think this course teaches you a great deal about how the world should work theoretically and how it actually does work. This course will be what you make of it, so seize on opportunities.",
    "If you are fortunate enough to be selected, you would be an utter foool not to take it. This is easily the best class at Yalefor everyone, and especially those interested in global affairs or politics or any kind. You will learn to think strategically in a government and geopolitical setting. Invaluable. Must take.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If you are taking GS II, you have already enrolled in the Grand Strategy Program. I enjoyed this semester more than the fall semester because we learned how to exercise grand strategy in real life. From the briefings to the simulations, we grappled with real-world problems and worked together to tackle them. I came away from this course feeling much more confident about my abilities as a leader and strategic thinker. As everyone knows, there are problems with Grand Strategy too Western, too neoconservative, too white but I have faith that Professor Gage and her team are taking steps to address them. The modules, briefings, and simulations were all excellently run. Enjoy the immense resources that this program offers, and work to amend its flaws.",
    "1. GS hype is overrated in my opinion. 2. You will probably take the class anyway. Gage will hopefully take the class in a more interesting direction. Don't take it too seriously, have fun w\/ the course, spend GS money on something interesting over summer and go to the dinners -- they were the best part!",
    "I absolutely would (and have!) recommended this course to a variety of students."
