   "comments": [
    "I would. If you are interested in NEMS\/MEMS and you want to get a firm background on the subject but not kill yourself with crazy amounts of work, this is a good class. The workload is manageable and just about right.",
    "A great course to get an overview of different nanomaterials synthesis and characterization topics. A reasonable amount of coursework is involved in the class. This course is especially useful for students interested in nanoscale electronics.",
    "This course is an overview of the field of nanomaterials. The course starts with an intro to various common nanomaterials, then follows this with a discussion of common characterization techniques to analyze nanomaterials. The course concludes by discussing current applications of nanomaterials.I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in nano fields. It's very informative of the current state of the field and isn't too stressful. Overall a great experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is just getting introduced to nanotechnology. But, I would not recommend this course to students (especially graduate students) who already have taken some course like this before, especially in analytical instruments (unless they have done it long back, in which case it will be a very good course to refresh the concepts).",
    "Sure, I'll recommend this course to other students, because it's a good introduction course to nano field.",
    "ENAS 703 is a lecture-based course, discusses mainly on nanomaterials and its applications. It also covered essential material characterization techniques. I would recommend this course to engineering students, especially if he\/she is under material science discipline (or any other related field).",
    "Solid overview of nanoscale characterization techniques with a professor who keeps things interesting. If it's relevant to your research interests and you have an open slot, consider taking it."

   "comments": [
    "The course was helpful in getting a better understanding in synthesis of carbon-based nanomaterials. The discussion of SEM, TEM, and AFM was also helpful to my research. Overall, I think the most useful aspect of the course for my research is better knowledge on what topics are \"hot\" in the materials science world and what tools do I have available to conduct research with.",
    "This course didn't really apply to my research, though it's given me a better sense of the field of nanomaterials, which I'm interested in, regardless of my chosen dissertation research topic.",
    "This course mainly provides me knowledge on the theories of characterization techniques, which help me to better use the coresponding equipments.",
    "The course provided a good knowledge on material characterization. It is directly helpful for my research. (Material Science - based research)."
