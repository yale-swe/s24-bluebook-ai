   "comments": [
    "Faulkner is Faulkner, and he is not changing, so if you find his major novels to be frustrating reads, then you probably shouldn't take the class. I think Faulkner is amazing, and I enjoyed doing the reading and writing my essay. Professor Smith has constructed a wonderful syllabus, he responds well to student comments in class, and he is great at providing feedback on essays-in-progress. My only wish is that Professor Smith didn't ask so many questions that had to do with the plot in class. He often asked very interesting questions, but too often I found myself frustrated that his questions had to do with the plot or some less interesting aspect of the novel. This particular seminar experience was interesting for me because I loved my seminar mates, but I never thought discussion went deep enough. I always left classing wishing that we had talked about more. Of course, the issue with all Yale seminars is that there is not enough in class time to discuss the assigned reading adequately, especially if you are reading Faulkner. Keeping this in mind, I think it was inevitable that I would leave seminar desiring more. Even still, I always had fun. Always. Professor Smith knows his material very well, and he has obviously put a lot of thought and hard work into making this class into the best class it can be. From what I know of Professor Smith, his courses are the kinds of classes that will get better every time he teaches them. Whoever gets to take this class next, I envy you.",
    "You read a lot of Faulkner. Then you read some other contemporary writers. Then you read some criticism. Then you write a big paper (which includes a proposal and a presentation in class). Pretty straightforward.",
    "Only take this if you know what you're getting yourself into. Read the first chapter of Absalom, Absalom and multiply by a million. Ridiculous amounts of intense and unpleasant reading. Take something more fun than a course focusing on Faulkner's obsession with incest and interracial sex.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if you like Faulkner's prose. Class discussion could have been more interesting though. It was geared more towards the social and racial aspects of Faulkner's novels than towards his literary techniques.",
    "English 437 is a fascinating introduction to the major works of Faulkner. The system of presenting secondary literature is not ideal. It's a solid senior seminar.",
    "An enlightening and rigorous intertextual approach to a complicated author. The accompanying texts -- Freud, W.E.B. Du Bois, Cash, etc. -- provided a variety of critical approaches to a canon that is rich in psychoanalytic and historic detail. Professor Smith is absolutely wonderful: engaging, challenging, and absolutely in love with what he does. Take it. You'll learn a lot, and learn to love the material besides.",
    "Take this class if you want exposure to more Faulkner than you have read thus far or as an introduction to his works. However, if you are already an experienced Faulkner reader, be prepared for very surface discussions of the novels, from which you will gain little more than you probably did reading on your own. Part of this is the structure of the class, in which fifteen minutes of each class are eaten up by a student's presentation on a particular critical work on Faulkner. These can often be helpful and informative, but are leave far less time for fruitful discussion.",
    "Good class. Faulkner is interesting; Caleb Smith is a good professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to a serious English student with the understanding that reading this much Faulkner can get to be quite exhausting - so balance your schedule well! Professor Smith put together a syllabus that mixed Faulkner with other writers relevant to his works. This helped stave off the inevitable exhaustion that reading nothing but Faulkner started to elicit a few months in. My one complaint was the relative lack of guidance with the final paper; if you've never taken a seminar with a final product of this scale, it can help to have a more involved draft\/workshop process.",
    "The focus is on getting really far into some of the major novels, rather than on making a complete survey of Faulkner's work. The paper writing process is more stretched out over the course of the semester than in other senior seminars (as judged through conversation with fellow majors), which, even if it doesn't result in a better paper, at least forces more engagement with one's ideas. There were very infrequent reading quizzes, which was mostly humorous. Professor Smith was wonderful. From navigating the overwhelming demand for his course, to having sufficient and flexible office hours--even his responses to emails are faster than average for English professors, even though he's also the ADUS--Professor Smith made it clear that no one was going to get any less out of his course for a lack of attention on his part.",
    "Take this class! Whether you love Faulkner or think you might hate him, you'll either change your mind or gather ammo for your side. Either way there are worse ways to spend a semester."
