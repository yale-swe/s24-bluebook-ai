    "I would summerize the class as an excellent introduction to economic anthropology. I would recommend the class to anyone who has not previously taken an economic anthro class",
    "I would recommend the course because of the opportunity it gives the students to do their own work in the field. The term paper was quite interesting and beneficial. The readings, however, didn't clearly fit together for me and I lost the forest for the trees, as it were, because there wasn't much time spent talking about how these readings fit into bigger questions that define each week.",
    "Is a great opportunity to review general issues about economic anthropology. At the same time, is good for economists, marketing students, forestry, etc,"

    "This course has helped my understanding of the field of archaeology and my disserertation research by helping me recognize others cultural forcing agents",
    "It gave me general backgroud for the study of anthropology in general. It provided me an overview of the matter and at the same time, I had the opportunity to learn the perspective of students from different departments about anthropological issues."
