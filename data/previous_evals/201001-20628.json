    "I would recommend it because it's very interesting material.",
    "Yes I would. To me, it was the integration of biology and computer science that was very well done.",
    "I would summarize the course as the union of signal processing, neuroscience, and computer vision. I would recommend the course.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in how biological systems overcome the visual problem. Great in general for the proper balance of biology\/engineering.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Taking a course with Zucker is a great experience that I would recommend to anyone.",
    "Very accessible and very knowledgable of the field -- capable of taking sophisticated material and presenting it in a way that is more comfortable (both in terms of the pace and the method used for teaching).",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. To summarize it: It is a course on understanding biological vision using mathematics. In other words, it is computational vision from a \"rogue\" perspective.",
    "I would recommend it but not for someone wanting to do strictly computer vision. The class is better for biological vision that for learning about computer vision algorithms and methods."

    "It was very good for personal curiosity.",
    "I am already applying the biological vision aspects of the course to my research (shape from shading, optical flow, etc.)",
    "This course was not related to my research, but it was a very educational course that helped me broaden myself as a computer scientist.",
    "While my original perception was that this course would discuss more of an engineering overview of computer vision, the class material was nevertheless presented in a way that made it fairly intuitive to understand the more theory-based content in the aforementioned context.",
    "It is great to broaden my knowledge of vision systems and methods used throughout biology. It also helped to know about how assemblies of simple neural elements can create extremely complicated non-linear responses to stimulus."
