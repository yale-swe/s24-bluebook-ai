    "if you're at all interested in either poetry, language, translation, or mediation\/adaptation studies in general, seriously consider this class. and, it's fun.",
    "This is easily the best Lit class I've taken and maybe the best class I've taken at Yale.All the assignments (--> projects) were a lot of fun to do (nice creative change of pace from other classes), all the readings\/discussions were really interesting and engaging, the professor (Prof. Jacobs) was AWESOME (really nice, intelligent, great sense of humor, personable, genuinely passionate about the material), and the workload was totally manageable (although all the assignments were really cool; no traditional boring critical essays!).WORKLOAD:-maybe a small project every other week or so (example project: translate a \"fragmented\" poem from\/into your language of choice), which everybody shares\/discusses with the class-read a couple essays and a sample of one poet's\/translator's work each weekIf Professor Jacobs is teaching it, TAKE IT. And if there are only a few people taking\/shopping it, all the better--it's really cool getting to hear people's opinions and see their projects in a smaller group discussion (in other classes, it usually sucks to have fewer people, but it's great in this class). The work is almost always fun and totally manageable, and again, Prof. Jacobs is fantastic!",
    "TAKE. IT. Poetry and Translation was by far my favorite class this semester. I usually don't like literary theory, but when limited to just poetry translation I found it to be very stimulating. I was always excited to go to class and I always left it feeling really good. That's how good this class was. Professor Jacobs, by the way, is fantastic. She is a wonderful teacher, an accomplished translator, and was unusually receptive to and encouraging of her students. Also, the assignments (small translations and explanations of them) were so fun to do!!!",
    "I cannot even begin to say how much I enjoyed Poetry and Translation. It is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Class discussion was actually about learning from the professor and from my classmates as opposed to proving we had done the reading or trying to impress anyone. The syllabus was one of the most well-crafted syllabi I have had the pleasure of following; not only was every reading interesting and worthwhile, but each week's reading built on the other in a way that made you think that you couldn't have done the later readings without the first. The inclusion of a practical component, in which we actually engaged in exercises of translation, brought the reading to light in a meaningful way. Professor Jacobs is fantastic. I genuinely looked forward to every single week, and never looked at my watch, which in a two hour seminar is virtually unheard of. Take this class.",
    "Fascinating, mind-expanding readings and poetry. Deep questions about literature and translation that challenge pretty deep biases about how writing occurs, the role of the author in a text, what it means to be \"creative,\" how style develops through contact with the foreign. A smart, young, and engaging professor who makes class a lot of fun. Assignments that are genuinely fun, creative, and reward thinking as opposed to a lot of work. How can I put this simply: absolutely take this class. ESPECIALLY if you've never thought about translation, why it's important, and the work it does."
