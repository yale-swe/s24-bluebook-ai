    "This is an amazing class! Dufresne is the best, and you must take her class, even if you aren't too keen on going to law school at the end of the day. You learn so much from everyone and you get a good feel for what it takes to think in a particular way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you're hoping to go to law school at some point or work with immigrants \/ refugees \/ vulnerable populations in general.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Be prepared to do a lot of work but it is 100% worth it.",
    "I would definitely, absolutely, without a doubt recommend this class to literally anybody with any interest in the law or in refugees. Prof. Dufresne is truly amazing and you'll get so, so much out of this. Definitely make the time to get to know her if you can get into this class. Note, however, that the workload is really really severe. You have approximately 100 pages of reading per week, and I averaged ~15 pages per hour. That means about 7 hours on the reading, at least. On top of that, you have either group discussion homework which Prof. Dufresne tells you to spend 2 hours on, or you have written work that takes anywhere from 2 to 5 hours. On top of that, you have to prepare for in-class oral arguments on the cases you read, and that takes about 3-4 hours most weeks. So I'd say you can expect an average of 10 hours per week or more to be spent on this class per week, outside of class. Point of the story: It will feel like literally all you do is work on this class. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU HAVE TIME TO DO IT. It's probably no surprise that a class with fancy buzzwords like \"law\" and \"policy\" in the title draws a ton of a very specific kind of person -- section bleep-holes. Some people approach this class as though they have literally nothing else to do and totally devote all of their time to it. Their enthusiasm is nice, but it isn't realistic and most students can't swing that kind of commitment (or at least have the social acuity to know how to present their enthusiasm in a way that isn't ridiculous or alienating). Prof. Dufresne will email out a few model answers for the homeworks each week and I think most students in the class found the answers to be a little bit absurd (i.e. 15 pages of writing when you turned in 7 pages, etc.). The key is not to be intimidated: Prof. Dufresne certainly appreciates when students go the extra mile (or the extra 75 miles) in really doing an amazing spectacular incredible job but she doesn't really expect that of everybody. Just do what's asked of you, do the reading, and think critically about what you're learning. She'll reward you for it, even if you have other commitments in your life that preclude you from spending your every waking moment on this class. (One other note on the written homeworks: Literally just write every single thought that comes to mind and don't worry about phrasing it nicely.) But honestly, the group of people really does add a lot and the class experience is just phenomenal. You really learn to think critically about the law and you also learn a bit about what it's like to actually practice law rather than study it in a super academic intellectual divorced-from-reality way. I realize this is really scattered but seriously bottom line just take this class it's amazing and you definitely won't regret it. (Also, take any of her classes! they're awesome.)",
    "I would recommend this class to any student broadly interested in law, human rights, or just looking to think critically.",
    "The course is great! The materials are engaging. Class discussions are great. The professor gives super interesting assignments. And it actually teaches you a skill!",
    "Refugee Law and Policy is a great class! It's a lot of work but very fulfilling and it teaches you how to think in a new way. If you are interested in refugee issues already this will add to your knowledge enormously, and even if you are not interested in refugees, it's a great chance to learn about legal argumentation and see whether you are interested in the law.",
    "Please take it if you want to learn more about refugee law and if you want some preview of what immigration\/asylum lawyers do! Don't worry if you're not PoliSci or EPE majors. You still have a chance. If you can't get in, try again next time. However, if you can't care for the subject matter, please don't take it. There are a lot of nitty-gritty legal details, and if you check out in class, the quality of class discussion is inevitably compromised and everyone's learning suffers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "A truly wonderful course. Even if the subject is not directly relevant to your interests, you will learn a TON and almost never get bored. Out of some forty professors who have taught me at Yale, Alexandra Dufresne is easily in the top three. She pours so much of herself into her courses and keeps trying different methods to make sure that you really \"get\" refugee law by the end of the semester: both in terms of the mechanics of how it works and\u2014more importantly\u2014in terms of why the system is the way it is and how its problems might be solved. The questions she poses in class and in homework assignments are brilliant and will probably require you to think in unfamiliar ways. The workload is sometimes daunting. On weeks when there was written homework, I spent about 5 hours on the homework, 3 hours on the reading, and another 3 or 4 hours preparing for oral argument. But not all weeks have written homework, which makes life easier. Overall this was one of the most enjoyable and educational courses I've ever taken. However, consider Dufresne's other courses too (immigration law and child law) and try to get into the one that fits you best.",
    "balanced focus on nitty gritty legal details and big picture philosophical and sociological questions about the refugee law system. Learn how to build an argument with statutory analysis as well as to write a legal brief. Learn from a professor with EXPERIENCE rather than just knowledge.",
    "Excellent course! \"Refugee Law & Policy\" with Dufresne is an all-undergrad class, but it's taught like a law school class - you use a law school casebook and have oral debates in class. That structure itself was really wonderful, since we were able to use the law as a lens onto the really emotionally heart-wrenching stories of refugees and the really complicated international relations and politics behind how the asylum process functions, while figuring out a fascinating legal framework and how to navigate it. It is a lot of work. I think Dufresne said on the first day that we should expect to spend about 12 hours per week on the course - though I found it to be less than that. You're reading cases and the casebook really closely and prepping oral arguments because she announces in class who will be arguing, so you need to be prepared every week. But everybody taking the class really does put in the effort, and you learn a lot. Dufresne's goal is to have every student who takes the course hire-able to work on refugee law with one of her old colleagues. So, very much worth it - the class is hard to get in to unless you're pre-registered through EP&E or PLSC, but keep coming back to try. Dufresne is a brilliant, saintly, massive achiever of a woman who will inspire you.",
    "All of the other reviews are spot on: Refugee Law and Policy is an unbelievable course, and everyone -- regardless of academic interest -- should try to take it. It's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take this course! While it can be a lot of work it is completely worth it and the work is different than anything else you'll do at Yale. However, only take the course if you are willing to dedicate time to it. She calls on people randomly for oral arguments so you really have to be prepared for class everyday.",
    "Refugee Law and Policy is probably hands-down the best class I've taken at Yale. The reading for the class is mostly a law-school case book, that maps the universe of U.S. refugee law and policy. There's three things in particular that stand out about the class - a)For most of the seminar, the class is run like a hybrid version of a law school class. The expectation is that every single person has done the reading, and you'll be asked to prepare oral arguments as if you were representing one of the sides in many of the cases we read. b) Prof. Dufresne is fantastic because she intersperses the oral arguments aspect very well with taking a step away and looking at refugee law and policy from the larger picture i.e. someone from outside the system, not within it. She's also excellent at not letting her own perceptions influence discussion - she's more than open to new ideas and new readings or approaches to the law. c) You really have wonderful discussion because everyone is so engaged and willing to contribute. Its a really great seminar environment for that reason. This class is a lot of work - I'd say close to 6-8 hours of prepared work a week : but it is absolutely worth it ! If you have a chance to take this class, I would 100% take it.",
    "This class was even more intensive than I\u2019d anticipated\u2014in addition to over one hundred pages of case law every week, we had to either discuss questions outside of class in small groups or complete lengthy homework assignments. We also had to prepare oral arguments for several cases before each class, since anyone could be called on. While I enjoyed reading the refugee cases\u2014some of them were horrifying and heart-wrenching\u2014the heavy workload sometimes made me regret that I had taken the class. But Professor Dufresne was an incredibly dedicated professor who cared deeply about her students, and I learned so much in her class. I can\u2019t say I enjoyed every minute of Refugee Law, but I\u2019m grateful that it pushed me to think in ways I had never before at Yale."
