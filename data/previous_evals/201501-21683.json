    "It is typical research for credit. Currently the class is Pass\/fail unless you are a senior. There is hardly any work for the actual \"class\" (short proposal, midterm update, and final presentation\/paper). You are expected to work at least 10 hours a week in your lab.",
    "Chill senior project - your research experience is going to depend mostly on your PI and lab of course, but Professor Duncan is (thankfully!) not too demanding in terms of requirements relative to other science majors. Outline of your research proposal at the beginning of the semester, a quick update to him at the midterm, and a 12 minute talk + 10-15 page paper at the end of the semester. As a note, at least for this year, both BENG 471 and 472 count as letter grades for seniors, as long as we let Professor Duncan know that our senior project would be for the whole year.",
    "Senior requirement for BME, so it just really depends on your own lab.",
    "BENG 472 is a pretty chill senior requirement. It involves a semester (or more if you want) of research, a 10-15 page write up of your work, and a 12 minute presentation that is pretty laid back. Relatively speaking, its fairly easy as far as senior projects go.",
    "Typical senior project class.",
    "Of course take it and do lab work on time, haha!",
    "A standard research-for-credit course, with a proposal, midterm report, final paper, and for seniors a final presentation.",
    "You really wouldn't be taking this class unless you were a BME major. And honestly, this is your chance to get some hands on experience making something that you would have never though possible. Find someone amazing to work under. Be amazed.",
    "It's a great chance to get to use the skills you learned in biomedical engineering to do real-world research.",
    "This class is just research for credit, so you get out what you put in. Honestly, I wouldn't do it though because it's pass\/fail so it can't help your GPA and it takes away from possibly taking a really cool Yale class. You can always do research on the side.",
    "You really don't have much of a choice about taking this, it's very much what you expect - it's thesis work. If you enjoy your thesis work and have a good adviser it'll be great, if you don't it's not going to be much fun. This is what you make of it."
