    "This is a very intense course that moves very quickly through difficult subject matter. You learn a lot, but a lot of random vocabulary. I would recommend it only to someone intending to take at least six semesters of the language (because you also have to learn a dialect) and that is invested in learning and using arabic in the future. It's too much work for just a language credit.",
    "Take it if you really want to learn Arabic and are willing to put in the time and effort. Especially in the first month, there will be a lot of work and you will probably regret taking it - but I promise it gets so much better after that!",
    "I would recommend the class if people are willing to put in the effort to keep up with vocabulary and grammar.",
    "I had heard horror stories about the Arabic department, but was pleasantly suprised with this course. It's well organized, not an overwhelming amount of work, and fairly tested. Sarab is a phenomenal teacher.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think this class was a great introduction to Arabic. Be prepared to put a lot of time into preparing for class every day. It's very fast paced at the beginning but it eventually slows down to a more manageable amount of homework. I would definitely recommend taking the class with Sarab Al Ani. I wish the class had put more emphasis on conversational skills, but other than that it was a good course.",
    "Arabic 110 is a nice introduction to Arabic language *for students who are serious about learning the language*. Sometimes it can be frustrating seeing how (seemingly) little progress you've made with the language. At times I compare learning Arabic to learning 3 languages at once because you have to tackle the script, Modern Standard, and then any applicable dialect.If you don't plan on using Arabic for the rest of your life, taking 3 semesters of Arabic just to meet a language requirement is a bad decision. You won't even make a dent in the language after one semester and you have to really enjoy learning it or else the homework\/class 5 days a week won't be worth it for you. THIS IS NOT A GUT.That being said, if you are interested in learning Arabic, starting with 110 is the best (and only) way to do it! The professors are knowledgeable and I think do a great job of teaching a really difficult language. Any issues or frustrations I've had from the course came from fundamental issues with learning Arabic as a third language, not from the course itself.",
