    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student but only if you are willing to put in a lot of time in the dark room and take advantage of asking questions\/asking for help. It's there if you work for it but you have to be committed.",
    "The class has four main components - shooting, developing\/printing, lectures, and critiques.The shooting is tons of fun, especially as you feel yourself getting a sense for how things are going to look when photographed. It's very satisfying to make a picture that you know is going to turn out well.The developing\/printing process is pretty meditative, actually, and once you get the hang of it it's nice to be able to budget a certain amount of time for getting stuff done and then just doing it.The lectures were pretty interesting, and it's cool to be able to see what some of photography's greats have done, and how that compares to the kind of work you're doing in the course.The critiques, on the other hand, are pretty long and arduous, though not too much unlike other ones I've had in other art courses. Be prepared to be either attentive and interested or pretty bored.I'd recommend the course wholeheartedly - it made me look at the world in a whole new light, and was a really different type of class that helped balance the other tasks at hand in my semester.",
    "yes!",
    "Good class, lots of time, take it Credit\/D if you're just dabbling.",
    "I highly recommend this to art students; it will really help you figure out what you're visually interested in. For non-art majors, this might seem like a lot of work for not a lot of payoff... But if you're interested in photography, or think you might want to learn how to really use a camera and take interesting pictures.",
    "The class is definitely a lot of work, but it's worth it. You're only going to improve as a photographer if you keep shooting and keep practicing your dark room skills. If Lisa is teaching it, take it.",
    "DEFINITELY take this class. try to take it during a semester where you're taking four classes because the darkroom takes up a lot of time, and because it's not always easy to predict HOW much time it will take (maybe you'll get the printing of a picture correct on the ifrst try, maybe it will take an hour and a half to get right... you never really know, so having a really packed schedule would be tough with this class). but it's totally manageable esp if you don't leave it all to the last minute.",
    "A lot of work. Carry a camera around and feel hipster. Take photos, make art, feel zen in the darkroom. It's great.",
    "Recommended, but only if you're taking at most 4.5 credits in a semester, and you're willing to commit a lot of time and money.",
    "Maybe a better class for art majors who want to seriously get an introduction to the field. As for those who want to dabble, you will probably regret not dropping the class towards the end when you have to spend hours in the darkroom getting the prints just right (even if you take it cr\/d\/f its still embarrassing if you don't do all the work, and if you do do all the work, its a lot of investment for a credit) So only take if you want to really learn about printing!"
