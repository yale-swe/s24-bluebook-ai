   "comments": [
    "High level french class. Review of grammar, but goes in-depth on grammatical nuances. Writing essays in french. Building confidence in fluently speaking the french language. Building french listening skills through watching films. Learning french culture.",
    "This class is great for students who are thinking of improving their essay-writing skills, and for students who still need a little more grammar help. (All of the examinations are grammar heavy so they require a lot of grammar practice).",
    "Take it! The books you read and films you watch are spectacular, and your French will improve considerably. The workload is manageable and you spend a lot of class time just discussing interesting topics. This was my favorite class I took all year.",
    "Feels like you know french better with all the talking, movies, etc. However, be prepared to invest a significantly greater amount of time into homework and assignments.",
    "It is a wonderful class that really focuses on developing oral as well as written skills. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Better than the 130 or 140, and it doesn't feel like as much work because you don't have class every day. Still it's a decent workload. I really felt like I improved my French in this class, it was a very positive experience. Mme Hoffmann was great.",
    "i would recommend it. all the writing really made me much more comfortable by the end of the semester. and i felt that i could better understand the movies and books we watched\/read."
