   "comments": [
    "Take this class with Professor Epstein in the spring!! She's phenomenal, and you will love her. You'll also be exposed to several different types and styles of medical writing, from casual to formal, all of which will probably come in useful somehow in the future.",
    "Weak course. Disorganized and unable to provide enough depth in any one area of writing or medicine to be enjoyable. Reminded me of a high school class, busy work and all.",
    "I ABSOLUTELY 100% RECOMMEND THIS COURSE TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE (even if you are not a pre-health student). It is phenomenal and Professor Epstein is one of those one-of-a-kind professors that you won't get anywhere else. She often baked for us and took us on class field trips to a pathology lab (first field trip) and the brains storage basement (second field trip) at the medical school. She makes everything fun and every reading worth while. You have to put a lot into this class, but you will get a lot out. And just about everything you do is fun. Professor Epstein is amazing. She is always available if you need help with your writing and offers great advice for improvement. Several times I had phone office hours with her on weekends. Anytime I had questions or needed to stay after class to ask about my writing, she was always available. If you're looking for a good English class, this one is the way to go.",
    "One of my favorite courses I've taken so far! It was one of those courses where the time flies by. The mini field trips we took were very eye-opening and helpful. The types of pieces we wrote were varied and taught us how to approach different styles and audiences. Professor Epstein is one of the best professors I've had. Very enthusiastic, straightforward, and caring. She can be a little disorganized, but she still returns papers promptly with detailed comments and suggestions. She makes time for her students, puts us in touch with people to interview and lends us books to help us with our style and papers. If you're planning on taking Writing in Medicine and Public Health, I would definitely suggest taking it with Professor Epstein. I can't remember the exact number of pieces we had to write, but I never found the class to be tedious. It was definitely worthwhile.",
    "Professor Epstein is a really cool person and she has a lot of great insight and knows a ton about her field and has a bunch of great connections. That said, I don't think her expectations were always clear and her grading seemed somewhat arbitrary. Don't know if I would wholeheartedly recommend taking it.",
    "This is a great class. Epstein cares about you so much and will always make time to talk on the phone with you about your writing",
    "Take if you get in! One of my favorite courses at Yale. Our class had several guest speakers and field trips to a pathology lab, the YCBA, and medical school basement to look and write about brains.",
    "If you are interested in medicine or public or writing in general DEFINITELY take this class. If you are expecting an easy A well I would suggest you take a non English department class. Professor Epstein is a fair but harsh grader. But it is the English derpartment's rule that no more than 50%(?) of a class can get A's and A-'s. But the class has been rewarding, as a premed and engineering student I loved the focus on details and how the beauty of details make a story more enjoyable to read.",
    "Absolutely take this class!! Especially if Randi Epstein is teaching it! SHe is phenomenal and will make you love medical writing (who knew). It was lots of fun, work load was very reasonable, and you can watch your writing improve throughout the semester.",
    "Writing about Medicine and Public Health is probably one of my favorite classes at Yale. I have taken writing classes at Yale before, but this one was special. Since I am a pre-med, all of the readings\/assignments were interesting because they relevant to science\/medicine\/public health. I was always very excited to do the assignments, and they really improved my ability to write. Assignment grading is a bit arbitrary, but Professor Epstein is accommodating if you show her that you want to learn - and you will learn a lot from her and the class if you maintain an open mind.",
    "This class is a great look at medical and science writing and ways to improve communication between scientific writers and lay audiences. I would definitely recommend it to any future medical\/ science student because it is very applicable to these fields.",
    "I think that any premed should take this class. It really opens your world and helps you see medicine in an entirely new light."
