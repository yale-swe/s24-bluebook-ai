    "If this class is offered again, you should definitely take it.",
    "One of the best syllabi you'll ever encounter, as long as you do the reading. I came out knowing--and appreciating--19th and 18th century literature and philosophy far more than I ever thought possible. That Tristram Shandy is a masterpiece helps too. This is a really important course.",
    "I would recommend Around Tristram Shandy to another student. However, since the class focuses primarily on one novel, it is important to make sure that you are interested in it. Nonlinear narratives aren't for everyone. It was a funny and enjoyable class.",
    "Yes! Excellent novel and incorporation of other texts that impacted it ( and a film that impacted it!) Plus the professor offers a sensitive and nuanced look at the novel and does an excellent job of engaging students in discussion."
