   "comments": [
    "Yes! I loved this class! Although there are many readings, you do not have to do read them all in full detail in order to benefit fully from the class. If you are looking to dive deeper into understanding the natural dynamics of the human being then this would be a great class for you. You broach a wide range of interesting topics that all make you reflect on yourself as well as humanity in general.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is always fun and interesting even if the reading may seem long at points it is worth it. Professor Campbell is a great teacher and always trying to engage with her students.",
    "I would recommend this to any freshman. This was my favorite class of the entire semester.",
    "A lot of the movies\/readings were very interesting and you do learn a lot about communication. The discussions during class were not always deep though because we tried to cover too many readings each class, and Professor Campbell talked about assignments for a large part of each class though. Overall an interesting and worthwhile course though.",
    "YES PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Absolutely! As a freshman seminar, it was a wonderful introduction to discussion-based courses at Yale. Again, it is also fun to take a class that is applicable to every-day life and makes you reconsider your habits...",
    "If you're looking to just work on your writing, the more traditional English seminars ( like 120 ) might be more helpful.If you're looking for interesting discussions about the impact of technology on society and the way people interact, then this is the class for you. It's really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to any freshman. It is a good introduction to writing and discussion at Yale. It was a great bridge between Highschool and College work.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone. This was the best class I've taken this semester and I also see it becoming one of the best during my entire four years at Yale.",
    "English 013 01 explores different means of communications and their significance. I would recommend this course to another students because it was interesting, relevant, and I learned new things.",
    "This class is a survey of the various ways people communicate and the different media available now and in the past that people used to relate to each other, with a focus on comparing older forms of communication with social media and other digital communication tools."
