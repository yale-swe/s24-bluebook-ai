    "I feel that the tests were not reflective of the material we covered in class in terms of their level of difficulty. The listening segment of the test, which was often taken from videos where people were speaking totally proficient German, did not take into account that we usually only practiced listening once before each test. I would say the same for the reading parts of the test, which became increasingly difficult\/long despite the fact that the time we had to complete each test remained the same. This is not to say that I think my instructor, Susan Morrow, did not do good job(although I do feel that she was at times unnecessarily harsh in her grading), as I feel that she is a great instructor, but rather that the tests themselves are not designed to allow a fair grading distribution. In two of the tests we've had, the highest has been around 44\/50, which is a B+, and in the other two the highest has been an A-. However in no test, at least in my class, did someone achieve an A grade. I understand that L3 is supposed to be considerably harder than L2, however I feel that the jump from L2 to L3 was too large and the course did not reasonably accommodate this. The tests were not the best assessments of the material we learnt and consequently didn't doing the most effective job of reinforcing that material. Additionally, if we were to receive tests like the ones were were given, I feel that the time that we had to complete the tests should have been increased from 50 minutes to maybe a full hour. Often people were scrambling to finish and very few turned their tests in before time had fully elapsed.",
    "Although GMAN 130 with Susan Morrow was the best German class I've ever taken, there was still room for improvement. Several assignments--the weekly emails, the final video--didn't help me learn more German or feel like a productive use of time. Susan was a wonderful TF, and made the material enjoyable. I also really enjoyed the 2 extracurricular German events that were required.",
    "Listening portions of the tests always overly difficult",
    "The tests are far too difficult and far too long. I said this at midterm evaluations and I was shut down but I need to repeat it. Even my tutor, a fluent German speaker, took one look at the test and said not only that the reading comprehension would almost have been difficult for her, but that she thought the tests were absurdly long. I never once got more than half right on the listening comprehension because you expected us to comprehend people speaking German full speed, native speakers, sometimes whispering, sometimes with odd accents. I understand that you want to test us on everything we learned, but I studied hard for all of those tests and never got a grade higher than an 82%. They need to change."

    "This class is taught by grad students--Susan was fantastic, but I think she's not going to teach it again, so I can't really recommend or discourage you from taking the class. The material is straightforward. The class is fun if you have fun classmates\/teacher. The final video project is annoying but doable.",
    "Yes, German is an enjoyable language. But I don't like how the department makes it almost impossible for anyone to get above an A- in the class. This dissuades students from pursuing the language beyond L3."
