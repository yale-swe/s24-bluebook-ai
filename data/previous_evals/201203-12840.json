   "comments": [
    "This was a comprehensive review of all the Spanish you learned in L1\/2, in addition to some more on the subjunctive. Your comfort with speaking will only increase a little, but it is a solid, work-intensive Spanish class.",
    "It was a great way to work on your Spanish writing and speaking. If interested in taking more Spanish in the future, definitely take this class!",
    "If Barbara Safille is teaching try to get her. She's really nice, absolutely insane and a very very fair grader. I also found L3 much easier than L2.",
    "Put time in but you will be better at Spanish!",
    "You don't cover much more grammar than you did in 120, but you'll read harder texts and will be held to higher expectations.",
    "good deal of work but prof. safille makes class interesting and fun",
    "Spanish 130 is great if you need to take it for the language requirement, not so great if not. Only because I don't think I learned much more than in L2 and the class was big so there wasn't a lot of practicing time. If you can, take L3 over the summer in a spanish speaking country if you really want to improve.",
    "This class is amazing. Professor Safille is absolutely incredible and she has an unusual ability to motivate her students, crack jokes during class, and demonstrate a genuine interest in seeing her students succeed.",
    "Good class. Serious grammar review with cool readings and debates. Great professor - so engaging and caring. Would certainly recommend Spanish 130 03.",
    "Its a grammar course and an intro into speaking and conversational Spanish. I would definitely recommend it if you are serious about expanding your knowledge of the Spanish language.",
    "Yes, great Spanish course. Spanish 130 is really focused on honing your skills.",
    "The coursework in Spanish 130 is interesting. Daily homework does not take too much time. Lectures are captivating and you learn a lot from the material offered. Professor Safille is amazing, engages all of her students, and is a fair grader. Take this course, and take it with Professor Safille if you can.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! It is a bit more work than most other classes, but you will definitely see an improvement in your Spanish-speaking abilities by the end of the semester."
