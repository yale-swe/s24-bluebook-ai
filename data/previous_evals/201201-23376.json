    "1) The readings are unnecessary because there's no room for discussion, nor are they relevant to the midterm. There was no final. They're interesting on their own, but it's hard to evaluate their value since their only benefit is personal.9) Field trips were poorly scheduled (Friday during reading week was hard, though I understand the challenge of coordinating with silvi trips). Also, the professor's desire to re-explain everything our hosts were saying diminished opportunities to learn from them. The professor was also not very sensitive to students' schedules.",
