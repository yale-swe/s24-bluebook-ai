   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. The workload is not overwhelming, and the class is really interesting.",
    "I loved this class. You should probably have some interest in art\/beauty\/history but you don't need to have studied them before. Having never studied art before, I learnt so much in this class. The professor is great and fun.TAKE IT!",
    "If you are at all interested in art history or merely writing about beauty you should definitely take this course. It is a wonderful english class. It is a great introductory writing course where you can learn how to write.",
    "ENGL 114 is a quintessential class at Yale. Professor Jones' section just was not for me. Shop a couple of sections so you get the right professor and topic.",
    "It's a class for practicing your English writing abilities, but it doesn't help you develop them further. I would only recommend this course if the student is very uncertain about his\/her writing abilities. If you have taken IB\/AP English or have decent writing experience, then don't take it.",
    "I would recommend this class if the student already has a strong english background. I would not recommend it to a student is looking to vastly improve their writing.",
    "I would recommend it especially to international students whose native language is not English. While organizing my thoughts for class discussion and learning how to express ideas on paper, I grew more familiar with certain usage of English words and phrases. But this course could be a little overwhelming in terms of workload.",
    "I definitely recommend this class if you have an interest in art. Professor Jones is wonderful and the class gets you thinking about art in different ways. If you enjoy looking at an analyzing art you should take this class! You will also grow as a writer. There are four papers in total. This may not seem like a lot, but the amount of work you put into each paper will probably be more than you ever have (but you will feel very satisfied with the final outcome). Definitely take this class; you will love it!",
    "Overall, English 114: Seeing through Other Eyes with Professor Jones was a great introductory English course. You'll probably enjoy it more if you have some interest in art or history or beauty, but if you have a good set of classmates and make an effort to participate in discussions, it'll be a good experience regardless. You get to take trips to the Met and the Yale Art Gallery to view art exhibits for your essays. Also, Professor Jones is very flexible about the topic of your research paper; you can basically research anything you want. Professor Jones is such a warm, friendly lady; she's always willing to meet with you and help you with your paper. The only warning I have regarding this class is that Professor Jones is a pretty harsh grader, so don't expect to be getting many A's on your essays.",
    "I am delighted that I took this class, despite my limited knowledge in artwork and notions of beauty (as a concept). Although writing on a somewhat abstract field that I was relatively ignorant about was very challenging for me, the class improved my writing a lot. Professor Jones provided very helpful and insightful comments on essays. Class discussions really opened my eyes and helped me better understand the readings, which by themselves were very enjoyable. The professor was excellent and I highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because it opens your eyes to a new topic of study. It allows you to judge whether or not you like art\/history, and also helps you work on your writing skills."
