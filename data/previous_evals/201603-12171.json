    "This is an an excellent course. Professor Joseph invests a great deal of time and energy into the syllabus (he has taught this course for many years), and it really shows. He urged us to view the readings in conversation with each other, and the seminar participants were ready to follow his lead. I highly recommend this course for any student interested in the exciting and rich field of resistance studies. Four stars!",
    "Enhanced critical thinking, analytical, and writing skills.",
    "This course allowed me to engage with subaltern historiography in Latin America. This new dimension to resistance in Latin America has been incredibly illuminating. This is not just important regarding my knowledge about Latin America but also about debates in intellectual history in other regions as well.",
    "The course taught me of the state of the art of Latin American History writing of the twentieth century. It was particularly insightful to see how ethnographies and a more classic approach to History are coming together to generate new cultural histories. The different styles of writing this kind of history and the issues associated that surface (historicity, anthropological morality, subjectivity) were also looked at with detail in the course. The political issues were also debated among the students and led by professor Joseph in a very engaging way."

    "Interactive student engagement and quality analysis and syntheses from the instructor.",
    "Professor Joseph design for the course and his selection of readings is very effective. The texts are all germane and there is a clear development of historiographical debates over time. The instruments are very manageable and can serve as assets for oral fields later.",
    "The strengths of the course were the rich debates that the readings generated among students. The nuance with which the political aspects of the course were reviewed. The bibliography. The way the professor was invested in good debate among students, both with his presentations and the system of Memos so that we would all get to read our pier's opinions."

    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes, excellent instructor and broadening experience.",
    "Yes. This is excellent course for anyone interested in Latin American resistance, subaltern history, history of peasantry, history of revolution as well as interdisciplinary studies.",
    "Yes. I think the bibliography is both contemporary and essential to understand the landscape of historic writing in the US on Latin America. I also think the insight on how to look at the political aspects of Latin American History in the US is unique and necessary at Yale. The professor is open to different opinions and the readings bring on-site information."
