    "Excellent course. You'll get out what you put in. There isn't much busywork assigned, but if you do all the reading, you'll learn a lot (and the course will be a fair amount of work).",
    "Take it! It's a sweeping overview class that will leave you mindblown re: the state of astronomy and fantastic advances Pieter & co have made over the decades. Material is dense most of the times but is always rewarding because Pieter doesn't over-assign homework and is very conscious of what is and isn't worth spending time on. I was an exchange student in this class who had taken zero astro classes before this one and ended up having a grand ball of a time."
