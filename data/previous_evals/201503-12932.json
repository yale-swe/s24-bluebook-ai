    "A good and necessary introduction to CP. A first attempt within the department to see how you handle presenting relatively unfamiliar material for the first time. If CP is one of your exam subfields, it makes sense to take this class.",

    "A graduate-level course that introduces major themes and debates in comparative politics with a focus on research design. Would highly recommend this course to any student interested in developing research skills in comparative politics.",
    "The class provides a helpful overview to the substantive questions asked by the comparative politics subfield. I would recommend the course to another student looking to get familiar with the subfield."
