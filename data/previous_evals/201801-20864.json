    "The discussions were very useful and forced me to engage deeply with the material. However, sometimes it felt that only a few students spoke during discussion. Perhaps it would be best to assign a paper to each student to focus on so that all students speak similar amounts. Moreover, sometimes we would prioritize papers that I found less interesting than others during a given week. Perhaps it would be useful to ask the class at the outset which papers they would like to prioritize (although that sometimes occurred and students simply differed in opinion)."
