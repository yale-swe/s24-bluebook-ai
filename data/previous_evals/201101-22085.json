   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course as a necessary evil; it's a prerequisite to many other classes and a good alternative to Math 120, but still wasn't pleasant or interesting for me in any way",
    "Yes, if you're choosing between math 120 and this, TAKE THIS. Smooke is really great at helping you to understand the material, I can't stress this enough. Overall, the material is pretty hard but if you read the textbook and pay attention in class, you should do well.",
    "I would really recommend this class, especially with Professor Smooke. for the first time ever, math was actually my favorite class",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "it is difficult, but still can be interesting because the application aspect makes it more interesting.",
    "This class has been the most miserable experience of my time at Yale. Professor Smooke is a perfectly jolly fellow, but he is probably the single worst teacher I've ever had. He spends most of his time writing out entire paragraphs directly from the textbook onto the blackboard with his back turned to the class. He is totally uninspiring, he fails utterly to teach anything but the bare minimum--leaving you out in the cold to figure out the details of the concepts that you really need to know--and he has made this the only Math class I have ever disliked.The material is perfectly fine: it's the next logical step in your Math education. ENAS 151 has a reputation of being much better-taught than MATH 120, but this only applies to non-Smooke teachers. I cannot say that MATH 120 will be any better, but know that this class is mind-numbingly boring and painful. (NOTE: I say this before taking the final exam, and while my grade is still in decent shape; these comments reflect my experience with the class, not with its effect on my GPA. However, rumor has it that Smooke curves every class to a B minus.)Sorry: truth sucks sometimes.",
    "ENAS is absolutely an excellent course - the best course I've taken at Yale so far. Prof. Smooke is excellent. He makes the course reasonably challenging and actually interesting. It's also much fairer than the math department courses, since everyone has the same professor, the same lectures, and the same expectations.",
    "It's probably a good class if you don't take it with Smooke.Otherwise, BLAH.",
    "Partial derivatives and how they can manipulated to describe motion, area, and work. 90% of the work is probably trying to teach yourself, if you didn't know already, what the intricacies of the previous sentence really means.",
    "Yes, I recommend it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. It wastaught exactly from the textbook (oftentimes word for word), so you don't really have any class material to refer to if the reading doesn't make sense. Prof. Smooke knows his material but doesnt' always do a good job of conveying it to the class. There also isn't really that much application-based calculus. We learn about how the math could be applied, but it ultimately comes down to plugging into formulas. I wish the course had been more challenging.",
    "TAKE PHYSICS BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS CLASS.People have varied science backgrounds going into this class, and you can end up at the end of the pack if you don't have a background in physics, or at least a good understanding of vectors.",
    "A great alternative to math 120. Smooke is an excellent teacher, who challenge us to do more than just memorize a few formulas. An interesting class due to the real world applications. I definitely recommend.",
    "Yes, definitely! Applying math to practical situations, such as fluid flow or work performed on a particle, is infinitely more interesting than memorizing proofs. The material was interesting, Smooke was very entertaining and funny, and the tests were very easy compared to what I expected. (The average test grades were always in the high 80s). The problem sets are long but manageable and Smooke is flexible with when you turn them in. All and all, much better than Math 120!",
    "Supposedly better than 120, so take it if you have to.",
    "ENAS 151 is far better than MATH 120. Take it!",
    "Tough class",
    "The one big note is the tests. The problems on the test are all word problems where it can be difficult to interpret what the math problem behind them is. It would be helpful to have practice tests that better reflect what the actual exam will be. Or to have more homework problems that reflect the test questions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It gives you a very good grasp for multivariable calculus and is a good introduction to the type of problems that students in engineering fields will see later on.",
    "Very worthwhile course - I thought the material was interesting and presented very clearly and with applications.",
    "This class is really interesting but difficult.",
    "It's a pretty straightforward class and most people who take it have to take it.",
    "Yes. As long as you have to take math 120, this course is more interesting and easier to follow.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class with Professor Smooke. He's a fantastic professor, easily approachable, who's genuinely interested in seeing his students grasp the material. He goes beyond what you might get in other courses to be sure that everyone's understanding, and his teaching style reassures this goal.",
    "I would recommend ENAS 151 because it is easy and important if you are going to do anything math-related. The weekly problem sets are repetitive (in a good way since it helps drill the material) and helpful for the exams.",
    "ENAS 151 is apparently better and easier than MATH 120. The professor and TAs know the material. Contrary to some opinions I've heard, the workload is NOT heavy and the material is easy. But I feel that I have learned little more than the slavish application of certain theorems and formulas. We seldom went beyond the frame set by the examples in the textbook.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to a student looking for a multi-variable class with lots of side discussions on how the concepts are applied. But it should be noted that even though the problem sets are relatively easy, they are pretty long. I think they can definitely be finished in two days...maybe even a day, if the problem sets are only 10 problems long. This semester, the problem sets towards the end of the course got shorter.Test-wise, look forward to applying the concepts behind the formulas rather than trudging through painful, solid numbers. Don't worry, it won't be the same as the plug-and-crunch problems in the long p-sets. If you're the person who can grasp what's going on but is still working on avoiding completely unintentional algebra mistakes, then maybe you'll like this course.",
    "It's definitely a good course if you are an engineering\/science oriented person",
    "Definitely a solid course. Well-taught, useful, and an appropriate level of difficulty (i.e. they don't give you things that are stupidly hard for no reason). If you're thinking about taking this or Math 120, it's not even a decision: TAKE THIS COURSE! The caliber of teaching is miles above anything you will find in the math department. The class won't be brilliant or life-changing, but you'll learn what you need to learn and you won't mind coming to class even at 9am. I even had fun in lecture sometimes. Also, vector calculus can be pretty cool and it's extremely useful in the physical sciences. I definitely recommend this course.",
    "This class is a great alternative to Math 120. The material is not difficult and is presented in an interesting and engaging fashion. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone wishing to take multivariable calculus.",
    "I would recommend it, however, I would tell them that it not in any way an easy class. The midterms and final are very difficult while the homework problem sets are fairly easy.",
    "It's Math 120 but taught by a great professor with more interesting example problems.",
    "I liked it, but if you don't like problem solving you wouldn't.",
    "I felt Engineering 151 was an okay course in multivariable calculus. While the class covered certain material less extensively than the analogous Math 120 course does (such as line\/surface integral theorems), you will learn of methods in which concepts that are taught can be applied to real problems (though you shouldn\u0092t except to be solving any complex fluid mechanics problems). While this appeals to some, I found that I didn\u0092t have as deep a conceptual understanding of the course material as some of my friends who took Math 120 did. This may be okay to some students, the way in which multivariable calculus was presented left a little to be desired. Professor Smooke is a thorough and engaging lecturer. However, he often goes on somewhat lengthy digressions during each class meeting so that it seems that the later lectures are more rushed and the material is covered much less thoroughly. He does have many interesting and funny stories to share, though, and I would recommend that you visit his office hours if you have any questions or to simply get to know him.Overall, I would recommend this class only if you are interested in learning basic multivariable calculus techniques and do not care so much for developing a strong conceptual understanding of the subject.",
    "The final step of calculus: differentiation, integration and applications in more than one dimension. the class deals with the mathematics of multi, but presents the material in a very practical way.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT AFTER A THREE-SEMESTER BREAK FROM CALCULUS LIKE I DID. Bad idea. Have calc very fresh in your mind and you'll be fine.",
    "Great way to learn multivariable calculus, especially if you're interested in real world applications. I would recommend the course merely because it is is well taught.",
    "I really liked this course! This is the best way to learn multi variable calculus! Prof. Smooke makes it all so clear and he keeps class entertaining with random facts and demonstrations!",
    "I definitely recommend ENAS 151 over MATH 120 to all engineering majors, especially with Professor Smooke. The book is really easy to understand and Professor Smooke uses real life examples and tells you how the calculus relates to physics concepts in other engineering courses. Protip: Take the book with you to class and follow along with the examples so you don't have to scramble to copy them before they're erased from the board. You will understand them much better as the professor goes through them if you can just jot down the important things the professor says than if you had to focus on writing everything down.",
    "This is a great class for those with a mind for engineering and really like applied math problems. However, keep in mind that this is a large lecture math class- that can be pretty weird for a math class. Although Professor Smooke was great about answering questions in lecture, it might not be a good class for you if you don't like speaking up in lecture. The class moves quickly, so be prepared for that!",
    "Yes. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot, and it was very interesting. Professor Smooke is a great teacher, and very interesting. Definitely take this class if you have to take multivariable.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is challenging yet always worthwhile, and Professor Smooke consistently provides real-world applications which give students reason to learn. In short, the class is engaging.",
    "ENAS 151 is Math 120 but with a more established professor and an engineering focus (as in the examples are linked to the applications in the sciences). Overall, I'm very happy I took this version if only because more resources are available for help -- there are great TAs who hold two or three study sessions each week. Professor Smooke is great, but rushed through the second half of the semester. The problem sets are generally harder than the tests, which are fair. If you are in the sciences and want a better experience for multivariable than the risky math department, go for ENAS 151.",
    "I would recommend this class for another student over Math120 if the student was interested in Engineering at all or if they had a physics background. I appreciated that it was taught by a professor rather than a TA and the material, though almost the exact same as the material in Math120, was presented in a much more interesting way than I hear it is in Math120. The tests are also very difficult, but more enjoyable than those that I have seen in 120.",
    "Choose this class over Math 120 if you are less proof-inclined and more interested in the practical side of equations and formulas.",
    "Yes, if you need to take multivariable calculus. But it didn't help me understand if I like engineering or not, which was the main reason why I took the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I enjoyed this class! Professor Smooke is a cool dude. The only weakness is that it is so early in the morning.. towards the end of the semester I struggled to arrive on time to class. But the class material is straightforward if you put your mind to it and while the three tests can be tricky, they are definitely doable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone planning on majoring in engineering or applied sciences. There is a large focus on physical applications of multivariable calculus, which makes the class seem more practical than the equivalent math 120 class. However, for someone with little or no physics or multivariable experience, this class can be pretty difficult.",
    "I highly recommend this class, especially as an alternative to MATH120. Professor Smooke was excellent. The class moves pretty fast, but it is reasonable. It is better than MATH120 because it involves real-world problems that make the class more interesting and seem more relevant. Tests can be challenging and frustrating, but that's to be expected in a math class like this. Finally, at the beginning of the course Professor Smooke took time to explain the very basics of vectors. which is great for those who have limited physics backgrounds (this was not the case in the first week of MATH120).",
    "I would highly recommend ENAS151 in the place of MATH120. The class is in the engineering& applied science department which may or may not be more intense than the math department, but the real-world applications used to teach ENAS151 makes it a much easier course. The tests are pretty closely related to the problem sets so if you could do those, you're golden on the midterms (except for that one \"trick\" question he adds).",
    "Multivariable calculus with an emphasis on engineering applications. I would recommend it for anyone who prefers concrete problems to abstractions.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENAS151 to another student. Often I hear that Yale's Multivariable classes from the math department are lacking in instruction or content or something, hence why ENAS151 was first offered as a class, and though I have no comparison since I didn't shop the first, ENAS151 is definitely worth shopping and was a joy to take.",
    "I recommend it, as the pros outweigh the cons:Pros:1. Solid way to both strengthen and deepen your knowledge of calculus.2. Provides more real world problem solving than Math 120.3. Stimulating, but no where close to overwhelming.Cons:1. Could have actually had a few more real world problems2. A large lecture, and though Prof. Smooke definitely encouraged us to ask questions, asking a question in a lecture setting can be intimidating."
