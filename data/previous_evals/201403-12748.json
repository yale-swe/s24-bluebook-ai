    "This class is definitely challenging, so don't take it unless you absolutely know you're interested in theoretical math. Also, 230 is not practical in any way, so don't take it if you're trying to learn practical linear algebra or multivariable calculus. This class was definitely one of the most interesting math classes I have ever taken though.",
    "I enjoyed the material and the proof-based nature of the course, and how the problem sets get you to spend time thinking through and really understanding the material whilst having gentle grading. Tests are also very do-able. Some of the material is pretty dense (e.g. inverse function theorem) and can't always be digested in class itself without later review, so be prepared to take your own notes. Larger proofs should be sketched before going into the details. Take this if you think you'll enjoy learning about topology and how vector calculus builds upon that and the structural links between calculus and linear algebra.",
    "Absolutely. This class is supposed to change based on the instructor, but at least with Giulio, it was well worth it. Previous years had homework horror stories; with Giulio, homework took about 5 hours per week, not \"25\" as some reviews from last year said. If you're interested in proofs, this class is great. Exams were very reasonable. I would shop it, and see the first homework to get a scope on the instructor, and decide from there.",
    "If the student is considering becoming a math major, I would definitely recommend the course to him\/her. The material is a good introduction to theoretical math, which is very different from the type of math taught in a traditional high school class. Conversely, if the student prefers applied math, I would not recommend the course. The student probably would not enjoy the proofs.",
    "Agonizing experience, I must say. I've never been so lost in a Math course before, and I think it's not because of the materials but more of the teaching approach that threw many students off. I know that for advanced Maths students you're not likely to choose NOT to take this course, but if you were to take Math 230, I wish you would be more mentally prepared for the struggle than I did. Do a lot of independent learning and do NOT rely on professor. I was depressed by this course many times during the semester because I felt that there was no one else I could turn to for help. I wish you wouldn't be in my position.",
    "This class covers a wide range of topics, starting with field axioms, and moving to properties of real numbers, basic topology, limits, contiuity, derivatives, linear algebra, and manifolds. I would recommend this course as all of these topics are interesting and dealt with well. It is a challenging class, and proof-based. But when it is taught by Tiozzo, it is not as horribly challenging as it is reputed to be.",
    "I recommend this class. There is no doubt that this is a hard class. Some people will struggle more than others (if you think you're smart because you got into Yale this class might cause a crisis of confidence\/ identity- but you will come out smarter if you put the time in). This class is composed of people from a WIDE range of math backgrounds. Some took AP Calc BC their senior year of high school (myself included) while there are some in the class who took AP Calc BC their freshmen year. If you are in the case where you have not taken multivariable yet but think you will learn it from this class you are wrong. This is a proof-based class. It focuses much more strongly on the foundations and workings of math than on the results (its one of those \"I've proved that an answer exists but I have no idea what it is kind of classes. Its letters and words math not numbers and equations). Also, if you are looking at the class because you are a physicist taking PHYS 260... You dont really need to. Youd be better off taking MATH 222 or 225 because you will not use anything you learn in this class in physics (OK, you will, but certainly not in PHYS 260).",
    "Great class for any prospective math major. Giulio is the man, great teacher. The psets are not very long, maybe 5 hours a week if you work decently efficiently. It definitely helps to have a background in proofs and to know multivariable coming in, but those are definitely not necessary to take the class. Equally importantly, it is the best class to meet the smartest STEM freshman at Yale.",
    "About what I expected, maybe a little less. This is Professor Tiozzos first year teaching the 230\/231 sequence and I have been told it is much less rigorous than previous years so some of the cult that has developed around it may need to be dissipated. But, as far as evaluating the class on its own merits goes, it was a very proof-based class as promised. Despite the fact that Professor Tiozzo says he will not follow the book at the beginning, it turns out that he does which is very important given how helpful I personally found the book. The class is objectively difficult in that many people who did well previously in math could not handle the workload\/did not want to put in the effort. That being said, this class is definitely doable with some effort. Professor Tiozzo was not the best lecturer for sure. He sometimes got lost in his own logic (famously for his rendition of Dantes Inferno, the seven lemmas of hell) and often assumed that students could fill in more gaps then they actually could. He often needed to just go one connection further and frequently failed to connect concepts back to the overarching themes that were being studied. At the end of the first semester, I think I have finally figured out how to take this class. Read the book. Go to lecture. And, most importantly, slowly go through the problems on your own not trying to get them all done all at once no matter when office hours are. In contrast to his lecturing skills though, he is very good in office hours and is willing to take the time to explain things to you if you know what to ask, though office hours are rigid. Concepts, when you get down to it, are not that much of an extension from multivariable and linear algebra, but I think it is providing the right framing for 231. Expect to spend some time on p-sets each week, though not as much as you might have heard. Overall, I am glad that I took this class. It has helped me decide on my path in life and experience a new side of mathematics. Honestly, grading-wise there is a decently large A range, but the problem is that Professor Tiozzo is a very harsh grader taking off excessive points for small\/unimportant mistakes. This class is not for someone interested in conventional multivariable or linear algebra for scientific applications (something I am glad I got before this class). As a side note, the problem session are not as helpful as one would like. TA came unprepared and was very nebulous about helping. Grading: hard; Workload: hard; Knowledge: decent basis. -He who shall not be named",
    "It takes a lot of hours, with most people spending around 8-12 hours per pset. However, for anyone with a significant interest in math this is the couse to take.",
    "Difficult but rewarding",
    "A really tough, challenging, demanding class for those who love math.",
    "Essentially, Giulio is a unique, fantastic teacher. His analogies about coffee, malls, and describing manifolds as trashcans are some of the highlights of lecture. You will like the class, and be happy iff you want to be a math major. In the first few weeks, the class seemed pretty easy. Do not be fooled. After the rudimentary material is covered, the class ratchets up in difficulty quickly and many people dropped after the first midterm. Psets generally take 10-15 hours, and studying for tests is an ordeal. Grading for the class is equitable, and of the people who survive, most get As and Bs. However, grading is unclear, as Giulio never established point values for midterms \/ finals. If you ask him where you are at though you will get a gauge. This class is necessary for math majors. Most people have a background in upper level mathematics and still take it. It solidifies your rudimentary understanding of Fields, Topology, Bolzano-Weierstrass, Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, Implicit \/ Inverse Function Theorems, Manifolds, and in general, just Introductory Analysis. You'll learn how to write proofs in Giulio's style, which is simple, elegant, yet sometimes frustrating because you don't understand all the mechanisms behind it. Take it if you want to be a math major and are willing to put in the work. You'll come to appreciate not only the beautiful, intricate proofs, but also Giulio's teaching style, idiosyncrasies, and the friends you make throughout the class through long hours on psets and studying for tests.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone seriously considering higher mathematics courses.",
    "Math 230 is amazing! Giulio Tiozzo is an amazing professor and a great guy to get to know. If you're on the fence between math 120 and math 230, take math 230!!! It's harder, but definitely manageable if you find a study group. Math 230 is an amazing introduction to proof-based mathematics and will let you know if a math major is for you. Even if you're not majoring in math (I'm not), the material is amazing and some of it would normally never be accessible to a non-math major. In the end, I am really happy that I decided to stick with math 230 this semester. Also, GO TO GIULIO'S OFFICE HOURS. He is a legend.",
    "Very hard course that will probably take the most time of any course, especially for freshmen. With Dr. Tiozzo, you won't have any structure to your course. You won't know how grades are being distributed or what the lesson plan is like, and since he doesn't follow this textbook this will often be a big issue. Students who spend upwards of 20 hours a week on problem sets may be surprised to find a C+ as their grade (many students in my course are currently in that situation), and you wouldn't find out before Dr. Tiozzo left the country, leaving you with no way to see why you missed what you missed until it was too late. I will say that Dr. Tiozzo is genuinely nice as a person and will answer questions in his office if you need it, but this course itself has a long way to go",
    "I would recommend Math 230. You will learn a lot of valuable tools for understanding math, and you will see that math is more than just plugging numbers into a calculator. This is a good course to get your feet wet with proofs, and to better understand how the world of mathematics actually functions.",
    "Math 230 is definitely a difficult class, but it is not unmanageable. I personally struggled with a lot of the material, but in spite of that I found its approach to mathematics both novel and fascinating. I would definitely recommend taking this class if you have a strong background in mathematics and are not opposed to doing long p-sets",
    "A hard course that has an incredibly bad curve. Don't take it.",
    "This course is difficult, but a great experience. The course is well structured, and Giulio is a fun professor. The problem sets are quite tricky and very proof-based; the exams are much nicer.",
    "MATH 230 is a wonderful course on the basics of vector calculus and linear algebra as it should be done, and offers an excellent education in how to approach higher level mathematics. As such, I would recommend to any student interested in mathematics or mathematical thinking.",
    "Math for maths sake!",
    "Math 230 with professor Tiozzo is a great course for students with a passion for math. Unlike previous years, the workload is manageable, and (as always) the material is good. This course is based on rigorous proof-based mathematical theory, and application\/computation is a smaller part of the Psets\/tests (although it's still there). This course proves most of its content from the ground up, starting at field axioms, but in this semester we get all the way to manifolds (Lagrange multipliers!) and more. If you're looking for an intensive but rewarding math course, this is definitely a good choice.",
    "Math 230 is a great introduction to proof based mathematics, particularly if you have never done proof based mathematics. If you have, then it won't be super interesting, but you'll at least learn a fair bit if you've been sticking to the abstract side of things.",
    "[TL;DR] MATH 230 is awesome. The classes are intensive and fast-paced, and they cover a lot of content. The grading is reasonable, and the psets are way harder than the midterms\/final (which makes it relatively easy for one to get an A). Prof. Tiozzo is also passionate and easy-going. You'll make many friends while struggling with the problem sets! MATH 230 is an excellent course! It presents many attractive fields of math, including real analysis, topology, limits and derivatives in R^n, and an introduction to manifolds. It is very proof-based, and it is not easy for one to perceive the applications directly (a.k.a it is mostly abstract). I could not have taken a better, most intense math course! *GRADING* Weekly problem sets, two midterms (October+November) and one final. The problem sets are way harder than the exams, but you'll have more time and your friends on your side. Remember to start them early in the week!! Overall, it is not so hard to get an A - if you understand the problem sets and the classes, you will do fine without a lot of study. *TIPS* Take good notes - you will not want to depend on a fellow student's notes one day before the exam. Pay attention to the problem sets - all students will agree that they are the greatest challenge of the class, by far. So strat them early and do not pull all-nighters (Well, not every week). *OVERALL* Take it if you like math and a good challenge, and enjoy learning the fundaments of what you learn in math. Do not take it if you would rather learn more applications than proofs.",
    "MATH 230 is not for the weak: it is a significant time commitment and is very different from other freshman math courses, being proof-based rather than problem-based. This, however, makes it all the more rewarding. Prepare to be frustrated and confused. Take advantage of office hours; Professor Tiozzo makes himself very available and approachable to students.",
    "Sometimes the purpose of this course seemed to be to weed out non-math majors. It moves extremely quickly. Also, there are many students in this course who are very good at math and will let you know it; if you are easily frustrated by competition then be forewarned.",
    "I have absolutely no idea how to answer this question as I still don't even know whether I'm happy I took it.",
    "This is an interesting class. The problem sets take a while to write up, but if you do them in a group, it is certainly manageable, and you'll make friends in the process.",
    "If you are considering being a math major this is the course you should take this course freshman year. As a math major you will have to get good at doing proof-based math. The class really should be called Intro to proving stuff (Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus is just an added bonus that you learn by taking this class which feels much less important than really learning how to tackle mathematical proofs). I can say that I feel like I have grown tremendously as a mathematician because I now feel capable of making statements and proving them in any field of mathematics (given the definitions, theorems, and axioms for that field of mathematics). The reason I feel I have gotten so good at proofs is because every single homework question answer must be proven, and any statement in made in class is proven by the professor. The homework is not easy but rewarding. The first few assignments are especially tough to those who do not have any experience with proving stuff. But they gradually get easier as you build your proving muscle. Also you may have heard horror stories about Math 230 and how you will have no life if you take the course because it gives so much homework. These horror stories are false because the new teacher Guilio Tiozzo gives much less homework than the previous teacher Asaf Haidari did. I took the course and I definitely did not take over my life. I had plenty of time for other things."
