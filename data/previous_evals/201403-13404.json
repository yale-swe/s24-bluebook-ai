    "Overall an easy class to get another credit. Lecture quality varied -- beware they put the best one on the first day of class to try to get you to enroll because you only see one lecture before shopping period ends. Some lectures were ok, but it was hard to stay awake on a Friday afternoon for many of them. Discussion section varied -- some (including mine) were very fun, but I heard other people had bad experiences -- it depends on professor that is in charge of your section. I would suggest going to the class and signing up but if you have too much work it should be the first class you drop",
    "I would describe this course as a lecture form of magazines like the Scientific American. This class absolutely fascinating, but only if you're genuinely interested in research (for people focused on industry, I imagine this class would be super boring)",
    "The class is not very difficult, It is extremely interesting and worth it.",
    "I would not. Compared to DS, it lacks in coherence and sophistication, and with the research opportunities not guaranteed, there is really no attractive points in taking this course. I would rather recommend other seminars focused on the students' respective fields.",
    "SCIE 198 is a class that exposes you to different areas of research at Yale. I would only recommend it for a student who wants to get an overview of what's available for research at Yale, not if you want to get an in-depth understanding of any particular topic.",
    "This class has so far been a great way to get a sense of research going on in a wide array of scientific fields; I would not recommend it to students who only have an interest in one field. It has especially been a great way to get in touch with other science students and learn about what they've done\/what they're doing\/what they plan to do.",
    "Good course for an introduction to what's going on with the forefront of science, but sometimes the lectures are a bit too technical and focus on specific papers instead of overall progress in a field. Homework is infrequent (every other week) but annoyingly tedious when it has to be done.",
    "This class was great but somewhat tedious.",
    "I would recommend the class if they are interested in doing research in the summer or don't know what kind of science they are interested in.",
    "I would recommend, but would brief future students on exactly what the course is. I feel many students dropped out because they were not expecting the course to be what it was. Go in with an open mind and don't drop if the first lecture is not the best thing in the world. Most lecturers are very interesting but overall it was the great discussion sections with a great group of peers who shared my interests and instructors who were interesting that ultimately kept me captivated by the course.",
    "I love the exposure to a variety of science research topics that PSE provides. Presentations topics are always eye-opening, and I was fortunate enough to have an awesome, engaged section. However, some of the presentations are a little dense and could be explained in a more accessible manner to freshmen. Also, I wish PSE were considered a science course and counted towards distributional requirements.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because of the exposure to new and fun science you won't find anywhere else.",
    "Good opportunity to get a glimpse into current scientific work done by faculty at Yale, with topics that are interesting for the most part. Discussions aren't too stressful, and homework isn't too bad, but just the timing of the course (Friday afternoons) makes it a bit of a struggle, especially after a long week.",
    "I would NOT recommend SCIE 198 01. The class is not a lot of work but you can easily get lost during discussion sections because most of the time no one knows what's going on so they just spit out wrong info that makes things even more confusing.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student if they were interested in all areas of science in the way the course covered it. If they had a reasonably good background in all subject areas and were not set on one particular subject but were interested in research, I would tentatively recommend the course to them. I would include the caveat that the lectures can be inconsistent in quality, and the discussions are often flawed, but I would add that one has the opportunity to see many different research projects can be valuable and eye-opening. It can also be interesting to see what sorts of questions researchers are interested in asking and answering.",
    "The class is good, is not too much work, and is definitely worth it if you are interested in more than one science. Even if you already know your primary interest, I think that different disciplines of science can be very relevant If you are interested in only one specific science and dislike all others, however, the course is probably not for you.",
    "I would recommend this class to any freshman who is wondering whether or not they would like to do scientific research in the future.",
    "It is a pretty easy course that introduces you to scientific research. It will also help you make friends with other science majors.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course if you're only looking for summer research funding, since PSE no longer guarantees funding, and you can definitely find fellowships and grants even if you're not involved in PSE. The workload isn't bad, but class meets every Friday from 1:30 to 3 pm, which is a difficult time for me to stay focused, especially on lecture days.",
    "The course is a series of lectures designed to introduce students to interdisciplinary scientitic research, and give studenta exposure to research currently going on. I would recommend the course because it gives students a way in which to become well-acquainted with modern science, and learn about interesting topics as well.",
    "It was not the amazing course that it was made out to be. In fact, many of the lectures were quite boring and too detailed for the average college freshman. It's also heavily focused on biology, which for me was annoying because I don't really like bio and I did not have a good background in it.",
    "I thought this class was going to be more amazing that it actually ended up being. If you are reading this you have probably already been accepted into PSE. I would recommend applying for another freshmen seminar first. The freshmen seminar program is very good (they all get a decent budget to spend on their students- I got to go to New York to the Natural History Museum for a planetarium show in a seminar that I wasn't even in because they had so much money left over). Other seminars will also help you get research (as well as having more interesting topics). You probably looked at PSE and said, \"this is great! I get to learn about all these different science topics!\" But really that isn't the case. You don't really learn any of those topics. Instead you get a presentation by someone working in roughly those fields about their own research (which is nice but not what I was looking for- you don't really learn the relevant concepts). If you end up not getting into any other freshmen seminar then you can consider taking PSE. The workload is pretty minimal and it only meets once a week which is easily doable (even if it is on a Friday afternoon). Also, one thing they say is good about PSE which isn't at all unique to PSE is that you get to meet a lot of other STEM kids. There are definitely better ways to meet STEM kids. In fact, you can't not meet STEM kids.",
    "Not a broad survey course as much as a series of highly specialized topics. I would recommend it a a networking tool between STEM kids, especially upon first arrival at Yale, but not really otherwise.",
    "It is a great class if you have never done research before, but are interested.",
    "It's a class where you get to explore the various scientific fields through guest lectures. I'd definitely recommend it for those who are unsure what their field of calling is.",
    "A class that should only be taken if you know for 100% that you are going to stay in New Haven to do summer research. The lectures are hit or miss, and there are other ways to learn about more interesting research going on on campus. The discussion section are interesting depending on the professor supposedly, so their engagement level also highly differs.",
    "Very good introductory class to engineering and real life research projects. I would recommend it to anyone who is uncertain of what kind of research they want to get into in terms of summer research or a major. Make discussion sections as fun as possible because you'll spend half the class in one of them!",
    "Some lectures are much more interesting than others. The discussion homework questions take a lot of time, and I wish they could be answered mostly by actually engaging with the lecture.",
    "Perspective on Science and Engineering is essentially a brief overview of the work that current Yale professors are doing in various fields. Whether or not you find it interesting can vary greatly with every lecture, but the opportunity cost is not very high, as the workload is minimal.",
    "If you are interested in science or engineering and would like to participate in research at Yale, this is the course to take!",
    "Perspectives on Science and Engineering is a fine half credit course. Some of the lectures are interesting while others are less so, mostly because some of the lecturers are not great at explaining advanced concepts to people with no knowledge in their field. The real value of this course is meeting other students interested in science and engineering in your discussion sessions as well as the discussion leaders who are usually professors who enjoy discussing science. Professors Ahn and Wyman were truly smart, kind men who showed a genuine interest in science and were great discussion leaders. I think the course can be valuable for some merely for the chance to meet other students and great professors, while providing guidance for starting research at Yale. The choice to take the course is really a cost-benefit analysis for the student. The problem sets are not a ton of work, but sometimes annoying, while meeting other people in science can be of great value for some."
