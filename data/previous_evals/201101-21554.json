   "comments": [
    "305 is tough. I would say tests in this course are significantly more difficult than in 301 and there is always somebody in the class crushing them. However, the workload is light (homeworks are usually only 2-4 questions long) and the material is relatively interesting and results seem to have real applications (although they are rarely elegant). Ali was a good instructor for learning the material, although if he sticks to the curve of the midterm, 1\/3 of the 9 person class is getting a C or below, 3 A's, 3 B's, so definitely don't take this if you really care about your GPA.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who has enjoyed proof based math courses. This is definitely a step up from whatever you have taken before, so you may want to start the class out as Cr\/D, but it is definitely worth your time.",
    "We covered measurable sets, measurable functions, Lebesgue integration, convergence theorems, Lebesgue space, Fourier series, and Fourier transform. Not very well taught (also the professor changes every year, so it just depends on your luck, but it probably won't be a good professor), and the text is not comprehensive enough, so if they use Beals again definitely get another text for reference. However the material is very interesting, so if you're very self-motivated, it's worth taking the course.",
    "interesting material, especially when you get to fourier series and fourier transforms and their applications. don't go into this class expecting it to be easy, even if you're great at analysis.",
    "I learned a lot by the end but I felt lost almost the whole semester until the end when I studied for the final. His tests are really hard but the curve is therefore really big. The problem sets are doable and much easier than the tests and also easier than trying to follow what he is saying in class. I you think you want to learn the material taught in 305 take this class but it is definitely not a must take.",
    "MATH305 is a continuation of MATH305, but in my experience, it is much better taught and more pleasant. The concepts are not difficult to understand but it takes some practice to become skilled at using them. It is also well taught.",
    "This is solid introduction to Lebesgue measure\/integration and Fourier Series\/Transform. If you like analysis, take this. It builds on the material of 301 in a nice way, and I actually found the methods used to be somewhat cleaner than those in 301. Furthermore, Lebesgue's theory is really nice, definitely something worth thinking about and understanding. The stuff on Fourier Analysis could be a bit tedious at times, but I thought it was worthwhile by the end.",
    "Math 305 is a fun class. Ali Haddad was a good teacher... A little quiet, but very clear and doesn't mind answering questions. The exams were very hard and graded pretty rigidly."
