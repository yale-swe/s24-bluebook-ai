    "Definitely, if you are interested in and prepared. This course makes all the physics you've taken seem so much less interesting. Be prepared to spend long hours doing the problem sets which never consist of more than 5 questions. Study the textbook well and you will enjoy the course.",
    "Awesome class. It's required for AP majors but I would suggest it to anyone with the appropriate math and physics background. Professor Schoelkopf is great and QM really is a beautiful subject once you come to understand it.",
    "Probably the best quantum class for a physics major to take, particularly with Schoelkopf.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "It was a reasonably good and enjoyable class."
