   "comments": [
    "You will not regret taking this course in your freshman year. Although it does require a lot of work, the more effort you put into the course, the more you will learn. The idea of writing a research paper might be daunting at first, but you will enjoy the process if you pick a topic that you are truly interested in and as a result learn more.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. Although there was a significant workload, the class helped me improve my writing through the drafting process and revision. The material and topic was also very interesting.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in foreign aid\/ being a global citizen and need help on learning how to write for US academia.",
    "If you want to read stuff that are actually meaningful, then take this class over the other sections. But be prepared that the workload is probably much higher here than anywhere else, at least that's the impression I got after speaking with others.",
    "Yes. Take the class if you've never done much writing before (like me) or if you're not sure about your academic writing ability. There are a couple of weeks that get really intense (lots of reading + lots of drafts) but I think the subject matter is interesting enough to keep you up to it. Also you're pretty free to choose your research paper thesis which is SO great.",
    "This course is valuable. No matter how skillful a writer you are, you will learn from this course. Professor Gosselink is incredibly kind and helpful. Her critiques and input are thoughful and really will change the way you write. The class consists of three essays and a presentation. The first essay was a little dry, but the rest of the course more than makes up for it. The third essay is a research project which is followed up by a presentation. The presentation was one of my favorite parts of the course because it was relatively less stressful than an essay due during reading week and taught us a great new skillset. You will spend a good amount of time writing and revising, but ultimately a worthwhile course.",
    "English 114 is a great introductory course to writing. It teaches you to write synthesis essays and research papers. It also has you read many scholarly articles on global affairs.",
    "Professor is great. Some readings are boring while others are fun. A LOT OF WORK. Be sure you can do 30-page readings every other day."
