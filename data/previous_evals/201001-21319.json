    "Statistics II is a required course in the sociology PhD program. The goal of the course is to learn how to read and understand quantitative work in the discipline of sociology. I would recommend it to senior undergraduates who are considering applying to a PhD program in sociology, or to graduate students in other fields who want a sense of how quantitative work is done in sociology compared to other fields.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it: it provides students with the statistical fluency that is essential to continuing in the discipline.",
    "Statistics are an important aspect of the social sciences to know about and I would stress to the students who are to take this course that as Vida Maralani emphasized the course is not for geared towards the production of statistical analysis but the interpretation of it.",
    "This course is a required course anyways, so i guess my recommendation wouldn't change a lot. Nevertheless, I would recommend it to a fellow student if he\/she's interested in statistics. I would summarize it as a \"hard, very demanding and time-consuming\" class.",
    "The course is an introduction to several of the most common statistical models in sociology and an expansion of some of the topics of Stats I. I would recommend it for a student interested in quantitative sociology (even if he or she is not likely to perform such analyses but would only rely on quantitative articles). However, ot may be less relevant to students in the comparative or cultural fields, as it gets down to very specific details which may not be as helpful for such students.",
    "You will like it! Vida takes a subject that many first years dread, and makes it interesting and empowering."

   "comments": [
    "It was useful to learn the different statistical models, and I definitely feel more confident in my ability to engage with the models we learned in the course, but I think it's unlikely that I will be using any of the models we learned in the course in my dissertation research because the models we learned don't seem lend themselves to the type of work I do. However, the course seems like a good stepping stone to other quantitative courses that are hopefully more in line with my area of interest.",
    "Due to the fact that the discipline of sociology is based upon multiple interpretations of what it constitutes (I would argue that this is a strength of the field as it reflects the nature of its subject, society, as an entity that is formed through multiple interpretation) this particular course did not happen to fall in line with my particular interests. As such it will most probably not contribute to my dissertation\/research.",
    "It didn't contribute to my dissertation\/research too much as I'm not planning to use Statistics too much in my research. However, I believe that it's a must to learn Statistics in order to be able to communicate with the rest of the discipline, so i believe that this course serves a useful purpose.",
    "While I am not yet sure whether or not this course would directly contribute to my own research, after taking it I feel much more able to evaluate quantitative sociological articles, even when those are technically complicated. I am sure that the skills taught in this course would be handy later on.",
    "Absolutely essential for understanding quantitative sociology. I am so glad I took it."
