   "comments": [
    "A fun course where you get a chance to peer into how experts in the field digest research literature.",
    "This was an excellent class to discuss some key fundamental papers as well as novel topics that were introduced in lecture. I would recommend this class to other first years.",
    "It's a seminar course that people read papers and discuss about papers. I recommend it to the fellow students, for it is very useful for us to gain a sense of doing research and evaluating others' work.",
    "I learned a lot from CBIO 603. My DGS told me it is a course easy to get honor but I spent much time on it. I had a big picture of cell biology and learned to write review and summary. I will recommend it to another student, especially if he wants to get to know cell biology. It will help us think critically about the good papers and practiced science communication.",
    "A highly recommended literature-oriented course that supplements the standard lecture course. Good opportunity for closer interaction with faculty.",
    "It's a relatively easy class where you analyze a single paper in a week, but slowly the professors slip in more work over time until you're doing twice the amount of work they promised to give you in the syllabus. If you're okay with essentially being lied to or summarizing 2 papers a week, take this class! If you like your teachers to be more transparent and to actually give you the amount of work that they promised you and the amount of work you expected when you signed up for the class, then don't take this class. This is not to say that the extra summary a week was a lot of extra work, just that it went against my principles. If lecturers want to assign two papers, just put that in the syllabus...",
    "This class helps you to cultivate a critical mind, and I will definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "I would strongly suggest this course only to students who are willing and excited to participate. I hope this course continues to focus on discussion, sharing ideas, and critically examining papers. For this focus to be maintained I think students need to focus on in class participation over grading."

   "comments": [
    "This showed me a variety of common techniques and methods to study different topics. I also was able to develop my skills as a critical thinker.",
    "It deepens my understanding in molecular cell biology and how to evaluate people's work. It is very useful to my research for it trains me to think logically and give critical analysis.",
    "I developed interest in autophagy from the class. I get to know some professors working on it, which really helped me choose rotation.",
    "It helped me to more easily extract important data and findings from large papers.",
    "This course taught me how to critically evaluate papers. As a side note, I appreciated examining lower quality papers as well. Pollard had us read two papers, one of which had some questionable logic. This helped us actually examine the science instead of just picking out what the authors believed.",
    "This class has improved my ability to read papers critically"
