    "With professor Gerle, at least, Music 314 is very focused on writing songs for the theatrical Broadway stage. If you're pushing in a different direction musically, expect to get quite a bit of push back. Professor Gerle's comments can be kind of grueling at times \u00e2\u0080\u0094 expect to do multiple revisions of EVERYTHING you bring in as well as writing new things every week \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but his criticisms are always legitimate and meant to help you improve as an artist.",
    "MUSI 314 is an advanced seminar instructing aspiring composers and lyricists in the creation of new musical theater. I would definitely recommend the course to another student, as it is the only vehicle of its kind for aspiring musical theater songwriters - even for a composer not primarily interested in writing music for the theater, it provides good musical principles and techniques that will sharpen any type of composition.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are completely dedicated to the craft of songwriting. It's too much work if you don't get some sort of personal fulfillment from it. Also, don't take it expecting to start a new extended project. You can bring in songs from a side project already in progress, but otherwise, it's not as much of a workshop as the course description might suggest."
