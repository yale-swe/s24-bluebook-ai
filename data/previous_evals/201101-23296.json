    "Two main issues with this course:1) I covers too much material in too little time.2) There is gap in knowledge between SOM and F&ES students. F&ES students could benefit from more detailed explanations in class, but the class speed does not allow for this.",
    "The course heavily depended on utilizing excel spreadsheets and modeling, both of which I don't know much about. There was a distinct difference between skill sets between FES students and SOM students. I'm not sure how much I got out of the class because i had little to contribute to my group work and felt like I was free loading because of my inexperience with modeling.",
    "Games were interesting. Rest of course was somewhat cursory.",
    "This class would have been great if it weren't so short. Maybe I'm just not used to a 1\/2 semester class. This is a very interesting subject it would have been great to go more deeply into some of the material, instead of just giving a quick and superficial view.",

   "comments": [
    "Make it a semester long course, or cover less material. Some material is difficult to follow for F&ES students (such as commodities trading).Make group work due on Thursday nights, not Friday nights. Quality collaborative work goes out the window when people have social lives on Friday nights.",
    "I wish it had gone into more detail about the market considerations surrounding new and alternative energy, like wind and solar. The course stuck mainly to very traditional energy markets, and the electricity section did't really discuss in detail the types of issues surrounding energy efficiency and renewable energy. Since that's more the direction I'm heading, I would have really appreciated more discussion around demand side management and renewable energy markets.Also, it was sometimes difficult to follow the concepts presented, as many of them relied heavily on SOM background knowledge. Even though I had taken the Economics foundations course at FES and have a pretty strong grasp economics, some of the so-called \"basic economics\" concepts discussed in class were totally foreign to me and many other FES students. Since this is a joint class, it would be helpful if the professor knew better exactly what level the FES students were at, so that he\/she could either provide background info in class or some sort of supplementary material out of class for us to get caught up with the SOM students. For instance, a lot of the concepts used in the oil markets game were totally new, and so FES students had to rely heavily on SOM teammates to do a lot of the work (and hope they did it correctly!).",
    "explaining how the games are going to work before they start. explaining how to model for results.",
    "Please devote a greater portion of the course to renewable energy.",
    "Would be great if it were narrower and deeper maybe.",
    "Should be a full semester course. Would have been great to spend more time on each of the topics - oil\/gas, electricity. Didn't have much time at all on renewables - a real disappointment. Also, would be great to add a field trip to this class - possibly to New York to visit with traders or possibly to a gasoline blending station, natural gas gathering spot\/flow gate etc.",
    "The lectures weren't too interesting. It was assumed that students knew how to do excel modeling to complete the assignments which was not true for many of the FES students. As a result, I didn't get as much out of it. A tutorial onn how to do the modeling at the start of the class would have made a huge difference."

    "It is always beneficial to learn how to work as a team, even in the most difficult circumstances.That being said, some people become leaders, others are active but just trying to keep up, others simply don't care. Having to submit collaborative material on Friday nights is a bad idea, people have social lives that take precedence.",
    "Combined and complemented strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Advantages were that it provided a good opportunity to learn from SOM students who had a much better understanding of many of the Excel and financing concepts necessary to play the games well. I learned a lot from my oil market group.Disadvantages were that if you didn't get a team of people willing to work\/help the team, it was very easy to stuck having to take up a lot of work yourself. My electricity markets team was not very motivated to put a lot of effort into developing a strategy, and as such we didn't do as well as a team, and I didn't learn as much from the experience.",
    "Some people pull their weight better than others--the usual. Also the business students are really valuable b\/c they know how to use excel and do trending really well. Wish FES students could learn that too (perhaps as a separate lab when these exercises are introduced)?",
    "advantages, i learned more about excel modeling.disadvantages, i had little to contribute and would have drowned without the help of my group mates.",
    "One major disadvantage was having a group of individuals unwilling to participate in the game, creating a very unfair workload.One advantage was being in a group of business school students and, as a forestry student, being able to learn from them.",
    "Group work is a very big part of this class. It was interesting to work with SOM students, who are like a different species.",
    "Discussing strategy with the OPEC and electricity games was essential to determining the best path forward. Also simulated the difficulty in keeping a cartel together.",
