    "This is a survey course on Latin American politics conducted in Spanish. Take it to improve your Spanish before going abroad, or keep up if you've just come back from abroad. Although there is a large range in fluency within the class, there are enough people with very good Spanish for you to have an interesting conversation and improve your oral skills. However, you should NOT take this class to learn about Latin American politics or Latin American studies. The readings are very short and the assignments do not make you do a lot of research, so you won't learn anything about politics from the class that you couldn't learn by yourself in less time.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who's interested in improving their spanish through conversation, readings, and short writing assignments, as well as gaining a basic overview of Latin American politics. I don't think it's the best language course, or the best Latin American politics course, but it does an okay job at both.",
    "Great course for improving your speaking ability and learning about Latin America\/Western Hemispheric relations. If you can get in, take it!",
    "It's an overview of Latin American politics, covering the last century but especially events from the post-WWII era and the present. The course focuses on specific time periods in certain countries, like the Per\u00f3n era in Argentina or Colombia's drug war nowadays. So it incorporates both historical and modern events. The readings and work load are definitely manageable and fair. I would recommend this course because it's interesting but not too overwhelmingly dense. This is for someone looking for an overview, not an extremely in-depth analysis, of Latin America and its relationship with the US.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. It improves the language ability and at the same time you really learn about politics of Latin America, giving the course a rich content.",
    "This is a great class, but be sure to do the reading and be prepared to participate in class often.",
    "THIS CLASS IS FANTASTIC. Absolutely take it. The professor is incredibly smart, and the class is well-structured to give you an overview of Latin American Politics. The assignments are truly unique and will improve your grasp of both the Spanish language and Latin American Politics greatly. At the end of the semester, I was most proud not of an essay I wrote in English, but the 8 page essay I wrote for this class. The simulations are fun and engaging; though their success very much depends on the moderators. Class was always interesting, and I was constantly impressed with Carballal's ability to take whatever we said in class and then provide her own fascinating insight that was related to our comment.",
    "I would definitely take this class, but only if you like to speak in Spanish. It was hard for me to participate sometimes because I didn't have strong opinions on the themes of the course in English, so translating into Spanish was an added burden. But overall it was a lot of fun and I learned SO much about a part of the world that I had been neglecting.",
    "A difficult course that will be helpful in two respects--in one way it will teach you about Latin American issues and their relation to the US. Second, it will improve your skills as a Spanish speaker and writer.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's excellent, if you have pretty good Spanish skills and not a ton of background in Latin American politics.",
    "Definitely recommended if you don't know anything about Latin American politics. Beginning of the course can be a little frustrating, since most of the readings\/topics are theoretical, but once you move onto specific countries and current issues, and especially class simulations. Profesora Carballal is a great professor, although approaches the topic from a liberal perspective."
