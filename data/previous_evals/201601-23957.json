    "In this class, we addressed a wide variety of complex, provocative questions from a legal, psychological, and at times philosophical and moral perspective. Questions included: How should police respond to accusations of child abuse? Should adolescents who commit crimes be treated as adults? Are cochlear implants in children unethical? Should parents be able to choose the gender or sexual orientation of their child? Is childhood sexual abuse harmful? How should courts make custody decisions? I would definitely recommend this course to another psychology graduate student - and indeed, already have."

    "This course enriched my knowledge of psychology by introducing both a developmental and a legal perspective. As a social psychologist, I am very interested in the real-world implications of my research, and this class expanded my understanding of what these implications might be."
