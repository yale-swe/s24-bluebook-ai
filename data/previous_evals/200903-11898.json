    "I would recommend this class for someone with strong Hebrew skills who wants to fulfill the language requirement or is interested in getting a very small taste of Hebrew literature. The class is really easy and the work is relatively interesting. The workload is not bad at all, there are a few short stories and many poems and songs. If you can understand enough of them, they will be interesting. There are occasional tedious readings in English about the literature and poetry, but it's not too bad, and you don't have to do much more than skim them. Sometimes, class can be a bit slow, especially during the first few weeks and the introductions of new units, when she explains about the history and biographies of the authors. Yet other times, there can be somewhat interesting discussions about topics introduced in songs or analyzing short stories. It's a really relaxed atmosphere, with little to no pressure.",
    "Great class-- amazing way to practice speaking and reading hebrew texts, to learn about Israeli history and culture, and to have an intimate and fun environment for discussion. I felt i learned not only about Israeli literature and culture, but also about the interaction between history and literature in general. Because Israeli history is short and relatively manageable, it's easy to compartmentalize it and understand \"waves\" of literature as directly corresponding to different moments in history. So that was a really fun academic experience, as well as being just a good environment to learn more hebrew.Ayala always says that it is a course in Hebrew, not for Hebrew. Which is definitely true-- you'll learn some good new vocabulary, but I wouldn't say that it made my hebrew astronomically better. But i guess ata certain point the way to improve in a language is just to start reading and translating.And of course Ayala is the best, and she will always brighten up your day.",
    "If you want to learn something about Israeli literature in Hebrew, this is a good class. You'll talk about some interesting trends in Israeli literature. Ayala assigns a lot of reading, but you can get away with reading a fraction. She is really nice and grades easily, I think.",
    "Great class, Ayala is one of the sweetest professors you will come across, and the t topics are pretty interesting. Although, if you're interesting in learning more about modern Israeli culture, you may want to look into some of the other classes being offered, as this class looks more into the history of Israeli literature than modern movements.",
    "A very interesting class! The curriculum was sometimes a little bit freewheeling, but that did not matter, because Prof. Dvoretzky is such a dynamic teacher and she makes every class fun and interesting. She was always willing to offer help after class or to meet privately. I was also impressed by how deftly she taught ot people from very different hebrew backgrounds.. Professor Dvoretzky is the warmest, kindest teacher I have yet found at Yale and I highly recommend taking her classes! She is clearly excited about what she teaches and she passes that excitement to her students."
