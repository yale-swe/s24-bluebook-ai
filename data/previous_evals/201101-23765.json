    "Must take if you're entering into the film world post graduation. There are few practical courses at Yale in the film studies department. If you are not going into entertainment, it will still be a fun class, but you will be fighting entertainment diehards to get in.",
    "If you want to learn about the movie industry, then absolutely. If business talk makes you cringe and go into a corner and cry, you might find the class less exciting I suppose, but I thought that and then I took the class and changed my mind. So I'd say if you're lucky enough to get in, take it!",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this class to anyone with a remote interest in the film industry. It's so much fun, and while by no means a gut, the workload is far from overwhelming.",
    "Fun class. Not too much work. If you have a film background you probably won't learn all that much.",
    "not a good class for losers.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Yes, most definitely. If they offer it again, take it. You won't regret it.",
    "YES. IF YOU GET IN, TAKE IT. YOU HAVE TO. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN FILM AT ALL, YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS. It's important.",
    "Definitely take this if you can get in! Our class was all seniors except for two juniors, but it's worth a shot. The reading, discussions, and assignments (all small, even the final proposal) are all totally chill, yet a great insight into the world of film.",
    "Definitely take it! Even if you just have the tiniest interest in movies, this is a very real-life class with a Yale graduate with incredible outlooks on life."
