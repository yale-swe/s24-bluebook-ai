   "comments": [
    "very good and important discussions, not an obscene amount of reading, very manageable workload (just a 10-15 page paper at the end), would recommend taking after inequality in american democracy, also by hacker, just to know where he's coming from and have a framework for analyzing everything",
    "Yes. The short papers are pretty easy and it helps you to contribute in class anyway.",
    "It's a solid class - you learn a lot about the history of the welfare state. The comparative perspective part isn't really applicable - it's almost all about the US. I'd recommend it.",
    "You will definitely finish the course with a pretty wide-ranging knowledge of the welfare state, its historical origins, a LOT of the politics behind it, and some idea of where it might go in the future. Also, you get to be in class with Jacob Hacker, which is pretty awesome. The 4 response papers really aren't that big of a deal, so it's not that much work ultimately. All-in-all pretty great.Warnings\/caveats: 1. It's really a politics class and not a policy class. You can learn about policy, but not really directly from it. This means it can get a little repetitive at times. 2. There's a lot of reading, and you don't get much out of it without doing the reading. 3. Depends a lot on who is in the class. If people aren't willing to talk (which was sort of the case this semester), then it can get a little boring.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in health care",
    "I would recommend this class if you care about American welfare policy. Do not take this class if it's just a passing interest.",
    "Yes!",
    "It is a great course if the material interests you. I have had Professor Hacker as an instructor in both lecture and seminar form now, and I think he is much better as a seminar leader. Of course, the quality of your seminar depends on the group of students. Regardless, the syllabus covers a wide range of topics, the workload is manageable, and the professor is very knowledgeable.",
    "Good class, with a lot of reading. Not an onerous workload otherwise.",
    "Not too much work, pretty interesting discussion at times (though it dragged a bit when not enough people did the reading thoroughly). Professor Hacker knows his stuff and it's worth taking the class just to see his perspective on some important and current issues."
