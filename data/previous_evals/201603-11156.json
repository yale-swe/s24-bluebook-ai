    "I learned how to communicate in Italian using many different verb tenses, as well as with a wide range of vocabulary.",
    "I developed a good foundation in the Italian language. I also became more confident with public speaking because the class is based around speaking Italian.",
    "I learned a lot about Italian culture taking this course, it was very engaging and interesting. I also learned much more about Italian language than I would have anywhere else.",
    "The ability to speak basic Italian with my peers",
    "I learned elementary Italian. Basic verb tenses and a workable vocabulary.",
    "I learned a lot of basic Italian vocabulary and grammar to help me build my conversation\/speaking, reading, and writing skills. We covered a lot in the first semester and while I don't feel that I have a completely firm grasp on everything learned, I definitely came a long way since not knowing any Italian at the beginning of the year. I also learned a little about Italian culture in this class.",
    "Learned a lot of helpful vocab and verb conjugations. Great emphasis on conversational skills."

   "comments": [
    "One strength was that our professor was very good and had us actively participate a lot. Meeting every day also was very helpful. One weakness was that we moved so fast that it was hard to retain all of the information.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it is only taught in Italian. This helps you learn the language better and be more confident speaking Italian. Weaknesses are that the class is very fast-paced so it can be difficult to keep up with all of the material and fully understand the different grammatical concepts. I wish that some of the grammatical concepts had been explained better, but other than that I enjoyed this course.",
    "This course was very engaging and required much attention and practice. It was very strong in every aspect.",
    "The strengths of this course were the amount of personal engagement from the teacher and the level of rigor asked of us. A weakness of the course were the large Italian tables in which I was not able to participate very much",
    "Simona is a competent professor who knows Italian well. Students are able to speak with a native Italian speaker which helps with pronunciation and authenticity. I have no complaints with this course.",
    "Great focus on speaking and listening, could use more oral presentation projects for practice."

   "comments": [
    "This course was amazing! I loved having class everyday because we were constantly practicing italian, which made it easier to remember.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because of how wonderful my professor was.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because I thought that the way that the language was presented helped me learn better. I had never taken Italian before and I learned a lot in this course and it has made me want to take more Italian courses in the future. The Italian department also has lots of fun events that help you learn the language and have fun doing it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The instructor was very friendly and helpful. The workload is manageable and it was by far a wonderful language course.",
    "I would recommend this course because the teacher was kind and I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Yes. It was a great crash course into basic Italian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to start a new language at Yale. Italian is a fun language to learn and the Italian department at Yale is excellent. The class was challenging and fast paced, but a lot of fun and you learn a ton in just a few weeks."
