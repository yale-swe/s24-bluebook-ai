   "comments": [
    "Somewhat boring with a TON of reading (if you do it). Very easy to do moderately well, with a take-home midterm and only two discussion papers before the final. I'd recommend it if you're actually interested in the material, which is pretty relevant, it's just pretty boring too.",
    "Take this class. It's great for both political science majors and non-majors.",
    "I wish it had been a bit more intense and focused, but overall a very relevant and interesting course. Hacker is clearly a leading scholar in the field, and is very approachable for questions.",
    "Hacker is a really cool, smart guy. But he's not the best lecturer in the world. I think he could get a little bit more excited about the lectures and maybe use less graphs.Overall though, good stuff. You learn about inequality. Which is actually quite horrifying.I did the CBL section which was really cool -- but A LOT MORE WORK. Make sure that they give you more credit for it than they did last year...",
    "An interesting course with a lot of reading but you can get by without doing all of it.",
    "Great class to learn about the modern American system.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is very interesting and provides a more practical approach on theories than many other Political Science courses",
    "Really interesting topic, that will make you question our current system of extreme corporate wealth and skyrocketing levels of poverty. Also great for getting a better understanding of the healthcare debate. However, the lectures were somewhat dull, and Hacker, though brilliant, isn't all the captivating.",
    "You'll get a good look into a lot of interesting public policy debates, and there are some pretty good readings over the course of the semester. That said, you'll get a fairly one-sided (but very thorough) account of inequality in America. Interesting course, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "Yes. Foundation to understanding inequality in America and various governmental attempts at remedying this disparity.",
    "Take this course if you want a laid-back but thorough introduction to issues of inequality and policy proposals for solving them.",
    "Looking at the different types of inequality, their causes, and possible solutions. If you can take this class CBL, and are prepared to work twice as hard as everyone else (if not more) do it! It's worth it! (I rated the workload as much greater because of the CBL component I chose to do.)",
    "Definitely a polisci class you can pass on. Probably wouldn't recommend it very strongly at all. Not awful, but not great.",
    "This was a political look at the ways in which people in the US are unequal, looking at the way the inequality initially occurred and how society perpetuals it.",
    "Solid class. Not much work and if you do a little reading you learn a lot. Graded really easy.",
    "This was a good class covering different aspects of inequality in American society.If you are interested in the material, you should take it. You get an academic viewpoint of many topics in inequality that you assuredly have heard about but haven't spent too much time on.",
    "I would recommend it. Its a good survey class of basically all that is wrong with the American political system.",
    "This class is topical and interesting, and I thought it was a hidden gem. If you're someone who feels like you normally don't learn anything about the \"real world\" at Yale, take this class! You learn a lot about how politics, economics, and social status actually work in the world. Take it whether you're a liberal, moderate, or conservative -- you can really examine your political leanings critically and solidify your arguments about welfare, healthcare, and inequality while learning some new ones. All political viewpoints were welcomed in my section. The non-CBL sections had the workload spread out pretty well, with two 2-page reading responses, a take-home midterm, and a final.",
    "Take it if you are open and willing to learn about touchy issues like welfare and class relations. If you are going to blow it all off, don't bother.",
    "A good poli sci lecture with interesting readings. Professor Hacker tries to include both philosophy and statistics, but ultimately it becomes a little redundant. Still, it's worth taking if he's teaching it.",
    "Probably not. Although we exlpored some interesting ideas, we didn't really learn anything. Lectures were deadly boring and almost no one came (those that did spent most of their time on facebook.)",
    "It provides a strong background in political economy. It blends economic data with ideas in political science and political theory. It was nice that the course also was sociological. We were exposed to the key ideas in the field. The most interesting topics were about the shift from community groups and cross-class organization, such as fraternals, to membership organizations and lobbying groups, the decline of unions, the debate about poverty, and learning about the welfare state in the US, and the Bush tax cut debate.",
    "The CBL section should be approached with caution, because you're signing up to do HUNDREDS OF HOURS of more work than anyone else in the course. The projects are fulfilling and interesting, but the fact that you're in a self-selecting section of the very best students by no means you're going to do well. It's frustrating that you're getting the same credit (and maybe the same grade) as the scores of athletes taking the class and doing no work at all. And the grading of the projects is pretty flawed, because you'll always end up knowing more about your given topic than the TA giving you a grade.",
    "The presentation and structure of the course is only okay but the material is fascinating and urgently relevant. There's way too much reading, as is pretty much par for the course in Yale social science courses, but you don't really have to do all of it. Lectures are fine. Basically it's super important stuff and I gained a range of valuable and interesting insights on controversial policy questions and on the operation of political systems, but to some extent you need to make your own enthusiasm because neither lectures nor section will regularly bowl you over."
