   "comments": [
    "The texts are sometimes boring (eg Tous les matins du monde) and the films are often incomprehensible due to a lack of subtitles in french and cultural barrier",
    "This course is a lot of work that can be repetitive and feel like busy work. You have to be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to it. However by the end you definitely learn a lot of French!",
    "I wish we would read more interesting books. French literature is so rich, I don't know why we pick such average\/uninteresting books from Quignard. Also, most of the movies were really boring. We could have watched so many great movies like \"Amlie\" and \"Les Intouchables\" that would have created much more interesting discussions.",
    "The way that the syllabus wasn't posted all at once was incredibly frustrating because i wasn't able to plan more than a week in advance. Also, I really did not enjoy the books we read, which seemed so old and pointless. There are plenty of other good French literature books that we could have read, but they chose bizarre books.",
    "I did not appreciate some of the chosen works. I would have preferred to study works more relevant to French identity (e.g. for movies amelie, bienvenu chez le chtis, les intouchables). I found Quignard's book particularly clich and uninteresting. Also, I would have found it very helpful to keep the tests in order to go over my mistakes, as is the case with most classes. Thirdly, I found it unnecessarily complicated to have the syllabi week by week.",
    "Although I enjoyed the discussions in my seminar and found the course interesting and enjoyable overall, I was disappointed by some of the choices of literature and movies. I would suggest assigning classics of French literature rather than uninteresting and lesser known novels likes \"Tous les matins du monde\" or clich made-for tv films. Although the grammar and vocabulary interrogations served as useful revision, it would have been more helpful if, after the corrected tests were returned, students had been allowed to keep them in order to review our mistakes and study for the final, rather than having to return the worksheets immediately so that the tests do not have to be altered every semester. Finally, I felt that the structure of the course was not ideal - perhaps entire lessons or separate weeks should be devoted solely to grammar and others to literature and discussion, as combining both meant that the grammar side was sometimes neglected."
