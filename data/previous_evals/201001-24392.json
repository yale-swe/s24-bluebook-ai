   "comments": [
    "This class covers a variety of topics relating to its title - telecommunications, media, the Internet, etc. Students present the papers from class each week, allowing the students to more deeply engage with the material, and Professor Chevalier offers commentary which is interesting and insightful. She makes her expertise clear and it greatly enhances the class. The paper is enjoyable to write and the professor is always available to help. This is a great seminar for second semester economics major who want to flex the economics skills they've picked up while here. I highly recommend this class.",
    "This is a great course without much work, which can be both good and frustrating at the same time. You will know a couple of topics in-depth based on your presentation and paper, but otherwise, it's on you to do the reading and participate in class.",
    "I have definitely taken better ECON seminars, but this is in no way a bad course. You really will get out of it what you put into it. The readings are not necessary for the class, and there were really only a few people who spoke, but the topics have the potential to be really good if they are ones that interest you.",
    "Easy way to fulfill one of your seminar requirements.",
    "Solid course, if you are interested in the material at all you can really learn some good stuff. Not too much work on a week to week basis.",
    "Interesting class, but if your interested in issues of the Internet and not its backbone, take Brad Rosen or Elizabeth Stark's classes."
