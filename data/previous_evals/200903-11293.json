   "comments": [
    "This was a very fun class, with not too much work, and one from which I learned a lot.",
    "Yes take it! Such fun work!",
    "Small translation assignments every week (generally 500-700 words), a midterm project (a creative piece in both French and English), and a final project (7-10 page translation of a literary work). Fairly straightforward class - good, but not very exciting (unless, perhaps, you had a group of people more engaged than we were - we had lots of awkward silences). Shop it and see what you think.",
    "French 185 is a introductory course on translating very contemporary French fictional texts into English. Classes are like workshops in which you present and discuss your translation of the previous assigned text. There are short readings assigned every so often and they are supposed to help you understand the theory of translation.",
    "The class is pretty self explanatory. It's about Translating texts from French into English. There's a bit of theory in which you explore all the nuances of moving from one language to another but most of the issues come up in the practical weekly exercises. I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the subject.",
    "This is a great, non-traditional French class. Though the topic might seem easy, it's actually quite challenging, but it allows you to employ all the French vocabulary you've accrued over time in a really rewarding way. Professor Waters is a lot of fun and makes class time a pleasure.",
    "If you're into translating from French into English, then this is the class for you! The weekly translations will give you lots of practice, and the occasional dips into theory will fill your mind with startling 'issues' in translation that you might never have considered otherwise. I'd done occasional translating before but only got a sense of what my strengths and weaknesses were through this class. The work is very manageable. Professor Waters is very engaging and very qualified - she's a professional translator - and also very unlikely to let you get away with anything slackerish if you try. You'll be translating mostly beginnings of very very recent French novels, which I found very enlightening, since I've hardly read anything French from after 1950. So you won't be translating Voltaire, but it'll be good for you :) Take it!"
