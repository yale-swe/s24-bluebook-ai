   "comments": [
    "So much lab love in my lab, so I had a great time. It's hard to get a lot done since you can't be in lab all day every day, but still a great way to continue to get credit for work you may have started over the summer or in past semesters.",
    "A great way to get involved in a lab!",
    "Fantastic course, especially if you are already doing research. Take it!!",
    "This class is research for credit. Even though you are only required to spend 10 hours a week in the lab, I think that it would have been impossible for me to actually get any data if I was there for any less than 18 hours a week. Basically, don't take this class unless you plan to make it your priority for the semester.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Take it! If you're doing research, why wouldn't you?",
    "If you're doing research you should probably be getting paid or do it for credit. This was probably the most meaningful educational experience of the semester for me. Doing science is so much better than just learning about it.",
    "If you are on the fence about doing Research for Credit, definitely do it. More helpful that any instructional lab course you could take. Just make sure you pick a lab you're comfortable with.",
    "If you have to do this for your major then take it. It is nice to be able to make your own hours. The work is a 2 page proposal, a final paper, and a presentation which are all manageable seeing as you have a whole semester to gather data.",
    "Getting credit for research I would be doing anyway is great! The report is a great way to summarize your work not only for your PI but for yourself to see where the project should go.",
    "Do it! Doing science is tremendously more fun than learning in science classes, and if you're smart about it there's terrific mentors available to you here. You'll end up working more than the required time (10hrs\/wk?), but only because you want to get results and MB&B experiments don't respect your schedule.",
    "Take it if you need an elective in MB&B and are already in a lab where you like the PI. Be sure to pick a PI who you like.",
    "I think your research for credit experience depends solely on the lab that you are working in. I really enjoyed this because the work that I was doing was interesting to me and the people in my lab were very nice and fun to work with.",
    "If you enjoy research, definitely take this course. This class is a great way to get credit for working in the lab. That being said, you'll probably be spending a lot longer than 10 hours a week in lab.Your experience will depend on your P.I. and your project, so the best way to ensure that you enjoy it is to choose your lab and project wisely.",
    "depends on research and lab you are in",
    "It's pretty chill. Make sure to put the relevant dates in your calendar at the beginning of the semester. You don't want to get to finals week and realize your presentation should have happened two weeks ago and that you really ought to have submitted a draft of your paper to your mentor instead of writing it the night before. It's a little disconcerting that you only have an idea about 5% of your grade (the proposal) until the end as the grade is essentially 2\/3 the final paper (your PI and the instructor in charge both grade it) and 1\/3 your presentation (your PI grades you).You need to have already worked in the lab you plan to work in to get anything done. If you come in needing to be trained you won't have time for the mistakes you're going to make. If you do come in having worked in a lab full time before it's pretty frustrating to have to adjust from full-time labwork to the 10 hours per week for 470. And if your schedule isn't flexible it can be a nightmare to make time. And make sure your lab understands the undergrad calendar so they aren't surprised that you're leaving for fall break and thanksgiving instead of staying to do labwork.Overall, it's more a function of your lab than the course as to how hard it is and as to how much you can get out of it.",
    "Really depends on your PI.",
    "Decent-- lots of work but I would have done it anyway. The paper was long and stressful but that will vary for everyone. Def worth it, but not going to take again since the paper was so long. Good way to get credit for the major.",
    "If you are considering doing research as a career, you have to take this course. It is a lot of hours, but the more you put into it, the more rewarding it is. You will do 10-15 hours a week, but if you're busy you can negotiate with PI and reduce the time. Don't worry if you don't get substantial results in one semester - the instructors know how much can be done by undergrads in this course, so if you meet that or exceed it, you'll be fine.",
    "Any MBB student who is interested in or currently doing research should take this course. You get to do pretty cool research of your choice, and only need to turn in a research proposal and final report, and do a final presentation. All these assignments are excellent ways to improve your scientific writing and communication. This is a great way to delve deeper into and put a greater time commitment into your research.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to any one in the major. I really enjoyed the flexibility to schedule my own experiments and to probe my own scientific questions. After all, you'll have to understand science with some hands-on experience.",
    "you commit to ~10 hours in lab a week. for many students it doesn't make sense to do less than 15 or 20. this requirement is as flexible as your lab is willing to be. there is no official way of recording or checking hours. the only thing you officially submit is a 2 pg proposal around one month into the semester, and then a 12-15 page final paper (lit review, intro, methods, results, discussion etc.). both are really painless, ESP if you have done research, or better yet research-for-credit, before."
