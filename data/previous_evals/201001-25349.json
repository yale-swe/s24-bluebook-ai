    "Theater Studies 240 is great because it introduces you to the basic concepts of melodrama. You also get to watch some sweet movies. However, this year the class had nearly twenty people or so, which i think but a damper on the class because the discussions became very boring. There were rarely any strong disagreements or fruitful debates. I can imagine this class would have been much better had their been only four or six people in the room.",
    "Great class. Fun, interesting, not very difficult (minimal workload, emphasis on discussion, genuinely enjoyable and \"breezy\" readings\/assignments).Workload:-2 reading responses (one page, on pretty much anything, graded on completion);-1 mid-term paper (12-ish pages, graded generously, with an extended due-date); and-1 final paper (15-page paper option OR write a screenplay).Definitely take it (discussion is always fun, usually funny, and sometimes hilarious).",
    "This was a fabulous course. I think it says a lot that it was a Friday seminar and yet was consistently a highlight of the week, academic-wise at least. At the end of this class, you will think everything is melodrama--and more importantly, understand what that means. Fascinating subject that offers a different lens into theater and film in general. The only way I would improve this class is offer standardized film screenings at multiple times; some of the films were impossible to see if you missed the very specific screening time.",
    "Yes, this class, while specialized gave you a lot of tools for interpreting theatre\/film and really taught a lot of self-awareness of the melodrama that really is everywhere. It is a great mixture of theatre history, theatre studies, and film studies. Take this class, just for the fun of it because it is intellectually fun.",
    "Yes, definitely. You start to notice all of the common elements and tropes present in most melodramas, and then you end up analyzing everything you see in terms of melodrama. It's very interesting to see the common elements pop up everywhere, and it's just a very eventful and fun subject to discuss.",
    "This class is very similar to other classes in the Theater Studies department. You will study a variety of texts from a dramaturgical point of view. However, it is accessible to students with no prior experience with theater. If you take it after the THST 110-111 sequence, you will get even more out of it.",
    "Take. This. Class. I took this class on a complete whim, and it ended up probably being my favorite class of the semester. The first half of the class you read a lot of 19th century melodramatic plays that are a lot of fun to read and discuss (think: first instance of a person left on the railroad tracks. Awesome.). Then the second half of the class revolved around watching 20th century melodramatic films, which were also awesome. It was a seminar filled with fun people, a great (and very fashionable) professor, and tons of connections to modern melodrama in Hollywood (Princess Bride, Star Wars, etc.).",
    "Highly recommended. Great literature course that's a little different from something like English 120 or 129; you get to know a specific (and prevalent) genre really well, exploring different incarnations of it. Great professor, great class! Take it!"
