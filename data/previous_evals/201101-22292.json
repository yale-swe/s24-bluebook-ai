    "It is a fairly easy music appreciation class. I would recommend this class, but not for a rigorous study or survey of Indian music.",
    "This class was very interesting for the first month. It had the potential to be one of my favorite classes at yale - singing ragas in class, learning about another music culture, taking a trip to new york to see a live hindustani classical music concert - but it soon became very repetitive. It is not a hard class at all - short listening responses due each week, one in-class midterm (not difficult), a concert observation, and a final research paper. The weekly listening journals became busy work and seemed very high school. Also, I was hoping this class would have had more of an emphasis on music theory. Instead, it was more of a history type class. Professor Scott is the most lax professor ever. He is very knowledgeable about what he does and seemed genuinely interested in shared that with us. Overall, I would recommend this class as a class you should take if you need to fill one extra slot in your schedule.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants to expand their musical palate to something outside of the Western world.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in music or South Asian studies. So far, it is the best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course! However, I should warn that the focus is entirely on traditional Indian music, so those looking for a class on something like Bollywood music won't find that here.At first I was a bit unsure of whether or not I would like the class - I didn't even know if I liked Indian music - but I ended up loving it. Class time is spent listening to, discussing, and singing Indian music. Professor Scott is a talented musician, a fantastic storyteller, and an expert on Indian music. On topof that he was a very friendly and chill professor. On a few occasions he brought in instruments and played them for us. There is a lot of reading, but you can usually get by without doing them (the answer to most of the questions Professor Scott asks is Krishna). This class is appropriate for both those with lots of musical training and those with none. I had very little musical background, and I think that had its advantages and disadvantages. For example, I felt I was able to think out of the box more so than students who were used to thinking of things in terms of Western music, but at the same time I felt those who had musical backgrounds were able to discuss the music we listened to much more eloquently. All in all I really enjoyed this class. It was a very relaxed environment and the perfect way to end a week."
