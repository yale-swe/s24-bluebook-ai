   "comments": [
    "Yes. Take it. You know why you should take it.",
    "Yeah! Some of the reading is exceedingly tedious, and some of it apparently redundant, but those are my only complaints. A great arc to the class, great lectures by Fry (esp. on the spectrum of structuralism to deconstruction, Saussure to De Man\/Derrida), and a reasonable amount of thoughtful work.",
    "Good lectures, lousy sections, not enough depth to really understand much of the material. Very whirlwind and only brought together sporadically. Some fascinating texts, however, and Fry is entertaining and knowledgable.",
    "Lit 300 is exactly what it purports. Take it if you want an intro to lit theory, or if you need it for the lit major. Do not take it as a freshman\u00e2\u0080\u0094you will not have the background for it.",
    "Paul Fry is transcendent. This class is amazing. All of the reading is necessary for a well-rounded person. Also, we analyze \"Tony the Tow Truck.\" What more could you want?",
    "I would take it even if you aren't a literature major. It's a great course, and the kind of stuff you'll want to read in college. I never felt like I was reading a \"must read\" list, but essays that actually helped me in ALL my other classes. I plan to finish any unfinished reading this summer and continue exploring some of the theorists. I'm not even an academic! And I hate philosophy! They're just good thought exercises, and ways of understanding the political value of art. Seriously, TAKE IT.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "This is definitely a worthwhile course to take if you are interested in English or Lit. Don't be scared off -- the readings can seem dense or boring, but Paul Fry is a great lecturer and made everything really interesting and dynamic.",
    "I took this as a non-English\/Lit major and regret it. I don't know if I would have liked it more otherwise.",
    "yes",
    "ENGL300 is an interesting course: it raises and analyzes many important questions on the nature and meaning of literature. If you're interested in thinking about why Yale English classes are structured the way they are, and if you're interested in issues like the extent to which an author's biographical information is relevant to understanding a text, this is the class for you. But beware: the readings are often challenging, and the firs couple of weeks of the course are easier than the middle few weeks. Overall, though, the course isn't too difficult, and the final was a piece of cake (even for those who hardly did any reading and just crammed at the end.)",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It's one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Solid course, great reading. Fry is great but I personally would have much preferred to take the class as a seminar.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are a student of literature interested in how and why we read books, and how literature can be viewed\/used. Know at some points that you might be frustrated the class and think what you're reading is BS, but in the end you'll probably find authors on the syllabus with whom you connect. There are a lot of interesting ideas here, many of which you might not buy, but it's important to know that they exist and that people who read literature have read them. Be careful about what section you're put into: the people in your section can have a big impact on how you experience the class: people who are very vocal about what they don't really know can be irritating. Didn't love it the whole time, but in the end, glad I took it.",
    "Don't take this class if you are not fascinated by lit theory. If you are not, like most sane people, take a more concrete class and watch Prof Fry's lectures online.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're a strong reader, have some background in philosophy, and enjoy analyzing philosophical\/theoretical texts. Intro to the Theory of Literature is a really excellent survey of the main schools of literary theory from the late nineteenth century onward- the Formalists, New Critics, Structuralists, Deconstructionists, Psychoanalysts, Marxists, Gender Theorists and Post-Colonial Theorists- that presented a helpful overview of the ways people have suggested we think about literature, and more importantly meaning, throughout time. Anyone interested in questions about the role of an author, the influence of the political context on a work, the power of literature to be subversive, or the way words convey meaning will find at least one unit they want to study in greater depth later on, and will also be interested in the way they all fit together. Professor Fry is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. Every one of his lectures is engaging, both explicating and expanding on the reading as well as following an arc towards a large point about literature. He's one of the great ones you come to Yale to study with, and my only piece of advice is not to make the mistake I did in being too impressed and intimidated to ever go to office hours or talk to him after class.",
    "This is a strange and wonderful class. You will pass through stages of loving and hating lit theory, of understanding nothing and everything, of thinking the material is pointless and thinking it changes everything about how you see the world. Not a lot of reading, though some of it is dense and infuriating. Fry is brilliant, but don't expect to understand every lecture if you're the average student with average prior exposure to the material. And do yourself a favor and actually do the readings before lecture. The lectures aren't a summary of the readings, and you'll get a hundred times more out of them if you just do the (8-20 pages of) reading beforehand.",
    "Paul fry is the man. If you're taking the class, take it with Fry. Super boss.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who would like a good sense of the various big names in academic circles; best suited for people who have not taken a survey class before, although it would help to have had heard of and worked with some of the theories before.",
    "It's alright--it's just dumb that you have to take a final.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely take this class -- the syllabus is interesting and varied, and Professor Fry is engaging and gives a good spin to the material.",
    "Yes, if you have an interest in literary theory take this but definitely be prepared for a lot of studying and some very dense readings.",
    "Excellent, challenging course that will help you think differently about what you read."
