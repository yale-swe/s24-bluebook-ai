    "Yes, definitely do one.",
    "Yes, by all means",
    "It was a learning experience, and I would definitely recommend it for all economics majors.",
    "I think it was an awesome experience, but it's not for everybody. I was utterly lost for most of the time and had absolutely no idea what I was doing. It wasn't until a couple of weeks before it was due that everything finally started to cohere and I finally understood what was going on -- at that point, I had a great time. If you feel like you've missed out on the opportunity to hang out with professors one on one (which is easy to feel in a massive department like Econ), the essay is an awesome opportunity to fix that. And if you're worried about sacrificing the credits, consider doing a 2-term essay that's an extension of your fall term seminar paper; that way, only 1 credit\/semester is devoted to independent study. Plus, the great thing about the econ senior essay is that it's due SO much earlier than most other departments, so you literally have a whole MONTH after you hand it in when you are doing absolutely nothing and your friends are seriously stressing over their theses.",
    "Would highly recommend for anyone interested in graduate school in economics.",
    "I would, great chance to do novel research",
    "Definitely take it if you have a question you're interested in but it's a lot of work.",
    "I think you should be very sure that you have a good topic before you choose to write the senior essay in Economics. Many of us (particularly in the economics department) view class selection as choosing the lesser of two evils - we're perfectly content with courses that we find mildly interesting, because we're used to taking required lecture classes that can be a bit dry. The senior essay is a very different experience. Your work will be almost entirely self-motivated, and there's the real potential for things to pile up and make for an absolutely miserable month of March. Writing my senior essay was really taxing, because a misunderstanding with my advisor resulted in my having to re-do virtually all of the work during March, so it made for a really stressful second semester of my senior year. In order to enjoy writing a senior essay, I think you need a really great topic that will motivate you to work and write a great paper. You should be excited about your topic and passionate enough about it that your work doesn't feel like a chore - otherwise, you're setting yourself up for procrastination and misery, and you shouldn't choose to do the senior essay when you could just take an interesting seminar instead. Also, a good relationship with your advisor is key. Ideally you will have worked with them before so you know what they're like, and you'll be able to meet with them regularly.Basically, I can see this being a rewarding experience for you if you meet those criteria, but I really found it pretty miserable because I had a topic I wasn't that passionate about and I ended up putting far more time into it than I had anticipated. Since this is optional, I'd only recommend doing it if you're really passionate and excited about your project. If you're kind of ambivalent about whether you want to do this, don't. There are plenty of great seminars in the department that you only really have access to as a senior (I loved Douglas McKee's class, for example), and you can get a lot out of those while still taking time to enjoy your senior year.",
    "This is the continuation of the first term of the senior essay; you are not reading this evaluation unless you took the first term, in which case you are compelled to take this class. Use your time wisely, especially if you did not make significant gains in the fall - the due date approaches much more quickly than you'd expect. Otherwise, enjoy another semester of exploring and analyzing your topic.",
    "I would recommend doing it. There's a great amount of satisfaction in taking everything you've learned in the econ major and using it to produce original research. Just make sure to pick a good advisor and have a good topic since you'll be spending a lot of time on this paper.",
    "Absolutely! The major is worth much less without a thesis. A thesis is the program that makes you love economics for all that it is and all that it isn't."
