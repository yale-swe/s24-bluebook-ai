    "An interesting class. It was a lot more math focused than I would have liked or expected. I also wasn't a huge fan of the presentation-based structure. There wasn't much discussing of actual concepts, but more of mathematical models, which I didn't get very much out of. But with a 2 short papers 5 pages and 1 presentation, the workload was very reasonable.",
    "Great senior seminar, that offers application of econ to real life.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's not too demanding (2 5-7 page papers and a presentation) and is an interesting topic. Though, it was at times more theoretical than I was hoping for.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT. It looks like an easy credit but it will give you far more brain damage than it's worth. She doesn't teach, she just has students give presentations for 2 hours every class period on subjects they hardly understand. The result? You'll claw your eyes out for 2 hours a week. Don't do it.",
    "It's a very interesting class with manageable workload."
