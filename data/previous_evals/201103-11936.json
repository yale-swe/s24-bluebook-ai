   "comments": [
    "A great course. You will get out of it what you put into it. If you take risks, and engage in workshop, you will find that your writing starts improving very quickly.",
    "Taking a writing class makes you write, which is important at Yale. It was a well-run class, with reading, exercises and workshops.Professor Woodard is wonderful: so caring and so enthusiastic. At some point in the semester it became clear that every story was \"very good\" and every writer was \"better than you think you are\", which reduced the strength of praise, but specific critiques were helpful, and the support invaluable in creating a positive environment. We had a very friendly, positive group, which meant that everyone seemed to feel very comfortable.",
    "Absolutely, ABSOLUTELY take this class.",
    "If you love to write, it's an amazing class. Take it. Professor Woodard is amazing.",
    "I wish we could have spent more time writing new stories and less time redrafting. Workshop was okay, conferences with Prof. Woodard were very useful -- her comments are usually spot on. It was tough to get a sense of your grade in the course, though. I felt like I didn't do all that much writing in this class. It wasn't the amazingly wonderful creative writing experience that others rave about. The people in my class were good, but the class dynamic wasn't spectacular as it often is in other writing classes. I don't regret taking this class, but it wasn't the best use of my time. Definitely apply to other writing classes and see if you get in. The workload isn't bad at all -- just don't put your stories off til the last minute. Fiction is tough; writer's block comes at the worst times.",
    "This is a really fun fiction workshop, and your writing will definitely improve.",
    "Definitely take this class. It's great to be given pointers, tips, tricks, criticism, etc - even aside from the basic fact that deadlines are good for writers. The writing can vary in quality between students, but Professor Woodard makes sure that workshops are productive even if other class members are off their game.",
    "A typical fiction workshop with a number of exercises based on (mostly) short story readings.",
    "Writing workshop, produce two short stories and three additional drafts, weekly small assignments based on short readings",
    "Prof Woodard is ridiculously supportive and will make you think that you're a writer (which, I guess, you are). The other students were never that harsh in workshop, so don't feel too nervous about sharing your work. Everyone's in the same awkward boat.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's a great intro course and does not require previous writing experience, just genuine interest in writing good short stories and making yourself the best writing you can be. The course load is not too difficult (3 stories and redrafts of each at the end of the class). Professor Woodard is funny and witty and so so helpful.",
    "Take this course. Take it now. With Professor Woodard.Just take it.",
    "This is a great fiction writing class. Professor Woodard is a wonderful teacher, and really good about encouraging you to write what you want to write, not just literary fiction if you aren't into that. It isn't too much work, either, and she is careful not to overload you. You should definitely try to take this class!",
    "Intro to Writing Fiction is a great class to take if you have been mulling over 2-4 well-developed ideas for a short fiction piece, are prepared to write a short story in about a week and present it for criticism to a classroom full of people you don't know very well (you'll do that three times over the course of the semester), and have strong editing skills (you'll have fun reading your peers' fiction, but be prepared to give them thorough feedback, too).",
    "I ABSOLUTELY would recommend this class to another student, but with the warning that it is not always (in fact, it is rarely) fun. It's a workshop-based class, so you spend the vast majority of your time reading and critiquing student-written work, most of which is surprisingly bad. That said, I learned SO SO much about the craft of writing from reading and analyzing all those stories. Especially because you read student work alongside one professionally-written short story each week, and it's immensely valuable to see and understand that gaps between the two types of work. If you want your writing to get better (and don't have much experience with fiction), this is definitely a class worth taking."
