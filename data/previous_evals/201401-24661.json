    "If you can get into this course, take it without a doubt. One of the best I've taken at Yale and you won't regret doing it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this to another Yale student. A course that teaches an understanding of cities -- especially New Haven -- should be a requirement for every Yale student. And if you are lucky enough to get into a class taught by the man who was New Haven's mayor for 20 years, don't pass that up!!",
    "Take it!",
    "An absolutely incredible class. As a professor, DeStefano is insightful, engaging, and funny. At two hours, seminar discussions does tend to drag a bit, but that's pretty inevitable. The workload is reasonable, the readings are relevant and enjoyable, the papers are very open-ended and allow you to explore the topics you're covering in further depth. Would definitely recommend."
