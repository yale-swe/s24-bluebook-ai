   "comments": [
    "The class is fun and enjoyable, and not too intensive for a level 1 language course. I would definitely recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in Korean or foreign languages\/cultures in general because once you start taking the class, you will grow to love it.",
    "A wonderful intro course that is a great foundation to more advanced learning of the Korean language. The curriculum and the instructors make this class a joy to go to as well as a class that one can take a lot away from. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "If you really want to learn Korean, this is the class to start with. Keep in mind that it is definitely a commitment (a year-long one!) and that it is a lot of work. Nevertheless it is fun and you can already understand basic Korean\/read fairly quickly by the end of one semester!",
    "It's a fun class.Just know that you will be walking around speaking to your classmates in Korean a lot.Not too much homework, although the workbook exercises, which you have to do about once a week, can take a while--I've heard people taking anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours.Professor Lee is nice and spunky and funny and really wants to help you learn Korean! --just don't come late to class. She doesn't like that.",
    "Korean 110 is a solid beginning course in Korean. Its pace is not too fast or slow, though if you are considering the Light Fellowship, know that you will be learning much much more at a much faster pace than the ease of this course. Lee Sunsaengnim is a great professor, patient, and excited to teach Korean with you. I would recommend Korean 110 if you are interested in it or if you are looking for a not entirely stressful way to fulfill your language requirement.",
    "It's a lot of work, some of it seems like busy work, but also fairly manageable and fun. Most people taking the class either had some background in Korean or an overwhelming love of K-Dramas and K-pop. As I did not fall into either of these categories it was kind of weird for me, but overall enjoyable. If you have any interest in Korean you should take this class. Because it's so small, the class really becomes your Korean family!",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves learning languages or who is interested in Korean culture!",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in learning the language.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student interested in learning Korean because it covers basic grammar formations, vocabulary, and pronunciation.",
    "KREN 110 provides a basic introduction to Korean, focusing on developing speaking, reading, writing, and listening. The course books are the Sogang University Korean books and rely upon interpersonal interactions as a way of teaching the language in context.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class. Professor Lee-Smith is amazing - so kind and encouraging - and you will learn an incredible amount in just a few months. Back in September, I couldn't have imagined being able to read and write short stories in Korean by finals week. This is a very well-organized, well-paced, and genuinely fun language class.",
    "Korean 110 is an introductory Korean course. In it, you will learn how to read and write Korean - all in the course of about 3 days - and will then move on to learn to understand and speak the language as well. The workload is very light, but there is a small bit of homework every night. By the end of the semester, if you have been keeping up with the class, you should be able to carry on a (semi)natural conversation with a friend. Basically, one semester of Korean here got me as far as 2 years of French did, and I became fully fluent in French in 4 years. So it's a pretty great program.",
    "Yes, if 1) you are interested in Korean, and 2)if you are ready to be flexible\/work without a set schedule.",
    "I would summarize Korean 110 as an excellent intro to language course. It combines all the necessary aspects of language placed in a very comfortable and encouraging environment. As a student, I've learned so much about Korean and anyone who's interested should take this class",
    "Korean 110 is a great introduction to Korean language and culture. I would definitely recommend it to another student who is interested in Korea, Asia, or just a new language in general."
