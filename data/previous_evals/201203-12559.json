   "comments": [
    "Only take this class if you are required to take a math. Not a fun class, but it's just one of those you have to get through. During class, you just frantically take notes for an hour and fifteen minutes and leave. It's not too difficult if you have some previous Calc BC background or are really good at Calc AB. It wasn't a complete regret, but it was not \"fun\" by any means",
    "I would recommend this class if you like math and are planning to become a math major. I would also recommend it if you need to fullfill a math requirement.",
    "This course is a fairly general math course with a manageable workload. Instructors have different teaching styles and ways of explaining the material, so it is very much advisable to shop as many instructors as you can before you decide on a section. Personally, the accents of some instructors were minor and did not affect my learning experience. In fact, I purposefully chose my instructor (although he had an accent) for how in-depth he went and how he conducted the section. What you get out of the course is really what you make of it. There are mandatory homework problems, which are not extensive, but additional recommended problems are listed. There is ample time to finish exams, but time must be invested in studying. The pace of the course is pretty fast, so it is beneficial with a little prior knowledge of the material. As one who took BC in high school, this was a very helpful course, but not an entire repetition of BC, because the topics are explained in much more detail and some new methods are taught. Be sure to review some AB material, because concepts that were not covered in class surfaced on the exam.",
    "If the student is coming from highschool and has taken BC Calc there then yes. Otherwise no. The learning curve was too steep for me and I struggle comprehending everything my teacher was saying.",
    "Take if needed to fill a requirement\/if you really enjoy math. Otherwise, this can be quite a tedious class.",
    "It is a difficult calculus class. Don't take it unless you need it to fulfill some specific requirement, there are plenty of other QR classes.",
    "i would recommend math 115 if u are premed, haven't taken Calc BC in high school or didn't do so well and want to review the material. don't expect too much support from professors. don't take if you are looking for an easy QR.",
    "If you plan on taking math 115, I'm sure you have an idea of what you're getting yourself into.",
    "If you are absolutely certain you enjoy math, take it. Otherwise, shop wisely. As a humanities student who enjoyed math in high school, I found it frustrating and unenjoyable.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is very tough and for most non-math majors 112 fulfills the requirement and is significantly less challenging. It is difficult to understand most of the professors and the exams are very tough.",
    "Mathematics 115 reviews some skills that you already know, but then goes into more detail and covers new material. It really helps if you have a good professor to guide you and explain the material. I would recommend this course to other students, but only if they have previously taken a Calculus class."
