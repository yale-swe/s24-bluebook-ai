    "I learned a lot about clarinet playing!",
    "It's a music performance class- I practiced working within a chamber group, learning my own musical materials, etc.",
    "Another great semester in chamber music! I felt that my playing and my musical thinking reaching a new high this past term. Having the opportunity to play the piece in full several terms for the performance allowed me to communicate more sophisticated musical ideas.",
    "Great opportunity to play chamber music with great musicians",
    "In this class I was able to not only learn a complete piece of chamber music but also work with others, get experience playing in front of others, comment on others' performances and work with several coaches.",
    "This is a great course that gives you a lot of freedom and helps you be collaborative with others, organized, responsible, and creative on your own."

   "comments": [
    "Great course. More modern pieces would be great to break up the Brahms. Or just different composers with different styles.",
    "Great",
    "While I've enjoyed being with the same players for many semesters, I actually felt like I was being held back almost every semester by the level of the other players. I can imagine it is a tricky balance to strike with having players of similar levels be in the same group, but also diversified enough such that the groups themselves don't vary too much in level. Pianists sometimes have an awkward role in large chamber groups. I would ask that with particularly difficult pieces, have at least one coach who is a pianist\/knows the instrument coach the group. I would also keep telling groups at the beginning of the semester to hold string rehearsals when necessary (esp. for piano quartets and quintets). Also, could we have singers in the class? The \"TAs\" in the class have always been fantastic, so I'm very happy with the selection of the coaches. Wish the Argus Quartet could stay for another year with the course!",
    "The model works pretty well. Maybe it would be nice if each coach could lead a \"score study session\" at the beginning of the semester, showing us at least in broad strokes how the piece works. e",
    "The best way to play chamber music as an undergrad at Yale - high level of musicianship in all students and knowledgable and committed coaches (faculty, YSM grad students, and professional chamber musicians) Across the groups, I think that the range of repertoire could be widened (there was a lot of Brahms and Schumann this past semester, for example)",
    "Opportunity to give and receive feedback to other fellow students",
    "This class is great because playing in class helps the groups get used to playing in front of others, and commenting on others' performances helps everyone think about other performances in order to improve one's own group.",
    "The only weakness is that having two coaches means they sometimes tell you opposite things-- I think my coaches could have communicated a bit more. However, all the coaches are really helpful and wonderful."

    "YES!!!!!",
    "If you are serious about music, you must take this class. It is an incredible opportunity to play chamber music (and you get half a credit!)",
    "Yes, take this course! If you enjoy chamber music, you will enjoy this course.",
    "If you want to play great music with talented musicians, take this class. Can't be beat!",
    "Definitely take it if you want to play chamber music!",
    "Absolutely! Weekly chamber coachings, good repertoire, you get to hear your friends play music, what more could you want?",
    "Yes, take this course absolutely! If you get in, you *have* to keep up practicing your part or else everyone in you group will become disincentivized and you'll all hate each other for having done this until the last week before the concert. So, don't learn a lesson the hard way. :) If you could get into the course, you're probably a good instrumentalist, so make time for this course's demands. 4 months for an entire chamber work is completely doable. The fun part about this course is when you actually start asking the bigger interpretive questions about the piece and learning how to do that within a group. So don't let learning the notes hinder you from that learning experience.",
    "Yes, if you'd like to play chamber music in an organized setting.",
    "If you have any desire to play chamber music with other committed classical musicians, then take this class!",
    "Yes, for committed musicians",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because the structure of coaching, rehearsals, and playing in class allows the groups to learn their pieces well and really involve themselves in their playing.",
    "If you want to play chamber music for credit and work with really great musicians, take this!"
