    "This class has a great syllabus that includes both literature and film. I would definitely recommend this course. It is one of those rare combinations of extremely fun but also interesting and valuable.",
    "Make sure that you like the material beforehand. I wasn't the biggest fan. Who am I, right? Seriously, I don't think the literature we read was that great. Also, there was way too much over analysis in section. If it's a lecture, then take it because Professor Grimstad is brilliant and he loves these works . If it's a seminar again, then I would think long and hard about it. It seems interesting, but fall semester is long. After 12 straight weeks, you may find detective fiction to be a bit dry.",
    "An in-depth look at the evolution of Detective Fiction from Poe to Phillip K. Dick, and covering everything in between (movies included), this course allows a careful examination of a genre often discarded by elitist literati. If you've ever doubted the literary validity of the genre, this class will forever convince you otherwise.",
    "i would recommend this class.",
    "Hype is deserved. Take it.",
    "Not too much reading, but because of how huge the seminar was you had to always come very early if you wanted a seat at the table. And then when it came to the actual discussions you had to be very on top of your game and very well-versed in highly sophisticated literary analysis to feel comfortable talking in the class. It was kind of dominated by a few people even though the class had about 20+ people in it. Professor Grimstad is wonderful though. But you should also think about how the only think you're graded on all term (besides class participation) is one 20 page final paper. Little daunting.",
    "Absolutely take it if you can get in, but do all the reading and come to class ready to participate. You will not be able to participate in this class if you just sit back and wait for an opportunity to talk. All the reading is interesting enough that you should want to do it anyway, or you shouldn't be taking detective fiction!",
    "This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Grimstad is amazing-he is one of the most enthusiastic professors I have ever met and his excitement about the material is infectious. The readings are diverse and almost universally enjoyable, and the way in which the different selections coalesce into a complete narrative about the genre's history is fascinating.",
    "Detective Fiction is incredibly fun, and it's not as silly as it may sound. You'll learn a LOT about some serious authors, and the material will always always be interesting. What I would warn against is the grading -- this year, Grimstad (who by the way is brilliant and really sweet) made it 40% participation, 60% final 20-page paper. That was scary. Hope that he changes it.",
    "A good class -- the literature you read isn't that great, and detective stories get redundant, but it's definitely something different for a change. 40% participation, 60% 20-25 page final paper. Grimstad is really cool and energetic....a bit long-winded. The class is fun and it's barely any work. A good junior seminar.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in detective fiction.",
    "Detective Fiction is a fun and interesting course, and a relatively painless way to fulfill the junior seminar requirement for the English major. If you enjoy reading and talking about great literature, then you should definitely take this course.",
    "One of the best English literature classes I've taken, taught by one of the best professors at Yale. Prof Grimstad is hilarious! Classes were so much fun to attend, which was entirely due to Grimstad's cunning, his charisma, and his tangible passion for the material.",
    "This was a great course. I provides the unique opportunity to watch a genre evolve from its definitive starting point with Poe to its modern adaptations. Professor Grimstad has a clear passion for the subject and his enthusiasm is contagious in group discussion.",
    "Pretty damn close to a perfect English seminar. Great reading list, brilliant professor, and, when I took it, a really fun group of students. Be prepared to take mystery stories very, very seriously: it's a literature class, not light reading for credit. But if you can close-read and appreciate the thrill of a good story at the same time, I cannot recommend this class highly enough.",
    "Yes absolutely. This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This was a really great overview of some of the most important works in detective fiction, from Poe to the Golden Age to the hardboiled writers to Philip K. Dick. There's a lot of reading and discussion, and one major paper at the end. I went into it loving detective fiction and came out loving detective fiction, but with a much fuller understanding of the genre and having read a huge number of works I'd never read before. This is not by any means a gut class -- the work load is not super-intense, but the intellectual level of in-class discussion, and the kind of thinking Professor Grimstad expects you to do, is definitely complex.",
    "DETECTIVE FICTION IS AWESOME.PAUL GRIMSTAD IS AWESOME.You go to his classes during shopping period, and you see people overflowing from the room for good reason. The man is young, energetic, passionate, and ridiculously intelligent. He knows what he's talking about. You get to read awesome books, and you have movie nights. Professor Grimstad has that unique ability to craft a totally enjoyable course experience that is well-rounded and challenging.The best part of it all is that you know that he wants you to feel the same passion he does for the material. Not many professors try to cultivate that human relationship with the texts covered in class.You're wondering if you should take this class? TAKE IT.You're wondering if you should take any of his other classes? TAKE THEM."
