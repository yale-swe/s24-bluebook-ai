   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Knowledge both of the theoretical basis of geographical and historical study as well as important concepts relating to visual presentation of information and ideas.",
    "How geography and history blend Making visual argument How to write a lot",
    "This course taught valuable skills at using mapping software and image editing software to create and edit maps for use in scholarly papers and publications as well as how to use mapping tools to conduct geographic analysis. The course also taught much about the discipline of geography and how to take critical approaches to studying geography and history. These insights, alongside the usage of mapping tools, allows for critical study of maps and inclusion of geography, space, and place in historiographic work.",
    "I learned a wide variety of things in this course, including: the history of academic geography in the US, and its relation to other academic fields, especially history; how to think about socially constructed space; how to look at, read, understand, and deconstruct maps as arguments rather than as objective portrayals of the world; and I learned the beginnings of how to use GIS, and how to make and use my own maps as part of historical argumentation.",
    "This course was a wonderful multidisciplinary look at the intersection of geography and history, with a special emphasis on using visual techniques from the digital humanities to develop analytic skills. While many scholars speak about the spatial turn in an abstract sense, this course teaches you how to think spatially and engage in spatially informed research. In addition to taking space seriously, it takes visual analysis seriously, and one learns how to read maps and images with as much (or more) care than one typically reads text and scholarly prose. I would say that I learned how to pause and look at the visual details of scholarly works that I had previously often seen only as secondary",
    "In this course, I learned how to integrate spatial and visual information into my current project, along with the massive corpus of theory and literature advocating for spatial information. It really was one of the best courses I've ever taken.",
    "I have a broad understanding of the intersections between spatial thinking and historical methods. I also gained experience with creating maps and visualizations as part of a research project",
    "I learned to read and include visual material in my arguments as well as the historiography if geography"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great course. The combination of heavy historical theory and practical use of modern computer tools was fantastic. Professor Rankin talking frankly and honestly about the experience of working as a historian and the process of writing historical works was so helpful.",
    "Strengths - rigorous workload, interesting readings, thoughtfully constructed Weaknesses - class discussions sometimes felt rushed",
    "This course was particularly strong because of the professor taking the time to clearly explain practical skills related to the topic, as well as his tendency to ensure the entire class understood concepts that were brought up in discussion. The professor also explained much about writing and publishing. The class also, I feel, benefited greatly from the diversity of students in the class from different departments and disciplines, each sharing their ideas and fields of study with one another.",
    "Strengths: the syllabus was a good mix of theory, methodology, historiography, and actual history, which was great for a course that is really situated at the border of two disciplines and which is pushing its students to rethink modes of analysis that we might take for granted. The course also had students with an incredibly diverse range of subject matter interests and past experiences, which made for super fruitful class discussion. Weaknesses: cant really think of any!",
    "The major strength is the passionate engagement of the professor, who clearly knows the field and conveys this passion to students. I enjoyed Bill's demonstrations of how he has developed visual arguments in his own work, and the mini workshops were inspiring. However, for someone with little background using some of the software Bill uses so well, it was occasionally a bit like watching a magician, in that I wasn't always sure I could learn how to do some of the wizardly tricks Bill could do. That's ok, because it set a model for inspiration. The course might benefit from a few dedicated hand-on sessions led by photoshop, illustrator, and GIS experts in which students actually bring in an image and learn to improve it for their work. This could be led by a TF in a kind of addition \"lab\" session. One other minor improvement might be to spend a bit more time looking carefully at the assigned texts themselves. We discussed them in the abstract, but could have paused and engaged in a bit of close reading here and there. But this last point would have required an additional hour in the seminar, perhaps. Another strength is Bill's excellent feedback. He gives incisive and wise comments both on paper proposals and on class presentations. Oh, and the in class presentations were very good at getting students to develop presentation skills. They were well run, interesting, and valuable to the intellectual work of the class as well.",
    "I'm very glad Bill strove to keep course enrollment small -- this class would not have felt the same with more folks in the seminar. Particularly in the beginning of the class, I was very concerned by how often students seemed to take turns monologue-ing their smartest thoughts rather than actually dialogue-ing with each other, to the point where I almost emailed the instructor about it. After a couple of weeks this issue got better. But it highlights that the instructor should not only present guidelines for contributing in class during the first meeting, but continue to remind students to keep their contributions clear and concise for the first few weeks, so participants develop the habit. We read a variety of written forms during the course (history journal articles, prose in atlases, book chapters on geospatial tech, writings for popular audiences), and therefore had a variety of forms to mimic (for lack of a better word) when writing our term papers. I understand that not providing students with a project rubric to follow is and should be expected in graduate school -- but I do wish more guidance had been given on what form\/style we should aim for in our final papers, mostly to help students *scope* their final projects and determine how much work they could reasonably bite off for the end of the term. The first two-thirds of the class, at times I felt that we delved into works proposing fascinating ideas\/theories and then completely set them aside two weeks later. Perhaps the course, and students' intellectual takeaways, would benefit from more deliberate expectations\/asks for students to tie-in previous weeks' readings in discussions.",
    "The strength lay in the very purpose of the course. A weakness, though, was that I wish we spent a bit more time discussing the readings and following the questions each week's presenters gave as a guideline through the readings which I think was something that got abandoned soon after the presentations themselves.",
    "I liked the mix of theory, practical mapping tutorials, and engagement with visual material. I think it would have been helpful to get feedback on paper drafts from other students. Maybe there could be one fewer week of presentations and there is a week when we share drafts in small groups"

    "Yes! This course was life-changing. Take it. You won't regret it. Amazing course.",
    "Yes, its well worth the effort",
    "Yes. I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in geography.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a student who is interested in engaging with spatial modes of thinking and analysis in some way shape or form in their own work, whether they are starting off or have been doing so for a while, and even if you havent had a particularly historical bent to your work before.",
    "Yes. You should definitely take this course if you want to engage seriously with maps, spatial analysis, visual presentation, and in order to engage in serious intellectual discussions with a wise professor.",
    "I would 100% recommend Bill as an instructor to anyone interested in history of science. The class itself I would recommend depending on a student's subject area. This class is ideal for those who want to converse with ideas from specific thinkers\/academics in their scholarship; the works read in class provide a great place to start. However, for students who are more interested in practical aspects of map-making, decision-making behind visual products, the material history of how mapping techniques\/technology has changed over time and how that has influenced cartography, I think the course was slightly lacking. I got the sense that the undergraduates in the course felt \"in over their heads\" -- so I'd be explicit with future interested undergrads about the differences between an undergrad and grad workload.",
    "I'd highly recommend this course to anybody who is trying to understand the \"spatial turn\" in history, and especially how to integrate map-making and other digital humanities tools into their work."
