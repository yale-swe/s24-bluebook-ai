    "I loved this course. I think I developed a much deeper understanding of solo performance and all of its aspects. I also feel like I was much more comfortable in my own writing and performing abilities by the end of the semester. The prompts and readings for this class were all extremely interesting and actually incredibly fun to do. Our guest speakers also gave us great advice and forwarded our learning in a great way.",
    "I learned about the various creative processes of performance artists (and other artists\/creative people). I developed a clearer understanding of specific techniques and methods used in solo performance.",
    "I learned about the creative process, specifically the discipline necessary to be an artist. I learned about crafting a play that is uniquely suited to the one-person form.",
    "I think I saw a little bit of the history of the one person play as a form, and saw some really impressive performances. I was also confronted with the question of my own creative process, though there were limited opportunities to actually explore what worked and what didn't. The class gave me a structured opportunity to produce two scripts, though I didn't really feel like it adequately gave me the necessary tools to feel confident doing so.",

   "comments": [
    "Honestly, more time. I understand it's a college seminar and therefore can only be once a week, but having more time for this class would have been amazing because oftentimes, not everyone was able to present work they prepared or practice. Our discussions were great, though, and I thought everyone had a fair say in them. It really came down to our performance assignments. In a way, it was good, because you didn't feel too much pressure to do really well, but in another way, it also caused students, I think, to slack and not try to do assignments because they didn't have to present them anyway.",
    "Strengths: Learning about and getting to try out different techniques of solo performance. Weaknesses: Probably the biggest weakness of this course was the amount of time we spent discussing things like morning pages, the creative process, etc., instead of getting up on our feet and trying things out. In general, we would spend about 3\/4 of class talking, and then only have 30-45 minutes for the practical work. If this ratio were flipped, more people would have a chance to work on the actual *performance* part of solo performance, and the final performances might end up being more creative.",
    "GET RID OF THE REQUIRED DAILY WRITING. IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME AND ACTIVELY DETRACTED FROM MY ENJOYMENT OF AND LEARNING IN THE COURSE.",
    "Strengths: interesting readings Weaknesses: Not enough writing exercises leading up to the midterm\/final - often felt as if I were starting from scratch, no concrete feedback on writing technique",
    "Strengths: Talkbacks with guests Curriculum - the texts are extremely informative Weaknesses: Not enough composition assignments or feedback Discussions sometimes felt irrelevant or purposeless Class size is too large - limits number of students that can perform each class",
    "uy ok so. not a lot of classes like this at yale. if you have a really good idea of a 10 minute solo piece you want to do for your final project, and you want it graded, this would be a great class for it. real highlight are the performers and writers who come to visit, most of whom are very high-profile and ooze talent. those are super exciting to see, and often have great insight. unfortunately however, I think the class needs some significant restructuring. I had a lot of problems with the class, but they all pretty much come down to the fact that we didn't actually end up doing that much work except for the midterm and final, which, as a result, felt like they came out of nowhere and for which we didn't feel prepared, a sentiment that was shared by most people in the class I spoke to. there was a ton of talking about creativity in the first half of the semester, we'd spend the first thirty minutes of class talking about our journaling assignments (our \"morning pages\"). journaling (3 pages a day, all semester, even breaks) is definitely annoying, but it's rewarding, but I never felt like it unlocked any creativity, and we spent probably a quarter of all class time reflecting on the process of writing them, which just wasn't helpful. we'd then spend another hour talking about the readings, and the discussions were never that interesting, though that might have been the fault of the classroom dynamic. then, in the last thirty minutes, three to four people would get to present their assignments, which were mostly improvised. this meant that when we got to the midterm, and again the final, we'd only performed in front of the class two or three times each, all of which felt pretty insubstantial. I'd much have preferred to spend way more time in class developing and thinking about real assignments perhaps in groups or with partners rather than having insubstantial discussion about creativity. i think this class could be so much better if we learned by doing, not by talking about it. in general, i think part of this stemmed from the fact that Hal is a director, not a writer. he gave me really, really helpful advice on my midterm, but I would have loved to have been receiving advice like that throughout the course. even having a few two or three minute pieces throughout the course would have been helpful in exploring what kind of work we wanted to do, and what it means to put together a piece.",
    "Strengths - Very challenging and engaging. Intimate setting. Class visits from professionals in the field. Long class period which allows for much exploration. Weaknesses -",
    "Strengths: not overwhelming amount of work; guest lecturers super amazing; get to watch a variety of performers (diversity\/identity emphasized) Weaknesses: trouble with performing classes that are once a week is that there is not enough time to really perform! only a few people can do the exercises each week; also class is really about creativity not writing which is fine except for the fact that the midterm and final are plays so it's kind of overwhelming to tackle those projects; would like more formal instruction with respect to craft of playwriting"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Whether you do theater or not, this is a class that will really change how you share experiences and stories with other people.",
    "I highly recommend this course when it is next offered. I learned so much about the one-person form and was forced to feel comfortable performing my own work, which is so important. Hal is a really great teacher and the course is a sort of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet real players in the field and talk to them about their work.",
    "It depends...This course is much more about exploring the creative processes of different artists\/thinkers than it is about solo performance. While you will get to practice techniques of solo performance, the majority of your time will be spent discussing how different artists \"create.\" The course is also very dependent on the people in it. You will learn from each other's work, so if you don't have exciting\/creative\/out there people in the course, it might be kind of tough. Up to you!",
    "The daily writing is a pain, but Hal is great, the guests are interesting, and the challenge of writing a one-person piece with no specified topic is both difficult and liberating.",
    "Definitely take if you are interested in becoming more creative, but definitely not a writing course.",
    "Yes. This course provides students with a solid base for future creative endeavors. I learned a number of techniques that will serve me for many years as an artist.",

I also felt that while Hal preached that we should find our own creative process, the only opportunity in the class to be creative (the midterm, and the final) required a pretty regimented set of requirements, that many of the guest artists had foregone. While the class prompted me to start thinking about my creative process, it didn't really provide many opportunities to explore. in general, i think part of this stemmed from the fact that Hal is a director, not a writer. he gave me really, really helpful advice on my midterm, but I would have loved to have been receiving advice like that throughout the course. even having a few two or three minute pieces throughout the course would have been helpful in exploring what kind of work we wanted to do, and what it means to put together a piece.",
    "Yes - very good way to delve into creative process and one-person play. Nice intimate setting."
