    "I learned how to approach math courses at Yale, along with the various mathematical subjects that were discussed.",
    "I learned how to take limits, find integrals, use differential equations, and how to prepare for exams.",
    "I learned how to study for exams through practice problems!",
    "I learned about limits, derivatives, basic integrals, and basic differential equations.",
    "I was able to better grasp calculus",
    "I learned the fundamentals of calculus in this course. This will be helpful for any major in QR that I might be considering. I also learned the value of going to office hours because without office hours I would have really struggled in this course.",
    "fairly standard introduction to calculus.",
    "I developed a much stronger knowledge of Calc 1 by taking this course. I am now able to compute limits, derivatives, and integrals with ease.",
    "I developed my ability to think about the math theoretically and gained a much deeper understanding of concepts introduced to me in high school.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundational concepts of calculus and how they are applied together."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course could be improved by the PSETs feeling more homogeneous, as opposed to having two psets due in one week. Furthermore, if there were no true false questions on the test, that would be wonderful.",
    "The lectures are fun and engaging, the problem sets at times are ridiculously difficult.",
    "Strengths is that it helps with problem solving and peer tutors were awesome. weaknesses include that the class material was significantly easier than any of the homeworks, and the homework was very hard.",
    "Class lecture could be refined",
    "I thought in general this course was decent. One thing that I wasnt a huge fan of was the ximera. For me at least it was more annoying than helpful.",
    "a good course, it's hard to say how it should be improved since it was a perfectly fine run of the mill math class, nothing to be fixed i guess.",
    "I have trouble thinking \"outside the box\" when tackling challenging math problems, especially under test conditions. I have trouble recognizing similar questions when shown to me during a test and making the connection with similar questions I've practiced on. Finding different ways to solve similar questions still poses a challenge to me."

    "Yes I would I think its a good course for setting the foundations of math for anyone interested in a major that involves any quantitative reasoning. 112 is good for those who could have taken 115 but might not be super comfortable taking it.",
    "Yes? if they need to take math and haven't taken calculus yet, I would recommend it (also its a prerequisite for other math courses), but if they have taken calculus before I would recommend 115.",
    "Only if it is a required prerequisite or required course."
