    "This course was an amazing, professional experience in learning screenwriting. It was far more useful than any traditional screenwriting course offered by the Film Studies Department. Brian cared about each and every story, offering thoughtful advice on how to develop the plot while being hard enough to make you want to push yourself further. If you have any interest in this field and if this course is ever posted again, take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in screenwriting even if they have no previous experience. You get to go through the entire process of coming up with a story idea, expanding it into a full beat-by-beat description of the plot, and then writing the first 15 pages of the screenplay. Professor Price definitely knows his stuff, and he divides up the assignments into very manageable pieces. Also, it's lots of fun hearing everyone's stories and doing table reads.",
    "If you get in. Take it. If you don't. Beg. It was one of the most amazing classes I've taken at Yale. Helped me exercise a completely different part of my brain. Brian kept the sessions super entertaining, relevant and interesting! Take it. Take it. Take it.",
    "Definitely take CSPC 310 if given the opportunity, if you have any interest in film or the art of screenwriting whatsoever.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone interested in screenwriting. Having shopped and\/or taken other screenwriting and fiction writing classes at Yale, I can say with confidence that this is hands-down the best class taught in this area. We start the semester learning the basic elements of storytelling from none other than Aristotle and end the semester having written the first 15 pages of a feature length script and an incredibly detailed outline (beat sheet) for the entire film. Professor Price gives amazing feedback on every assignment we turn in and is very willing to meet with students before and after class to have one-on-one conversations about the development of our stories and scripts. Like I said, if you are at all interested in screenwriting, you should take this class.",
    "I would highly recommend! A crash course in the universally acknowledged structural process of screenwriting and why it's so ubiquitously understood to work so well.",
    "Too bad this class was a one time deal. Best class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "An awesome class. It is helpful if you actually have a good idea for a screenplay, but either way you will learn so much. Take advantage of Brian Price if he ever teaches this course again. He is an amazing professor and succesful screenwriter. Very fun.",
    "Definitely recommend. If you like anything related to film or tv, this is for you.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "Great introductory course and very helpful for anyone who has previous experience writing screenplays."
