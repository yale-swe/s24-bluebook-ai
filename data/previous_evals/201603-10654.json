    "Lots of history and fun facts about the Industrial Revolution.",
    "This course taught how to effectively apply contemporary economic models to the European economy during the Industrial Revolution. It focused on key events throughout the period that (possibly) made a difference in the economic advancement of the region, as well as highlighted noteworthy (and often conflicting) arguments about the economic relevance of certain phenomena. Most importantly, it taught that economic history continues to provide a valuable perspective for assessing the current economy.",
    "I learnt how to summarize economic history papers, and how to apply economic models to \"real-world' applications. Learnt how to read critically and think logically.",
    "Great economics class! Teaches you economic history and theory.",
    "I learned about European History, causes that led to the Industrial Revolution, theories on international trade, slavery, and many other topics. I developed insights on a variety of economic phenomena as well."

    "This class was exceptionally clear, well-organized, and engaging. Professor Guinnane's syllabus effectively substantiated his expectations for the course and its demands, which was incredibly helpful and appreciated.",
    "Every class is interesting and keeps you engaged Have to come everyday though",
    "very engaging and very thorough",
    "This course was very strong, mostly due to the outstanding lectures given in class. Professor Guinnane did a great job presenting the material and engaging students. There was a nice variety in the types of homework assignments, and all of them furthered student learning on the subject. I do not see any major way this class could be improved."

    "I would recommend this course. The first few weeks can be super dry, but a foundation was being built. At the end of the course, I can see that the really boring stuff that I was learning at the beginning ended up mattering. I came away from this course knowing a lot of little things that economic historians are sure on, but realized that the big questions still have not been answered.",
    "I would recommend it strongly to Econ students. Interesting material that was very well taught. Seems niche at first but is quite relevant for today. Decent amount of work though (3 papers, midterm , final, psets) but none take too much time.",
    "Yes! Especially if you're not too keen on mathematical psets. The psets in this class are bearable , and the essays are short.",
    "I absolutely adored this course--it was easily one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Guinnane is an incredible lecturer, and his modern insights and excellent sense of humor made the class truly enjoyable. Definitely take this course if you are looking for an engaging and historic application of economics. It will change the way you view economic phenomena as well as highlight the everyday implications of the modern economy and its connection to the past. TAKE IT!",
    "Yes, really great econ elective, especially if you're interested in development economics. Very interesting course materials and lecture is really great. Prof. Guinanne is intimidating initially but a really great teacher.",
    "10 out of 10 recommend to economic majors",
    "Highly recommended. Everything that I wanted American Economic History to be. Professor Guinnane comes off very intense (mandatory attendance in lecture), but the class is very worth it if you're interested in the Industrial Revolution and development. The class itself is all about England and the factors that promoted its industrialization, but Guinnane also does a good job of connecting historical lessons to broader economic themes. There's 5 psets and 3 papers, but the psets are pretty straightforward and the papers are only like 2 pages and are basicaly summarizing academic econ papers.",
    "Absolutely not. This was not an overly difficult course, but it was organized really poorly and really unconducive to learning. Lectures involved the professor walking in with a couple pages of notes, and talking at us about topics related to the Industrial Revolution in seemingly no particular order. He would jot down a couple phrases or graphs on the board and sometimes show us some pictures or maps. There are no powerpoints or class notes and the material was just presented in a completely chaotic way. The grading of the short essays seems completely random, and feedback isn't great. The professor also apparently doesn't like when people use \"big\" words, which doesn't make sense either. This course really didn't feel like a Yale quality course at all and I was quite disappointed.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Professor Guinnane is amazing, although he is real straight shooter and can be a little more strict than many professors. His lectures are really interesting and he uses examples from modern society to make points. I was initially concerned that the material in this class would be boring to learn about, but Professor Guinnane makes European Economic History very engaging and relevant. There is a fair bit of work, but the assignments are usually pretty useful."
