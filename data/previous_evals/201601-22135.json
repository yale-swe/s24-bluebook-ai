    "This course is a both a broad survey of history, visual art, and literature, and something much more deep, serious, and engaging. This course offers historical and thematic arcs for understanding the black female body, but it also pushes you to deconstruct the ways of knowing ingrained in how we perceive, analyze, or describe the visual or textual field."

I found this course to be a very useful space for thinking deeply about the relationship of culture to meaning and history."
