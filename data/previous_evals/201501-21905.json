    "Interesting material taught very accessibly!!!",
    "Good class!!",
    "Economics of innovation was a great course. You learn about a number of U.S. intellectual property tools (copyright, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, etc.), as well as some basic mathematical models to provide intuition.",
    "This is a great course for your senior seminar. Its pretty difficult and very mathy. Its like advanced micro. I hate writing essays though so this was great for me. its just 4 psets, a group presentation, and an in class mid term and final. Very manageable.",
    "This is the best senior Econ class at Yale. Take it!",
    "Great class! Really solid senior seminar - Professor Chalioti is a total sweetheart and fantastic professor, great course material, workload not too terrible. A lot of algebra on the psets but the midterm and final she prepared us really well for!",
    "Yes, take it! Probably the best senior seminar!!!",
    "Highly recommend as a senior Econ class. You learn a lot of important and relevant material.",
    "Yes, would recommend",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class. The professor is great and the material is interesting.",
    "Amazing class, amazing experience, if you can get in, take it. It may seem hard at first, but the teacher is awesome, and you'll thank yourself for taking it.",
    "ECON 410 is a perfect option for Economics seniors looking to meet their senior major requirements. Professor Chalioti cares about creating the best classroom experience possible for herself and her students and wants all of her students to succeed. The class is neither too difficult nor too work-intensive and the material is interesting. Highly recommend."
