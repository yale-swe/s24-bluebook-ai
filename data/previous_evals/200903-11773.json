    "If you are going abroad, I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student, as it informs you about the issues that it would be better for you to know about if you are going to France\/a Francophone country. Of course, even if you're not going abroad, I thought that this course was way more interesting than anything I could be doing in a regular literature course. We just talk about current events all day, and politics, and watch emissions about politics. Great stuff, far better than reading Baudelaire.",
    "The class covers a lot of topics concerning France and French culture, good overview",
    "It's a very interesting course which not only strengthens the students' French but also teaches them relevant and current information about France. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve his or her French in an interesting and discussion-inspiring environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. There was a lot of work but it was interesting and really developed my understanding of french culture as whole."
