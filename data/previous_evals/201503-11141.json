    "Introduction to Sound Studies provided an overview of the emerging field of sound studies. Each week, we were assigned a monograph plus several shorter texts (sometimes). Over the course of the semester, we were all asked to bring in texts that interested us to discuss with the class. I would definitely recommend the course. It was one of the most interesting I have ever taken."

    "Sound studies is an important field of research in both film studies and American studies. This course has provided me with the theoretical framework to discuss a whole new area of study. While I am not sure of my dissertation topic yet, the final paper for this course has allowed me to pursue an area that I am interested in studying further (and potentially considering for my dissertation)."
