    "I would recommend the class, just be prepared for a lot more theory than you might expect. If you put a lot into the class and do the readings you will get quite a bit out of it.",
    "I would recommend the course as an easy way to cover thematic issues in international politics and to read some important authors and texts, but but I am not sure I would talk the course up as too engaging or critical.",
    "The course offers a very broad introduction to diverse institutions which will offer new ways of thinking about the problems they face and stimulate ideas for further enquiries into their effectiveness."
