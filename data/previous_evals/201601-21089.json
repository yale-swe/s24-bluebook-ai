    "This was a great class!! The material may seem a little boring at first, but the second half of the class was amazing. I feel like I learned a lot of USEFUL things about security. The class covered crypto algorithms, but the most fun part was learning about the web and how security works on the internet. I found myself using many different tools that I had heard of before (e.g. digital certificates, Tor, browser add-ons), because now I understand how they work and what their purpose is. I really recommend this class to people interested in learning more about being protected against many kinds of security\/privacy problems in the digital world. Professor Syta was very helpful and she definitely cares about her students!",
    "!A: READ THIS. Really GREAT chill class for someone with MINIMAL programming experienceNOT FOR CS MAJOR credit. I'm not CS major. EXTREMELY INTERESTING TO LEARN....I knew nothing about encryption\/internet\/protocols\/. CONTENT: first half of the course before the best was most interesting, all on encryption algorithms. Second half was mixed: learning about internet protocols useful, but bunch of random memorization topics mixed in that was boring. PREREQS: intro to programmming, AP Comp Sci, or CS50. That's it. LECTURES: The first two weeks were pretty boring, which is why a lot of people left during shopping period. final class size was 20, so it was intimate. GLAD I STAYED. The Lectures were either very technical, with lots of diagrams and math on algorithms\/encryption (BEST PART). The lectures focused on definitions, definitions and MORE definitions + concepts were not. please revise course content with more technical content\/problems. needs work; often felt like social science class. PROFESSOR: very friendly and approachable. wants you to do well. but not very good at creating discussion.PROBLEM SETS: Extremely chill, almost no work at all, very infrequent. mix of some short programs ( 15 lines of code) plus definition\/concept type questions. The technical encryption math problems and short programming problems were **the best**. First midterm was EXCELLENT. Exactly what I expected, very straightforward and not difficult. CASE STUDY: I was confused why this was even assigned, but I'm glad I did it. in retrospect, caused me to learn a \"real world\" example in depth. FINAL EXAM: disappointing. focused almost entirely on memorized content. There was a question on what the different padlock symbols in Firefox mean (really?) definitely did worse because it was based so much on memorizing. Overall take itthere's NOTHING else comparable that is offered at Yale.",
    "This course will teach you everything you need to know to have a basic understanding of how information is secured. This may not sound super important, but IT IS! It affects everyone! It's your duty to be informed! And it's a well-taught, accessible lecture with very, very little work, so you have no excuse.",
    "I would definitely recommend CPSC 257 if the person really wants to know about information security because it touches base on a lot of subjects",
    "This is a good opportunity to have an overview of current security threats that you should watch out for, both as an user or as a software developer, without going in too deep on the technical side",
    "It's a nice 5th class (which is weird for CS). Interesting but not really challenging. Textbook is (unsurprisingly) pointless to buy. If you have a background in InfoSec, you should probably passit's very much an intro-level course, with predominantly writing-based problem sets.",
    "It's a cool class. The material is very interesting.",
    "Awesome course! Too bad the postdoc teaching it is leaving Yale as she's found a job elsewhere. The class really was just going through the excellent O'Reilly textbook, but seriously, when would you read a technical book for fun when in college? Only weaknesses were pacing - we spent way too much time on math at some points, such as elliptic curves - and practicality - it would have been INCREDIBLE if we could perform some of the exploits we learned about in labs but because we are on the Yale network that couldn't happen.",
    "Would recommend course to a student wanting to learn more about how online security works and how to better secure communication. It is a great elective more geared toward computer science students, especially if they are planning to go into security because the course covers encryption from primitive types to the ones used today. It is also a good elective in general because it is not too complex and could teach people a lot about being more cautious online with personal information.",
    "A fantastic overview of many cybersecurity issues in today's world with a strong look into all of their backgrounds and history. You're not going to come out of this class as some kind of Anonymous hacker but its definitely interesting to get a look at some of the things you could do to protect yourself starting now or how all of these data breaches keep happening. The class does get very technical at times but Syta is always there to help (the slides are usually put up for review), the readings are actually relevant, and sometimes things are easy to Google. The programming problem sets are not extensive as this class is truly for non-CS majors and CS majors alike and the TFs are usually well briefed. This was my favorite class this semester and I hope the CS department continues to expand into new electives like this that actually count towards the major."
