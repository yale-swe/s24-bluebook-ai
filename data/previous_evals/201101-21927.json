   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a fairly fun and easy way to get a science credit.",
    "Take it if you need a science class and dont want to develop ulcers while trying to compete with premeds. It's really easy to take along side a heavy course load, and they try to help you through all of the topics to make sure that you understand them.",
    "This course wasn't as painfulas it might have been. It doesn't hurt to be interested, I guess. Lecturers were decent and serious about conveying hard science in a manageable way - a bit uneven though.",
    "Truly a science gut, I highly recommend taking it.",
    "Great easy science credit. The three exams spread out over the semester mean you don't have to try to remember everything at once and the paper is easy once you pick a topic.",
    "Lots of class time and mandatory section, but an easy science credit...",
    "This is a relatively easy science credit--you basically never have to go to class and can get an A-\/A. The lectures are pretty boring.",
    "Probably wouldn't recommend taking it. There are more interesting science credits, but this one is pretty easy.",
    "Yes, it offers important information on important topics in today's world",
    "More about biology than the issues, but good nonetheless.",
    "I recommend it if you're looking for a science credit out of desperation.",
    "Yes, if they were looking for a science credit or interested in Biology.",
    "Sure --it's not too hard of a science credit, but make sure Colleen is your TA (or just go to her section anyway if you can't get her as your TA). She explains everything really well and honestly I felt like my section with her was more useful than class.",
    "This is a GREAT science credit. You really learn a lot about important issues that face our society today and are related to biology and science. I highly recommend the course to everyone. At the same time the workload is very manageable and reasonable. The course is truly excellent - science and non-science majors alike should take it!",
    "Would definitely recommend. Is more of a top-down approach to biology rather thanan all encompassing survey of biology. Mostly focus on the science behind particularly interesting and relevant issues like cancer, stem cell, gmos etc. Not overly detailed and a solid science for those of us less scientifically inclined.",
    "Yes if you need a science class. Dont actually need to go to class.",
    "A good science course for someone who needs the SC credit. I actually learned interesting things and my gpa didn't take a hit.",
    "This is an easy science credit that teaches you about important issues. Don't expect to be learn deep science or to be very challenged, but it's fun. AP Bio level.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is looking for a science credit and who is interested in bio. I like biology so I thought the material we covered was very interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if you don't have a background in science or biology. It is structured in a way that allows critical thinking, argumentative writing, and debate to be applied to scientific concepts and ethical issues.",
    "Perfect easy science course. It requires a lot of class time and you need to study a lot before the exams, but the course is straight forward and as long as you study you can do really well",
    "If you're looking for a manageable science class to fulfill the Sc credit, take this course. Don't be turned off by the fact that it meets three times a week. In theory you could probably go zero times a week and still be able to do well on the tests.",
    "Yes. Good and interesting way to get a science credit.",
    "Very informative.",
    "It is an easy way to get a science credit and interesting if you are into current issues and topics. I would especially recommend it if you are interested in debate or politics because it gives you the background information on current hot buttons issues such as stem cell research.",
    "I would recommend it. you actually learn something and everything lectured on is applicable to the real-world. great for non-majors, not much work. three tests and one 7-8 page research paper",
    "nah.it's not as easy as it seems at first.",
    "Take this class if you really, really, need a science credit and don't want to take any classes that are math related. But if you want to take a biology for your science credit I STRONGLY suggest trying to get into the seminars or smaller lectures. MCDB 105 is honestly just so boring. Breaker's alright, but Soll and Miranker's lectures are tedious. Plus the class seems to have no overall structure, it's just a random assortment of recent scientific advances in biology - which can be interesting if presented well, which they were not in this class. It's not very hard though.",
    "Only take it if you need a science credit or if you are going into MB&B",
    "Overall this was an interesting course that went beyond subjects covered in AP Biology. I enjoyed the fact that this class went just beyond the science and posed questions about ethics and future implications. This was definitely a manageable course, especially if you have a high school background in biology. The grading was fairly dispersed and the material was engaging. I'd recommend this course to anyone who needs to get their science credit out of the way; however, if you are a person who is interested in science but isn't majoring in a science, I recommend also looking into other courses if you are more serious about the material you want to learn.",
    "Fairly easy to get a good grade in, if you study. And voila! Science credit.",
    "Good science credit, dont underestimate the work. Lots of slides to memorize for each exam, but otherwise very straightforward.",
    "This is not a bad class for the science requirement. There are parts of it that are pretty boring, but there are also interesting subjects in science explored by the professors. All of the people who teach the class are actually quite good (the lecturers), though they were occasionally held back by the structure of the class which encouraged them to give vague, unsatisfying explanations.It's certainly not as dull as you might think it would be, and it is really pretty easy to do well--just study starting 2 days before the test, and you won't have to do any other work for the class at all, except write the paper.",
    "For a science credit go for it.",
    "There are better science credits so try to shop around! The three professor format isn't great because their teaching styles tend to be incredibly different. While this course promises to delve into interesting issues, some of the material can be really dry. Before you take this course you should really look into the syllabus to get a picture of what they're going to discuss.",
    "Maybe not, choose another science credit!"
