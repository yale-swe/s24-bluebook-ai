    "A course that moves through Japanese history since 1970, the novels and short stories are unlike others in the realm of literature. The texts were some of the best I have read and thoroughly enjoyed. Yes, there will be strong themes involving sex and sexuality that may appear inappropriate, but the overall analysis of the texts is rewarding. Professor Treat has great anecdotes to tell, based on both personal experiences and publications. Unlike other classes, Treat will sit with you and delve into a text trying to understand it with you. Occasional moments of silence - discussion is what you make it to be. Try something new. The workload consists of 2 papers. However, grading is reflective of efforts, so do not expect it to be easy. Takethe class Credit\/D if you're simply interested or for a grade. Either way, it's well worth it and will remain a class to remember in my Yale experience.",
    "The books were not as great as I expected, but class was usually interesting and VERY relaxed. There is really no reason to do all the readings since participation is extra credit and you only have to write 2 8page papers for the grade, which is probably why discussion was a little slow sometimes. Do the reading. I regret not doing all of the reading.What I liked most about this class was the fact that it was so different from any other Lit or English course. Instead of close readings, Professor Treat talked a lot about the history and social context of the books, which means you'll learn a lot about Japan. Also, instead of asking specific literary interpretation questions during seminar, Professor Treat asks for general reactions from anyone who feels like speaking up. As a result, discussion is natural, pleasant, and stress free.The workload is extremely light- two 8 page papers on anything you want to write about. Class participation is extra credit and there are no reading responses.",
    "JAPN 251 covers a great amount of Japanese \"culture\"-- I say \"culture\" with the quotations because as professor Treat emphasizes, the study of literature is not really a direct reflection of Japanese society. Professor Treat has a rare gift for speaking frankly and cutting through political correctness as he shares his opinions about much of Japan, the world, and its writings.The work tends to be pretty manageable. Many classes tend to be reading short stories for a single class, although a handful of weeks may have a much larger reading assignment of a novel per week.I would have hoped discussion could be a little more guided--if the day to day discussion were given something a little more structured like specific questions to prepare responses to based on the reading, would help facilitate discussion. As it is, Professor Treat gives sweeping introductions to the authors and some of the big ideas they play with in their novels, and the discussion goes from there, but some of the more challenging novels left me feeling like I didn't entirely understand what was going on.Altogether though, a very interesting course I would look forward to each week.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. The discussion is a bit dull and can seem repetitive most of the time.",
    "You read incredibly interesting novels and stories that if nothing else will give you interesting things to tell your friends about. You should absolutely take it.if you're at all interested in Japan and reading. Although Prof Treat will say that the class is not about Japanese culture, you can still glean a lot about contemporary Japan from these stories. Treat knows everyone in the (apparently small) world of JLit and by the end of the course you'll think he knows everything too."
