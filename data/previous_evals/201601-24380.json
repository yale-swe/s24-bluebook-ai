    "Yes. It is a good survey and an opportunity to have real discussions with other people interested in the material.",
    "Yes, definitely. This is one of the best courses I've taken with senior fellows. The readings are also very interesting.",
    "Incredible course. Learned an amazing amount from Professor Ford. His understanding of Arab politics goes beyond anything you'll learn in a book or any other course on the Middle East and North Africa at Yale. Also Ford is just a badass all around. Take it.",
    "Really good overview of Arab politics, good blend of history + present. I liked that we had a lot of flexibility in terms of assignments - it really allows you to go deep on topics you're interested in.",
    "The class makes you think a lot, especially tying together historical events and themes. Don't take it unless you're willing to do a lot of reading."
