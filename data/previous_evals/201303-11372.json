    "Unless you have to for the BME major, don't take this class. Fahmy is a very disorganized professor and his lectures are difficult to follow. The exams and psets border on the ridiculous in what they ask you to find.",
    "I enjoyed the course and felt that the material was presented in a way that was accessible and not too challenging. However, there were some clear issues in the course's organization. Due dates and exam dates were frequently changed, which in the end actually benefited my personal schedule, but I know many students were inconvenienced by this. Unfortunately, the professor's frequent lateness to class meant that we often didn't get started on time and ended up rushing through the material. Especially in the beginning, math-heavy part of the course, lectures were sometimes disorganized with the professor making frequent mistakes on the board, which made it hard to follow. I have taken physics, multivariable and Chem 115, all math-based courses here at Yale, and never experienced a similar situation. That said, I did appreciate the professor's enthusiasm and kindness, and I could tell that he really did care about the course but maybe he just has an incredibly demanding schedule outside of teaching. You'll only be taking this if you need it for the BME major; I really wouldn't suggest it to anyone if it's not a requirement.",
    "It's a required class for the major - I wouldn't recommend it otherwise, but if you have to take it, there's nothing you can really do about it.",
    "A requirement for BME, so if you're looking at this class you most likely have to take it. Its a pretty decent introduction into biotransport, but Professor Fahmy is not the best lecturer. However, the tests are open note and the end of the semester project is actually super fun! It's nice to be able to apply concepts learned to a \"real world\" situation, and it also gets you thinking about research in a very realistic way.",
    "Oh my lanta, let me tell you a story. Let me tell you a story about one of the most frustrating classes you'll ever even think about taking. It had so much potential, really, it did. You've probably learned about diffusion and enzyme kinetics in general chemistry or in high school, but this class is supposed to be more in-depth. And it was.....after you sifted through a seemingly never-ending cloud of confusion. The lectures were horrendously organized and the grading scheme was horrendous. There was a massive group project at the end of the semester that counted for 40% of our final grade. It was really cool working on it with two other people. I got really good at reading scientific papers and actually understanding their content. But, and this is a massive but: 20% of the project was from peer review. Literally the people sitting next to you were the people determining 20% of your grade. And the rubric, oh my lord - it was equally as confusing as the lectures.TL;DR - Don't take it if Professor Fahmy is teaching it. Everyone was frustrated for the first two and a half months of this class. The group project, while enjoyable, was horribly organized and due during finals period. For your sanity, don't take this class if it's being taught by Fahmy. Did mention there was no textbook and he never uploaded pdfs on time? I pray that Miller-Jensen teaches it next year.",
    "A course that really came together at the end. It's tricky to stay focused through all the separate information at the beginning of the course, but the synthesis into biophysical methods and the final project is worth it.",
    "Obviously, if you are a BME major you have to take this class. Don't give up on it-- it may seem pointless halfway thru the semester, but it gets better. Don't worry about grading-- it's a bit convoluted.",
    "It was a very disorganized class. Professor Fahmy is extremely nice, and the grading was pretty generous, but many times it felt like the class wasn't clear at all. There was a lot of cool stuff about experimental methods in the middle. The final project was graded by peers, so that made people kind of uncomfortable. Take the class if you have to.",
    "A very good biomedical engineering course. The content covered is very relevant. The course was not as organized as it could have been, especially during the first several weeks. The highlight of this class is the final projects. It was really challenging working on a project proposal with other students and forced us to come up with innovative ideas. It was also really fun listening to the other projects.The stuff you learn in this course is very relevant. Not too much homework and the tests are pretty straightforward.",
    "Wonderful subject material, horrible execution. This class was a lesson in frustration. Classes moved at a glacial pace and still managed to be confusing. The homework was fine. The tests questions were easy, if one could figure out what the question was asking. The project was so much fun to work on but the grading and how it was handled by the professor was aggravating. I would not recommend the class as I took it which is sad because it was stuff I was excited to learn. Most people taking it are BME majors because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s required so I hope it is better in the future.",
    "It's a very chill class if Fahmy teaches it, but make sure you prepare well for the final project. Pick people who do things ahead of time to be in your group. Slackers and procrastinators will cause much frustration and will affect quality of your final project\/grade. Oh, the middle homeworks are challenging; try them early and go to office hours for help.",
    "BENG 351 is a class you have to take if you are BME. Interesting material presented by a very disorganised professor. And that makes the class very frustrating. Take it if you must. Be sure to take good notes in class and to stay on top of the material, otherwise you will not get anything out of it. The team project sucks. Try to work with people who you can forgive when 40% of your grade goes to the dogs.",
    "You will take this course because you are a BME major. Good luck.",
    "Take the class, it's good and quite fun at times. Fahmy can be absentminded but you will come to like him after some time!",
    "This was the most frustrating course I have ever taken. There were so many mistakes made during lecture that our TAs told us to check everything with Wikipedia since there was no textbook either. Grading was maddeningly subjective. Despite interesting material, it is hard to be excited about such a poorly organized class."
