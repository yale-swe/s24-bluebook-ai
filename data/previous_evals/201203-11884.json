   "comments": [
    "Do it. The class is fun and you'll become a better writer in Spanish.",
    "Definitely, don't be scared by the amount of reading and writing in this course. You really walk out of it knowing Spanish to a greater degree and your writing skills really improve. Plus, Professor Byrne is just all around really great and the class is really interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is truly interested in developing their written Spanish and is not afraid of writing A LOT (more than in english 114 or english 120). You will write several papers, the longest of which is 10 pages. It can be challenging, especially since you are limited to writing on only one short story. If you are not used to analyzing small works and writing lots about them, you will definitely gain that skill from this course. You also get some degree of improvement in spoken Spanish too. There were only 9 people or so in our class, so spending 3 hours a week together only speaking Spanish was great for us. The worst part about the class, however, is the time slot. It can be really hard to stay focused in a Spanish class titled \"Composition and Analysis\" when it starts at 4:00pm and is starting to get dark outside.",
    "The readings are great, and the teacher is great. However, if this sort of subject matter doesn't interest you - don't take it. It's a lot of in depth analysis of the short stories you read. The conceptual analysis is very interesting, but the analysis of the composition and grammar of the stories can get dry.",
    "You will read various short stories in SPAN 250 and write essays about any topic you want based on these stories. The essays become longer progressively from one page responses to a ten page paper. In class, Prof. Byrne will discuss common mistakes in writing or steps to improve Spanish writing and the reading assigned. The reading assigned is very short but interesting. Prof. Byrne will give back graded papers with a chance at revision. Papers are graded carefully and proper use of the Spanish language seemed to be more valued than content. I wouldn't recommend students to take this course.",
    "This is a good class to take to improve your Spanish academic writing (if you plan on going abroad for instance). You feel your writing improve and the learning is gradual so it's not overwhelming.",
    "Yes! But only if you can speak and read Spanish fluently. This course will help you not only become familiar with major Spanish works but also appreciate them.",
    "I took 250 because I had taken Conversational but did not feel ready to take a hardcore literature class, and this class was just right. Profe Byrne is great, the syllabus is fun, and your writing will improve significantly. At times, the grading did seem a little harsh (a few grammar mistakes = B+\/A-), but that's just to make sure you work hard and really concentrate."
