    "A historical and literary approach to 17th-c. theatre. Not exactly an introductory course to the 17th century: some background in this area is helpful, I think. Workload heavier than any other class I've taken in the French department (30-40 pages written in French over the course of the semester for weekly response papersonly 10% of gradein addition to 20-page final paper). Response papers a great exercise in writing, but time consuming if taken seriously. (I know two or three students who decided not to take the course because of the workload.)"

    "Course fulfilled a distribution requirement. The fact that the course focused on theatre was also very useful, since few other classes in the department focus on this genre (in my experience). The course did not relate directly to my dissertation research."
