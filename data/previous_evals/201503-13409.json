   "comments": [
    "This was an incredible course. All of the information was presented in a comprehensible and interesting manner and the coursework was extremely helpful for learning how to critique primary literature and how to conduct a systematic review.",
    "It was great! There were a lot of topics covered that really kept my interest.",
    "The course was great in teaching us more about obesity prevention interventions.",
    "Strengths: - Broad overview of current field of obesity and lifestyle interventions - important perspective to have. - Walks through how to write a systematic review, over the course of the semester. Very good that the sections are spread out - gives time to work iteratively on the product and get feedback through. - Allows students to go deep on a specific topic that they're interested in. - A few visiting lectures (on bariatric surgery and lifestyle intervention at Yale) - helpful to get perspectives from the field. Weaknesses\/Improvements - More appreciation of and attention to systemic\/policy structures that create obesogenic environments could be helpful.",
    "This class was great! A variety of topics important to the topic were covered. It provides a good highlight of the material covered without completely glossing over topics. Favorite class material: Obesity treatment (08\/22), physical activity 10\/13), Diet (10\/20) and Childhood\/Adolescent obesity and lifestyle interventions (10\/27)",
    "Great class, gives you a lot of experience writing a systematic review which i really enjoyed. It would have been nice to have a few more guest lecturers.",
    "I think the course could be strengthened by having more guest speakers in the class. A major strength that the class already has is that Professor Irwin consistently mentions internship opportunities in class. Personally, I felt that was the best part of the class.",
    "I really liked the course structure, the biggest strength is that the way the assignments are set up you have to do work regularly which helps you learn the most and also at the end there was no stress about the final paper as 80% of the work was already done (given that you did it) small classroom size allowed for great discussion and participation",
    "I enjoyed it and benefited from it tremendously and I am now armed with the skill of knowing how to write a systematic review from start to finish. I love the way the course assignments were broken down so we were able to focus on one section at a time and then get feedback.",
    "Very insightful and informative"

    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Dr. Irwin is a great professor who provides prompt feedback to students.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Strengths: - Supportive, likable personality. - Engaging lecturer - wrapped in personal stories, which were fun to hear. - Chose a good range of concepts to cover in the course. Weaknesses\/Improvements: - More direction on how to present a systematic review (what to definitely include in the powerpoint) would be helpful for those who have never done that before. - More class participation could be encouraged! Missed opportunity with such a small class to hear what peoples' backgrounds were, why they were interested in the course, what expertise or experience they could bring to the conversation. It seemed like a lot of students had work experience in the field and I would have been interested to learn more about what lessons they had learned.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Strengths: Very approachable, very knowledgeable. Provides feedback in a very timely manner. Weaknesses: NONE!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Irwin is fantastic, she is very passionate about what she does and about the course material.

    "This is a great course in teaching you how to write a systematic review and the process of doing so (researching literature databases, etc.).",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. Tangible skill learned from course: how to write a systematic review Knowledge gained from course: Broad perspectives on obesity epidemic and ways that society as a whole should respond.",
    "This is a great class to take if you are interested in learning about obesity and a variety of topics within this field. It is also a great way to learn how to carry out a systematic review.",

    "Take the class! It was the best class I took all semester!",
    "Will be very helpful for students looking to better understand the obesity epidemic and approaches to solving the issue from a public health standpoint."
