    "TAKE THIS COURSE! IT'S PHENOMENAL!",
    "THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE YALE COURSE YET! Seriously, this course is FANTASTIC. Absolutely fantastic! Professor Kavanagh is GREAT; he is so knowledgeable and SUCH a wonderful discussionleader, and he is also super friendly, super approachable, and very accessible. Also, the fact that it's a small seminar is really great; you really get to know everyone else in your class and thus discussions just keep getting better and better as the semester goes on. This course has exposed me to some of the best works of both literature and film that I think I will ever study in my entire academic career, AND I've had the best academic discussions of my life in this course. I always looked forward to this class every Monday and Wednesday, and come Wednesday afternoon I was always sad that I would have to wait such a long time to go back. Seriously, the discussions were so, so, so interesting, and SO much fun! If I could continue to take this course every single semester, I would! THAT'S how fascinating and wonderful it is!!!",
    "Lots of reading and good discussions. An excellent course for those interested in the themes of 18th century France.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you are at all interested in French, history, or philosophy. Great format, great readings, and great wealth of information.",
    "French Enlightenment is a structured look at what people and great thinkers of 18th century France thought and wished to become. You'll enjoy the philosophy, the literature, and art taught in this class, and you will be able to find many connections to the modern world. The professor is great! He's incredibly spirited and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this class to anyone, especially to French language students.",
    "The freshman seminar on the French Enlightenment introduces students to the philosophy of the era, along with a little bit of the historical background. You read many works from the period, as well as watch some movies on the French Enlightenment. The course is a lot of reading, along with a shorter essay, an in-class mid-term, a presentation, and a final paper. All of the reading was interesting, and the class discussion is very reflective of the reading, makingit particularly worth your while. Professor Kavanagh is a great instructor and a true expert in his field.",
    "Fantastic course. The reading list is varied; so many great, interesting works. The course is a mash-up of history, literature, philosophy and political science. The point of the course is not to learn a bunch of facts about the French Enlightenment to reel off on a test. Rather, you get a sense of the period, and all of its nuances. You read some very famous works and other much less known ones. Workload is not too heavy and Professor Kavanagh is great. For humanities students I cannot recommend this course highly enough.",
    "I highly recommend this course for any student even vaguely interested in French studies\/literature. The material for this course includes the foremost works of the French canon, yet are rarely taught. This course will give you a more nuanced understanding of the French Enlightenment, and you will be able to see its profound range of implications, from the Revolution until today."
