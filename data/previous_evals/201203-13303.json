    "What a great class. Someone once said \"to be tired of Hobbes is to be tired of thinking\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's true. If you have any interest in understanding the history of political thought or the nature of politics in general, Hobbes is a thinker you have no choice but to reckon with. As for the teacher, Smith is very good, though he chooses fairly eccentric essay topics. He leads discussions well and assigns (or at least assigned for this class) extremely reasonable chunks of reading per class.",
    "Very interesting class, definitely changed a whole lot my understanding on Hobbes. Smith is a good discussion moderator.",
    "Definitely take it! But know you need to keep up with the reading to really get something out of the experience.",
    "Hobbes is the greatest political philosopher in the Anglo-American tradition, and it would behoove you to carefully read his works.",
    "good! Hobbes is much much more interesting than you think and Smith is always good in class. discussion was good but not great.",
    "This seminar was a rewarding investigation of a central figure in the tradition of Western political thought. Studying Hobbes is rewarding for its own sake, but also because it provides a useful framework for the work you'll do in other classes. That said, the seminar was at least 5-10 people too large, and Prof. Smith's feedback on the first paper (of two, 10-12 pages each) seemed hurried and wasn't so helpful.",
    "Highly recommended! These texts are really central, and it gives you a good hold on a really important figure in political philosophy.",
    "The Political Philosophy of Hobbes focuses for most of the course on the main works of Thomas Hobbes: De Cive, Leviathan, Behemoth. The last few weeks of the course offered readings of critical work on Hobbes, from Contemporaries like Clarendon and Bramhall, to modern political philosophers like Strauss and Schmitt. The reading is lengthy every week, but manageable, and the essays by critics are particularly engaging. The in-class discussion is interesting. I recommend this class for anyone with a preliminary experience with Thomas Hobbes or with early political philosophy who is seeking a more thorough study of this interesting historical thinker.",
    "This class is an in-depth study of Hobbes's political theory, centered primarily on his works Leviathan, De Cive, and Behemoth. Given that Hobbes was one of the best political philosophers OF ALL TIME--OF ALL TIME--reading his core works is tremendously valuable and rewarding. Professor Smith does a greatjob of leading discussion and asks students challenging questions. The work is not too onerous and Smith is a fair grader. I strongly recommend this class for students who are interested in political philosophy.",
    "Political Philosophy of Hobbes was a challenging class - not so much due to the amount of material, but rather the difficulty of it. Nonetheless, if you are at all interested in social or political thought, this class is rewarding and incredibly interesting.",
    "This was a fantastic class. If it is ever offered again, I would strongly urge those interested in political philosophy to take it. Modern politics, whether we like it or not, have deeply Hobbesian elements and, perhaps, foundations. The rich and thorough understanding of Hobbes that this course offers not only allows one to understand one of the most profound and important figures in the history of Western thought, but allows one to better understand contemporary politics and philosophy.The balance struck between primary source readings of Hobbes and readings of his contemporary and later critics and analysts was wonderful.Smith, as you may know, is a little whacky, but great. He is especially good at talking over ideas one-on-one. Don't expect a small seminar, however; for this class, at least, he let in everyone who applied, resulting in a cumbersome and unwieldy class size."
