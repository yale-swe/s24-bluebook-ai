    "Definitely take it if you can get in! It's a lot of work, but you will end up looking at the whole world differently. Walks to class will become much more interesting. You will develop your own artistic style that you never knew you had. I had absolutely no background in photography or art and gained so much from this course.",
    "The class provides a perfect introduction to the field of digital photography. It is seriously worth taking for anyone pursuing visual art.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are willing to put a lot of time and effort into the projects. The more you can invest, the more you'll get out of it.",
    "This is a wonderful class for students that are fully dedicated and willing to be challenged.",
    "A lot of work but worth it if you're into it",
    "I recommend Intro to Digital Photography. It is a great mix of learning practical photography skills and studying art. It is a little bit demanding in terms of how much shooting is required per week. Sometimes 500 photos are due. I definitely learned things I can use in the future and was opened up to a new art form."
