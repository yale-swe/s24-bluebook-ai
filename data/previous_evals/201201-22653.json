    "Profesora Lomask is wonderful! I decided to take Spanish solely to fulfill the language requirement, but in taking this course, I've really begun to appreciate the fact that I'm learning the language. Class was always engaging, fun, and interesting. Profesora Lomask was approachable, friendly, and an excellent instructor.",
    "If you took spanish L1, you should probably take L2.",
    "Yes!",
    "Spanish 120 teaches elementary Spanish - you'll learn a lot more vocabulary, and most tenses aside from pluperfect, conditional, and possibly a few others. I felt I learned more in Spanish 120 than in Spanish 110. I would recommend it to a student who has taken a little bit of Spanish, or to anyone who has taken L1.",
    "Learn a lot in a short period of time, but very time consuming in homework and memorization.",
    "Spanish 120 was a great class and I fully recommend it. The tests are a bit more difficult that Spanish 110.",
    "If you want to take Spanish, definitely go for Laurie - she is amazing.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it as an extra class because it is so time consuming and requires work every night. However, most people take it because they need it to go toward their distributional credit. I found it to be surprisingly fun, so as long as you are up for the extra work load, it may be beneficial and fun."
