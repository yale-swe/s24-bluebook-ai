   "comments": [
    "It's a really interesting course. If you like sculpture and have already taken AP Art History, I would certainly recommend skipping the Introductory course and taking this one, especially if you are interested in the technical aspects.",
    "Yes - if you love this time period, especially Michelangelo and Bernini, you can't not enjoy it.",
    "Very interesting class. Tests are my very difficult as long as you take good notes in lecture. The papers are really straight forward and interested, and I think you're bound to learn a ton about the renaissance and art history in general. I loved this course.",
    "If you are interested in Italian culture, or art at all, this class gives a lot of insight. Because it is so specific, you learn a great deal, and it is not just about memorizing facts. By the time you get to the midterm and final, and you have paid attention in classes, you don't need to study very much because it was taught so well. I would definitely recommend it."
