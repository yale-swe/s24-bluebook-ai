   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was excellent. Prof Summers knows his stuff and uses his experience to go above and beyond the subject material. A big plus for this course was all of the great reading that we had. Most of the books we had to read for class gave greater perspectives on several diseases and were a great read overall! The one knock I would say is that the class is only as good as the response from the class. The class functions better as a conversation, not as a lecture. If no one speaks about the subject that day, then the class may seem a bit dry. I would HIGHLY recommend this course to other students (regardless if they want to study medicine\/disease or not)!!",
    "Very chill class. Keep in mind, this is a humanities class. We didn't end up learning a whole lot about global epidemics - just a few big name ones, but we ended up analyzing epidemics in literature a lot. We delved into the biology behind epidemics a bit, and a little about public health, but not as much as I expected.",
    "Very low key freshman seminar. Interesting topics covered, but nothing you couldn't learn from reading on your own. Professor Summers was really the main strength of the course. Such a cool guy!",
    "I would summarize it as a class with a lot of reading (the workload was hard to keep up with some weeks), and with discussion that is completely irrelevant to the readings completed. On paper, this seems like a great course for a wide range of students - those considering the pre-med track, those interested in public and global health, those interested in reading historical literature and those who want to participate in stimulating discussions. However, the class doesn't live up to what it seems like on paper. Readings, while interesting, are pointless because they aren't discussed in class and students are never really shown the important connections between historical readings. Discussion is far from stimulating, mostly because class time is more so spent listening to the professor lecture.For these reasons, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. I think a lot of freshmen are convinced that they have to try a freshman seminar because they're so hyped up in reputation, but this one is simply not worth it when freshmen are only allowed to take up to 4.5 credits their first semester.",
    "I would recommend to anyone who wants a chill seminar class.",
    "Epidemics in Global Perspectives provides a great exposure to understanding various epidemics throughout human history and understand the concept of an epidemic. It was a valuable learning experience, and I genuinely looked forward to class and discussion as Professor Summer is also very very knowledgable and brings many new points to be examined.",
    "Epidemics in a Global Perspective was my favorite course this semester. The class has little workload aside from readings, but these readings can be long. You can get by in this class without reading, but you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get anything out of the class. If you do choose to do the readings, you will learn a lot and have much better group discussions. Professor Summers is a great, funny professor with extensive knowledge on the subject. An overall fun course that teaches you about multiple different epidemics in history. I would recommend the course to anybody that is interested in epidemiology or looking for an interesting freshman seminar with not too much homework.",
    "This is the perfect freshman seminar. There only work is doing the reading before each class. A decent amount of material to cover, but definitely manageable as long as you plan out your time. Just two papers, one is five pages on a given topic about epidemics, one is 3000 words (10-11 pages) talking about your favorite epidemic (literally, you can talk about anything from the epidemic of obesity to the history of epidemics in Ancient Greece).Bill is an awesome guy. He's dedicated to the class and is happy to tell stories about whatever comes to his mind as we discuss the books. He even had us do little skits for different stories based on the Decameron. And it pretty much had nothing to do with epidemics and was just so we \"got a feel for the time period of the Plague.\" Those were a ton of fun.I'm really glad I took this course. Even if you don't get picked on the lottery, just go to the first class and get on the waiting list. I got in eventually that way.Take this class, and you'll start your freshman year out strong.",
    "I thought HUMS 076 was a great overview of how diseases have been a driving force throughout history. The material is interesting, and Professor Summers (Bill) is an incredibly intelligent professor who is really well-renowned in his field. I really appreciated that we were also able to analyze perspectives of disease from a literary as well as historical standpoint, as it added a lot of texture to class discussions. Most of the people in the class were either Pre-Med or planning to major in History of Science and Medicine, but I took the course with no concrete interest in the field, and I now am seriously considering going into Public\/Global Health and Epidemiology. There is a lot of reading at times, but you could usually get by without having done all of it (or even any of it), and there are only two papers (a 5-6 page midterm paper and a longer research paper as the final), so the workload is fairly light. Bill is a great person, is really approachable outside of class (I once met with him in Bass Cafe to talk about my final paper), and does a lot of things to make sure that the class is engaging and interesting (for example, we had a \"scavenger hunt\" in Sterling Library and took a class field trip to New York one weekend, which was a great class bonding experience). I would highly, highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to explore a really interesting subject which is highly applicable to today's society.",
    "Epidemics in Global Perspective was a fun class. Professor Summers is cool and relaxed, so the overall experience is definitely a positive one that allows students interested in disease to learn more while creating bonds with classmates. Students often had the liberty to do as they wished on projects, which gives them great freedom of expression in his class.",
    "The mos enjoyable course I have taken. Strongly recommended.",
    "This is a good class, but not a great one. We looked at plague, smallpox, Spanish flu, and AIDS in depth, and, less thoroughly, TB, malaria, and dengue. The focus of the class is on how these biological phenomena played out within the context of society.There is reading for this class almost every day, ranging from about 10 pages to 200. A lot of people didn't do all the reading and you can definitely get by that way, but I would recommend not taking this class if you aren't prepared to do a lot of reading for it sometimes. The readings are the meat of the class, and if you don't do them you're really missing out. In addition to the readings, there is a small non-graded assignment in the beginning, a midterm paper (which was ungraded), and a final research paper.This class did not manage to be \"great\" because during class conversation was often forced and dull. This was partly because we were trying to discuss reading that a lot of people hadn't done, but also because Prof Summers is not an excellent discussion leader. Don't get me wrong though - he's a great person, incredibly knowledgeable about a wide range of subjects and friendly and open as well."
