   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the commercialization and the power relations in the culture industry",
    "I learned more about the behaviors and actions of the pop culture industry which is where I intend on obtaining a professional career.",
    "This class taught me how to think critically about everyday issues we have in a society that is constantly changing with advancement of technology and pop culture.",
    "This course dually teaches students to understand art through sociology and sociology through art with modern examples and classic theory.",
    "I continued my foray into learning about cultural sociology, and learned how to intellectualise all of the artefacts and cultural forms we take for granted.",
    "I have learned to think more reflectively on the concept and purpose of artwork and popular culture in general, not just in the United States, but elsewhere that features the same phenomena. While this was not an art class, I do feel that I can speak of art in a more knowledgeable way, not in regard to its aesthetic appeal but rather in how it appeals to society.",
    "This course provides a unique opportunity to look at art and culture, both \"high art\" and popular culture, both by looking at the historical, social context which produced it and through the formal characteristics of the cultural artifacts themselves. I gained insight into how to combine formal analysis with historical thinking, grounding ideas about art in the realities of social worlds.",
    "I see myself thinking about my field (not sociology) in an entirely nuanced way. I also feel I have a library of resources to refer to for my future work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "For a good part of the semester the readings felt repetitive, which led to a lack of nuanced discussion in the classroom. I personally found the research papers much more intellectually stimulating than the theoretical ones and would appreciate more of them.",
    "The class is terrific, highly interactive and rewarding",
    "I definitely learned a lot in this course. However, some of the reading assigned for each week was burdensome",
    "The class had very interesting readings that were set up in such a way that allowed you to develop your knowledge over the period of the course, drawing on previous readings in the process through a chronological order.",
    "This course is always evolving. Prof. Eyerman's trust in his students to bring their gifts and talents to the course creates the perfect balance of structure and creativity! NOTHING to improve!",
    "This course was amazing!",
    "I felt sometimes the readings were a bit long in the sense that many important topics were assigned, but not all could be covered. I generally enjoyed how the class was run by student conversation, although I would have appreciated a little more structure every now and then to fuel the discussion.",
    "The readings for this class are wide-ranging but very cohesive, and almost all works that I was excited and grateful to read. I gained a lot from the readings and the fact that Professor Eyerman encouraged reflection on them through weekly reading responses. Professor Eyerman is so knowledgable and thoughtful. As with any seminar, the quality of discussion sometimes depends a lot on the engagement and interests of the people in the course, so I would have liked the seminar to be a bit smaller to facilitate discussion.",
    "The class structure was one of the best I've had at Yale. I particularly liked that almost any topic could be discussed in class. Students often drew from their past experiences which really made the discussion insightful and passionate. Its hard to think of a weakness of the course. Perhaps I didn't like that so many students used laptops. I found it distracting and that it inhibited discussion."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class if you are interested in convoluted theory. Otherwise you might find yourself unable to engage in class discussion on a deep level.",
    "Anyone interested in sociology, art, culture, film, music, and commerce should take this",
    "If you are looking for a positive learning experience and interested in the pop culture industry, this is a good class to take. Professor Eyerman is very good at leading a seminar and extremely knowledgeable. Be prepared to do a lot of reading.",
    "As a pre-med student, this was my extra fifth class fulfilling my social science requirement and I am so happy that I took it. Professor Eyerman is absolutely the best and really engages in the class. The discussions are interesting and I learnt alot about culture and different types of art forms we are surrounded by today, examining them in a critical way.",
    "Yes, the opportunity to learn from a professor like Prof. Eyerman on a topic that is so relatable and formative of one's worldview is a MUST for any Yale Student.",
    "The material is amazing and Professor Eyerman is brilliant.",
    "I did enjoy the class, although I found it difficult to engage sometimes. I have found that after taking this course, I have learned to think more reflectively on the concept and purpose of artwork and popular culture in general.",
    "This is a great course that dabbles in both social theory and general news concerning popular culture and there is no need to have much social science experience. Ron does a great job of facilitating discussion; his classes always are enjoyable because of the student engagement he promotes.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in culture, which is all around us, then this course provides a strong theoretical grounding to examine culture rigorously and critically. Professor Eyerman is wonderful, and the structure of assignments allows you to focus on your specific interests and make the course as interesting and applicable to you as possible.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. I feel the course material is very specific and students should be aware of their particular interests in taking it but if so I would encourage any student to take it. Especially because I think the knowledge can be applied to so many fields. As well popular culture is something we all have experience with but don't fully understand."
