    "Only if they change the format of the class including how the papers are presented and the grant writing process. The instructors are great.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this seminar from the way it was structured. The two main components of the class (as I understood them) were supposed to be discussion of seminal papers in the field of innate immunology, and writing a grant proposal.Overall, the seminar was very \"journal club\" like and I don't know how much I got out of it beyond exposure to these seminal papers. Even then, most discussion was about problems with the papers, and little emphasis was given as to why these papers were chosen and why they are considered seminal papers for their discoveries. It seems odd to only spend time taking papers apart without discussing why they are also considered good papers. I would love to learn more about the history of the field and why these papers had the impact they did at the time they were published. I thinkthis would be very useful for students to learn.I don't think the grant proposal writing process was handled very well and it did not add anything to the class. I don't feel like I learned how to write a good proposal. I would recommend that if the goal is to teach students how to write proposals, this would be much more beneficial if broken down into steps (ex: due date for topic choice, later due date for specific aims, later due dates for a rough draft) where the students can get peer and\/or-more-importantly faculty feedback on their proposal, so that we can actually learn how to write a good proposal and re-evaluate and adjust for feedback during that writing process.The course information was interesting, and the discussion was good, so its not that the class wasn't enjoyable. I just think the class wasn't coordinated very well, and in consequence the goals of the class (or at least my goals of the class) weren't achieved.",
    "Yes, by the end of the semster you will have covered a wide range of topics - current and important in this area of research",
    "I did get a better glimpse of innate immuno. However, you may not gain much from this course. I wish the professors had explained the overall goal, purpose, methods of the papers better. I would NOT recommend this course.",
    "Journal club style class where individual students present a paper. Would recommend the class if the class size for that seminar is small, but you get less out of the class with a large class size."

   "comments": [
    "While I didn't learn very much about innate immunology, the class did give me some good ideas that I amalready putting into practice for my thesis.",
    "The information from the papers did broaden my understanding of innate immunology, and gave me some new things to keep in mind in my own research.",
    "By both broadening and deepening my knowledge base -Helped me to understand my dissertation topic from a different yet critically important perspective."
