    "This is by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. The lectures are extremely disorganized in the sense that there is writing all over the board. I gave up taking notes because I could not understand them when trying to use them for problem sets. The problem sets were extremely frustrating given that Rosner often expected us to use correlations that he had only derived in class (couldn't find them anywhere else, in the textbook or online). It was never clear what equations I was supposed to use.This class involved disgustingly little math or derivations, and we had to use many dimensionless correlations that I will never remember of find useful. This is not to mention the useless graphical analysis problems we had to do. Does Prof. Rosner honestly think that people in industry are using hand-drawn graphical approximations to make design calculations for distillation columns (like the Panchon-Savarit method)? These methods are extremely tedious, did not teach me anything behind the actual theory of the process, and were ultimately time-consuming and frustrating.On the midterm we had under 30 minutes to answer 20 questions. After 30 minutes Rosner took the exams away saying it didn't take him that long. Well of course, if you teach\/study ChemE for nearly 60 years, it would be easy. For us novices, it was not, and it's annoying that Prof. Rosner expects senior ChemE's who have only taken extremely poorly taught kinetics and transport courses to be prepared to be able to sift through the sheer quantity of equations thrown at us in class and in the textbook so that we can find the few equations necessary to complete his problem sets and exams. I'm working on the take home final now and I've never been this stressed, because I have no idea how to find the equations I need to use to solve the problems.",
    "You're in my prayers.",
    "The material covered in this class should actually be very interesting to chemical engineering majors, but the way in which it was taught was confusing and, as a result, uninspiring.",
    "Write down all equations given in class and clarify what each and every term means, it is not always clear. Book is dense - it gives lots of information, but the index is sorely inadequate for it, so mark up your text book as you read. Better yet, bring it to class and mark it as Rosner talks. Let go of perfection, write reasonable things down and turn them in, and you will feel better.",
    "You have to take it, I recommend going to lecture because it helps"
