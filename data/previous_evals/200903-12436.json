    "If you have any interest in musicals, this is your class.",
    "Excellent survey of musical theater history. Dan Egan is engaging, personable, and intelligent. very manageable workload, and completely worth your time if you like musical theater",
    "This was my favorite course I took this semester, if not ever. It's sort of a lecture\/seminar hybrid. Dan Egan is very experienced in the field, and was very good at engaging us and helping us look at the material in a new way. If you're at all interested in musical theatre, take this course!",
    "If you can tell the difference between Rent and Carousel, DEFINITELY. I would say that you should enjoy musicals in order to take this class, but if you do, this is easily one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Mr. Egan is so engrossing in his discussions, his selection of musicals and readings to supplement them is fascinating and insightful, and he is always available to give extra help on the papers (and when I say extra help, I mean he will take a train from New York to meet with you and will find you good sources). Also, he takes the class on a trip to New York to see a Broadway musical (this year: Finian's Rainbow), so that shouldbe worth it right there). Caveat: Mr. Egan is a fair, but TOUGH grader- he missed the grade inflation train. If you are not a music or theater studies major (I was not one of those, and I was in the minority), then I would recommend this class Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Take this class! Whatever your experience with musical theater is, you will walk away transformed (sorry, that's a little cheesy, but I can't think of a better word) : you'll meet some new plays, you'll learn how to \"close-read\" songs, you'll see how different musicals have inspired later ones, and you'll see how the state of American Musical Theater is related to American society at large.It's an all-around great class and Professor Egan is a wonderful lecturer!",
    "THST 236 introduces students to some of the most important trends in the American musical theater from 1927 until today, with particular emphasis on the works of Rodgers and Hammerstein and Stephen Sondheim. I would definitely recommend THST 236 to a fellow student because the subject matter and the teaching are both phenomenal.",
    "Take it. If you love musical theater, it is definitely a worthwhile class. Egan is great, a wonderful lecturer and discussion leader who knows what questions to ask to get you thinking. The workload is not bad, and you can get away without doing a lot of it if you're familiar with a lot of shows. It was definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale, if not THE favorite.",
    "If you have any interest in musical theater's history, or just really enjoy talking about Broadway shows, take it--Prof. Egan is brilliant, and the class incredibly enjoyable.",
    "Great great great. Take it! Be prepared for all of the music listening you have to do - don't hit the library at the last minute.",
    "This course was absolutely fantastic! There was a very appropriate amount of work -- never too much to be a burden, but enough that I felt I was really learning from the readings. I loved the assigned soundtracks and the readings and genuinely looked forward to doing my homework for this class. If you're into musical theater, this course will be pure fun. Prof. Egan is a wonderful professor and his passion for the subject is evident. He's also extremely accommodating when arranging meetings and gave us his number to call him if we wanted to talk through paper topics, etc. I feel very lucky to have had the chance to take this course and I wish Prof. Egan taught more courses like this!",
    "YES! It's a very accessible writing distributional credit. The assignments are manageable and to the point. Fun and varied, from watching videos, to listen to records, reading musical scores, and reviews of the dramatic style to specific performances of the shows. TAKE THIS COURSE!"
