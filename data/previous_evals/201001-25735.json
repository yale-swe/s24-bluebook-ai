   "comments": [
    "I took it as a required class, its not necessarily a FUN class per say but if you have to take Math 115 take it with Frame. There's one problem set per week, one midterm and a final.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. I took AP Calc AB in high school and got a 5 on the AP test. This class seemed like to right level with a bit of review but mostly new material. This section of math 115 was considerably easier than the others, based on what I hear from my friends.",
    "Here's the thing about Math 115: if you're thinking of taking it, you're probably gonna have to take it to meet a requirement. So since you're taking it for that, I'd recommend taking this one with Michael Frame. It sounds more daunting because of the whole \"science\" thing, but in reality I think my friends in regular 115 were much unhappier than I was in this class. Michael Frame is spectacularly helpful and does a good job of making tests that are challenging but not terrifying. I was lost for most of the time in class, but by going to his office hours I was able to get it. This is better than regular Math 115, so I'd recommend it if you're choosing between that and this. Bring a friend.",
    "Goes over material similar to the regular 115 through biological and medical applications. Some of the systems and applications are difficult to understand, but at base it's general calculus concepts. Problem sets range from easy, 1\/2 hour assignments to difficult, multi-hour projects--find some friends, and go to office hours or the course tutor!",
    "If you are premed and are not a math whiz, this class is for you. The grading is easier as well as the concepts. However, if you want to have a stronger understanding of math for math 120, I would suggest taking a regular 115 course.",
    "This is the biosciences section of Math 115. We do similar concepts as the other math 115 sections, but Michael Frame finds biological examples to apply those concepts to. Michael Frame is Amazing. He's one of the best teachers here. If you can get him, take the class. It's inspirational and he's always available for help or just to talk to him about anything. Some of the concepts were a little bit difficult to wrap my mind around, but there's always help available. He's incredibly generous with the grading, stressing the importance of learning the stuff than stressing over grades. It's awesome.",
    "This course was amazing. While I don't really enjoy math that much, the real-life applications outlined by Professor Frame were very interesting. Also, not only do you cover integration and infinite series, but a little bit of linear algebra, and a little bit of differential equations. The exams were very reasonable and while the first homework set seems really difficult, the rest are very managable. This is definitely a math class for science\/pre-med people. While the math is very similar to the other 115 courses, the applications and contextual discussions are all medically based.",
    "If you are looking at medical school or just interested in Biology, take this course.",
    "I would summarize it as a trip through Frame's mind. He's got a goal, and it's not quite visible, but it's there. It doesn't all make sense in the end, but it gives one hell of a good feeling.",
    "Great course, great instructor, interesting material. Warning: this class does not directly prepare you for 120 and is also NOT going to be a review of Calc BC. It dabbles in basic multivariable, linear algebra, and some integration. In order to move on to 120, one must take a couple online tutorials over the summer."
