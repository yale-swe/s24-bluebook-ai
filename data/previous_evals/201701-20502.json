   "comments": [
    "Theoretical econometrics and STATA",
    "Learned a lot of stata and the nuts and bolts of linear regression.",
    "I learned so much about econometric theory and concepts and feel confident that I can read most academic papers.",
    "Lots of Stata.",
    "This class was amazing for gaining a true confidence in econometrics and being able to understand the data behind economics papers.",
    "I learned how to use stata: a very very useful skill, as well as the theory behind statistical methods.",
    "Basic understanding of econometrics",
    "Learned a lot about linear regressions and models for prediction.",
    "This course taught basic econometrics skills and how to use STATA. Very straightforward and pretty useful.",
    "If you have taken 131 and 132 already I don't think you will learn much more in 136. Some of the lectures are interesting because you can understand the mathematical logic behind econometric tools, but I actually think for reading and understanding papers 132 is a better course",
    "basic overview of econometric analysis, mainly focused on OLS regression in the first half, but opened up to more types of regression in the second half of the course.",
    "An introduction into methods used to perform economic research. Learned basic STATA skills and concepts behind economic models.",
    "In ECON 136, we studied econometrics from both a theoretical and practical perspective. We reviewed linear regression the assumptions required to gain useful information from linear models. We then spent a considerable amount of time examining how to actually draw causal inferences from economic models and different techniques of dealing with issues that arise when trying to make these determinations. Overall, as an incoming senior hoping to do empirical research, I found the material of this course invaluable, especially the information about IV regression, panel data, and the techniques for binary choice data."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Prof. Kitamura and his genius (and occasional humor) This was generally a great class.",
    "I wish the professor would provide concrete reading to go along with the course. It would help immensely if he followed the textbook in any sort of fashion. I also wish we had been better prepared for STATA before the course because being unfamiliar with the software made doing problems sets very frustrating.",
    "The course is straightforward and you are tested only on material you were taught. You probably don't need to buy the textbooks- they are very expensive and there are online versions available. While you won't be able to use the online versions in the open note tests, I did not use my textbooks in the exams as we were tested only on material we were taught in class.",
    "The first half is very boring and the psets are unnecessarily hard because they don't teach us stata, but we have to perform many stata commands.",
    "Textbooks were not great.",
    "Strengths: exciting professor and fair tests. No weaknesses, nothing that needs improvement.",
    "Sometimes I wish I got more big picture stuff. While the motivation for IVs and Fixed Effects stuff was well delivered, it honestly took me a while to understand what a 'causal model' was, and where econometrics fits in in the general field of econometrics. Maybe just a bit more 'story.' Also think we could have spent slightly less time on basic OLS: I think we covered the material thoroughly but sometimes slightly repetitively. As a technically 'honors' class it could have been a bunch harder and faster! The finals scores shows this. Strengths of this course: material is fascinating, Yuichi is a strong lecturer who cares about his students a lot, it seems.",
    "The course was relatively straightforward, and covered a lot of materials for linear regression.",
    "It could be less repetitive and more challenging",
    "the in-class notes weren't very clear and methodical, so it was difficult to figure out exactly what was covered during class when looking back at the notes. in addition, the provided pdf slides and the in-class lecture used different notations and symbols. this wasn't a problem near the end of the course, but for much of the course i was really confused and wasn't sure which symbols were referring to which things. there were several times during lectures when i wasn't exactly sure what the point of the math we were doing was. we would spend several minutes going through a calculation, and only at the end of that calculation would the professor explain what the result was. some terms that we used were not well-defined. for example, the term \"causal model\" is not once mentioned in the textbook nor in the pdf slides, but it is alluded to in the homework assignments and the in-class lecture. i asked the TA for a clear definition, but she didn't seem to know for sure. there were a few minor points that the professor didn't exactly seem to know the answer to. for instance, we were told quite emphatically that \"fail to reject the hypothesis\" is equivalent to \"accept the hypothesis\". see page 120 of the textbook for why that's misleading.",
    "Pro: Covered very interesting material that was very applicable to real world scenarios. Class often referred to past studies as examples. Gave an introduction to STATA. Cons: Organization was not always clear, moved with Professor Kitamura's pace and what he deemed important but did not follow the textbook or any materials.",
    "I thought if we had the lecture slides from Professor Kitamura, that would be really helpful to prepare for the class before hand.",
    "ECON 136 is clearly a course that Prof. Kitamura has taught for a while. He knows how to present the material and is clearly an expert in the topics he presents. I think that a particular strength of the course is Prof. Kitamura's selection of a few papers and models to use for the entire length of the course, which allows students to repeatedly work with similar data sets and see how econometrics is used in the broader economics literature. One area for improvement would possibly be pacing. It felt as though the pace was slow for the first half of the course, but then very rapid in the last month, which could perhaps be adjusted in the future."

   "comments": [
    "Most students in this course take it because they have to for their major. You have to stomach a decent amount of theory, which can be quite dry if it's not your thing, but the applications are very interesting. If you take good notes, attend section, and ask questions, the problem sets are manageable.",
    "I would to Econ+Math and Applied Math majors who need to take this class anyway. It's so much more enjoyable than 135.",
    "I did learn a lot about regression analysis and I would recommend this course to someone looking for that sort of background.",
    "If you're taking 136, you probably have to, but I would recommend it even to others who are interested in statistics and regression.",
    "It starts off incredibly boring but it gets super interesting very quickly!",
    "Learning Stata and basic modeling is important for most econ related jobs.",
    "Yes! If you are an econ major, this class is definitely way more engaging that 131",
    "This is basically a crash course on basic tools economists use to verify assertions about causality in the world. I cannot think of a reason this kind of knowledge isn't critical, though if you have less interest in the proofs Econ 131 might be a good alternative. There is a fair balance between scope and rigor. Overall not very demanding but extremely interesting.",
    "The best econ class I've taken at Yale. Definitely take it---it gives you a rigorous understanding of the tools and assumptions of econometrics. Prof. Kitamura is clear, funny, and clearly invested in his students.",
    "It was a good course for learning about linear regression and statistical analysis. I would recommend it if you will be using these skills in the future.",
    "I would recommend this class. Yuichi's class lectures are mildly entertaining (which says a lot for such a dry topic), though his notes maybe be confusing at times. However, there are notes posted online, the textbook, and the TA which were all very helpful with clarifying information. We got 8 psets over the course of the semester, which took and average of 2-4 hours each. Go to section!",
    "Take this class, it is very fair and has a great professor",
    "i would recommend it. the lecture isn't fantastic, but the mathematical rigor of the course makes it 100% worth taking over another class in econometric analysis.",
    "Most students in the class are Econ\/Math majors or Applied Math Majors so the level of the class is very high. Moves very fast and is a required course for most students, and while it is very interesting, maybe a STAT230: Data Analysis course is more suited for general data analysis vs specific data analysis for econometrics.",
    "Yes, Professor Kitamura is great. Super nice guy. Very helpful. The second part of the course is much better than the first half. Take it.",
    "Econometrics with Professor Kitamura is one of the best of the required courses for the econ\/math major. Prof. Kitamura is a good lecturer who is both funny and generally pretty clear. The material also feels very interesting and useful if you are interested in doing economics research."
