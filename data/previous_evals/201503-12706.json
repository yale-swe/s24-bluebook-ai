    "If you want to take this class, you must be self-motivated. The flipped classroom style will allow you to be lazy because the professors will just go over the same material in class, just not as well. Also, they do not give problem solving strategies which are really helpful for cutting off time on tests, so you'll have to look those up on your own. Ultimately, this class is not very good. However, the workload is not bad, especially if you space out time to problem sets.",
    "200 is a very solid course for students with decent background or interest in physics. I came into it having taken AP C Mechanics but not E&M, and I would 100% recommend 200 for anyone in that same situation. You avoid the crazy speed of 260 while still going fairly in depth and using some more advanced mathematical methods (120 is assumed as a co-req). People without AP could still probably do alright, it would just take a little more work in the beginning when we go over mechanics quickly. I've never taken a flipped course before, but I thought it worked well in these circumstances. Shankar's lectures are an absolute joy to watch -- ok that may be an overstatement, but they do show you exactly how we arrive at each result\/formula we use, and how most everything is just an extension of Newton's 2nd Law, which is awesome. The accompanying book is probably the best physics textbook you will ever read, and (since Shankar wrote it) it follows the lectures almost exactly. Class time is usually used well, with a review at the beginning followed by practice problems, and the profs\/TFs are all very helpful. Psets are also relatively short (no more than 2 hours, often just 1) since you do practice problems in class, and you can watch the lectures sped up, so it's really not a huge time drain. Definitely a good course if you have the right preparation.",
    "I would not recommend PHYS 200 to another student. In my experience, the reversed classroom format does not work as intended in practice.",
    "Do not take this class if you can help it. If you enjoy phys do yourself a favor and take 260. If you do not, do yourself a favor and take 180. I repeat, do NOT IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE NOT EVEN IF ALIENS ARE THREATENING TO EAT YOUR BRAIN WITH A SPOON TAKE THIS CLASS. If you absolutely must however, a little tip- watch Shankar's lectures ahead of time- they are useless kind of but they work... in any case, flipped class pls do not.",
    "As someone who appreciates being challenged, and LOVED learning relativity (a new topic for someone who took AP physics C already), I find it hard to tell someone to take an easier class (physic 118) or take such a mathematically intensive course (physics 260). Since there is not equivalent for physics 200, I say take it. Know this, the course is not built very well, and the flipped class room does not work. Get a tutor if you're struggling and do it early. Buy the 118 textbook if you want, it was really helpful for studying for the final (although painfully easy) and get the physics 260 if you want a book that's sometimes more difficult than ours (but very well explained).",
    "Be prepared to spend more time than you imagine you would going over all the video lectures, and get ready to engage with the discussion in your group. The groups is key to the learning experience.",
    "A very solid physics course. I would recommend it if you need a physics course and like math.",
    "Pretty chill physics class. Nice if you have already studied physics in high school and are taking this for a major: psets are short and the material is straightforward.",
    "No take 180 or 260.",
    "This is a decent physics class. The video lectures are very good, and the problem solving in class is generally useful. The problem sets are much shorter than in other classes. From what I've heard this seems like the best of the three intro physics options.",
    "This is a class for people who have taken at least AP Physics in high school. Topics are covered quickly and broadly because the professors assume much prior knowledge. Knowing multi-variable calculus is helpful.",
    "Physics 200 is a great course that covers a lot of fundamental material; however, the way in which this material is covered, is not fantastic. Students taking the course should have a very strong background in physics.",
    "I would not recommend the class because it was unorganized in terms of teaching style. The professors often did not seem to have a deep enough understanding of what they were teaching, would contradict themselves, or would not have answers to students questions. The TFs were also unhelpful in that they often could not explain the answers to homework questions after they were graded.",
    "If you would like to try the flipped classroom style, you can, but I don't recommend it that much.",
    "Be careful to make sure you have the necessary physics and math background before enrolling! This year's class was flipped, which was nice--but you still have to be comfortable with physics beforehand to do well here.",
    "This course is excellent but also very challenging. You learn a lot but you have to put a lot of time into it. Because of the flipped structure, you have to put in a lot of your own time and it's really on you to learn the concepts. The problem sets and tests are challenging but you learn a lot, and they are especially manageable if you work with other students.",
    "This course is a decent introduction to mechanics. It is a flipped classroom. The online lecturer is quite good (it is definitely a good idea to watch these lectures if you take the course). The other lecturers in the classroom are decent but not as good. The psets ask you to plug and chug numbers whereas the midterms and finals use all variables. I prefer variables and think the psets are annoying; others prefer numbers and think the midterms are abstract. If you know you want to take physics but are on the fence about physics 200, definitely shop the others. Physics 260 will try to psyche you out with all the math you don't know (that's what happened to me), but talking to my friends in 260 I almost think 260 is a better, and still doable, course.",
    "If it's a flipped class again, don't. Just take 180 and read Shankar's book if you really love physics",
    "I would hesitate before recommending PHYS 200 to another student. On the one hand, it was at a good, intermediate level of advancement, where we were given many explanations and mathematical bases for phenomena, but without using extremely complicated math (most of the time). The flexibility of the course was also nice, and it wasn't too stressful (most of the time). However, the inverted classroom setup was frustrating, and I often resented having to spend many hours each week watching the lectures, in addition to doing psets.",
    "A good intro physics course. Can be challenging if not adequately prepared, and maybe a bit boring at times, but overall pretty solid.",
    "Phys 200 is a course designed to make one think critically about physics, with multiple concepts introduced during one semester. Although the pace was quick, we learned a great deal of new information. Having not been introduced to relativity or waves in high school, I believe this course helped me learn a great deal more about physics. People (not books) proved to be our best resources for new problem-solving skills, as our table group discussions were very efficient. I would recommend this course to any student, because it helped me learn more about physics at a good pace. More importantly, this course helped me practice lifelong skills, such as problem-solving and communication.",
    "Much more math-centered than 180. As a general rule, everything is pretty good except relativity and waves.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The flipped classroom creates a lot of work outside the classroom beyond just watching the lectures and doing psets. You basically have to teach yourself a lot and it is very frustrating.",
    "PHYS 200 was challenging especially due to the flipped style of teaching. If you strive in learning through online videos I would recommend it if you have time in your schedule to go through videos before class. Otherwise, I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who have had significant exposure to physics in the past. Otherwise, take a lower level physics class.",
    "I took 200 instead of 260 because of concerns about the mathematical content of the class, and while I regret the scheduling problems that created, I don't regret the class itself. I think it's a good place for anyone coming out of a strong high school physics background, especially if you haven't done much calculus-based physics. I took IB physics (not AP, so I can't offer any insight there) and thought it was a really good match. In general, the flipped-classroom format is not the best; students are often left to their own devices, teaching themselves the content, and class is often repetitive, covering material which was presented in the video lectures. However, even given that, it was not a bad class by any means, and I would recommend it as an intro.",
    "Very fast paced and difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to freshmen. However, if you are well prepared, its better to choose a higher-level course such as 260.",
    "Physics 200 is a course that was (in the recent past) taught by Professor Shankar. However, about ten years ago, the University recorded the entirety of Shankar's class and posted it online. At the beginning of the series, Shankar admits that he has absolutely no idea what might be done with the series, but he doesn't seem to care. If you take this class, you'll quickly discover how Yale has purposed these videos. The structure of the new and improved Physics 200 is well-founded but poorly executed. This class is set up so that students watch a 75 minute lecture the night before the class, and in class, the students work approximately 4-5 problems that should elucidate the topics that the video taught. You'd be surprised to find out, though, that the videos teach in such a way that working the in class problems become very difficult to solve. Shankar consistently used different notation and focused on different ideas when he taught his course in 2006, and it appears that the course instructors, while gifted physicists, did not know exactly what had been covered in the videos. This lack of continuity led to confusing class periods. What we needed in the course was a section devoted to the structured work-though of problems and examples, which Shankar's original course included. The Physics 200 course this year, though, simply turned us loose on difficult problems, and left most of the class floundering, while a select group of students who had already seen the material at this difficulty excelled. Even with a tutor, a solid high school physics course, and a notebook full of notes on every single one of Shankar's videos, I was unable to solve the problems on most PSETS, and I was especially unable to solve the problems on the exams. I must admit that I spent the majority of the class, along with my fellow classmates, wishing that we could just sit and have a traditional lecture with Helen or Frank, have a legitimate section (the course includes a Wednesday \"problem solving session\" which is just a study hall that included no real teaching, only haphazard teaching by the TAs), and actually learn physics. I would highly recommend taking Physics 180 or Physics 260 as most of my friends did. In fact, I was told all year that Physics 260 was categorically easier than Physics 200. While the 260 course does have a strong math requirement, it's much more practical to learn math than to flounder in a class that has clearly been sinking since its inception. Additionally, this course is very stressful because no metric is given at any point for grades, and you're left wondering until the end what score you've earned. Do not take the decision to take this class lightly--you'll be disillusioned during shopping period, and you'll regret it.",
    "I would really only recommend this course if you're required to take it. If you are taking it, be prepared for a lot of independent studying and working. The course is very fast-paced and flipped-classroom style, which personally I'm not a huge fan of. You watch video lectures on your own given by Professor Shankar, sometimes take an online quiz (that you never end up seeing the answers or explanations to), and then go to class to have a quick reiteration of the same topics by Professor Caines or Professor Robinson, explained in almost the exact same way. We would then do a series of in class problems on the topic with your table group, which we would often run out of time to finish explaining by the end of class. Although the professors provided us with some practice problems online, very few of them mirrored the difficulty of exams, making it hard for me personally to study for tests. Because of all the in-class problems, our homework problem sets were relatively short, but you could take this as either a positive or negative -- good because you could say the workload is less, but bad because less practice. I was overall pretty disappointed with the class because although the material is really interesting and I met a lot of great people at my table, I just struggled a lot with the way it was taught.",
    "Good course!",
    "The inverted course style didn't really work for me.",
    "I would say that the beginning of the semester is similar to an AP physics class. However, this class moves a lot faster and as you get to the end of the semester the class gets a lot more difficult. I found this class too difficult for me, so I would only recommend it to people with a strong physics background who are serious about taking it.",
    "This class was okay. If you love physics, I'm sure you'll have a blast - but it turns out that I definitely don't like physics as much as I thought I did. I took Physics 200 as a CS major who liked physics in high school, but it definitely was not worth it. The reversed classroom approach encourages you to wait until the day before the exam to learn everything, and definitely do not do this!",
    "I appreciated the flipped classroom format of the class in general. In particular, I think this worked especially well in the first half of the course, where we watched the lectures on mechanics at home and then did practice problems in class with the professors and TAs around to help out. However, in the second half, there were days when Professor Caines or Robinson would lecture for the majority of the class, which seemed to defeat the purpose of the flipped classroom. Finally, there were issues with communication between the professors and TAs about expectations and grading because they would sometimes contradict each other or not understand what the questions on the problem set were asking. However, I thought the class was actually pretty good overall and would recommend if you are interested in physics and can motivate yourself to watch the online lectures.",
    "I would not recommend this course - you might as well be teaching yourself out of a textbook with an answer key for all the support you get. The problems in class are not very helpful - we got to maybe 2-3 of them per class.",
    "The course is a great introduction to studies in Physics that often integrates math skills from Math 120; the two courses should definitely be taken concurrently. Further, if you learn best by drilling through problems - rather than in a lecture format - this course is certainly conducive to your learning style.",
    "I do not recommend taking Physics 200\/201 if you can avoid it. If you want to do Physics, spend your freshman year taking math classes and doing some other science like Chemistry. Then go straight into Physics 401 or 410. If you don't have the background to do this and have to take 200, be prepared to be very pro-active about learning physics. Class time under the flipped classroom model is very ineffective so make sure to watch the videos and take notes and do problems beforehand. Also make a study group and teach each other. There are times in the class when some students have the math and some (those taking Math 120 concurrently) do not. Also make the effort to go to study hall and office hours.",
    "When taught flipped-classroom, this course is pretty annoying. There is a lot of out of class work that has to be done because in class, all that happens is a recap and a few small practice problems. There is also no actual textbook, so trying to understand completely foreign concepts can get pretty difficult. Overall, I would definitely not recommend this course.",
    "I would say that it's a fine class, but only if you can function well in a flipped classroom setting. The class gets much harder the second half of the semester, so you have to be prepared.",
    "Physics 200 is a great calculus-based introduction to physics that is made unnecessarily hard by the flipped-classroom format, sometimes poor teaching of Prof. Robinson, the homeworks that are not consistent in difficulty, and the exams which both ignore material we spent a great deal of time covering (gravitation) and include problems on material we never discussed (the last problem on the final involved remembering an identity for a geometric series, which we never ever discussed). Take this class if you took AP physics C (mechanics) in high school and love physics. Just remember that is a flipped class, so it will be a lot more work than you expected. Also be weary about the math requirement. Having finished multivariable calculus is preferable, since you do line integrals for calculating work fairly early in this course, and having done differential equations is very helpful for when they get to simple harmonic motion, since Prof. Robinson did a dreadful job explaining how to solve them."
