    "This class is the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Guest lectures all greatly enhanced learning in the class and were well chosen.Readings a little more on the heavy side and it was obvious that most people dismissed them as being capable of being completed from the beginning of the course.Prof earned great respect by conducting a middle of the semester student input survey. I felt that he did actually take our comments and concerns into consideration going forward.In the beginning especially, the prof did waste a lot of time in class to ask overly obvious questions that only served to interrupt flow of an otherwise interesting lecture. It seems reasonable to assume that everyone in a course like this knows what \"outsourcing,\" etc means, no?"
