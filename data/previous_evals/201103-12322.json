    "Kiswahili 110 is more difficult than you may expect, but it is a worthwhile experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in African culture.",
    "Swahili's a lot of fun. Great, great language (and easy to pronounce!). Mwalimu Kiarie is awesome; he has a really wonderful sense of humor, and you can totally tell that he's put a lot of thought into how to teach Swahili to American college students. The TA's are also great, as well as my fellow classmates. Yay warm fuzzy Swahili bonding. You trade a fair amount of class chillness for a fair amount of disorganization, especially towards the end -- a lot of the words you need to know are just kind of mentioned in passing and never written down on a vocab sheet or even on the board -- just to warn you. Otherwise, though, if you're looking for something new and like Africa (and who doesn't like Africa?), definitely take this class!",
    "Yes but only if you have a deep interest in East Africa.",
    "I would recommend Kiswahili as a language that is extremely different than any romance language, and important culturally and linguistically for any student hoping to broaden his or her language abilities with a language that is not very complex to learn. I think it's a great opportunity."
