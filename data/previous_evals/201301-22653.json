    "I would not recommend Spanish 120 to another student unless they really wanted to learn spanish.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Your knowledge of the language will skyrocket, and Sebastian definitely keeps the course interesting and keeps the class on their toes. He also encouraged social interaction between the class members, which was great because I feel like each of us developed a solid relationship with each other and with him.",
    "Span 120 is good for language requirements. You will have to study for quizzes and exams, but they aren't awful. Try to get Diaz and you'll love the class.",
    "Recommend it. Diaz is a character and a great guy. From dance sessions to random conversations, class was definitely interesting. Expect a big jump from L1 and level of expectation is much higher. Good class. Definitely take it with Diaz.",
    "It is a typical language class that meets everyday and you should be prepared for the big difference from L1",
    "TAKE THE SECTION WITH SEBASTIAN DIAZ. He's the absolute best. My Spanish improved soooo much with him.",
    "Great way to learn a lot of Spanish",
    "If you want to learn Spanish, this class seems necessary for you. I just took this class because I had to fulfill a language requirement, so my heart wasn't there.",
    "Absolutely. I learned a ton and really enjoyed my class and classmates. A terrific experience",
    "With Sebastian as your teacher I would definitely recommend this class!"
