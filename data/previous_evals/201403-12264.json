    "I had an amazing experience with my internship this semester. It was extremely worthwhile, and I really appreciated the opportunity to obtain course credit for doing research in a psych lab. I gained great real-world experience that will serve me well in my future career path. There is a final paper, but by the end of the semester I had more than enough to say.",
