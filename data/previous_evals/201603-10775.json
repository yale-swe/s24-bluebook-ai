    "This course was the first time I ever got to properly workshop academic writing. It was quite enjoyable to read my peers' work, offer my input, and hear what they had to say about mine. This course also taught me how to properly approach analyzing literature: accept that you don't understand it and ask--why? What works? What does not work? What is the purpose of this section, or that section?",
    "A sense of the profound weirdness and brilliance of some of the major writers of the 17th century; an appreciation for their work and the period in which they wrote.",
    "This course introduced me to 17th century English literature exclusive of Milton - a genre I had little to no exposure to before and which I found to be delightfully strange. I also greatly appreciated the inclusion of several important female writers from the period - I didn't know they existed and I was excited to gain a new perspective on this period in English literature."

   "comments": [
    "This course was excellent in that it was a senior seminar, so it was wonderful to be surrounded by my peers in my favorite subject at Yale.",
    "I think the syllabus is amazingly comprehensive for the time we have and already surveys a large number of genres (drama, poetry, prose), and I don't know what I would cut to be able to add something else! I did miss Katherine Philips, though; I wonder also if there could be room for Lucy Hutchinson, given that we have the manuscript?",
    "Professor Rogers knows how to run a seminar, and he damn well knows his 17th century literature. It was an excellent class for exploring the ideas that were present in the time of their publication, but did not feel restrictive towards productive modern interpretations of texts. Beginning the class with a fifteen minute lecture on the context of the works and moving into the group analysis of passages was such a great format, as it gave us enough history to shape the way we reviewed passages, but was not the defining context of the seminar.",
    "It's a wonderful survey of authors I've never encountered in any other English course. The only issue is that some of the readings were really, really tough. Professor Rogers helped us through them during discussion, but I could have used more resources at home to help.",
    "The diversity of the syllabus, both in terms of literary form, content, subject matter, and authorial background, was wonderful. I also appreciated the secondary source readings, which often helped illuminate the more difficult, impenetrable texts."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Mainly for Professor Rogers, but also because the literature is fascinating.",
    "ENGL 406 was a wonderful seminar--as an early modernist I am admittedly inclined to like this sort of thing, but I had the sense that everyone was invested in and enjoying the material! A lot of this was surely down to John Rogers, who is a very attentive and generous teacher and led discussions that always felt accessible--even for authors that are notoriously difficult to parse in a two hour seminar discussion, like Crashaw or Browne. The syllabus manages to survey a broad range of seventeenth-century literature but never felt rushed. Highly recommended!",
    "Yes! This is a wonderful class even if you're not interested in 17th century literature. Professor Rogers makes this an extremely enjoyable and interesting class. Take any class taught by him that you can. He's absolutely fantastic.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Rogers is fantastic, enthusiastic, and deeply knowledgable. You'll gain a deep appreciation for the weirdness and beauty of some 17th Century writers who you would probably never otherwise read, and you'll have a lot of fun in the process.",
    "I took 17th c. Lit because it's what the senior seminar lottery gave me, and it exceeded all my expectations. I had read almost none of the syllabus, and it turns out that the non-Milton literature is aggressively weird, various, disturbing, occasionally written by women (!), and more important than it seemed. But more importantly: John Rogers. Professor Rogers is a scholar among fools and a saint among men. He might be the most earnest, unaffected, engaged teacher that I've had at Yale, and his totally honest enthusiasm for the text encouraged the same in his students. Accurately described by David Kastan as \"adorable.\" Other high reviews include Leslie Brisman: \"I would take a seminar that man taught if it was on the telephone book.\"",
    "Absolutely. You'll read writers integral to the western canon who you would never encounter in another course, and Professor Rogers is one of the greatest professors at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend this course as a senior seminar. I initially took the course only because I had heard good things about Prof. Rogers, thinking I had no interest in the subject matter itself. I was pleasantly surprised, as not only is professor Rogers wonderful, but the readings are fascinating as well, if you're into weird religious or subversive material - and even some feminist stuff!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if Professor Rogers continues to teach it. He is energetic, funny, and passionate, and the material comes alive in his hands. The seminar group itself was rather large, and conversations were often led by the same few people each class, but the overall atmosphere of the class was wonderful. There's quite a lot of reading, and being seventeenth-century literature it can be very dense, but I was proud of the work I did in this class under Professor Rogers's endless encouragement."
