   "comments": [
    "The readings can be a bit cumbersome to get through, but all in all this course covers fascinating material across various topics in philosophy of mathematics. A lot of the class discussion can get a bit technical, but luckily Bruno is effortless in making each week's topic easily understandable and engaging. I definitely recommend this class to any philosophy or mathematics major. Note: it helps having taken Set Theory.",
    "Very interesting, but it's important to have the right background. Many of the papers are very difficult and if you are trying to learn background material at the same time, it seems like it could be difficult. The class ends up being more like an extended lecture than a seminar format. You probably know if the class is for you. If your not already pretty invested in leaning the material, it can be pretty boring.",
    "Brilliant class. Excellent but challenging readings, good lecture\/seminar, fun papers to write.",
    "Highly theoretical and rigorous philosophical analysis of several different and important positions with regards to questions of the ontology and metaphysical status of mathematical objects (what are numbers?!) and worries about the indeterminacy of mathematical terms (do they refer precisely?). The class (and especially readings) make substantive use of logical and mathematical notation. I would recommend to all the mathematics and philosophy majors, to anyone who was interested in the logic courses offered here, and to anyone who is interested in the popular mathematical results discussed in this class (Godel, lowenheim-skolem, different sizes of infinity, foundational paradoxes, etc.). Be prepared for rigor and clarity."
