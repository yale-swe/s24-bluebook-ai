    "Absolutely. But the student should enjoy Greek history generally and be willing\/able to devote significant time to the course -- the reading load isn't light. (a heavy workload, by the way, shouldn't be juxtaposed with an \"appropriate\" work load below. a heavy workload may well be quite appropriate, depending on the class. fix this, Yale)",
