    "I learned how to sight read more accurately and efficiently and to complete dictations with a different, more helpful, approach than I had been using before",
    "I feel as though I have a better understanding of scale degrees and how to identify and sing them. I feel I have improved at sight singing and have a better grasp of dictations or at least feel more comfortable approaching them.",
    "I developed strategies for taking musical dictation and improved my sight-singing ability.",
    "Basic music theory and keyboard skills, as well as sight-singing and dictation.",
    "I learned how to identify chords by sight and ear much more efficiently. I also gained insight into playing the same chords with different fingerings. This allowed me to diversify chord sounds and ease the transition between different chords.",
    "Sight singing, chord analysis and aural recognition through dictations, basic keyboard",
    "I accidentally evaluated Music 350 thinking it was Music 218, so my answers will be the same as my evaluation of Music 350. I became much better at music dictation and chord analysis in this class. I feel like I have gained a more solid base in those areas of musicianship.",
    "I got a little bit better at dictation. I greatly improved from my keyboard skills last year.",
    "Knowledge\/skills: Learning to accurately dictate melodic lines, harmonic progressions, and chord qualities; improving sight-singing skills; introductory keyboard\/piano skills in accompaniment, figured-bass reading, and sight-reading"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths - catered to the skill levels of each person in the class weaknesses - also a weakness that everyone had different skill levels",
    "While I think the course was generally well structured, something that sometimes got in the way of our learning was the different musical backgrounds of different students. The gap was sometimes quite wide, so a lot of discussions held no value for half the class while others just unnecessarily confused half the class. Also, I guess the practice helped me develop some skills, but in general, I don't naturally have a good ear or a sense of scale degrees or singing, so I still feel that a lot of assessments are a shot in the dark and I still don't have a reliable method of approaching this.",
    "The wide variety of ability levels makes it difficult to challenge all of the students. Not sure how this can be changed, really.",
    "The format is clear and instruction is also clear. The only problem would be that there are differing levels of prior knowledge and experience in the students, and sometimes discussions were led beyond the scope of the course that seemed to confuse some students.",
    "Strengths: Organization of the course and similar training methods for different lessons. It gave the course a feeling of consistency. Weaknesses: Composed of students of various music backgrounds. Students ahead would usually dominate discussion and add input that goes way over the head of those without like expertise.",
    "More aural interval analysis and helpful techniques to improve chord recognition aurally would be helpful. Does give a lot of practice in sight-singing and dictations. Keyboard lab was a great learning experience.",
    "I liked the consistency of the course; every week we did dictation and analysis, so I got much better at that. I didn't improve my sight-reading that much through this course, though.",
    "Personally, I think there should be two separate classes: one for those who have had dictation experience, and one for those who haven't. The range in skill set between the students was so enormously large that it made class really difficult. Also, because this class is about developing a skill set within a really short period of time, it's very, very difficult to catch up once you get behind. It's also difficult to answer some of these other questions on this evaluation because I don't know what else I could do in this class. Like \"Your level of engagement was\"... I participated in class, is that what you mean? \"Level of intellectual challenge\"...???... I feel like this isn't an intellectual class, this class is about building a skill set.",
    "If possible, it might be better to have some recorded dictations with which students could practice for homework. Otherwise, the course in general was well-structured and methodical, and did a good job of teaching the requisite skills. It was also quite enjoyable, and I looked forward to it among my classes.",
    "The strength of this course was that it was really adapted to each student's capacities and was thus very flexible. It also enabled students to be engaged and to interact with one another and with the professor in a constructive way."

   "comments": [
    "If you really want to simply improve your skills in sight reading and dictation, take this class. It's not a class I leave totally inspired, but rather feel like I got better at a technical skill",
    "Yes, it's very useful for musicians.",
    "If you are interested in training your ear, sight, and hands to hear, identify, and play various chord qualities, take this class.",
    "Yes! Take Music 218. Even if you have musicianship background, it's a fun class and you gain a solid base for musical analysis.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone who hasn't already had dictation experience or to anyone who isn't absolutely determined to be a music major. I didn't enjoy this class in the least, and as someone who didn't have dictation experience in high school, it was EXTREMELY difficult. Because this class is about developing a skill set within a really short period of time, it's very, very difficult to catch up once you get behind.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student similarly interested in developing their skills as a musician or composer. The skills we discuss also delve quite a bit into music theory and history, making the course itself much more interesting and less one-dimensional. I do caution, however, that non-musicians might find this class extremely difficult, especially the aural skills sections.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it teaches much basic musical knowledge, but in a motivating and fun context."
