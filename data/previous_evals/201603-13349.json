I feel a little confused now about when and where it is okay for me to have more of a creative license and when and where I should stick to the rules for the sake of professionalism.",

    "It would be helpful if the professor could follow the rules of constructive criticism. I know he feels strongly about the subject, but everyone in the class already knows how good he is and is in constant awe about it, so there is no need to emphasize that gap.",

That said, I've taken lots of lessons from this course for simply writing emails, letters and even occasionally policy papers.",
    "This course focused on improving my writing, which will help in all of my other coursework. I feel that I have the tools to carry on improving my own writing.",

    "I wanted to improve my writing and analysis abilities.",
    "I took this course because I wanted something different this semester. I wanted a course that was gonna build general skills not just skills in a particular topic area. I was taking quite a few research credits and so this was a nice way to balance out the quantitative work I was doing. You get into a rhythm of writing every week, which is really nice.",
    "I wanted to improve my writing.",
    "I wanted to be able to write about a growing list of topics of interest that didn't have other places within my course load. Unfortunately, I never left myself enough time to write in a focused (and short) manner about this list. Really important in this class to leave enough time to write, walk away from your writing, and return (at least once) before handing it in.",
    "I wanted to improve my writing and learn how to enjoy writing again.",
    "To bring together my professional formation for ministry and my love of the natural world and to do so through writing."

    "Just know that you're not going to get a publication out of it or an entirely cleaned piece of writing. But it is going to improve the process through which you approach writing and it will suggest many editing techniques to strengthen your voice.",
    "Do it. This will be one of my favorite courses of all times.",
    "Learn from your fellow students as much as from the professor. The biggest strength of this course is the fellowship of an incredible and motivated group of people that is then fueled by an incredibly intelligent and eloquent professor.",
    "Be prepared to work. Be prepared to want to work. The format of the class will make you want to put in consistent and significant effort each week."
