   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I think that this was a really great course. I enjoyed learning about the material, as I have always been interested in Jewish history and in French history, and this combined the two, with a side of literature. That being said, don't take this course if you're not interested in Jews or French literature. I thought that the reading load was very manageable, although it did vary significantly from week to week in the beginning of the term. There were only two assignments during the term, so we were able to concentrate a lot on the reading. Professor Samuels is really wonderful, interesting to listen to, and extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The free reign for the final paper was a nice chance to be able to explore a specific interest in the subject. The only problem I found was that the class was too large. There were never enough seats at the table, and people sitting around the edges seemed to get left out. I think it would be a good ideato cap it in the future so that a real discussion could be had, instead of everyone fighting to make an individual point.",
    "I would recommend this course - it's really interesting, not too much work and the professor is great. Any course taught by Professor Samuels will be really informative and well structured. French 353 is probably most interesting for thosewho have a Jewish background or a knowledge of Judaism.",
    "Take this course if you have the slightest interest in France, Jews, European history, 20th century philosophy, or sociology.",
    "I would definitely recommend Jewish Identity and French Culture. Professor Samuels is a true gem in the French department because he is so knowledgeable about his subject, so kind, and is so organized with the way the class is run. You will learn an enormous amount about Jewish identity, and I think this is particularly valuable whether or not you are Jewish. You will learn about French history, questions of identity, migration, race, etc -- all very important questions for any student to ponder. There is a good amount of work that goes into this course (one week = one novel + pdf docs; also the Holocaust testimony + wiki page took up an inordinate amount of time-), mostly because everyone in this class is so on top of things, because the readings are all helpful and important, and I think in general most people are genuinely interested and enjoy participating in class or just really respect Professor Samuels, the good man!",
    "Prof. Samuels is a gem and any class with him is a lovely experience.",
    "YES.It was wonderful. I really, really enjoyed the class, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to other studentsStrengths: the readings were very interesting; the professor's introduction-type lecture at the beginning of class was informative and fascinating. The assignmentswere mostly self-directed, which gave the students a lot of freedom in terms of choosing what to write about.Professor Samuels is the best. He is so knowledgeable, so nice, so caring, so deeply moving when he talks about the topics in class discussions. He is very good at leading discussion, and is very accommodating of students' opinions. He really sparked my interest in the subject matter (in which I was peripherally interested before but never really academically intrigued). He is a truly wonderful professor that any student would be lucky to have.Weakness: sometimes discussion seemed to be dominated by a few people, but this may also be because not all students finished the readings and didn't want to talk.",
    "Pretty good French seminar. Loved the topic of the course, although some of the books were hard to get through language-wise or just bizarre (Modiano). I feel like the class was mostly made up of people who were really confident in their oral French and therefore coasted by without actually doing the reading, which was frustrating for me (I am not as comfortable speaking and had to actually read a lot in order to contribute to discussion). Take this if you actually want to do some of the reading - you'llget a lot more out of it that way, and not just drift to Facebook during class. Be prepared to be intimidated by your peers - one of the kids in my class translated for African heads of state last summer, and another spent a year abroad in Paris. Upper-level French seminars are not for the faint of heart. WORKLOAD: 5 page response paper, report on a Holocaust testimony that ends up being 5-7 pages worth of material, 10 page research paper.",
    "French 353 was one of the best led seminars I have taken at Yale, with a great syllabus and really fascinating readings. The assignments were also creative and diverse. Prof. Samuels is a great seminar leader. He is brilliant and has insightful things to say about all of the readings. Although he is very knowledgeable, he doesn't make you feel like your opinion is worthless. He takes the time to listen and has planned this course very carefully. I recommend taking this course if you have the chance! You won't regret itAlthough the topic seems so specific, you will find yourself discussing readings, philosophers and topics that vastly transcend what you expect. A lot of what I learned in this class can be applied to my other courses. Authors include Sartre, Memmi, Zola... several very important works",
    "I would tentatively recommend the course, but highly recommend it if the discussion was more exciting.",
    "I recommend this course! Especially if you are interested in national\/cultural identities. The written work is not too much however, I would caution you about the amount of reading. If you can manage being a selective reader you'll be fine. But this course was very interesting and Samuels has a great taste in literature.",
    "If you're interested in French, Jewish issues, and history (this is much more a history course than a literature course), take this class. Professor Samuels is excellent and very engaging, and the readings are well-chosen. You cover all the most significant points in French Jewish history, and Professor Samuels led the seminar discussion very capably. He spends quite a bit of time providing the historical background for each seminar, which I appreciated, but if you prefer a free-for-all discussion, then you might prefer another course. It's also not too difficult.",
    "Yes. This is an essential for any student, French major or not. It is important to examine the ways a major religious group has been portrayed throughout one culture's history.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in modern France and Jewish culture."
