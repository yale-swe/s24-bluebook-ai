    "The material is so engaging and so interesting, and you take so many different approaches to the pre-, during, and post-genocide periods and problems that you will never get bored. I loved it. It was the only class I would pay attention at 9:25 AM for. There were a decent amount of readings, but manageable, and they were all engaging. Also one of the only classes I've done nearly every page of the reading for. Otherwise, the assignment demands are not too much, and Professor Simon is not a harsh grader, so I think it is an amazing class to take. Lastly, the Rwandan Genocide and the international issues surrounding humanitarian intervention are important for everyone to learn about.",
    "great course.",
    "This course was a very informative overview of genocide as a whole and specifically of the Rwandan Genocide."
