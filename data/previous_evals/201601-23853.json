   "comments": [
    "This class will change the way you understand Yale, your time here, higher education, and teaching itself. No other class has challenged me to reflect and consolidate my experiences with broader research to the same extent. You will write a LOT and learn a LOT from a master of this field. Professor Hersh is extremely available to his students and provides tons of substantive feedback on every assignment. He's also a really nice guy who genuinely cares about his students. If you have the chance, you need to take this - whether you're in Education Studies or not. You will work really hard, but you will not regret a minute of it.",
    "If you're at all interested in education and its purpose, take this class. You have the rare opportunity to think and write and read a lot about liberal education, and you inevitably start thinking about the way Yale is being faithful to and falling short of that idea. Professor Hersh is my favorite professor at Yale - he'll push you so much to be a better writer and communicator, but is also so nice and understanding. Quite some work - there's a weekly response paper (he says it can be like 2 pages but ours are usually 3-7) and anywhere from 100-200 pages of reading a week.",
    "YOU CANNOT LEAVE YALE WITHOUT TAKING A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR HERSH. I REPEAT: YOU CANNOT LEAVE YALE WITHOUT TAKING A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR HERSH. AGAIN: YOU CANNOT LEAVE YALE WITHOUT TAKING A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR HERSH. SERIOUSLY FOLKS. Truly, he is one of the most insightful, passionate, and engaging professors at Yale -- and above all, he just cares about how you grow and transform during college. Going to this seminar and reflecting on the nature of liberal education made me think so much about my Yale experience, how it could be improved, and how I can best take advantage of the resources here. You tackle some pretty big questions with really engaging conversation: Why even go to college? What is it for? Is Yale living up to its name? Are the liberal arts even relevant? You see things through the lenses of developmental psychology, history and historiography, political science, etc. You get to go to his house for dinner and talk with his lovely wife Judith. Only word of wisdom: be prepared for the weekly papers. They're difficult at first due to the sheer amount of reading and writing that you will be doing, but YOU CAN DO IT. Professor Hersh is also very lenient in terms of due dates, and more than accommodating if you let him know in advance that you'll have a busy week or something came up. His feedback will also allow you to be come a much better writer, as he is constantly evaluating and reevaluating your work. TLDR JUST TAKE IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!",
    "If you want to learn how to write really well and develop arguments, this is your professor. Hersh requires a lot of you, but you get an immense amount out of the class too. Its worth the time and effort if you want to learn and are remotely interested in education. Hersh cares an almost unreal amount. Far and away the best professor I have ever had. The class discussions are super interesting and the readings very engaging.",
    "A highly reflective seminar on the value and challenges of American liberal education, through the lens of assessment, moral development theory, and institutional\/structural issues.",
    "If you've ever wondered what you're really doing at college, take this course. If you've never wondered what you're really doing at college, take this course. This is one of the top three courses I've taken at Yale (and another of those top three is also taught by Hersh). It'll change the way you think about Yale, about college in general, and what education is for. Go for it!",
    "Take this class to reflect about your education - you don't do it enough. Though this class looks beyond Yale in its consideration of liberal\/higher education, it really invites you to think: why did I come to Yale? What has my higher Ed promised me, and what is it giving me? These thoughts are invaluable. Also the students who are drawn to this class are likely to become the community of thoughtful peers you never realized you were missing. So glad I took this course. Oh also professor Hersh is the most generous professor and his feedback is invaluable."
