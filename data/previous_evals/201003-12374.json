    "Fabulous class. I took it after 260 and not having taken 261, but that didn't hurt me at all. Less rigorous than the 260 sequence but easier to understand. Fun class, always looked forward to it, and was always engaged.",
    "Do it! All the fun of physics 201, but you're not constantly in pain and actually get to learn some really nifty stuff. I took this class just to spend more time with Prof Shankar. He's such a g.For real, great course.",
    "Physics 401 isbasically a more in-depth version of 200. If you are a physics major, and are considering taking this course, I would highly recommend it. It was the most challenging course of my semester, but it never felt unreasonably difficult. Just make sure that you spend some extra time doing practice problems. Class time is usually spent proving things rather than doing practice problems, so it really helps to do some practice problems on the side. Take this class!",
    "Really enjoyable class. Prof. Shankar is a great lecturer, and the small size makes the class a lot better than the intro courses. Definitely take it.",
    "Yes I would, even for a non-physics major.",
    "great class. not too much work or too difficult, but certainly challenging and you will learn a lot and better understand much of the material from earlier physics classes. definitely recommend it if you're interested in slightly more advanced math in physics and lagrangian, hamiltonian, and thermodynamics even if you don't plan to be a physics major",
    "Not as scary as 201, but the class is a lot smarter so I don't know if my grade will be any better.",
    "Take physics 401. It's basically a slightly more in-depth PHYS 200, so if you think you've got that stuff down pat, then take 410 I guess. But this was my favorite course of a semester of great courses. The material, classical mechanics, is beautiful and important for any educated person to know.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student due to the comprehensive nature of the course, great prof and TA.",
    "Is this an average old course? \/ Well is torque d theta d force? \/ Whether you're bright or your thick, \/ This class is RIDIC. \/ Straight from the mouth of the horse.(And by horse, I really mean one of the thick kids in the class.)For serious, what a great class. It's 150 minutes a week in the presence of Professor Shankar. THIS IS WHAT GETTING VALUE FOR YOUR YALE TUITION MONEY IS REALLY ALL ABOUT. Professor Shankar is a baller and a half. Brilliant. Hilarious. Charismatic. A true Shank-star. Old students of Professor Shankar reading his reviews because you want to see all the admiration for this amazing man, please also consider lobbying him to offer an upper-level physics elective. Imagine more courses like this one... to borrow from ampm, TOO MUCH GOOD STUFF! (Oh, also, workload and exams are not bad at all.)"
