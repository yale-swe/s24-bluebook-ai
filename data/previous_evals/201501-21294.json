   "comments": [
    "The class is a current works series so it a requirement for all students. However, to summarize, it is a weekly meeting where faculty, graduate students and post-docs mostly external, but occassionally internal, to Yale present their research. This allows for a more intimate setting for students and faculty to learn about new topics and techniques and provides a platform for discussion."

   "comments": [
    "The talks didn't directly contribute to my dissertation research. However, they definitely deepen my knowledge of the discipline. It is always good to learn about areas of research that you don't currently work on but could one day come across again. Plus, a broader understanding of the field can only help."
