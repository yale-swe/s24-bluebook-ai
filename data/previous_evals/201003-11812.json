    "This course is a good introduction to educational psychology but it is very pre-professional and the reading is boring - so make sure you want to teach.",
    "I would recommend PSYC 194 to a fellow student because you will learn unique lessons about learning and teaching that you can't gather from very many, if any, classes at Yale these days. If you are a psych major, beware as this class was very much geared towards the practitioner. Also, there is quite a bit of writing (3 to 6 pages every week) and very intense discussions on the text, so be prepared to work hard. But Alison is an amazing professor and will facilitate a great learning experience.",
    "Educational Psychology was a good balance of a psychology class and teacher preparation class. The lens for prospective teachers was always considered which was appreciated and offered a very practical learning experience.",
    "This was an enjoyable seminar. The material was pretty scattered, but the in-class time was structured in an usual and engaging way. Professor Matika has some great stories about teaching. She can be quite intimidating and takes a lot of class time letting the students make logistical decisions. The style worked for some people, and wasn't ideal for others. There were many, many writing assignments throughout the semester, though they didn't take a lot of time. The group learning project was fun, but a big scheduling burden.",
    "Educational Psychology with Professor Matika is very different from other courses I have taken at Yale. It requires 2-3 one-page responses each week that are based on the reading but also draw heavily from personal experience. Be prepared to recall your personal educational experiences and analyze them critically. There is a large group project component that asks you to learn a new skill with other class members in order to understanding the learning process. My favorite part of the course by far was the last two writing assignments that asks you to analyze your own responses from the course of the semester and seek out trends or changes in your thought process in order to deliver a cognizant analysis of your position on learning. I found it incredibly intellectually stimulating and I think it was the best part of the course by far. Professor Matika has a personality and an agenda for the course that some students found overbearing. However, I would strongly recommend the course. Not only is the information fascinating but taking the class is an interesting experience in and of itself.",
    "I wouldn't take this class unless you absolutely have to. It was pretty disorganized and a little too fluffy for my taste."
