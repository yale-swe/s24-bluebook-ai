    "This class is amazing (mostly because Dru is amazing--seriously, you should take this class just to hang out with her). Anyone who has the slightest interest in photography should take this course--even if you've never picked up a camera before. Dru starts at the most basic level so that everyone is on the same page. You will learn about how to operate a DSLR camera, some basic photoshop, famous photographers, how to talk about photographs, how to print, and much more. Can be a lot of work at times, but the work is taking pictures, so it's fun. Dru is awesome--she's incredibly knowledgeable and always made class fun and interesting. She's very approachable and kind, and is always happy to help or give advice. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. It's hard to get in; if Dru offers you a spot, you should 100% take it.",
    "It is am amazing class! I would recommend it to most if not all Yale students. Realize that it is quite a bit of work--many hours spent photographing and many hours in the DMCA.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, if they are interested in photography (a serious interest is best - materials for the course are quite expensive, and only worth it if you will continue to use them later).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students regardless of whether they are photography majors or not. I have had an extremely good time taking photos and learning about photography towards my goal of specializing in graphic design. This class was well structured, the work was all fun and did not seem like it took much time at all. Overall, excellent.",
    "YES",
    "Definitely",
    "This is an amazing course; absolutely recommended for all students. First off, it teaches you a life-long skill. Second, it forces you to think in creative ways and real push the idea of what exactly is a photograph. Third, Dru is awesome and so is learning about the department and what other work students are producing. Im not the most \"artistic\" person, but taking this course has definitely made me more able to examinephotography and it stayed approachable throughout the term. Plus, producing work you are very proud of is amazing.Overall, an absolute YES coming from a senior who has taken many courses.",
    "A great introduction to photography -- I'd recommend it for students taking it Cr\/D, but in general, be prepared to put in a lot of time every week.",
    "Like any course, you should have some sort of interest in the material being taught. I have always been curious about digital photography. Intro to Digital Photography helped me learn more about how to handlea digital camera and about different photography techniques. I also learned more about how to talk about a images in greater detail and about editing images on PhotoShop. Nonetheless, this course does require a significant amount of time. If you're willing to dedicate your time to learning more about digital photography, you should definitely take a look at this course. Dru is also a greater professor and in general, just a cool person. TAKE IT!",
    "Yes! Very fun class."
