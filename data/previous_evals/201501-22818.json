   "comments": [
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course, especially to someone who needs an L5 credit. If you don't, however, but still have room in your schedule for a \"fun\" class, I would recommend this one highly for that as well. The subject matter is fascinating and the variety of ways through which he approaches it will keep you interested all semester.",
    "We spent some time in the middle ages and with some primary sources from that time, but we also covered the pilgrimage in modern times. The fact that it's a history class in Spanish makes it more special. I would recommend it as a way to maintain your Spanish and learn some new terminology. Plus you learn about the history of a common adventure that you may find yourself called to take one day.",
    "SPAN 368 covers the history and modern day Camino de Santiago in an accessible and interesting way. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn relevant information and practice writing skills.",
    "Yes! Very interesting and entertaining. You will learn a lot and have a great time in doing so",
    "I took the course mostly to work on my Spanish, and I hoped I'd learn some interesting history along the way. I definitely think I benefited more from the history than from the Spanish, as the course only meets twice a week and isn't discussion-based. But the Camino's history is an interesting one and a great lens through which to understand religious and social issues.",
    "Wonderful class, especially for those who have walked\/plan to walk the Camino de Santiago. Even if you aren't, the class offers a great overview of Spanish history with respect to Catholicism.",
    "Definitely take this class! It will inspire you to walk the Camino and you will always look forward to going. I loved it!",
    "The course is a relaxed class (neither a seminar not a lecture) with a very manageable workload. I would certainly recommend it to a classmate interested in Spain or Spanish.",
    "A wonderful course if you don't mind reading a few dry books.",
    "A wonderful overview of the pilgrimage route to Santiago. Always the highlight of my Mondays and Wednesdays. Inspired me to walk the Camino this summer!",
    "Would recommend, interesting Spanish history and culture",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interesting in history, Spain, or someday doing the Camino de Santiago. Also great if you want to have a Spanish class with less speaking.",
    "This class represents the kind of courses that should define Yale's ideal liberal arts core. It is modeled practically as a history course (with reach into literature, art history, political science, and economics) taught in Spanish. Two midterm papers and a final paper, along with a short few writing assignments given out by the professor at sporadic times. Workload is therefore not heavy at all, and material is engaging.",
    "Definitely an interesting L5 Spanish course on a topic that's a little off the beaten path. I would recommend it to any student who has good mastery of Spanish and is willing to spend half the semester on medieval Spain.",
    "Yes. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This course is basically a history lecture but in Spanish. It was incredible how Professor Poole really brought to life the economic, social and cultural background of the pilgrimage road in northern Spain. He is a great lecturer and has an interesting but wonderful sense of humor. Going to class was a joy, and the readings are not that bad. The speaking portions of the class were lacking, so if speaking practice is really what you're looking for, I would recommend taking advantage of a tutor through the language department or a Spanish table at a meal. I absolutely enjoyed this class and am now planning on walking the Camino myself!"
