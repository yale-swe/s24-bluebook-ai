    "Freedom.",
    "Terrible course.",
    "This course was an interdisciplinary approach to the entire concept of freedom. From psychology to history to literature to paintings to architecture to political philosophy and beyond. It was a wonderful class because I left it having more questions than I started with. I heartily recommend any class with Charles Hill.",
    "Great class. Really makes you think about the foundation stones of political philosophy.",
    "This class provided a provocative analysis of foundations for freedom throughout history. The interdisciplinary nature of the syllabus offered a broad overview, but the reading material and focused class discussion allowed for thoughtful consideration of each week's topic. I definitely recommend this class to other students. The course featured interesting authors, unique perspectives from art (especially music and architecture), philosophy and political science and required a fair time commitment each week.",
    "A far-reaching survey on the notion of freedom through different cultural and historical lenses. This is an intensely intellectual class, though Prof. Hill has a knack for making complex philosophy comprehensible. Take it if you're self-motivated enough to do the huge amount of reading on time.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in reading the material, and if you have good seminar members with you.",
    "This is not a course on the \"Idea of Freedom.\" It is a course on the \"Ideas of Charles Hill.\" Not recommended.",
    "Take this class if you want to listen to Hill talk (which is always fascinating, if not always sensible), and do some cool reading. Don't expect a coherent idea of what 'freedom' is, and don't expect the people in the class to be sweethearts."
