   "comments": [
    "Good introduction to Middle East state-building an insurgency. Covers a broad sweep of history and a broad geographical area while giving you frameworks to discuss that wide scope. I'd recommend this class, although it does cover such a wide range of times and places that it can feel like you never explore anything in enough depth.",
    "Comprehensive, challenging, eye-opening - great group of students from across disciplines and life experiences.",
    "Yes, it doesn't offer definitive answers, but it feels like learning about the Middle East's colonial history, and how COIN has been used there, are invaluable to understanding the region today.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is interesting and provides element to evaluate the current situation in Middle East (not North Africa). It offers a different perspective than the traditional from the state.",
    "I would recommend the course if the student is interested in covering a large swath of Middle East history, and specifically is interested in state formation.",
    "Good class; stronger on the historic basis of these conflicts than it is on the contemporary material."

   "comments": [
    "Had some background in sociological and political theory but learned a lot more. Opened my eyes to other areas of my discipline.",
    "This course provided me an interesting new lens for analyzing Middle East politics.",
    "Overall good; would be better if it addressed COIN from a more practitioner-driven perspective. The professor was upfront about saying his intent was about identifying problems but not proposing solutions--but that's not a particularly helpful stance. Yale classes should be held to a higher standard; anybody can just point out the problems."
