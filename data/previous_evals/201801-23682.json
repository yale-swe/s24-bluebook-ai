   "comments": [
    "Took my Spanish to the next level, in terms of grammer, speaking, and comprehension. Things started to click and I feel like I'm just one step away from fluency.",
    "I learned a ton of spanish. Sitting in class every day and hearing the language, in addition to all of the hw and oral projects\/activities we do, really helps to lock in fundamentals. I feel much better about my abilities than I did when I started the class.",
    "I developed my Spanish speaking, writing, and reading skills in this class",
    "I learned a lot of Spanish grammar but also how to be more confident when speaking in Spanish. I also think I learned a little bit about the culture of many Latin American countries.",
    "I learned how to read and speak Spanish more fluently.",
    "increased fluency in speaking and listening, lots of vocab, some increased knowledge of culture",
    "I fine-tuned my existing Spanish skills and built off them. I learned more advanced grammar and became more comfortable speaking. Overall, my Spanish abilities did improve in a noticeable way.",
    "Throughout this course, I was able to practice my Spanish speaking, reading and writing skills at a higher level. I saw the complexity of my writing improve during the semester, and my knowledge of grammar improved as well. I learned about several tenses more in depth and attempted to incorporate them into my writing.",
    "Practiced spanish",
    "Spanish skillz",
    "I learned a lot of advanced Spanish grammar, and I feel like my oral Spanish improved greatly through this course.",
    "I learned a lot more Spanish vocabulary and got a lot of practice with speaking Spanish, which improved my confidence and my ability to speak better without preparing beforehand. I also learned a lot of new grammar, and I greatly improved my reading and writing abilities too."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Latter half of course seems to be flooded with work. Could be improved by having more balance. First quiz was also ridiculously difficult, and I don't think we were sufficiently prepared for it.",
    "I think more low-stress, improv oral activities should be implemented. Make one day of the week -- every week -- a day where we sit in small groups and talk about a topic. The way the course is structured right now with oral presentations\/exams kind of allows students to prep and memorize material, which doesn't go very far when you're in a situation where you need to think of words\/structure at a conversational pace.",
    "The class is very well put together and keeps us engaged in class. The final novel (Las Batallas en el Desierto) was my only major complaint about the class because I did not really find it useful for the historical context.",
    "This class is sure to improve fluency in Spanish as it requires practice everyday with many activities for both reading and speaking. One weakness is that the class is very expensive to take; the textbook costs far too much money.",
    "There is way too many assessments in this course that the course feels more burdensome than enjoyable.",
    "Strengths: readings were more interesting than L3, listening skills improved a ton Weakness: not enough emphasis on speaking",
    "The course is work-intensive. A lot of homework is assigned every day, which is helpful for drilling in the grammar concepts. However, less time is taken for the application of such concepts. A 50\/50 split would be more useful. Additionally, my class was overenrolled. There were 19 students in my section--too many, in my opinion, for individualized instruction. Finally, the tests are a time-crunch and evaluate one's ability to regurgitate grammar more than overall ability to write clearly in Spanish.",
    "The strengths of this course is the everyday exposure to Spanish which allows us to practice our skills and grammar more often. The everyday grammar activities online helped us get better at understanding various tenses and syntax in grammar. Also the size of the class allows students to get to know one another in a comfortable settings, enabling more discussion and interaction. The weaknesses of this course though are that we don't always get to practice and improve our speaking abilities. There's not a lot of pressure to speak during class and no substantial activities to properly practice our speaking outside of oral presentations or exams. Perhaps this could be improved by incorporating more speaking activities amongst students during class, not necessarily in front of the class or just in front of the teacher. Working with other students would allow us to practice Spanish without as much pressure in the most comfortable setting attainable during class.",
    "It was good! I think more in class activities involving students speaking in groups or pairs could be helpful, so that more people can practice speaking",
    "Some activities (gallery) weren't worthwhile. Not much listening.",
    "The strength is that the stuff we do in L4 is much more interesting than L3, and I felt that the stuff we did in L4 was more relevant to everyday life than L3. The weakness is that this course is way too overloaded. It feels like we were bombarded with stuff to be doing at all times, which was similar to L3, but everything in L4 was much harder or graded much more harshly than L3. It was so much that I truly felt my mental health slipping by the end of this semester, trying to keep up with Spanish and my other classes. I felt like I devoted a huge chunk of time to Spanish (way more than 1.5 credits) and then I was scrambling to find time for my other classes\/activities\/jobs\/etc. It was crazy, and I nearly cried of relief when it was over. I love the Spanish language a lot, but I don't think I could ever take another Spanish class at Yale agin because of my experience in L4.",
    "The strengths of the course are that the students have many opportunities to practice speaking, and there is a lot of new and important information that is taught. The weaknesses are that there is a lot of homework and it can sometimes get confusing and overwhelming, especially since the syllabus is somewhat hard to follow. Additionally, some of the readings are not very interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this if you want to immerse yourself in Spanish and become better in the language.",
    "Yes, it's a chill course with a huge payoff.",
    "Most people taking this class will be taking it for the language requirements, but it is a good class to take, especially with Daro.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they really want to become fluent in Spanish.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to put in some work",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to elevate their Spanish capabilities. It requires a lot of commitment, but there is payoff. It requires a high level of dedication to and interest in the subject.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a good environment to continue practicing Spanish. I enjoyed the size of my class and the students in there. We were all at fairly similar levels in our abilities, and we meshed well with our teacher. Activities and discussions were fairly relaxed and left everyone the opportunity to participate if they desired. The workload was very manageable, and we were given adequate time to prepare for exams and quizzes. So far my Spanish classes have been my favorite classes since I've come to Yale.",
    "Yes, its fairly fun and engaging",
    "If you have to take it...",
    "This course felt like was being run over by a high-speed train every single day. The workload is insane from the first day, but, by the end of the semester, it felt like my entire life was slipping trying to keep up with everything the this class demands and then all my other classes and activities. Unfortunately, everything in L4 is graded really harshly, so your work is for nothing, because tiny, small mistakes will keep you from an A or even an A- (or lower) even b if you are putting the time into the class. It was an incredibly frustrating class for me because I loved learning Spanish and taking Spanish classes, but this class really sucked all the joy out of learning the language. L4 was much more interesting than L3, but I don't think I will take L5 after this course because I've been slightly scarred. Don't listen to people who say that Spanish is a gut language or anything like that. I am a double STEM major who has taken an lot of incredibly difficult classes at Yale, and Spanish was by far my most stressful class this entire semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it does a great job of getting students prepared for the more advanced L% Spanish courses. It's not an incredibly difficult class, but I still felt like I was learning a lot."
