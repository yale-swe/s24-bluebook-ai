    "This is a most-take course for every student of a liberal arts university. The course ought to be titled \"Intro to Early Modern Philosophy.\" The study of philosophy from Descartes to Kant has greatly shaped modern notions of self and epistemology. Take it!",
    "Awesome philosophy class. If you were a bit disappointed with Intro to Ancient Philosophy, this class will rock your socks off, especially because of the awesome instructor, Prof. Winkler. I swear, you fall in love when you hear this guy talk about anything; there is so much passion and energy in his teaching. The material generally focuses on metaphysics and epistemology in the early modern period, which includes philosophers such as Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and finally Kant. The workload is very reasonable (three 5-8 pages long papers + regular readings) and the grading seemed pretty reasonable for a philosophy class (the philosophy department is known for its generally harsh grading). I would recommend this class to anybody with the remotest interest in philosophy, especially if it's taught by Kenneth Winkler. Bear in mind though that the material is pretty abstract (which to me makes it more engaging and fascinating); if you want to take a philosophy class that is easier to grasp, perhaps Ethics or Perspectives on Human Nature are better choices.",
    "An introductory philosophy course for modern philosophy, reading Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.",
    "Crash course on basic early modern philosophy with some annoying Spinoza thrown in. Pretty awesome, but may be repetitive for you DSers.",
    "Yes, good course for anyone who's interested. I found it more interesting than Phil 125.",
    "It's a good into course to metaphysics... if that is something that interests you. If you are more interested in ethics, or other branches of philosophy, don't take this class. As an english major taking the class, it was difficult to adjust to the style of writing that is expected in philosophy courses.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course and Professor Winkler to any student looking for a thorough overview of early modern philosophy in an enjoyable setting. We read important works of important philosophers and discussed them at a high level. Professor Winkler in particular is a terrific instructor. He is incredibly knowledgeable about both the ideas and lives of the philosophers we discussed and was moreover a very kind and approachable teacher. He cares very much about his students and really makes an effort to get to know them, which I so much appreciated; he also organized a number of optional out-of-class activities, including occasional class lunches (at which we discussed the philosophers and texts in a more casual environment and at which he shared incredibly interesting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and amusing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 facts we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a chance to discuss in class) and visits to the Beinecke (at which we got the incredible chance to see first and second editions of many of the texts we read and more \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and at which he again shared incredibly interesting and amusing information from his seemingly inexhaustible store of knowledge). He was always extremely well prepared for class and always clear, organized, insightful, and even entertaining in his lectures. The focus of the class is certainly metaphysics and epistemology, although there is some occasional treatment of ethics in connection with the philosophers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 beliefs about the former. I thought it really was the perfect introduction to both the fundamental ideas of some really well known philosophers and to the method and practice of philosophical thinking. The class is designed tobe appropriate as a first course in philosophy yet at a high level nonetheless, which I absolutely found to be the case. I am so glad I was fortunate enough to take this class with Professor Winkler and would highly recommend it.",
    "Great class for learning about philosophy",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Professor Winkler is a clear and engaging lecturer.",
    "Great course. Interesting readings, fantastic lectures, stimulating sections, fair tests\/papers. Professor Winkler is great: lectures are interesting and lively, and his handouts are pieces of gold. Section is also well done. Take this course if you have even the slightest interest in philosophy. It's a superb introduction to the subject.",
    "Take the class with Professor Winkler if you can--he's thoughtful, engaging, and awfully charismatic. The material itself leans heavily towards metaphysics and epistemology, so some may find the material dull. I would recommend bypassing this class if you have interests in a particular aspect of philosophy and are not a philosophy major.",
    "It's an informative overview of modernish philosophers. But if you're really interested in Philosophy, consider DS as an alternative; the seminar format is usually a better way to learn about this stuff.",
    "Great class! I'm a science major and I decided to take this course to explore something new. It was a great experience. The readings were very interesting, Prof. Winkler is a great lecturer, and the TAs are very helpful in section. Take it!",
    "This course is an utter waste of time. It's effectively an introduction to metaphysics and skepticism, neither of which have any actual implications on actionable philosophical questions, taught in an incredibly analytical manner that sounds like it would be interesting, but actually just boils down to \"is this argument valid? are the premises sound?\" ad nauseum. Absolutely no creativity is required or encouraged when writing papers, and lectures are dry, but convey the material decently well. Take it if it's required for the philosophy major.",
    "Very much recommend.",
    "Eh... you're taking it because you want to be a philosophy major? Don't. Take a whole bunch of other courses first, decide if you want to major in philosophy, then take it as a senior\/junior to finish the requirements. Don't take this as a freshmen unless you are really interested it skepticism and epistemology.",
    "A philosophy course that examines a broad range of interesting topics.",
    "Yes yes yes. Especially if Professor Winkler is teaching it. I am biased, because I am a philosophy major, however, I don't see how one can find Winkler's lectures boring (if the reading was done, of course ^^).",
    "It is what is: a necessarily cursory survey of early-modern thought. Take it for Professor Winkler's excellent lectures; appreciate the intellectual-historical context it gives you; and on your own time zero in on what interests you. Descartes, in particular, deserves a proper six-day second reading."
