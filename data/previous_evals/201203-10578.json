    "CBB 740 is a class for both clinicians and computational biologists that gives a good overview of the two fields (clinical& translational informatics) as well as their intersection.",
    "Yep. This course is a required one for CBB students. I think I will recommend it. This course is not very easy to understand for a international student without a textbook to refer to. There are concepts we should understand and tools we should learn to use. It's a good way to learn.",
    "This is a must take course for any one interested in translational research. I have already recommend this course to other potential students.",
    "I would recommend it to students who may be interested in pursuing research in the area of clinical informatics."

    "I learned how omics tests are developed for clinical use as well as the various sources of omics data which are important to know about as a computational biologist.",
    "It deepens my knowledge pretty much. I have a background in physics and mostly in computational biology. This course helps me know much more about informatics, for example about how people deal with genome data. And the clinical part of this course is totally new to me. My performance may not satisfactory. And it may not related to my research that much. But I think it's nice to have some basic idea of how informatics can help us in clinical and translational researches.",
    "Gave me a better understanding of the clinical research tools, data standards and translational research techniques. I will use these techniques for my dissertation.",
    "It covered research methods, algorithms, and tools I was previously unfamiliar with, which was very helpful."
