    "Although it comes under the guise of an \"intro to academic writing\", English 114 may foster in you a strong dislike for academic writing. It is not as easy as it may appear; in fact, it is extremely difficult to succeed. You will, however learn a few useful skills and, if you're lucky, develop a thick skin when it comes to criticisms of your writing.",
    "I would recommend it to students who wish to learn about an interesting subject matter and improve their writing abilities",
    "I would not recommend this particular section of English 114. Take the course if you need a writing credit. The grading seemed arbitrary and the course work was not engaging.",
    "I would probably be indifferent when speaking to another student about the course. I would say that if they are interested in writing and improving their writing skills to take english 114 but I would most likely tell them to not take my section. This is mainly due to the readings and structure of the course."
