    "The course description for the course does not detail what taking the course is actually like. If I wanted to take this course, I would definitely talk to a student who had taken it before. I would tell the student if you want to be knowledgeable about the history and scholarship of icon studies, you should definitely take this course. I would also tell the student about the added work of putting together an online icon exhibition, both inside and outside of class time. That is the one thing I wish I could have better understood at the beginning of the semester, about how much continuous work the exhibition tookthroughout the semester.",
    "I would say it was an excellent introduction to icons, but because of the exhibition project it came to be considerably more work than I had anticipated or budgeted for. Still, now that the exhibition is taking shape, I'm getting very excited about its potential.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this class, and describe it as a collaborative means of exploring icons through the practical format of an exhibition. I thought the project gave a really excellent and meaningful shape to the class. However, the logistics and planning involved was often overwhelming and frustrating. I think the entire group often feltin over their heads in ways which detracted from learning about icons. In the future, a more concrete plan and schedule is needed. However, I was amazed at the way everything came together at the end, and attribute this in part to a wonderful group of people, and in part to Professor Nelson's expertise. While this comment will probably give away my identity, I did not find the workload to be fair: those who worked on exhibition essays ended up with FAR more work than those who did catalog entries. This was frustrating at times. However, I learned a lot from my project and was very glad to have participated. I also LOVED our class trip to Washington DC and thought Professor Nelson did an absolutely perfect job of planning and running it."

    "I knew nothing of icons to begin with, and now I feel I have a pretty solid foundation in them. I LOVED this area and wish I had the language skills to make it my outside field. I was completely bowled over by how crucial this field is for any area of art historical study in the west. Everyone should have to take a class on eastern Christianity."
