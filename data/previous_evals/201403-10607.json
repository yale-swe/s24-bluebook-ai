   "comments": [
    "Anth 584 is a course on the material culture and ritual practices of tribal Indian peoples. Several different peoples from different areas are surveyed, as well as different theoretical models for considering these practices and the construction of artifacts. It's a great course with a lot of opportunity to explore any topic you'd like in your final project. Cecile is extremely engaged as a supervisor and only asks that projects be close enough to her expertise that she can really help out. Interesting, intensive, focused, but not at all rigid."

    "This course gave me useful frameworks for looking at cultural practices around the areas I am interested in studying, giving methods of considering how and why certain objects are made and ritual practices done. This is very close to my academic interests overall, so the course was very useful."
