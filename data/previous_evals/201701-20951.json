    "This class gave me much more practice with speaking and writing compared to the vocab and grammar heacy nature of earlier classes. I enjoyed the combination of different types of writing -- news, fiction, poetry, etc.",
    "I improved my speaking skills in Arabic",
    "I gained some reading skills in the course.",
    "Although I am a native Arabic speaker, I have not taken any Arabic classes since for years. Initially, I thought that this class would freshen up my memory and strengthen my Arabic skills. This course definitely exceeded all my expectations. Throughout the course, professor Sarab focused on improving our vocabulary, analytical skills, speaking, and creative wiring capabilities. Together, those activities not only strengthened my arabic even more than when I lived in Jordan, but also made me fall in love with my native language, which I had lost touch with for years."

   "comments": [
    "I thought one strength was the constant emphasis on writing every week. I think it could be improved by having vocabulary quizzes to help us retain vocab.",
    "I didn't like the reading strategies unit. I did like the selection of literary texts, because they were mostly interesting and gave some interesting insight into the author's society. Sometimes class was a bit boring to sit through -- I think talking just to another student isn't really very helpful, and often trails off into students not focusing.",
    "Strengths are good course material. Weakness is low engagement from students.",
    "I really enjoyed the layout of the course and how each week was focused on a different type of writing. However, I would have loved to have had some proper grammar review\/teaching included in the syllabus as well. The variety of readings meant that there was new vocab every week, not necessarily building on the week before.",
    "The strengths of this course are numerous, but most importantly, professor Sarab encouraged all students to work together and challenge eachother both inside and outside the classroom. The collaborative vocabulary list that Professor Sarab created really helped me understand the texts better and research new words that helped my peers understand the texts. Moreover, we were encouraged to go to at least 2 arabic table sessions which really helped me learn from other Arabic language learners at Yale. Finally, although some of my peers thought that the texts were too challenging, I thought that they were perfectly suited to prepare students to take more difficult Arabic classes such as Arabic 167."

   "comments": [
    "This class is very different from previous classes in the sequence in that there is not really an emphasis on vocab\/grammar. There is a *lot* of writing for homework, and a good amount of speaking in class, so you get good experience. Sarab is awesome and it's a very laid back class, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend Professor Al-Ani, but I think the class could use improvement",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any Arabic learners."
