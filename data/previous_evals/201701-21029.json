   "comments": [
    "I much better understand the structure and function of the human brain.",
    "Damn I feel like I know everything now. You learn so much in this course. And you learn it all through sheer willpower and brute force. Weaponize with flash cards, quiz lets, study guides; and highlighters cause your ass is going to battle. Your ability to BS will not help you. You have been warned.",
    "I learned to think critically about the functions of human brain",
    "Learned a lot about the ins and outs of brain functions and the source of many disorders.",
    "I learned about the anatomy and physiology of the human brain.",
    "This was a great introductory course to the mechanisms in the brain and helping me to understand how structure does (or does not) connect to function.",
    "This course was challenging but gave an incredible overview of the human brain in a short period of time. 10\/10 would recommend for psych majors that like memorizing and need a science credit because it is very informative and not at all a waste of time like a gut science class might be.",
    "I learned a great deal about the human brain and how it functions.",
    "I learned a lot about the functions of the brain and their localizations in different sections of the brain. Starting with the basic anatomy, the course dived into the specific functions in greater detail than I had previously encountered. I learned to interpret primary source literature.",
    "I learned more than I ever expected to about the anatomy, physiology, functions, and theories about the brain. This was a neuroscience, history, and psychology wrapped into one, sometimes intense, but overall well-done course.",
    "I learned how to memorize a lot of material.",
    "I learned how to memorize that's for sure. Well, in actuality I learned a lot about the brain and now find myself drawing parallels between everything I encounter in my life and things I've learned in this class, which is probably a good thing. I also learned that it's not physically possible to remember every single thing for an exam and learned to just take the L and move on.",
    "I learned about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying our sensory systems and motor system. And also how to think critically about research in the field of neuroscience, in order to understand the inherent issues with some studies.",
    "A TON about the brain - so so much information! It was really cool.",
    "I definitely learned about how the systems in the brains are organized, what things researchers are interesting, and how those questions are approached (it's not quite about psychology though, far more about neuroscience).",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the human brain, and have used knowledge gleaned from the class in everyday conversations and discussions.",
    "I learned a massive amount about cognitive psychology and its relation to neuroscience.",
    "I learned A LOT about the human brain.",
    "I learned SO much in this course. I learned not only the basics about the mechanisms and anatomy of the brain, but how to critically analyze studies and engage with the newest studies.",
    "This class was incredibly difficult but absolutely worth it. Professor McCarthy has mastered the balance of breadth and depth, and every single lecture was engaging and interesting. No matter your major, I recommend this class (as a non-STEM major myself)--you won't regret it!",
    "How the Human Brain is organized, how it functions, and how we conduct research on it.",
    "I learned about the neuro anatomy of the brain and how it functions to give rise to different psychological processes.",
    "I developed an incredibly thorough and insightful understanding of the anatomy and psychological underpinnings of the human brain.",
    "I learned a lot about the functions of the brain and how specific processes work. I did not learn as much about brain anatomy and region-specific function as I expected to.",
    "This class gave a good overview of brain function. I learned how to evaluate more technical neuroscience papers and look at common themes throughout the brain's structure and general processes.",
    "Developed a strong understanding of cognitive neuroscience and brain anatomy",
    "I learned about how the brain is laid out and how it communicates.",
    "This is a really intensive class but the information was interesting.",
    "I gained a nice overview of the brain and some psychological phenomena that can be explained through the underlying circuitry of our central nervous system.",
    "I have gained a comprehensive knowledge of the human brain by taking this course.",
    "Very specific knowledge about the brain, mostly from an anatomical and functional perspective",
    "I now have a much better understanding of how the brain works.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about the way the brain functions, how we operate and think in the world, and I've gained a lot of knowledge in neurobiology that I otherwise wouldn't have known. Its fascinating to see how the brain can change and adapt, and how fluid these concepts of consciousness and self control\/will are.",
    "Overall this class gave me a great understanding of the anatomy of the brain and how each part functions. Not only did we learn gross anatomy, but we learned about many historical theories and how each modern theory came to be. Additionally, we learned a lot about how each part relates to many different psychological aspects and the intersection between psychology and function. Overall we learned a diverse range of techniques and tools to understand how the brain works and how our current understanding came to be.",
    "I got a good in-depth look at some important topics in neuroscience, which is what I was looking for.",
    "I greatly increased by understanding of the kind of vocabulary and concepts needed to discuss processes of the human brain. We learned about the relationships between structure and function within the brain, and we also read primary literature articles about current topics in neuroscience.",
    "I learned about the different systems and parts of the brain: sensory pathways, memory, stress circuitry, decision making, what happens when damage occurs to different parts of the brain (vmPFC, dlPFC, OFC, etc) and what function each part serves.",
    "A general understanding of the anatomy of the brain and its functions",
    "The course offers a thorough consideration of the brain, focusing on the association between the brain structure and function.",
    "We covered the complex relationship between anatomical features of the brain and the many functions of the brain, from attention, memory, and motion, to emotion and social reasoning.",
    "Test taking strategies and in depth knowledge of human neutoanatomy. Definitely increased my ability to understand studies of the brain and psychology in depth.",
    "THE TITLE OF THIS COURSE DOES NOT LIE. You learn about the Human Brain, all of it, every mechanism and every structure. Professor McCarthy takes you on a beautiful journey through the secrets that lie inside your skull, and you will sit in awe and listen. Hopefully you will consolidate some information (because you'll need it for the midterms), but if you just sit there and listen, you will learn more than you thought you could. I KNOW HOW WE MOVE NOW. I KNOW HOW WE REMEMBER. I (somewhat) KNOW THE MECHANISMS OF VISION. It's challenging, it's awe-inspiring and it's completely worth it.",
    "I learned how to relate human behavior and the workings of the brain. I also learned a lot about experimental techieques in the field of neuroscience.",
    "I learned a ton of information about the brain, from its anatomy to how it works to process internal and external information to its involvement in even more complex processes like social behavior. I gained a solid understanding of experiments on the brain: what types of questions can be asked, how to set up those questions, and how the brain's response can be measured.",
    "I learned a lot about the brain and all the structures that I have heard about before. Now I understand what are the structures involved in a particular study.",
    "This class was hard and included SO much information, but I absolutely left it having learned more than I had in any other class at Yale. Easily worth the pain of late study nights to know so much information about the human brain.",
    "In this course you learn about neurons and action potentials, sensory systems, functions of different brain regions, and much more. You develop skills of how to study for high content courses and it will be pretty clear right off the bat whether you are interested in the material or not.",
    "Gained insight on contentious topics in psychology while learning about the systems responsible for certain functions and patterns of behavior in the brain.",
    "Functional anatomy, contemporary issues in cognitive science, facts about brain lesions and their consequences, scientific method in investigating the brain, interesting phenomena related to consciousness.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about the brain from the point of view that I was wanting to. I learned that I don't mind memorizing when it is done in an engaging manner which this class really did for me.",
    "Knowledge of cirtuiries in the nhuman brain as a background for the new neuroscience major.",
    "A great overview of the brain and its neural circuitry.",
    "I learned tremendously in this classthe amount of information that Prof. McCarthey was able to pack into one semester was kind of incredible. I definitely didn't absorb as much as I should have or could have (its 1 hour 20 minute length and placement right after lunch make it kind of hard to focus) but I understand so much more about the brain than I ever thought I could know.",
    "I learned a great deal about the human brain - this was an excellent introduction to neuro type course with a lot of the focus on conceptual knowledge.",
    "I think I really gained a firm grasp on different areas of the brain, different brain imaging techniques, and different behavioral tasks.",
    "A lot of knowledge. About the human brain. As the name suggests.",
    "I developed a much more specific understanding of how brain anatomy and processes contributes to psychological and behavioral functions.",
    "In Psyc 160, I gained a deeper understanding of the neuroscience that reinforces psychological principles. Beyond the course material, I got experience in learning complicated material in a large lecture. There are a lot of subtleties to remember in this class; Human Brain is a large and complex course designed to challenge you but also provide the support you need.",
    "I learned about the anatomy of the brain, functions of different parts, and a lot about the relationship between neuroscience and psychological topics and syndromes.",
    "I learned a great deal about the structure and function of many of the aspects of the human brain.",
    "This was intensive introduction to the study of the brain. You learn about how the brain functions from all levels, the effects of brain damage, the current research being done on the brain, and the history.",
    "This class taught me about the organization and function of the Human Brain. The professor moves very quickly, so it is important to keep up and go to lecture. His notes were extremely helpful and I appreciated that he recorded and posted all of the lectures online.",
    "This course is outside my field of study, but I am very interested in learning about the brain and how the body works. I learned so much by taking this course.",
    "Everything to know about the human brain"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is extremely efficient. The syllabus and expectations are very clear, and the lecture notes\/slides are always uploaded before the class starts, with video recordings of every lecture uploaded on a similarly regular basis. The one weakness-- review sessions that happened on the same day\/time of the week every single day. Basically, if you have work\/any other class during that time, you're never able to go to the review session.",
    "Very interesting material. Very dry lectures. The administration of this class is perfection, a beacon in this dark dreary world of Yale. Change nothing. Material is also super interesting. You will work your ass off.",
    "Classes were very difficult to follow, but the notes online were super super helpful! There was no need to take notes in class so you could actually pay attention.",
    "Strengths: the professor provides all information, instruction, and help needed to do well in the course (and learn). Weakness: I would not ask students to buy the textbook: all information needed to well is covered in lectures and notes. Besides many students will not have time to read the textbook. Unnecessary spending could be prevented.",
    "Profesor was great, the content was really good as well.",
    "The lectures are very dense. Although the related notes are helpful, at times the lecture moves at a pace that is too fast to be productive\/engaging.",
    "The tests involve a lot of memorization in such a way that I think it would have been more helpful to connect broad themes rather than memorize minute details. The format of the course is very well organized.",
    "Prof McCarthy's resources for the course made me take the course more seriously because he put significant time and effort into teaching and providing the materials students needed to succeed in the class. He is an amazing teacher, and the material he chooses is all extremely relevant.",
    "Strength: Incredibly enganging, very interesting content Weakness: Incredibly difficult to keep up with. If you are not looking for a class with a massive time commitment, do not choose to enroll in psyc 160",
    "Professor McCarthy is a really good lecturer and engaging. Subject material is difficult but that's just the nature of the beast.",
    "The course is a nice introduction to neuroscience. I",
    "The course is hard and there is a lot of material, but I don't necessarily think this is a weakness. I think the course is well structure for delivering the amount of material that McCarthy wants to impart. A strength would probably be the availability of a lot of resources for those who may feel like they're struggling.",
    "This course was more a lesson on memorization than anything else. The amount of material we needed to know wasn't terribly huge, but I still felt like I was just learning how to regurgitate the information the TFs wanted to see on the exams. I wish this course had been more focused on the big picture, or that we had talked more about clinical cases and not neuronal-level basics.",
    "Strengths: really interesting content Weaknesses: Too much covered, truly the amount of material was overwhelming. Professor McCarthy's notes were over 160 pages and we had to know all 160 pages worth to be able to get at least an 85 on an exam. I think the course should really be split into two. Development Psychology also has a ton of info and Professor Keil's exams were only 5 long answer questions. He would give 35 potential essay questions before for which we had to prepare in advance only to be tested on five. Therefore, we were able to learn all the info, but nothing was a surprise. It would be helpful if the exams were in that format.",
    "I feel like a \"flipped\" class would work really well here-- the students would watch the lecture videos at home, and then during lecture time we could split up with TFs into groups, and have the professor work with a different group each session. I feel like I learned a lot from lectures, but what was lacking was discussion surrounding the material.",
    "The intense content of this course would benefit from the addition of a weekly section meeting to review weekly material with TAs and other students in the traditional format.",
    "The material is very interesting and very important but extremely dense and Prof McCarthy went too quickly sometimes in lecture. The tests are also very specific, sometimes it seems like he would test on minutae.",
    "It's actually a very difficult course (in the sense that the grading was tough and could feel arbitrary: if you didn't hit exactly what they wanted, you didn't get many points). That made it hard to take as someone who wanted to take the class because I was casually interested. That being said, truly, a lot of material was covered, and I don't have that much regret. It was annoying, however, seeing my psych major friends drop out of the class (while this was the first psych class I've taken in my life).",
    "The tests are too focused on minutiae and memorization. The structure of the final was excellent, however. Sometimes I felt the class lacked a clear narrative, and that we were just jumping between different subjects. The last unit of the class (\"Third midterm\") was FANTASTIC, and I would love to see some of the rest of the class structured like that.",
    "Interesting lectures, great professor who makes a lot of resources available (lecture videos, lectures slides, lecture notes, weekly review sessions)",
    "More feedback throughout on the exams and more parallels between how the writing for the reading responses translates to the exams would help.",
    "Strengths: incredibly well designed lectures; engaged teaching staff; detailed materials (notes and lecture videos) available online; the perfect amount of weekly work. Weaknesses: perhaps would have been better to have required sections instead of optional weekly review sessions, although it's my fault I didn't go to them",
    "There's no way around the fact that there's simply a lot of material to be covered, and I think this course is doing a good job of making it not seem as daunting.",
    "The lectures felt a bit long and dry sometimes but the content is very interesting. It was cool to compare different studies - it felt very relevant and important.",
    "Honestly, given the fact that Professor McCarthy would post lectures, notes, and the like online, and hold review sessions every single week, there is not much to improve upon here. My only thing would be making it easier to get our midterms back--perhaps passing them back after class on day?",
    "Strengths: Very well-organized, incredibly in-depth, fair expectations. Weaknesses: Fast-paced, easy to get behind, half the class drops it after the first midterm.",
    "I don't think the course has any weakened sea. It was well taught with multiple components and great material.",
    "Fascinating lectures, interesting outside readings.",
    "The lectures were very interesting but the exams were incredibly difficult. Because there is very little homework in between the exams it is slightly hard to tell if you're prepared for the tests or are keeping up with the information.",
    "The class is taught very well. However the exams are harder than they need to beat times it felt like they were testing what we didn't know instead of what we knew. Maybe covering fewer topics or not covering topics in as much detail to have just a little bit less information for the exams needing to be known would be an improvement.",
    "I think the class should have a discussion section where lecture material can be reviewed and discussed at length",
    "This course requires a lot of memorization, and does not focus enough on overall understanding of important concepts. It moves too quickly to really dive into any one subject.",
    "The class was super interesting and informative. I really enjoyed most lectures and felt engaged throughout, which is rare for a large lecture. Professor McCarthy is extremely knowledgeable and has done many studies about the topics he covers. I thought the class was well-structured and all the work was helpful in better understanding the material.",
    "The course covers a lot of material at a fast pace. For a student with limited background in latin, biology, and chemistry I really found myself struggling to keep up. If you come in with other knowledge the course may be much more manageable, but for an ~intro neuroscience course I found the amount and depth of the material to be overwhelming.",
    "The lectures were brilliantly organized and Professor McCarthy is an engaging (and humorous) lecturer. The lectures notes and slides were super helpful in prepping for lectures.",
    "Course lectures and assessments were very focused on the details, which is good, but didn't always underscore what the bigger picture was, or why it mattered. I felt I understood some of this from taking the comprehensive section of the final exam, but would have enjoyed the course itself more if these concepts and connections across topics were made clearer throughout the course. Thanks!",
    "The course is very well-structured. The professor really knows what he's doing. The material is fascinating.",
    "Strengths - lots of interesting content, professor posted recordings of lectures which you could rewatch before exams, loved the weekly review sessions and posting of slides and notes. mccarthy clearly is a great prof who cares about what he teaches on. However... weaknesses - *too* much information that was not very hierarchically organized, made it difficult to study and remember all the details; tests are highly detailed (will ask about specific patients in specific studies, for example) and there isn't much of a curve so there's a lot of pressure. most of the grades come from the exams. more of the course is about rote memorization than questioning of big topics.",
    "This was an increadly interesting course that went through the structure s of the brain structure by structure. After learning about each strucure, we looked at how it applied to different functions of the brain, both functional and psychological. This provided us with an excellent structure in which we learned what a structure does and then how to apply it to different parts of the brain. This class structure was carried out through the entire class making the material very absorbable.",
    "Very fast pace, but great material. Would be great if could spend more time on everything.",
    "Professor McCarthy was a great lecturer, and the course topics were well designed in that they build on one another. I also really liked that the lecture videos were posted online. I didn't note any major improvements that could be made.",
    "Professor McCarthy is super accommodating and it is clear how excited he is about the topic, which makes it fun to learn from.",
    "This was a very organized, well-designed course that provided a solid introduction to the human brain and related neuroscience topics. With that, the strengths of this course included the fact that the subject matter was very interesting and that the weekly reading responses aligned well with the lectures and enhanced understanding of the current topic. The biggest weakness of the course may just have been the fast pace that we had to move to cover all of the material, because studying for each exam was a bit daunting.",
    "Strengths: overview of the brain in general (not just clinical), lots of research examples in lectures, lectures are VERY well organized and planned in advance Weaknesses: LOTS of material covered VERY quickly, exams test material in detail, sometimes it's difficult to pick out what's the key part to remember",
    "The strength of this class was the professor. The weakness of this class was the lack of clear explanation of what was the importance of each lecture.",
    "The course was very detail oriented and many times, thenlectures was very jam packed with information, but many times, information that is not covered on exams and may confuse students.",
    "Strengths: very comprehensive, wonderful professor, etc. Weaknesses: quite a lot of theoretical information that can be overwhelming for someone who hasn't taken a psyc class before (like me)",
    "The class is very well organized.",
    "The course delves into a level of detail that did not always seem justified by the functional importance of what was learned (resulting in a seemingly unnecessary burden of memorization). That said, the course was very thorough and taking as a senior was an interesting opportunity to unite the bits and pieces I had collected through my other courses.",
    "Strong subject material coverage. However, the accessibility of the material was relatively low, and it was hard to grasp simply from the lectures.",
    "Strengths: materials, Professor McCarthy, review sessions, Professor McCarthy, posted lecture notes and PDFS, Professor McCarthy, recorded videos of lectures, office hours, PROFESSOR MCCARTHY. Weaknesses: Honestly cannot think of many. I loved it.",
    "I think the strengths are the lectures, the exams, and the reading responses. The lectures are fantastic, and I really appreciated the vast amount of resources I had to look back on when I was confused or forgot something, from the lecture notes to slides to the video. Another strength was Piazza, that was an incredible resource to have as well. I felt that the exams were very well structured and timed, with the right amount of challenging and straight forward questions. I also really liked the reading responses as a chance to engage with the material in a new way. I can't think of any weaknesses, this was a really great class.",
    "I thought that the course was a lot of memorization and I don't recommend it for fulfilling the science requirement.",
    "Interesting information. Sometimes an info overload.",
    "Strengths: Professor McCarthy. He is exceptionally knowledgable and gives wonderful and interesting lectures. More importantly he goes so above and beyond for his students, (recording the lectures, hosting weekly review sessions, etc.) He's an incredibly devoted teacher and it is immensely appreciated. Weaknesses:SO MUCH INFORMATION. It is really really hard to learn everything without your brain turning to mush.",
    "The 75 minute classes are hard to stay focused in, but it would be difficult to cover all the material in 50 minute classes. The class has an almost overwhelming amount of material, but if you are engaged in class and read the lecture notes those are very helpful.",
    "The beginning (learning basic brain anatomy, synapses, the visual and auditory systems) was not very engaging, but the second half of the course (social neuroscience, neuroeconomics, the frontal lobe, various disorders) was incredibly useful and pertinent. While the beginning of the course was certainly necessary understand the latter half, I think less time could be dedicated to the various sensory systems and more time to the applications discussed in the second half. This course is incredibly difficult but posting the lecture outlines was very helpful for studying for the exams.",
    "The course covers a lot of information, which I feel is broken into bits well, but at times (especially nearing exams) doesn't feel as though we have the chance to engage with the material so much.",
    "strengths: fascinating and up-to-date materials in cognitive science, dedicated professor and TAs, weakness: lack of homework for consolidation of knowledge",
    "It was really fast-paced and sometimes hard to keep up with some of the most difficult concepts, but the extra review sessions and the notes\/videos posted online really helped and made the class more approachable.",
    "The professor is very responsive and engaging. You can tell how much he loves his field and it makes you want to learn. I don't really understand the purpose of the textbook as the lectures already have enough information and the textbook does not really provide anything needed for the tests. I would've liked to either not have one or use it more.",
    "I think the course could do a better job of sequentially organizing information to make it easier to learn for students. There were a lot of topics that were partially covered earlier in the semester that then were fully taught at the end of the semester, which made major themes and topics in the course eventually come together, but I think overall understanding could be improved by first explaining major brain regions and circuitry and then using the second half of the course to integrate case studies and experimental tasks and research findings. I think the midterm grades in the course would have improved in this case. The instructor specifically pointed out that they were low and I believe that this is why.",
    "The course's biggest strengths are its organization and Prof. McCarthy. Professor McCarthy is an amazing lecturer, he explains everything so clearly and makes even useless topics seem interesting. He organizes the course in a really logical way, which makes it easy to understand why you're learning the things you are. The course's biggest weaknesses are its length and the midterms. with the length, it's honestly just really hard to focus for an hour and 20 minutes, but he goes so quickly that if you zone out for a few minutes you miss entire topics and it's hard to catch up. The midterms are (or at least for me they were) really hard reasonable, but I never felt like I actually knew what I was doing or could be super well prepared for them.",
    "The material for this course is extremely interesting and Professor McCarthy is an engaging lecturer. I thought that the lecture slides and notes provided a lot of knowledge and a great basis for studying for tests, and really liked the lecture video usage as well. It's a difficult course, but overall I really enjoyed it.",
    "Strengths are that there is a lot to be learned. The lectures are very well organized and well delivered by Greg. Weaknesses...not really anything. You just have to put a lot of work into it to do well. But it is very possible to do well. Don't shy away from this class. The TAs are an incredible resource and I think they're underutilized.",
    "The course is difficult, but the information is organized well and there are lots of helpful study tools. I often found that when I watched videos of the lectures, I did better because I could pause the video and process information with more time.",
    "The class material is challenging at times and there is a lot of material covered in each lecture. That being said, I felt that there were several resources provided in order to facilitate learning. Lecture slides and notes are available before each lecture which is great in preparing before each class. They are also helpful in studying for the exams. Professor McCarthy also uploads recordings of the lectures which is great in case you miss a class or need to hear a portion of a lecture over again before an exam. Again, you'll have to work hard before exams to make sure you have the material mastered but the exams were fair. You'll definitely leave feeling like you know a little bit more about the human brain!",
    "Content-wise, this course is wonderful because it grounds some of the more pseudo-scientific psychological findings in real anatomical patterns. Structurally, it is organized nicely, and Gregory McCarthy is very intelligent and composed. One suggested improvement: I wish there were more built-in times to communicate on a smaller scale with the teachers and TAs. This would facilitate communication between the students and teachers, and would prevent the course material from seeming so rote\/cut-and-dry.",
    "Professor McCarthy was a fantastic lecturer, and I learned so much from him. I appreciated that he provided so many resources to aid us in learning the material-lecture notes, lecture slides, additional readings, and piazza. These were all very helpful. The professor, format, and excellent and engaging instruction were the strengths, and there no weaknesses in my opinion!",
    "I thought this course was an intro course, however, I felt that there was a lot of information that I was unfamiliar with. The instructor was incredibly knowledgeable, but I felt that we went through the material too fast. This was an enjoyable course, however challenging it was.",
    "There should be more assignments\/grades besides the three exams. A section outside of the \"review sessions\" would help a lot as well. I felt largely unprepared for the exams and readings did not feel useful, though they were interesting. The way the instructor taught was very good, however.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting, i really enjoyed seeing the clinical aspect of the class and the biology. Weakness: Moves very fast, but I guess it's the brain so it is hard not to. The exams take up the entire time period, which i did not see the point of.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is the fact that one gets through so much material and through every major system\/area of the brain. This is also a weakness when approaching exams because the amount of material can feel a bit overwhelming.",
    "Not very participative but provides a lot of information useful as a basis of knowledge for any further engagement in the topic"

    "The sheer volume of information you have to learn in one semester is frankly terrifying. If you're not on top of your time management skills\/don't have that extra hour each day to be actively studying (and you do have to study for this course every day to be successful), this course will overwhelm you. And by God, don't take PSYC 160 as your fifth course if you aren't naturally inclined to manage your time well and\/or have a genuine interest in the subject. If you're just looking to fulfill a science credit: Don't take this course. Period.",
    "Yes: if that person is ready to work hard and is very interested in the brain.",
    "Yes but its definitely a lot of work.",
    "It is a great class to take credit-d-fail. However, unless you're a psych major or super interested in the subject, it is too hard to take for a grade.",
    "I would. This is a great science credit for students who are not afraid of hard work",
    "I would recommend this class to students if you take it with a friend. It is helpful to have someone to study with.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone in the neuroscience major. It is difficult and not always engaging, but as so many STEM classes go, it is necessary.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in psychology or neuroscience.",
    "Don't be scared by the other reviews you might read of this course...yes it is challenging, but Prof McCarthy gives out lecture note outlines, tapes all of the lectures on video, and provides PDFs of the slideshows. If you are a psychology major TAKE THIS CLASS! It is really interesting and also EXTREMELY relevant. I am really glad I took this class even though I was initially nervous.",
    "Yes,but only if you are willing to put in the work required. You will gain so much knowledge. Be warned though, It is very time consuming if you wish to reap its benefits.",
    "Difficult but super interesting. Definitely take it credit\/d\/f if you're not already versed in some sort of neuroscience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor McCarthy keeps the material interesting, and his own research in the field makes him uniquely qualified on the subject.",
    "I took this class CrD and never even considered changing it. I was hoping for an interesting psych class that wasn't a gut to be my 5th out of 5.5 credits this semester. I may have bitten off more than I expected, but still really enjoyed the class and thought it was fine week to week. There was a lot of rote memorization for the comprehensive exams, but it helped to already have a science background, especially in the first and last third of the class. The material can be a bit dry at times when you go into the minutia, but overall I would definitely take the course again. I think I definitely would have switched the class back to a letter grade if I had just had a little more time to put in. McCarthy has been teaching this class for a while and he has his lectures down pat. He tries to spice up 75 minutes of straight lecturing with videos which is helpful. tldr; Good class, more work than you may think, worth it if you want a little more intensive\/interesting CrD or if you're interested in the brain.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I am interested in psychology and neuroscience, and yet I did not find this course intellectually stimulating or challenging. Instead of being asked to think critically, you are only asked to memorize a lot of information (which you will promptly forget).",
    "Unless you need to take this class for a major, do not take this class unless you're literally only taking two others and even still be sure to Credit D it!! Don't play yourself.",
    "If you're interested in how the brain works, then definitely! It helps to have background in bio and psych though, and I don't think this qualifies as an easy science credit, because you have to understand and memorize a lot for the exams, of which there are only 3. But the material is presented in a very clear cut way, and professor McCarthy is a great lecturer (dull at time, but mostly engaging).",
    "If you're willing to put a lot of effort into the class to actually learn the material then definitely! It's hard but worth it. You learn a ton of really valuable information.",
    "I would recommend the class to be taken as a 2nd or 3rd hardest course in a schedule, definitely not as a 5th class that you take as your science credit: you'd want the time to really dedicate to this class in order to get the most out of it (or you'd want some background in psychology and neuroscience). That being said, it was a fun class, and I learned a good amount about important things, like attentional systems, memory, sensory systems, and more.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is specifically interested in neuroscience or anatomy. Although the course is marketed as one that can be taken by any student at Yale, it is definitely geared toward those who have some sort of background in biology and an interest in one of the aforementioned areas.",
    "I would recommend it if they are up for a challenge and have a strong interest in neuroscience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you find the material remotely interesting. Professor McCarthy is very passionate and knowledgable about the material and it's evident. I enjoyed getting a greater understanding about the functioning of the brain and the methodology behind this research. Even though I'm not a psych major, I'm glad to have taken this course (not just for the SC credit).",
    "If you are interested in the human brain and are very engaged with the material, I would recommend this course. It is hard and covers a lot, so it isn't something I would recommend taking \"just for fun\".",
    "This class is super interesting, but the exams are reasonably heavy on the memorization. Final is 40% synthesizing all the material, but 60% just another midterm. You have to know your brain regions well in order to do well, as well as the 2-3 most important functions associated with that region.",
    "Yes I took it as a science credit (because humanities major) and it was both vastly superior to my other science credit and a truly engaging experience in its own right. Really a fantastically designed course for those who don't specialize in psychology or cognitive sciences.",
    "Extremely hard, but worth it.",
    "Take this course if you're at all interested in the brain! It's a great combination of psychology and biology. It's not an easy course but if you're willing to put forth the work it's very rewarding. I learned a lot of things I've been able to apply to my every day life. The week to week workload isn't a lot (just a weekly reading response) but you definitely have to study hard for the exams (2 midterms, 1 final). That being said, it is doable and the material is so interesting that I would totally recommend it.",
    "You'll learn a lot in this course. It takes a long time to study because there is just such a huge amount of information given to you, but the content is straightforward and not conceptually difficult to understand. The notes and slides are uploaded for you online, and the professor is very open to questions and requests for help. I would highly recommend taking this if you're interested at all!",
    "This class was incredibly difficult but absolutely worth it. Professor McCarthy has mastered the balance of breadth and depth, and every single lecture was engaging and interesting. No matter your major, I recommend this class (as a non-STEM major myself)--you won't regret it!",
    "An in-depth, incredibly useful class about the human brain, probably essential for any psychology or cognitive science undergraduate who really wants to know what is being discussed in their other psychology courses. Very fast paced and many students will drop it after the first midterm, but if you can stick it out then definitely worth the time and energy. I would not take as a fifth class, but the shopping period classes will give you an idea as to how fast it is, what is covered, and what is expected of you. Notes, slides, and lectures are posted online, which is very helpful when studying.",
    "Already have.",
    "This class is the best class I have attended so far at Yale. The workload and study load is manageable, and the lectures are truly fantastic. If you are at all interested in psychology, anatomy, human nature, or people in general, take this course.",
    "The material is very interesting and the class overall is very engaging, but it is very difficult. If you are really interested in the material and are prepared to keep up with the reading then you should take the class.",
    "I would recommend this class as a C\/D\/Fail, but not for a letter grade. I did not enjoy the tests at all and felt like I wasn't mastering the material no matter the amount of studying I put in.",
    "Yes, if interested in the subject material and willing to work hard",
    "Absolutely not! Unless you are interested in majoring in Neuroscience or Psychology on the Neuroscience tract this class is not for you. The material is not presented in an interested way and there is an absurd amount of information covered.",
    "I would recommend this class to science and non-science majors alike. I am not good at science but found myself fascinated by the material, which made doing the work much easier and more enjoyable.",
    "If it's something you're interested in and may pursue further, go for it. If you just think it's interesting and need a science credit, look elsewhere. If you do take it, be prepared to really commit yourself.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are interested in learning about the brain beyond fun facts and are willing to put in the work. This class is a lot of facts, so it is easy to get lost and fall behind if you slack off.",
    "Absolutely. The course is definitely challenging, but Professor McCarthy really did his best to make the information as accessible as possible.",
    "I would recommend this course credit\/d\/fail. I feel like I learned a lot of interesting information and am more knowledgeable about the world, but that this course added a lot of stress to my life and was unnecessarily difficult. it depends on what you want to get out of a course like this - if i could do it again, I would credit\/d and just learn for fun (although downside is no science credit)",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I would particularly recommend this class to any student interested in psychology at all, as it gives you a very good understanding of how the brain works, and thus how it gives rise to almost all psychological phenomena. Additionally, I would still recommend this to anyone interested in the brain as it provides students with an excellent understanding of a very important human organ. Even if it's not your primary interest, a lot of it is very useful to know!t Therefore, overall I would recommend this to every studenr, whether or not it is in their course of study.",
    "Great interesting course, just a lot of work!",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the topic, you'll learn so much from this class. Professor McCarthy is a great lecturer, and his lecture videos are all posted online a day or two after class if you like online learning better. As other people said, this class requires a lot of work keeping up with the material. The tests are mostly pure memorization, but also ask some higher level questions that require integrating and connecting related topics. There's just a lot of material to remember is all. But it's great. If you're wondering about taking this either before or after MCDB 320, just know that taking this after Neurobio will make it so that you get a lot more out of the class IMO. You'll know the biological foundations for a lot of the subjects covered. However, about 30-40% of the material will be straight up review, which is not an entirely bad thing. It makes the class easier, but you also reinforce those concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the human brain, even if it is not for your major. That being said, it definitely helps to have some biology and psychology background, because the course moves quickly and covers a lot of material at a fairly detailed level. The exams are definitely hard and you need to study a lot (averages were around 70s on both midterms), but it is definitely cool to have a basic understanding of the biological basis that gives rise human behavior. Lectures can be pretty boring depending on the topic and often feel long, but some days they are great. This class definitely requires a lot of studying for the exams, but the workload on non-exam weeks is fairly low, and the material is generally very interesting.",
    "It was an interesting course and it is helpful to know about the brain and different functions, but it can be dry and requires a LOT of memorization. If you're not a psych major, I'm not sure if you would find it worth the work, but I think learning about the brain is definitely applicable and the lesion studies were probably my favorite part. Some people take advantage of the lecture videos posted and don't attend lecture but I would recommend being there at lecture.",
    "Definitely!",
    "The class is difficult but it is also interesting.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the relationship between anatomy and function of the brain, and not just the functions (in which case, intro psych or cog sci may be a better choice).",
    "Yes. If you're looking to understand neuro anatomy, this is the course to do so.",
    "If you have ever seen, remembered, moved, heard, imitated, imagined, empathized with or otherwise functioned, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's challenging, but in the best way possible. If you are ready to dive into the brain, take Professor McCarthy's extended hand and let him take you on a neural journey that'll blow your mind (and brain).",
    "Yes, it is a great course to take if you are majoring in a related field or not. It is very engaging, and Prof McCarthy's lectures are always really well organized and delivered.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, although I do know that not everyone had a great experience so take my perspective with a grain of salt. I felt that the material was very interesting, which made it fun to study. It was a lot of memorization, but that's something I'm comfortable with. If you are too, this is the class for you. The reading responses are super reasonable. The lectures are pretty well paced but you also have notes and slides and even video to go back to. I had a wonderful TF. From my point of view, the exams were challenging but straightforward. If I had studied that material, I was golden. If not, I was doomed. I had a limited background in bio which never held me back, and I had seen some stuff before in Cog Sci which was cool to connect but not necessary for doing well. Overall, I was able to do well by keeping up, starting to study early, and just being interested in the material enough to be motivated.",
    "This course was much more material than could be expected to memorize at a given time. However, it was a stimulating and fascinating course with great material.",
    "Keep in mind this course requires a LOT of work. Specifically, you'll have to memorize a lot. Tests can be quite stressful.",
    "If you take the class, I highly recommend just watching the online videos. That way, you won't be scrambling to take down notes and you can make sure you understand what is being said in lecture, which can go very fast, especially because of a lot of unfamiliar words.",
    "If you like memorizing things, take it. If you don't like memorizing things, do not take the class.",
    "This class is a huge amount of work and really tough. But it's a phenomenal class. You'll learn such cool information and it's one of those classes where you leave it a significantly more educated and knowledgable person. Professor McCarthy puts a ton of information into every class (and will test you on ALL of it) and he expects a lot from his students, but he's also a remarkably devoted professor (he records every lectures, posts notes, holds weekly review sessions, etc.). He really makes the class so worth your time and effort.",
    "Definitely take this if you are interested in the brain and how it works. The class covers a lot of material so you are looking at studying a significant amount for each midterm and even more for the final. I wouldn't recommend this to a non sciency student as it is not a gut, but overall it is a really great class and you learn a ton.",
    "This course was incredibly difficult. The second half especially you'll learn so much, and a lot of it is wonderful and applicable, but it's just so much information. That said, McCarthy is a great lecturer and very willing to help, and he posts lecture outlines which are so helpful for studying for the exam. Don't bother buying the textbook, everything you need to know will be in his lecture notes, and then some. Think very carefully about whether you want to do this to yourself I learned a lot but I don't know if I would recommend.",
    "Would absolutely recommend to anyone interested in learning more about the brain",
    "Would definitely recommend if you are at all curious about cognitive science and how the brain works! I think it's particularly good for philosophy students interested in the scientific aspect of philosophy of mind and philosophy of cognitive science. I think it's a great science credit for Humanities students too. The course will blow your mind and change your understanding of the human condition.",
    "It's a very interesting course and you get to learn a lot of cool things about the brain and how it works, while getting a lot of content from the current research being done in the field. There is some overlap with the content from other psychology\/cogsci courses that I've taken (like intro psych, intro cogsci) and it could get boring during those parts, since I'd already learned the material. It's not an easy science credit for those who are looking for one, but it's definitely a worthwhile course and a good (and probably easier) alternative to the MCDB neurobio class if you're interested in the brain.",
    "This course is very well organized. Dr. McCarthy posts the slides, lecture notes and lecture videos online, which is super helpful. But you have to be willing to put in a lot of work to do well in this class. I really enjoyed it, especially the units on attention, memory and emotion.",
    "I definitely enjoyed the content of this course. However, that had to do with the fact that I was very interested in going into the neuroscience field. This class helped me determine that it actually is not the route for me. Assuming people might be in my position of exploring prospective majors, I'd recommend taking the class CreditD as it is a lot of work and memorizing even though the material itself is not that difficult to comprehend.",
    "I think he could find a better way to present the information in a more logical manner, since a lot of the course seems to be jumping around and it is frustrating when things are mentioned and then not explained other than \"we will get into that later in the semester but know that it's relevant here.\" Alot of the time I also felt as though some of these connections that were mentioned were never revisited\/explained, and I think it was a missed learning opportunity when these loose ends weren't tied up at the end of the course.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, though caution them that it's not at all a gut science. Prof. McCarthy is great and lectures are interesting, though sometimes difficult to focus through. Midterms and final were hardI definitely did not get my highest grades in this course. But overall, I feel like I learned a lot and don't regret taking the course.",
    "Yes! For students who find neuroscience interesting or just want to learn more about human behavior and our brains, this course is an excellent choice.",
    "Yes. It's really interesting. It's a lot of work. I could recommend credit\/d, but also don't underestimate yourself. You might do better than you think. Start studying more than 24 hours before the exams.",
    "Yes! It's hard, but it's manageable and the subject is really interesting and worth learning.",
    "Yes, if you are genuinely interested in learning about neuroscience as it ties back to psychology. Yes, if you are willing to put in the effort to take advantage of the resources that the class offers. Yes, if you check in with TAs when you can and attend all\/most lectures. Communication and engagement is critical in a big class like this one.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in neuropsychology. It is very well taught, covers a wide number of psychological topics and syndromes, and you leave it feeling like you really learned a lot and will remember the material going forward. It is also reasonable in its expectations of work and exams.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is dedicated to learning about every aspect of the brain down to its chemical function.",
    "I would, but only with the understanding that a lot of independent study is required to do well.",
    "Yes, I would but I would mention that the amount of study time is much greater than I anticipated.",
    "Yes, absolutely!"
