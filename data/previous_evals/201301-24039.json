    "This class is very applied and interesting. It's great to be in a class where we learn the process of developing and implementing an entire intervention from the beginning. This will be very relevant for my career.",
    "This class is an enormous amount of work, and I'm not sure that I really learned very much from all of the work. The material in the class is very common sense, and I honestly think that I could have written the final project without ever attending class. It just felt like a lot of busy work. I feel that this class should not be required for SBS students, since it is so specifically focused on an issue that not all SBS students are interested in -- behavioral intervention development. As someone who is interested in program management (but not necessarily behavioral interventions) I had been kind of excited about this class, but ultimately I found it to be far too research-focused and lacking in innovative material.On a very specific point, it's frustrating that the work of each group is dependent on the topic that they choose, such that some groups end up planning many more lessons and writing much more material than others. I would recommend that groups be asked to write a couple of example lessons, but not necessarily all the lessons that are recommended to change the behavior.",
    "I was not enrolled in this class. I had asked to be removed from this list at the beginning of the semester, but for some reason I am still in it. Therefore I can provide an evaluation of this class.",
    "better for 1st year SBS as opposed to 2nd years. difficult to juggle the amt of work and thesis in the second semester of second year",
    "Great class for SBS students. A lot of work, but you learn a lot about how to design an intervention.",
    "I wish this course was designing an actual project.",
    "overall, i think this is a really good course. I learned a lot about intervention development, things to consider when doing evaluation of the intervention, developing a model for the intervention...and so on. I do not think there is any weakness for this course.",
    "Great course. This was a practical course and definitely had much pride after you finish the manual.",
    "Practical and informative",
    "I learned a lot and I am glad we had to go through the process of creating an intervention manual. I think the instructor had designed the course well, and it is a class that is very open to discussion and feedback.",
    "The course is very strong in that I think it really mimics what you would have to do if you really wanted to design your own intervention program. Where it is weak, however, is in understanding where the money for your intervention might come from and who you would actually have to pitch it to if it were a real program.",
    "Good experience working with a group. We all learned a lot and got practical experience developing an intervention. The class component was pretty interesting as well",
    "good class but a little bit too abstract at times. most difficult parts of the assignment aren't explained as well while those that are mainly common sense we spent a lot more time on.",
    "Good course. It differs from other YSPH\/SBS courses in that it is one of the highly practical courses. You really learn how to get an intervention \"from A to Z\", and I am sure that I could apply these skills at any type of intervention\/fieldwork in the future, not just in public health.",
    "This course teaches you the proper way to develop an intervention. The strengths include that we went over each section of the evaluation as we were doing it, making it easier to learn. You also have the opportunity to choose what kind of intervention you want to create; since the course work requires so many hours of work, doing a project you like is important to prevent burn out.One downside was that your type of project chosen has an impact on what you will learn; some parts of the lectures were not relevant to my project, and I did not get to practice them. Another downside is the amount of work required; some members of the class felt they spent more time on this class than their theses."

    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is an amazing professor. He is funny, engaging, and really makes sure we understand concepts. He cares about seeing our progression as interventionists and helps in any way he can.",

    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Wonderful",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0the instructor was very good at facilitating students to discuss and think questions related to intervention development and implementation. the assignments, although were very heavy, provided a way to students to apply knowledge learned from classes to the real project.Trace also provided any help we needed when we were doing the assignments.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was a really great instructor. He has a wealth of knowledge and is able to break it down in a way that is easier to understand. He really cares about his students and their understanding of the material.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is great!! I wish he was here during our first year! He cares so much for his students and definitely one of the best professors I have had at YSPH. There are no words!",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Amazing",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Excellent. One of the best professors at YSPH. He is very dedicated and helpful and really does spend a lot of time reading all of the work produced in the course.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is a great instructor. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and uses real life examples, but he's also very funny which makes the class go by quickly.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace provided very thorough feedback. He has high expectations for students, which contributes to a more positive& thorough learning experience. Class was also pretty engaging for what at times could be a dry subject.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was great. The one on one sessions with the group to review feedback were really helpful. He seemed to be somewhat unapproachable or indifferent in the beginning, so I was reluctant to ask for help, but he is actually one of the most responsive and patient professors I have had at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Great professor! Spent a lot of time helping us to develop and improve our interventions.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0good overall",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Enthusiastic about his work and I enjoyed learning about his projects with adolescent couples.The professor provided rich feedback on each section and it was obvious that he took the time to thoroughly read our proposals.His lectures and power points were very clear and he provided easy-to-understand examples. I\/we were able to use what we learned in class when planning our manual activities.The one thing I did not like was that he did not acknowledge all of his students on equal grounds. I completely understand that some people \"click\"with some students more than with others. However, he never referred to me by my name and I felt discouraged by this. I do not expect us to be friends, but if I am genuinely making an effort to be in the class, pay attention, and learn from it, I at least deserve to be referred to by my first name on the times that I raise my hand. This lack of acknowledgement diminished my motivation significantly.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is really a great guy. I have to say I almost didn't take the class because his personality is so laid back that he seemed to not care about the class in the beginning. After a few weeks you realize this is not the case at all, and his relaxed demeanor made the class more enjoyable. We had a lot of fun, butalways stayed productive."

   "comments": [
    "This course is demanding but very helpful for any one who wants to understand program design and implementation.",
    "If you don't have to take this class, don't. It's a huge amount of work for very little payoff in terms of learning.",
    "I was not enrolled in this class. I had asked to be removed from this list at the beginning of the semester, but for some reason I am still in it. Therefore I can provide an evaluation of this class.",
    "I suggest taking this first year. It's a huge time commitment and doing while working on a thesis is a bit much.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to nursing studentswho are interested in doing intervention studies. This is a must-have course.",
    "The class was a lot of work but well worth it. You get to learn some really practical, hands on skills about creating a health intervention. You learn exactly what goes into it from the planning stages to evaluation. Definitely my favorite class this semester. But, it was a LOT of work!",
    "Writing a manual from start to finish. Pick a problem and create solutions. This was a practical course. Learned a lot!",
    "Its a lot of work, but rewarding",
    "A lot of work but one of my favorite classes I've taken. Very practical and will really teach you the intricate steps of creating an intervention manual.",
    "If you're not required to take it, I still think it's a great class to take if you are interested inpossibly designing your own intervention one day, however, just know that it is a lot of work and if it's not related to what you want to do, there may be better classes for you.",
    "This class is very work intensive and can sometimes be frustrating because of the need to focus on so much detail. However it's a good learning experience for creating, presenting, defending a project and allows opportunity to work intensively with a group.",
    "This course is a lot of work and if you are taking it as an elective, make sure you are committed to it. You also really need to decide if you should pick a group that you know will be good to work with but maybe not a topic that you are really interested in OR pick your favorite topic and have an unknown group. It is a hard choice so I would suggest putting a lot ofeffort in trying to get both the good group and the good topic. If things aren't working out, seek help or guidance sooner versus later.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but it was a rewarding experience to create a full intervention from start to finish. Would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "Overall, I would recommend it, especially for those that are looking for a more practical skill set.",
    "This course guides you through the proper steps to develop an intervention, while you simultaneously develop your own (100+ page) intervention manual as your grade. I highly suggest this class if you have time for it; however, I think the most important goal is to choose a project you really want to happen. There is no way I could have done quality work without wanting to put my heart into it, and it would be frustrating to create this massive project that I had no interest in putting to use. Find a cause you care about and a way to intervene, and you will definitely gain a lot from this class."
