    "Presentation, learning about others' research.",
    "This is actually a great class, even though it might look like a perfunctory senior requirement. I learned a lot from my classmates about other topics in Cog Sci, received really helpful feedback on my thesis through the peer review process, and definitely honed my skills in giving presentations on research (read: include humor, say a swear word or two).",
    "How to write a thesis paper, practice presenting research, research skills.",
    "It was interesting to hear about other people's projects and to get experience talking about Cognitive Science.",
    "Performed independent research for the first time, which was gratifying. Developed my own research question, designed experiment methods on Qualtrics, and gathered data on MTurk.",
    "learned how to execute an independent research project on my own, in particular gaining an appreciation for the challenges that appear at every level of the process.",
    "I learned a lot about the fascinating projects that my fellow Cog Sci students were working on. I also learned about the different steps of producing a multi-month piece of research and staying on track throughout.",
    "I had the opportunity to apply the skills that I have gained over the past three and a half years. Having a regular class specifically devoted to the thesis really enhanced the process for me and I felt like I gained a lot from the semester.",
    "I saw a research project through from start to completion and learned a great deal about honing and editing my work."

   "comments": [
    "I would encourage some structure for CogSci seniors in the fall semester; at the very least, a few check-ins to make sure that seniors are beginning work on their projects.",
    "good that there are regular progress points - there could be more check-ins through the first semester though, although the course does not meet then.",
    "This class was practically perfect, and I can't think of any suggestions to improve it.",
    "The course is solid and well-organized. Mark is very explicit about the schedule and the reasoning behind various times and dates which makes the whole process more approachable and less intimidating.",
    "This course was a good way for us to present our work and receive feedback once that work was substantively underway, but this would be a far more useful course if it were the second of two CogSci thesis credits. This major, and this course, would be improved by having the option, as many majors do, to receive credit for working on the senior thesis during first semester. The Cognitive Science major asks students to complete a research project - one that offers a \"new contribution\" to the field. It undermines the quality of the work that we are able to produce to not have an option for a two semester thesis, especially given the time consuming nature of performing research. Not every CogSci student is able to spend hours of their own time preemptively conducting research to be prepared for CGSC 491 and to ensure that their project will be accomplishable in the time allotted. I strongly believe that students' experiences with the course, as well as the quality of research and presentation during this course, would be improved by adding this option. Further, I think the course would be very much improved by changing the peer review assignment. The current structure results in students spending an entire week of the last 4 weeks before the thesis deadline frantically trying to read 100 or more pages of other students' work and to (sometimes unsuccessfully) provide substantive feedback on a paper that is typically far from our own limited expertise. I think it would be far more helpful for us to be paired with one other student who is closest to our own topic or area of interest so that substantive feedback can be given in a far more manageable manner."

    "A great senior seminar! Was really nice to get to see all my classmates present their thesis.",
    "Required for Cogsci majors, but also yes!",
    "you have to take it if you're in the major...",
    "It is somewhat meaningless to recommend or not recommend this course, seeing as it is mandatory for everyone in it, but it is definitely a great experience that you should look forward to!",
    "Yes, cognitive science is a great major and part of what makes it great is the small, but devoted community that you a part of. This class is a great example of that. You have sharp peers read over your work and a wonderful professor holding your hand through the thesis process and there every Monday to answer your questions.",
    "Be prepared that if you do not come into this course already with a solid understanding of your approach to your thesis and a good amount of planning and background research already under your belt, it will be a very stressful and chaotic semester. The course itself is okay - people pretty much just present on their thesis, which can be cool, since they are all so different - but what is expected of you in a CogSci thesis is a huge undertaking for one semester, so I would advise being ready to hit the ground running right away."
