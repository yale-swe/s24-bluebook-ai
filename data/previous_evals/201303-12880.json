   "comments": [
    "I would describe it as an excellent survey course of 16th-century French poetry, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest either in that time period or in poetry and poetry criticism more broadly.",
    "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a course in literary history with a great deal of difficult but rewarding reading.",
    "In French 830 01, we read and discussed mostly short poems by poets of the French renaissance Pleiade school. In class, we would read and discuss several poems from that week's readings, and Professor Duval would touch on relevant Greek and Roman myths. Work outside of class consisted of four close readings of short poems spread throughout the semester. I would recommend the course. It gave very useful context for literary culture in 16th-century France and familiarized us with major poetic works and poets of the time."

   "comments": [
    "It filled an important gap, and though it does not relate directly to my primary interests, I still found it very useful.",
    "This course does not apply directly to the area I expect to research, but it provided essential knowledge of French literary history and familiarity with canonical works and poets."
