    "A decent, easily-digestible science course for non-science majors. Not much work, marginally interesting. Overall, I didn't love the course or feel like I learned a tremendous amount, but it was a painless way to get rid of that pesky last science credit.",
    "I took this class because I desperately needed a science credit, and I'm so glad I did. Far from just fulfilling a distributional requirement, I learned a lot of really fascinating and important things about human behavior, and was able to tie them back to my core interests in the humanities. But what really makes this class special is Professor Valeggia. She is best professor I've had at Yale so far (and this is in a class I wouldn't have taken unless I had to). Incredibly committed, passionate, and funny, and she cares more about her students' well-being than any other professor I've had. I'm so lucky to have had her as a professor and I can't wait to take another class with her.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course-- it is a fun and interesting study of evolution and how it plays a role in our lives today. It is taught at a good level for someone who hasn't studied biology since high school!!",
    "A fun, interesting science class for those in need of a science credit. Interesting and fun, but only if you are okay with talking about the menstrual cycle, menopause, and menarche a lot (which I was so it was cool).",
    "Take it if your'e interested in the material but try to stay on top of the material even if you don't always go to class.",
    "Class on human evolution. Not the easiest science credit, but also by far not the hardest.",
    "Do you want a science credit that is fascinating, well-taught, and a reasonable work-load? If so, TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Valeggia is great. She starts every class with a meditation. She wants you to talk to her about your questions. She values students as people before she values them as workers. She asks you to do a fair amount of work, but nothing unreasonable. I wish I had taken this class as a freshman or sophomore. I would have added anthropology to my list of possible majors. What other science credit is in the WGSS department? No other science credit. None. This class was such a treat. I didn't expect to enjoy my science credit so much.",
    "A science class that is interesting and not just a rehash of base level concepts - certainly a rarity at Yale, and one that I enjoyed! There is so much interesting material in this class, Prof. Valeggia is a really nice lecturer. The workload is manageable, and the material makes you learn a lot about the world around us. Definitely recommend",
    "Great class! I used it for my second science credit as a senior, and I learned a lot of very interesting material.",
    "This is a GREAT way to get a Sc credit. It is not a gut class, but it is SO interesting. As a Theater Studies major, I didn't feel out of my league, mainly because Professor Valeggia is such a wonderful and generous teacher. The material is absolutely fascinating, the workload is just right. Definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about biological anthropology. However, I would not recommend it as your first anthropology class because the genetics can be tricky. However, as an Anthropology major, I felt fine in the class.",
    "An interesting class -- lots of good cocktail conversation -- but sometimes a little rambling. Good for a science credit.",
    "Yes, it is a manageable science credit.",
    "Claudia is super sweet but isn't the best at explaining scientific concepts would have appreciated more thorough explanations. Weekly discussion questions were kind of a pain, and I wish they were more closely related to what was discussed in lecture (they sometimes weren't). I do appreciate that this class wasn't particularly science heavy, and instead stressed life history theory and biological anthropology.",
    "A science for social science students, in EVERY sense. Yeah, it's approachable: basically an interesting high school-esque science class. Pretty light on memorizations, diagrams, chemicals and weird names. But more importantly it ACTUALLY taught me a new way to think about humans, behavior, and variation. Lectures were all interesting. Yes, she puts up slides but they really don't cover what she says in class so get off your butt and go. Okay, I ubered like twice, so I can't really talk, but it was far. Still, a class everyone should take. Done. Also, TA's were nit picky, it was annoying. But it was graded incredibly fairly- TA's rotated grading reading responses, graded sections of the exams, and graded our finals blind. They gave really thorough feedback on our reading responses, I was impressed.",
    "Yes! It will definitely change your perception of what is \"normal\" about the human body and evolution.",
    "An interesting and medium-level-difficult science course for both STEM and non-STEM majors (I am in the latter category). I would recommend it to another student.",
    "As an applicable and interesting science credit, ANTH 242 is certainly a class that I would recommend to another student, and I think that seeing Professor Valeggia in action would show someone that. My only main qualm with it is the grade distribution, because if you mess up on the midterm or the final exam, you're basically done for - just be careful!",
    "Dear fellow students, This class was a really great SC credit. I found the material to be extremely interesting - throughout the semester, I was constantly trying to determine the adaptive significance of the behaviors and characteristics of all of my friends. It became kind of like a game. Anyway, ANTH 242 is not too difficult, and also not too biology-heavy. It's really more about genetics and heritability, which I find to be a more interesting on the whole, and also more relevant for someone who won't be pursuing biology to a significant extent in college or afterwards.",
    "I took this class to get my science credit and was a little intimidated at first because I had forgotten EVERYTHING I had ever learned about biology and it looked like we were going to cover a ton of material in one semester. However, I LOVED it after the first day and came out feeling like I had learned so much that is relevant to understanding our everyday lives and our world! Professor Valeggia is absolutely wonderful; she is so caring and makes a huge effort to make the class accessible to people of all majors and interests. She emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach to the subject by looking at every unit of human evolution, our biology and our development through a sociocultural lens as well as a scientific one. You will learn to think outside the box of the \"Western gold standard\" that most of us have grown up assuming was the norm for human development and medicine. The midterm and the final were extremely fair, although you do have to put in the work to make sure you have a comprehensive understanding of all the main concepts since you will cover a lot and move pretty quickly. However, the professor and the TFs are super accessible and offer a lot of outside resources to make sure you're understanding the more complex concepts. Finally, Professor Valeggia starts each class with a 5 minute meditation, which I really appreciated because it let me calm down and focus.",
    "If you need a science credit, sure.",
    "Amazing science credit for non science majors because it is such an interesting subject.",
    "I would recommend it to social science majors for sure, probably not so much to science majors.",
    "I wouldn't recommend. Maybe for a science credit, but just such a hodge podge of info that isn't contextualized. Little assistance given to students for the final exam, who were asked to 'internalize but not memorize' *any* information from readings and lecture presentations.",
    "It's a good science credit and a good course in general. The readings are pretty dense but you don't have to do them, and if you do, they're interesting. I learned a lot of interesting things in this class--I think everyone would benefit from looking at humans with an anthropological, biological view. There are weekly discussion questions in the class, which get tiresome, but in general it's pretty easy. Prof. Valeggia is a good lecturer and a really nice person who, I sense, wants everyone to be happy. Each lecture begins with 2 minutes of meditation.",
    "I think it was a great class in that I learned a lot that was wholly relevant to my life. I think everyone should have a good grasp of human evolutionary biology. At the same time, I think some topics were skirted over a bit too quickly and could've been discussed in greater depths.",
    "I took this as a science credit, and one that I needed for my HSHM major. It was a good class to take, interesting with pertinent information. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a science credit where you actually learn something, but isn't incredibly difficult.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is both a good science credit for non-science majors and a good social science credit for science majors. The professor is engaging, material is mostly accessible to non-science majors but not at all easy or boring, and the TFs are accessible. Definitely try to take a course with Professor Valeggia; she is wonderful.",
    "Take this class if you need a science that is light on the equations and more concept-oriented. Really interesting and relevant to your life! And the professor is fantastic.",
    "Absolutely. You come to Yale to learn about humanity, and you can reach all the Schopenhauer, Proust and Euclid but never understand why exactly the human body works the way it does.",
    "This class was a bit heavier bio than I expected but overall very fun and interesting! The weekly response was not hard and grading was a little strict but fair. Go to lecture, study for the tests and let yourself enjoy the material! Think big picture.",
    "this course looks at human life history and anthropology through an evolutionary biology lens. I would recommend it as a science credit for non-science majors, particularly those with an interest in humanities and how science perceives human persons today",
    "Wonderful science course worth taking no matter who you are.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Take a large psych lecture or a smaller bio seminar if you want to learn interesting material and actually be able to stay focused and not frustrated in class. The class may seem like an easy science credit but is much harder than you'd think since it's so big that the curve will probably not be in your favor. You'll end up learning all the material yourself, save yourself the time and take a better class.",
    "I would tell everyone to shop this class. It seems the kind of science you'll see everyday in the world around you. And one of the greatest feelings around comes when you can apply your education to everyday life. The class explains why we are the way we are and who wouldn't want to know that? As long as you are curious and unafraid of a little science, then the class is the right fit for anyone."
