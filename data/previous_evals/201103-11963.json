    "Great class! I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it! Reading responses are actually fun to write and help with approaching the material",
    "Extraordinarily interesting, and not too much work. Definitely take this class.",
    "If you're looking for a Humn seminar, take it! As far as seminars go, the reading is manageable and if you've any interest in ancient near eastern literature, unwaveringly interesting. The weekly reading responses are quite honestly often fun to writer, rather than a labor, and the course involves a trip to the Babylonian Collection here at Yale, which is quite impressive and worth a trip even if you do not take the course, as well as the Met. Both events allowed for a great hands-on, tactile approach to the material. The professor is incredible in her knowledge and one of the kindest professors I've ever had and the other students in the class were awesome and made it that much more enjoyable.",
    "An excellent investigation into classic works of Mesopotamian literature and related traditions in Greek literature and the Bible. Highly recommended."
