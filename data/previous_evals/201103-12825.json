   "comments": [
    "Fantastic fantastic class! It has been my favorite by far at Yale. All the teachers are great! Very encouraging and supportive. It is a big time commitment with quite a bit of work but well worth the time.",
    "Chinese was my favorite class this semester. The small class size and phenomenal teachers make you look forward to class. Essentially the majority of the class is just chatting with the teacher or other students (in Chinese) and incorporating the new grammar points and vocab as we go along. It is a lot of work, but the daily quizzes and homework assignments just ensure that you consistently work hard and learn a great deal. The grading system is fairly forgiving, as it depends on such a large number of things that you never really have to stress out about a couple big tests or papers. If you work hard, you will do well, you will be amazed how much you learn, and you will love going to class. It is hard for me to imagine a better-taught class.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you're interested in Chinese. While there is a fair bit of work, it's not nearly as bad as is reputed (i.e. not 4 hours a night). It's one of the best foundation language courses I've taken here (I've taken 3), and each teacher is great.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend CHNS 110. The program is rigorous. If you make sure you keep up with the daily work (which, in its defense, is very reasonable) you will have no problem. The way the course is structured with its daily courses makes it effective. All introductory language courses should be treated this way.",
    "It really does require 2-3 hours of homework a night, but if you do the work (including reviewing the next day's lesson) you are practically guaranteed an A. Also note that you don't really learn anything about China, so don't be surprised.",
    "Chinese 1 is an excellent class. There is a lot of work but it is all worth doing and you never feel as though it is purposeless. The program is incredibly well run and the teachers are organized and talented. The amount of assessments (quiz every day, 5 tests) makes you feel as though you always know what your progress is. Generally excellent choice for anyone looking to start a new language at Yale.",
    "It's more intense than probably any language at Yale, but it's a very well structured course and definitely worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are willing to put in the effort to learn Chinese. It is a language that probably takes much longer time for most people to master, so one really must be interested in the mere process of developing all the skills little by little in order to start communicating. The structure of the course is very intense and fast-paced, so there is plenty of work to be done every single day. Oral presentations were unnecessarily stressful for me, because we had to memorize whole dialogues that kept getting longer. I felt that didn't exactly helped my speaking that much, since I was so worried about remembering what I was supposed to say that I just didn't sound fluent at all. We also have daily quizzes and weekly chapter tests, but those are not too bad, even though memorizing the characters can be tricky sometimes. We need to go to weekly tutorials with a grad student for improving pronunciation, and there are two computer-based listening and speaking exams. The good thing about having so many things to do is that your grade is most likely going to reflect your work throughout the semester and won't depend mainly on your final (15% of the grade), which actually isn't too difficult either.",
    "I love everything about this course. Daily quizzes are VERY reasonable and help you pace your character learning (they only test you on one out of 5 every day). The teachers, with the exception of Xiao Laoshi, are all incredible, and the fact that they all stress different things about the language makes you learn it much better. I liked the new textbooks a LOT - they're structured very conveniently around dialogues and sets of vocabulary terms, although the weekly recitations of a dialogue got a little old. Daily homework comes in very reasonable quantities (an hour or so per night) and helps you learn the language much better than if you just had to turn in a workbook every week (which was my experience with French at Yale). If you want to learn Chinese, Yale is the place to take it. My favorite class by far.",
    "If you want to invest good amount of time in this course, you will learn elementary Chinese very quickly. Good course.",
    "You should definitely take this if you want to learn chinese! You will absolute learn a lot if you put in the work. It's a fun class and entertaining."
