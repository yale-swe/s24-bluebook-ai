   "comments": [
    "It is an introduction to the history of digital video art from the 1960s or so to today (as opposed to film). Also, it is an introduction to the current softwware used to edit videos--final cut pro, after affects, photoshop, soundtrack pro, bridge, etc (lots of programs as parts of the adobe creative suite). I would recommend this class only if you are willing to put in the work. You get out what you put in, and it does take a lot of extra hours, outside of class time, in the video lab. Super-rewarding when you create something like a digital video, scored and editing by yourself. Also, I would recommend this class as unique to yale curriculum in that you leave the class with a tangible skill--something you can do with your hands, and put on your resume. it's wonderful to have that.",
    "Yes! It's a lot of fun and you get to learn a lot about video art (and also the contemporary art world, since it's a medium that hasn't been around very long at all). It's also a really useful class: you'll learn Final Cut, After Effects, how to use various video cameras, how to composite with greenscreen...etc. Really cool.",
    "Lots of work, but if you want hands on experience with this material, go for it.",
    "Quick technical overview of a variety of programs that will alow you to do basic video editing, effects, animation, soundtracks, and also light, use a green screen, and several types of digital camera. Additional introduction to video art and some discussion of film structure. I would recommend Art 145 01 to all fellow students, including students who would not be inclined to take what may at first sound like a technical course. I would advise the student to take notes to avoid confusing processes from one program with another.",
    "This class introduces the basics of digital video production in a fairly laid-back setting, with an emphasis on more experimental, video art applications rather than on narrative film. For the first half of the semester you focus on individual components of the production process--filming, editing, sound editing, animation--and at the same time you get some exposure to the history of video art and the different approaches various artists have taken to the medium. For the second half, you're working on a large-scale independent project of your own. Johannes is really nice and an effective teacher, very helpful and encouraging, and you have the opportunity to go at your own pace--you'll really get as much out of this course as you put in. I'd recommend it if you want to learn to use Final Cut Pro and related software without the more rigid structure of the narrative film courses.",
    "Yes, this is an excellent introductory course if you want to gain some experience with Final Cut Pro and digital cameras.",
    "The class provides a basic introduction to the means and methods of making short films. Instruction in production technique is supplemented by screenings which demonstrate a number of different approaches to film. Yes, I would highly recommend the class."
