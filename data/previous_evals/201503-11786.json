   "comments": [
    "Yes. Pretty interesting and pretty low intensity for an econ seminar. You read 2 economics papers\/ studies per week which are usually pretty cool",
    "Not worth it. There are better Econ senior seminars out there, and the workload wasn't THAT bad, but the grading wasn't great either. Go find an easier one, or one with fairer grading.",
    "A good course if you're looking for an interesting development economic course and a senior seminar in Economics without too much work. The grading is a bit harsh though, so meet with the professor early on to see how you can improve. But there's no final exam!",
    "I would recommend this course to other people. The topics are interesting, but you don't really leave the class with a real sense of the \"economics of africa\". We focus too much on specific economic studies instead of looking at overriding themes and patterns and solutions. The work load is consistent, with two reading responses due every week (only one is graded, randomly chosen) that often take a while to write. There are two papers, and you definitely need to come to class with something to say. On the flip side, you definitely build upon some of the concepts learned in econ electives and the core courses.",
    "I highly recommend this seminar! Professor Doss keeps the discussions on track and productive, and the workload is pretty reasonable. I think this class pushed me to look at development research with a better critical eye, to do more than just compare research against the gold standard of randomized control trials and to really look at the value of research. You also get to read a lot of innovative and interesting papers in Dev Econ. (Pro tip: you will never use the African Economic Encyclopedia textbook, so don't but it unless it's on sale.)",
    "This class is simply a discussion of selected econometric papers on Africa. It is not very enjoyable if you want an engaging class or exploration beyond your homework. It is not immensely hard, but it is immensely unrewarding. Don't take it. You can find a seminar of the same difficulty that is much more interesting.",
    "Yes, take this class if you are interested in the material. It' s not a heavy workload or too difficult and discussion is generally good and well managed. If you're focus is 'Africa' in particular though and you really want to learn about the continent, take a different class maybe in African studies.",
    "I would definitely NOT recommend this class to any classmate. This class is not interesting or engaging and the workload is very heavy if you want to do well. I felt that I learned nothing in class because we spent half the time on student presentations and half the time on discussions that didn't really evolve. I think a lot of people go into this class expecting to learn more about Africa but this is definitely not what you are in for here. Prof Doss has a lot of fieldwork experience in Africa but is a lot more interested and focused on discussing data collection. This could be potentially interesting but ends up being a pain because she emphasizes data collection methods above anything else without really explaining much and expecting us to simply \"get\" everything by ourselves. The workload was also among the heaviest I have ever had in a seminar. The reading load is okay but having to do 2 worksheets that are harshly graded out of 10 every week is a lot and very draining. It is particularly annoying when you spend days doing a worksheet and get a bad grade and then do one 2h before class and get a top grade- grading seemed random and it was hard to improve without guidance. Do yourself a favor and pick another seminar",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in reading economic papers about Africa. The course is reading heavy. The writing assignments are spread out well throughout the semester."
