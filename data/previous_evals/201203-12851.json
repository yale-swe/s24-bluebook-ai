   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It really helped me develop my speaking skills. Also, the homework load is completely manageable. You will usually just have a short reading or writing assignment that you will then discuss the next day in class. I enjoyed this class.",
    "If you are looking to fill your distributional requirement for Spanish, SPAN 150 is a great option. I would also recommend taking the course if you want to maintain or develop your Spanish conversational skills. The workload is manageable and relatively consistent throughout the year. The units are varied, ranging from ethics to watching popular Spanish movies, so it's pretty easy to stay interested throughout the semester.",
    "Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be intimidated by this class being L5 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there are no native speakers in the class, so if you got a 5 on the AP or did well in L4, you should be fine. With all the readings, projects, movies, and assignments, I would say the class is pretty interesting and pretty easy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not earth-shattering or anything, but the readings were real-world readings about real-world issues or high-quality short stories or novellas, and the movies were acclaimed international movies. My Spanish did not improve by leaps and bounds, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m certainly more comfortable speaking now, which was before the weakest part of my Spanish abilities. Prof. Carballal was a great instructor. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and accessible. She wants you to do well in the class, and I recommend taking the class with her if you can.",
    "This is a great L5 class straight out of L4, because L4 teaches you all the grammar you need to know but you don't necessarily have much practice speaking\/listening in Spanish. Take it with Profesora Carballal! She is great!",
    "Good class with the opportunity to improve your Spanish speaking ability. Not too difficult.",
    "Spanish 150 03 was a discussion based course which covered a wide variety of topics. Homework usually involved reading articles or a novel and the following class we would discuss the material. We participated in debates and role playing to practice speaking. There was minimal written work and only 3 or 4 written quizzes. The midterm and final were oral examinations.",
    "I recommend the class as a way to maintain your Spanish.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to a student looking to fulfill their language requirement and\/or improve their speaking. It is a class that doesn't require a ton of time investment, but actually feels interesting and relevant, much more so than grammar oriented spanish classes.",
    "A overview of several important conversational themes through reading, role play, and discussion. I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a fun and easy way to complete level five. However, if you desire to improve your grammar, take a different level five class.",
    "This class basically allowed me to practice my spanish regularly, as most of class consisted of discussion. Homework was light, and included mostly reading and some writing. I would recommend the course to someone looking to improve spanish speaking skills."
