    "This was the best class that I took during my first year at YSPH. Danya Keene structured the class in an intuitive way that made me actually learn how to do qualitative research. We not only learned what the methods were, we got to try them out ourselves firsthand. The class was also fun and engaging - not an easy feat for a two hour class scheduled on late Friday afternoons!",
    "The class was comprehensive and had a good vibe for a Friday afternoon.",
    "This course has the potential to be a lot of fun or absolutely terrible depending on the group you end up working with. I wish the professor had done a better job helping us match up with people who not only shared our research interests, but also had similar working styles. The class is a lot of work, so you really need to make sure you're with people who you vibe with. However, Danya is a great, low key professor who truly values her student's opinions and ideas, and class time is generally well utilized. I learned a lot of great qualitative research skills. Definitely an essential course if you're planning to do a qualitative thesis.",
    "Excellent course! Best course I have taken at YSPH. The class is set at a very appropriate pace. The groups project is clearly defined and augments what is being learned in the class.",
    "YOU. NEED. TO. TAKE. THIS. COURSE. This was BY FAR my favorite class this semester! Such a hidden gem of a course at YSPH! Each week a different topic is covered and you learn so much about qualitative research. By the end of the semester, you will learn how to develop research questions, write a solid consent form and interview questions, recruit participants, conduct qualitative interviews, code your data, analyze it, and disseminate the information. SUCH USEFUL SKILLS TO HAVE!",
    "This course is amazing and helps your build fundamental qualitative research methods skills! Classes a mixture of lecture and group work.",
    "This is a great course to introduce you to qualitative research in a hands-on way. Lots of great readings on working on your own qualitative assignment is really fun and enjoyable.",
    "This is my favorite course that I have taken at YSPH. It's extremely useful, interesting, engaging, fun, and challenging.",
    "This course was a great introduction to qual research methods. The reading selections were fantastic, and I loved how all lessons on methods were ultimately still grounded in a unifying theory. The experience we gained from going through the entirety of the research process (from developing a sampling frame, to making an interview guide, to recruitment, to interviewing, and finally to coding & analysis) was really invaluable! Would highly recommend!",
    "Strengths: Danya is an excellent instructor A significant portion of the class is work with a group, so it is important to pick your group and topic wisely",
    "This was a fantastic course that gave me a lot of tools to work in my intended field (Medical Education). By doing a class project, I really felt engaged in the material and it helped me understand some of the specific challenges in qualitative research. I really valued Danya's feedback on our work, it was always constructive and helpful. The only downside to the class was the amount of reading to be done. I would have preferred to just read a textbook of her choosing and then read and discussed studies that exemplified the theories and techniques from our text book readings.",
    "Qualitative Research Methods is an excellent class, but its greatest weakness was that it was held on a Friday afternoon. For qualitative research methods to be a core class for the Social and Behavioral Sciences concentration, it should be given a more prominent place on the semester schedule."

    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya Keene is the best teacher I've had at YSPH. She is light-years ahead of other faculty members in her teaching skills. Seriously, send all the other professors to Danya's classes so they can learn how to teach a graduate class. Teaching requires a very different skillset than research, and Danya's got them both down-pat. She structured the class in an intuitive, hands-on way that made it easy and fun to learn the topic. She also treats her students like REAL PEOPLE, which was refreshing after being treated like a high school student in other classes (I'm looking at you, Mayur and Fatma). Danya is approachable, immensely knowledgable, friendly, understanding, and wonderfully helpful. She is a fantastic teacher and an all-around great person. I wish that I had more professors like her during my time at YSPH. As folks have said before me, Danya Keene is a queen.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya did a great a job of capturing the variety within qualitative methods.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya was the perfect professor for this course. She was open engaging and gave great examples of qualitative work that she has been involved in.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya is a wonderful professor. Funny, laid back, and always available to her students for help and guidance.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Excellent! Danya is always thorough and prepared with lectures. She is always available to meet outside of class and gives feedback in a timely and helpful manner.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya was SUPER AWESOME! She's so friendly and always makes herself available to meet if you want to discuss your project. She also knows her stuff! Her lectures are super engaging, I literally never felt the need to open up my laptop to take notes. I just sat back during lecture, never bored, and took all of the information in. I normally take notes in classes, but this one was different because I felt like if I left lecture with a strong grasp of the material that was taught that week - that how awesome lectures were for me! Great great great, overall.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Dr. Keene is a fabulous instructor that respects and supports each individual student. She makes class lectures interesting with lots of examples, and help students learn qualitative research skills!",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0She loves what she does and it shows.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya is great. She gives so much useful feedback, and is extremely supportive and accessible, on top of being so knowledgable and great and teaching this subject.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya was a fantastic instructor who has a clear enthusiasm and passion for the material and for qual methods in general. I loved how she structured the curriculum to parallel the stages of the qual research process. Her classes and lectures were always engaging and accessible. Moreover, Danya was always warm and enthusiastic about helping the groups with any questions they may have had about their research projects.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0She is awesome...engaged, funny, and gives timely, thoughtful feedback No weaknesses I can think of",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya was fantastic! She was incredibly supportive and pushed us to complete projects to a high degree of quality. She has a wonderful grasp of the material and depth of knowledge and ensured everyone in the class felt included. One area of growth would be for her to prepare more for her lectures. There were many times when she would not be familiar with the content of her slides or even surprised by it. It could occasionally be distracting.",
    "Instructor: Danya Keene \u00a0Danya is a great professor and her interest in Qualitative Research Methods shows."

    "I know, the Friday afternoon timeslot seems horrible. But Danya is a fantastic teacher relative to the other professors at YSPH. It's a fun and informative class that will leave you with a new skillset and a smile.",
    "This course goes over qualitative methodology. To practice the skills, you carry out a small qualitative study. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes! This class prepares you to do qualitative research on your own. It is fundamental for anyone who might be thinking of doing this kind of research either during the MPH or afterwards. I would recommend this class to people that are not even enrolled in the MPH.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. By the end, you'll learn how to conduct a qualitative research project all on your own. One of the best classes at YSPH, I promise.",
    "If you are ever planning on doing qualitative research, you should absolutely take this class. It helps you build the technical skills while also working with a group on an interesting project. Pretty much work, but each assignment is different so it keeps it super interesting.",
    "Highly recommended for anyone interested in qualitative and\/or mixed methods research.",
    "I can't recommend this class enough. You are missing out if you don't take this while at YSPH.",
    "Would highly recommend to anyone who has even the slightest interest in qualitative methods and gaining proficiency in analysis of qual\/narrative data (as a supplement or counterpoint to our education in quant methods).",
    "An excellent and comprehensive course to learn how to do qualitative research. Even for Friday afternoon, this was a fun and interesting course",
    "This is a course to learn the techniques of qualitative research. You will work in small groups to complete a small qualitative study over several weeks, including the following activities: 1) identifying a qualitative study question\/theory 2) writing qualitative interview questions 3) conducting interviews 4) performing coding of transcribed interviews and 5) completing analysis of the data you collected.",
    "Qualitative Research Methods is a required class, but a good one."
