    "CHNS 155 is a continuation of CHNS 154 (you even use the same textbook). However Zhou laoshi is incredible, so if you are on the fence about continuing Chinese at Yale take it just for him.",
    "I would recommend this class. Zhou laoshi is great to get to know, and there's just one course left until the electives. As a caveat, this course actually is substantially more work than last semester's. Even though Zhou laoshi told us this explicitly in the Fall, and I saw other students say this in past evals, I didn't believe it - but it's actually true. The workload is certainly not bad, but just be prepared to spend a bit extra time with this class in the Spring.",
    "Exactly what you would expect it to be, a great continuation of the Chinese curriculum",
    "There's no reason not to take 155 after doing 154. The lessons were much more interesting and you can move on to the electives after this course.",
    "Great advanced Chinese class with a manageable and straight forward grammar.",
    "Another brick in the wall to building better Chinese fluency among advanced students.",
    "You should take it!",
    "If you've taken CHNS 154, which you probably have, then you know exactly what to expect out of CHNS 155. The course content is interesting, and the vocabulary learned through the assigned texts is useful. I felt that my writing abilities progressed more than my oral abilities, which was not what I expected out of the course, but an enjoyable experience overall."
