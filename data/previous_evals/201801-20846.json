   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of advanced econometrics analytical approach from a theoretical perspective.",
    "Econometric Approach to evaluate social policy",
    "The course covered many different theories in Econometrics, explaining both conventional estimation techniques as well as the relevant history or alternatives.",
    "The course helped me build on more econometric tools that ECON558 set the ground for. It helped me write the final paper and design better identification strategies to answer the research questions I was looking at. It was very helpful because it taught things in detail that we just touched upon during undergrad.",
    "I've learnt a lot about econometrics.",
    "I believe I learned absolutely everything there is to learn about development econometrics without doing a PhD.",
    "Advanced Econometrics knowledge and applications",
    "Useful applied understanding of the methods required for research",
    "I better understood the panel datas requirements and various specifications to overcome endogeneity",
    "Learnt Econometric tools at a more advanced level. Very cleverly designed course although I wish we could study more material somehow.",
    "It was a very intense course that taught me a lot of tools to handle econometric problems.",
    "Economtetric analyses, policy evaluations, statistical understanding of policies",
    "Many! I learned essential econometric methods, not only theory but actually application.",
    "Greater understanding of metrics and its uses\/challenges",
    "Econometrics"

   "comments": [
    "I think no need to improve.",
    "Lectures could be more organized",
    "The course is fairly comprehensive. However, sometimes it can get a bit too technical.",
    "Strengths: in-depth, comprehensive Weakness: the topic itself is hard",
    "Both the professor and TF are amazing, the topics covered in class were super interesting and applied, the problem sets and midterms were very well thought and definitely helped us to understand better the material.",
    "The topics are indeed more related to development than other econometric courses. The pace may be a little too fast\/slow at times, but that is hard to control, given students have different backgrounds and preferences",
    "The strengths of this course are many: - Uses examples of empirical work to allow us to visualize and apply the econometric strategy - Has a research paper that allows us to feel like pHd students for a semester. - Covers topics the most relevant topics in a very detailed way, but also covers other topics a bit more broadly just because it is important for us to be familiarized with the terms.",
    "Strength: covers lots of theories weakness: not quite well structured",
    "Strengths: good understanding of methods. No final exam allowed for focusing on paper.",
    "It was detailed but could be better paced as it got more interesting towards the end",
    "Strengths: Good challenging topics. Weaknesses: Focused evaluation too much on paper and too less on actual material.",
    "Interesting subject matter!",
    "Strength: very practical Weakness: -",
    "Good for learning \"how to think\" about econometrics \/ data \/ etc., not good for practical skills which should be automatic"

   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course for students who are going to pursue Ph.D in the future. His explanations with course texts are really helpful to understand basics of econometrics. This course contributes to supporting start-dash of advanced econometrics when you begin to start academic studies more.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "It builds strongly on Econ 558 and is a good extension to the material.",
    "To all non IDE-ers, this course would be more helpful if it was coupled with 558. If the student was interested in building research questions centred around an applied econometric model but did not want to get into the deep theoretical history of some of the methods, this would help them perfectly.",
    "Yes. I will recommend it to people who are interested in doing quantitative analysis",
    "Well..yes for those who are interested in development",
    "Yes. I would recommend the whole IDE program to everyone that is interested in Dev. Econ and has some mathematical and statistical training.",
    "Yes I would. If you want to go for a Econ PhD degree, you should take this class and learn all the methods and theories",
    "Yes, very useful to understand better what is going on with the methods underpinning the research results of academic papers",
    "Definitely",
    "Yes. This is a great course for anyone who has done basic statistics.",
    "Definitely",
    "Yes! If you want to learn how to apply econometrics to development issues",
    "Yes - if you want to learn how to apply metrics",
    "yes"
