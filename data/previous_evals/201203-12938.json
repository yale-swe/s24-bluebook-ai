    "ok class. Schroers is a good lecturer.",
    "Professor Schroer's is a great man. But not a very good lecturer on strength and deformations. He's better suited to be a Materials professor.",
    "Easy. Boring. Read the book.",
    "This class is good to take if you don't mind a bit of disorganization.",
    "This class is surprisingly useful and applicable. You'll use the things you learn here in many other classes as well!",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless you have to. The class is surprisingly qualitative while the psets are all quantitative. The lectures can be pretty dry and confusing.",
    "The material is pretty dry, but it isn't that difficult. If you aren't interested in it or if you don't have to take it, I wouldn't recommend taking it. Professor Schroers is not the best lecturer.",
    "If you're Mech E, take it (you have to). If you're not, don't. You'd be better off just finding some good reading material on the subject, if you're really interested in the subject matter.",
    "Jan is brilliant in his line of research. This class, however, would run a lot smoother with a professor who actually knew something about Strength, Deformation, and Statics. You'll have to play catch up on occasion, class is directly from the book, so it wasn't worth going much except for the class before the midterm and final for a rundown of what to expect. Not too difficult overall, and Jan is the nicest, funniest German man to ever walk Hillhouse Ave.",
    "Lectures were really boring. I ended up getting a lot more out of lecture when I followed along in the textbook.The material is definitely good stuff to know, but it can be pretty dry.",
    "Definitely take it if you need it for MechE or another engineering degree, or even if you have interest in statics and why structures fail. The workload is very manageable and won't kill your time."
