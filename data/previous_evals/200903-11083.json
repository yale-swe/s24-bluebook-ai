   "comments": [
    "I would describe the course as an engagement with major works on Japanese history over the past thirty years in order to rethink \"Japan\" as an entity from several different perspectives\/positions\/issues. Ranging from accounts of local agricultural production in the premodern era, to concerns with seismicity and culture in the making of a modern nation-state, to engagements with the history of imperial Japan's colonial project and the return migration, the readings for the course forced all students to constantly revise notions of what \"Japan\" might be at different times. I would certainly encourage other students to take the course, but would also encourage students taking the course to make sure they have a strong understanding of basic Japanese history before taking this course.",
    "This course aims to provide students with a broad look at contemporary scholarship on early modern and modern Japanese history. I would highly recommend it for the quality of the material and the enjoyable style of seminar discussion fostered by Professor Drixler.",
    "I would highly recommend it both for Asia specialists and those with general world history\/comparative interests."

   "comments": [
    "This course significantly deepened my understanding not only of Japanese history, but with the various historiographical approaches to Japanese history. By engaging with both the history and historiography simultaneously through exposure to many different works on Japanese history, I formed a much more rich, complex understanding of \"Japan\" through time and within the regional and global context. This course pushed me not only explore new approaches to the study of Japanese history, but also to rethink and revise previous approaches and assumptions.",
    "This course was highly useful in placing my own research into the broader work on Japan. It also allowed me to delve into my own research interests. The course was very helpful by providing a forum for discussing my own work in the context of contemporary scholarship.",
    "It gave me essential comparative background for my East Asian dissertation work."
