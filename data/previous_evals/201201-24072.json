    "If you can get in, definitely take this class!",
    "very good course where we stay updated on obesity related news. TAKE IT NOW.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. It is not science heavy however I do believe that you will get a lot more out of the class if you have somewhat of a science background. The course approaches obesity from many different angles which helps one understand the scope of obesity as a major concern globally.",
    "I would highly recommend the course for anyone interested in obesity and neurobiology. Theclass is taught very well, and will only improve with time. Ben Land is absolutely fantastic to listen to and spend time with, and is really easy to relate to. The course isn't very demanding while being highly informative. I feel that what I learned from the course will help me pursue a healthier lifestyle thanks to being more self-aware of the biological mechanisms at play in eating and reward. Moreover I think that what I've learned has revealed to me the true issues at the heart of the obesity epidemic.",
    "If this class is offered, take it. It's engaging, it's interesting, and the structure allows you to really focus on the area of your interest, although there is definitely more of a focus on the biology than the policy side. Final paper isn't too bad.",
    "Yes, take the course! It's a relatively easy course, but one in which you'll get to have interesting discussions, learn about a pressing public health issue, and change your attitude about obesity.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to other students if they are interested in obesity. You cover a lot about the neurobiology, but also get to explore obesity from a political, cultural, and environmental perspective.",
    "Take it! It's a great way to tackle a science credit. It's challenging, but the professor, Benjamin Land, is very good at breaking everything down and making it understandable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings are actually all really relevant, with current topics and research, stuff we would care about, and lots of stuff we would read anyway outside of class (assuming legitimate interest in the subject). As long as you want to get something out of the class, it's worth it.. you could very much just sit there and not contribute anything, but if you really care about the super complex problems of obesity and want to brainstorm out-of-the-box ways of approaching it, the course can be really fruitful. So make sure you're getting as much out of it as you want, and Ben Land will let you run with what you find, it's really awesome.",
    "Yes absolutely take it! The class is a great combination of interesting science and opportunities to think about public policy. It's also one of the rare classes that educates you about an issue that's very relevant to your own life and daily choices. Also, Ben Land is great.",
    "Excellent course. With obesity on the rise and a lack of neurobiological research related to food addiction, this is a super relevant class, and Ben is an awesome teacher. He's really down to earth and laid back, which is awesome. There's a lot of conversation in the class, even though you learn a lot about the actual neurobiology involved in addiction, along with the pathways and chemicals involved. We also talked about policy, obesity as a disease, and the future of our healthcare system. Such a great class, and with only weekly homework assignments and a final grant proposal at the end, the workload is really manageable. Take it!",
    "CSYC260 was an excellent course - it was very interdisciplinary and covered topics ranging from the neurobiology of obesity to the legislation surrounding obesity and whether it should be considered a disease, issues that are at the center of debate today. The class is very science-heavy at first, but you only need to know as much science as you need for your final project, which is writing a grant proposal. Be warned that it takes a lot of scientific research, which may be daunting if you're not a science major, but the professor provided us very helpful input on our proposal outlines and is very approachable in terms of any questions you have. I would definitely recommend this class - I truly learned a lot about obesity and addiction. The great thing about the subject matter is that you can apply what you learned about sugar taxes and classifying obesity as a disease to daily dinner-table conversation, as the topics are very current.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who's interested in obesity, either the neurobio behind it or its effects on society and what can be done to reduce obesity and its detrimental effects. It provides an excellent biological and social science background in the field and you will learn a lot regardless of your science background, all you need is an interest in the subject to benefit from the class. This is one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken in my four years at Yale and if it's offered again with Ben Land I would absolutely take it. Not a ton of work but you get a lot out of it.",
    "I really enjoyed this seminar. Great professor, low key seminar, and interesting discussions\/readings. I learned a lot about different perspectives of obesity- in particular the bioethical issues, policy, and current therapies."
