    "Music 214 is a class for composers and lyricists to write songs for musical theater. At the start of the semester, we did some analysis to find what makes good songs good. We looked at song form and what makes good lyrics as well. But for the majority of the semester, our task was to write one song each week. Sometimes we would write music to existing lyrics or lyrics to existing music, butafter a few weeks we began to collaborate with other students in the class as composers and lyricists and write songs together, which was both challenging and a lot of fun. Each week there was a different assignment to make us write all different kinds of songs. At the end of the semester, as a class we decided on a book, movie, or play to write songs for, and we wrote and produced a concert reading of our class musical. I would absolutely recommend this class to any student who enjoys writing music or writing lyrics and wants to learn how to write theater songs.",
    "Yeah! Loved the class. Josh was great... he was never \"easy\" on anyone's compositions, and people in the class really progressed from the beginning to the end.",
    "Absolutely take this class.",
    "It is definitely worth the exposure and excuse to write music if that is something you like to do.",
    "Absolutely a must-take class if you're at all interested in writing better music or lyrics for musical theatre. If you can take it with Josh, by all means do so - you will not regret it! You'll even get to write a class musical at the end of the semester together. Inconceivable!",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it absolutely. Great class for learning how to write music\/lyrics for musical theater, and also for learning how to collaborate with others when writing songs. It was a very challenging but supportive environment, and I loved it.",
    "Theater Songwriting is a dream.",
    "Take this class, whether you've never written a song in your life or already have entire musicals under your belt, Prof. Rosenblum will have a lot to teach you.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to anyone with the slightest interest in songwriting, composing, or musical theater. It is a less daunting way to learn about composing than taking one of the Music departments composition seminars, and for a more musically oriented person such as myself, it really opened me up to libretto-writing and humor. Our class became really close as we worked on a production of \"The Princess Bride\"- this class attracts really interesting people, who play a wide range of instruments or write plays or do improv comedy- and Josh encourages the close creative atmosphere. I loved collaborating with people as both a composer and lyricist, and am so much more confident in my abilities in both areas.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!! TAKE IT. GO. NOW. You will access a creative part of your soul and be a part of a collaborative environment that really binds together the class. You WILL NOT regret taking this class.",
    "Definitely recommend it to another student interested in songwriting, either as a lyricist or a composer! The best part is that everybody gets to share and perform their song in class. It was a truly enjoyable class.",
    "Yes.Interesting assignments, good cooperation projects, have a perfect interaction."
