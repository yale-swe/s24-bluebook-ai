    "You go to class everyday and talk in german about various topics whether they be grammar or about the fall of the Berlin Wall. You get great practice with speaking as well as utilizing a wide range of variety.",
    "I think that my German improved a lot more in the GMAN 130 than it did in 110 and 120. I don't know if I put more effort into it or if it was because I had a better professor this time, but it's definitely the case that I talked more in L3, and improved my writing skills. I took German L3 without needing it for my language requirement, but I don't regret taking it, and now I want to take L4. It was a lot more fun than the other 2 semesters, and the only problem I had was the e-mails that we had to write to Swiss students, since they wold never respond. I don't know why the department still has it in the syllabus, since it didn't work in L1 and L2 too. We already have enough of small assignments, we don't need an extra e-mail exchange that does not work! I sincerely hope that they don't have it for the coming semesters. Josh was a really good and dedicated professor, and I have no complaints at all about him. I really liked his teaching style, he's very funny and approachable, and going to class never felt like a duty, even though it was at 9:25 everyday. A couple times, he had to miss class because of conferences in Germany; then he brought German candy for us to eat during mandatory movie screenings we had in class. He was definitely the best professor I had for German classes at Yale. Also, there were two exams that we had two weeks in a roll, followed by one week with two movie screenings, which was kind of annoying, because of the lack of balance. Overall, although I don't like the way languages are taught at Yale, I liked L3 a lot better than my previous courses in the department."
