   "comments": [
    "I improved my time management skills by taking this course. Through periodic presentations in class, I improved my public speaking skills. Most importantly, I improved my people skills through chatting with the professor and my peers.",
    "Greater knowledge of Chinese, especially in reading and writing. I became much better at memorizing characters as well haha. I also learned more interesting facts about China, Chinese culture, chengyu, etc.",
    "Became much more proficient in reading, writing, and listening Chinese. Gained a much deeper cultural understanding of the Chinese language and associated idioms and phrases.",
    "For heritage speakers, this course familiarizes you with lots of new vocab, idioms, sentence patterns, etc. You also hone your writing skills through essays. There's also a lot about Chinese culture in the course so you learn a decent amount of that as well.",
    "In addition to learning to better read, speak, and write Chinese, I was able to develop a more nuanced view of Chinese culture.",
    "I gained a great deal of cultural knowledge and understanding of the social and political context of China along with greatly improving my Chinese language skills.",
    "Deeper understanding in Chinese culture and topics"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A huge strength of this course is that it was both challenging and low-stress. Even though the material was difficult, the class felt very relaxing, and I never worried too much about grades. Additionally, the professor taught us interesting Chinese cultural topics that were beyond the scope of the textbook. One way that the course could be improved is to give students more opportunities to practice their speaking skills. Much of the course revolved around reading and writing, and speaking wasn't emphasized as much.",
    "Su Laoshi's passion for teaching is so clearly evident every class. I quite enjoyed listening to his stories and seeing his enthusiasm for Chinese. A weakness may be that we don't have much opportunity to speak in class, but since this is a higher level heritage class, most people need more time spent on the reading\/writing side of things.",
    "strength: Su Lao Shi's teaching style is very engaging, and the stories he tells brings texture and color to the Chinese language. weakness: not much time given for free speaking in the class. it would have been nice if there were more opportunities to practice simply talking, because presentations were often read directly from an essay script anyways.",
    "Strengths: Su Wei is a phenomenal teacher and the small section style class is perfect for learning Chinese - there's a decent amount of work but it's definitely manageable. The presentations and essays definitely are worth it for getting better at the language. Weaknesses: Really none.",
    "I cant think of any weaknesses right now, but a strength is that the teacher had lots of experiences he shared which cant just be learned from the textbook.",
    "Enjoyed the topics taught in class; wish there was more chances in class to speak up."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Some Chinese courses focus on rote memorization of characters, but this course really emphasized the application of characters\/idioms and went beyond the scope of the textbook.",
    "Definitely. Take at least one Su Laoshi course if you're doing higher level Chinese!!",
    "Yes! Take this class if you need a language credit or if you want to gain a deeper appreciation of Chinese. Su Lao Shi has some great stories to tell and the level of context and detail he can provide for every important phrase in the textbook really makes the language more vivid. I gained a lot from this class.",
    "If you're placed into this class, you should definitely take it. You will learn so much and the class is very fun and entertaining as well, especially the stories.",
    "Yes, if you want to have a more in-depth learning of Chinese.",
    "Yes"
