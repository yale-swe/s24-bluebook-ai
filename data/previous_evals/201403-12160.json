   "comments": [
    "A required class, so not too much to say. However, keep in mind that you can totally miss a lecture or two if you're not into one of the subjects; just ask questions and be helpful when you're in the room.",
    "You have to take this, but don't sweat it. It's just an easy class where you listen to cool research in CogSci. I always enjoyed it every week.",
    "Sure, very interesting class to hear from other professors' work, very little work to do, but very interesting",
    "A general and low-stress survey of research being done by Yale labs and a preparatory course for conducting one's senior thesis research. Even though you can usually skip a week or two here and there, I found myself actually wanting to come to every class, if just to hear interesting speakers and get to know the other students in the major more.",
    "It's required for Junior CogSci majors, so you have to take it! But good news: it was an awesome class! There is virtually no work other than to show up each week and listen to some educated researcher give a talk about the work they're doing. Very cool.",
    "Junior Colloquium was a great opportunity to hear from different speakers in the field and to get to know other students in the major. However, lectures sometimes felt long and there could have been more time spent on discussion.",
    "Only available to Cognitive Science Majors and is a mandatory class.",
    "In this class, you'll learn about different topics within cognitive science, some of which you'll find more interesting than others. But I think that's the point -- to get you thinking about what kinds of things you might want to study. I'd like to hear more professors talk about their fields of research, and in a way, I wish this class had gone for longer or had met more often. It was really low stress and low commitment.",
    "Great overview course, small time commitment but you learn a lot!",
    "I would strongly suggest taking this course. (well, it is a required course, but you will love it) The lectures are very interesting, and we have the opportunity to see what kind of research that is happening throughout various departments related to cognitive science at Yale.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, but it's required for the major. The two-hour sessions were too long. The guest lecturers were nice, but once we passed the first hour, some of the material gets to be hard to follow. Most CogSci juniors and seniors kind of already know which general area they are interested in. Personally for me, this class didn't help me pick a topic to do my senior thesis on but it did give me a taste of the broad things you could do within CogSci. Not the most engaging though.",
    "I mean, you gotta take it, but this is one of the less painful mandatory courses you have to take at Yale. It's a lot of fun, you meet a lot of other cool CogSci students (#networking, anybody?), and the profs that come in to guest lecture are phenomenal. Though it can get extremely boring at times, this colloquium is a lot of fun and takes you through all of the fields of CogSci efficiently.",
    "The premise of this class is a really great idea. And even though it may have fallen slightly flat in execution, I am confident that future iterations of the colloquium will iron out some kinks. As it was, this was a nice \"master's tea for cogsci majors\" that was held two hours at a time, one day a week. Faculty members either in or connected to the cogsci department presented on their area of research, with interspersed questions from the students in the class. Some topics were definitely more scintillating than others, but it was nice to get a feel of different fields within cogsci in greater depth. (Though sometimes, the guest lecturers may have gone a little too deep. I'm pretty sure all that advanced neurolinguistics stuff flew over my head.) Two hours was also a long time to sit down and listen to the guest lecturer's topic, despite ample opportunity for student questioning. It might have been more beneficial and interactive if the first hour of the colloquium was devoted to the guest lecturer's topic, while the second hour had the students break out into smaller groups to discuss the speaker's work and how it might relate to their own topics of interest.",
    "Well it's mandatory, so if you want to major in cogsci you have to take this course. That being said...I loved it! Really interesting\/stimulating lectures. I met the (potential) advisor for my senior thesis in this class! Learned a lot. highly recommend.",
    "Great deal for Cog Sci majors: a personalized invitation to a stress-free, interesting lecture series, and an accompanying 1\/2 credit for virtually no work. Some guest lectures were better than others, of course, but they were mostly reasonably interesting. Hopefully the course will be moved to a less popular meeting timethis year's prevented us from taking a ton of other courses, as it crossed two time blocks on MW schedulingbut, even if it's not, this is great as far as required courses go!! Light, interesting, and worthwhile.",
    "The format of this class is straightforward - a different speaker every week discussing their work as it relates to Cognitive Science. There is virtually no homework. As a result, it's relatively interesting and extremely low stress.",
    "Just a large survey of various Cognitive Science related professors. The topics were generally interesting, but so long that it was very difficult not to get bored after the first hour. The question answer format is nice.",
    "The colloquium is a lot of fun (and it's also required for the major). Since cog sci can encompass so many fields, the colloquium is a great opportunity to learn about areas that are less familiar."
