   "comments": [
    "Learned a great deal about the literature on the subject; and the way in which military history can interact with social and political history. Also, course was very well-structured to help develop skills in history writing at all levels.",
    "I developed my research skills.",
    "Very few",
    "While the class was an interesting look at conflict and maritime issues, it was still ultimately a standard seminar for history.",
    "I became much more skilled at analyzing critical texts especially primary sources and more conscious of the proper way of citing things in the Chicago style. Professor Wilson is an excellent instructor who will challenge his students.",
    "In addition to what I learned about maritime history, I learned a ton about the study of history. With the final paper, I learned how to do a rigorous primary source analysis.",
    "I loved this course. I feel that I have a much better understanding of how to dive into the historiography of different topics, a more fully developed comprehension of the distinctions and crossovers between \"maritime\" and \"naval\" history, and a really cool sense of \"where we are now\" in terms of maritime history. The introduction to International Security Studies at Yale was also a really welcome change in perspective in terms of how history can\/will\/should\/should not be applied.",
    "This course made me a better writer. Dr. Wilson really helped me learn to write a research paper.",
    "KNOWLEDGE: A thorough understanding of the period discussed, particularly the 18th century and the role of the Royal Navy throughout the period. This course also sought to dispel many myths that casual historians of the period might believe, especially relating to piracy and impressment. SKILLS: The final paper forced us to grapple with primary sources to a greater extent than other seminar papers I have had in the past, which is excellent preparation for the original research expected as part of the senior thesis. Another major historical skill I improved in this course was my ability to rapidly understand historiographical debates, and how to parse a base of literature into contrasting schools of thought. Finally, this course included an emphasis on how to properly conduct historical citations, which was tremendously valuable for me and something many previous seminars overlooked. INSIGHTS: Into the state of the current historical profession, especially as regards the relative standing of Naval History. I found our explicit focus on historiographical debates within the discipline to be a refreshing departure from other seminars that sought only to impart content onto participants."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor had really great activities and for the most part was really good at running class discussions. It was a good mix of being told information and being able to discuss interesting aspects in the week. Readings could be more focused. Class discussion was usually on a small portion of them, but it was never clear which would be the focus. Paper presentations and guests would be better off left out.",
    "Professor Wilson is a fantastic professor who does an excellent job engaging his students and making sure they understand the readings. Sometimes the in class group projects were a bit redundant, but overall by placing a greater emphasis on the seminar and readings this class can be improved.",
    "I really liked when we brought in speakers from outside (and the events we went to for the event review essay). The course itself was also well-organized.",
    "I thought the course was very strong overall. The outside event review and guest speakers were highlights of the course. I thought all of the assignments were well-explained and relevant to the class, and grading was very fair. I also appreciated the time that Professor Wilson took to review citation formats, which was useful for my other classes as well. The group work exercises could have been a little better facilitated, but that may have been more a product of the early morning class time than anything else.",
    "Though sometimes it felt like there was one article too many to be able to get all the reading done, having selections from different anthologies, books, and primary sources is what enabled me to feel fully invested in each week's topic. We did \"types of ships\" fairly early on in the course but also fairly quickly, so I feel I have a better sense of how ships were constructed in the 16th and 17th centuries than in the 18th and 19th centuries, which were our primary centuries of study. It might have been helpful to have short reviews of \"ok, what are the classes of ships, what's a frigate, how can it be rigged, how many different types of ships are there and where are they coming from\" every so often later on in the course.",
    "This course was great. There was the right amount of reading and the writing load was manageable. The class discussions were always really interesting and Dr. Wilson came up with creative ways for us to get involved.",
    "STRENGTHS: -The single greatest strength of this course was its use of guest speakers and events. Dr. Wilson went above and beyond in his attempts to get authors of books we were reading to talk with the class on the week we read this assignment. While not all of these materialized, we had multiple throughout the semester. In my four years at Yale I never had another course that managed to bring in more than one guest speaker whose work we were reading at the same time; securing multiple eminent historians was unprecedented. Additionally, this course mandated that each student attend one speaking event hosted on campus that was relevant to the course and then write a report on it. This allowed me to engage with the resources that were available outside of class and interact with the historical discussions that were happening at Yale outside of the classroom. I only wish I had been given this assignment in my underclassmen years so I would have known where to look to find the interesting events that were available on campus. -Meaningful student presentations that forced us to do more with less by sticking to a stringent 5 minute time limit in order to explain our final paper. This forced me to refine my argument and supporting evidence into a clear and concise package, and then defend it against the questions and feedback of the class. This was much more effective for me than outlining (which we also did) and ultimately improved my final paper and my ability to present and communicate. -Every week's reading contained primary sources and secondary sources, which all received attention during our classroom discussions. Given the focus on historiographical debates, I expected most readings to be secondary sources, but Dr. Wilson did a fantastic job constructing a reading list each week that presented just enough secondary sources to parameterize the debate, and then enough primary sources to allow us to form our own conclusions and take these into class. In this manner, each and every reading assignment felt like it had it's place. WEAKNESS: The only weakness I can proffer relates to the syllabus; which is understandable considering this is the first time the seminar has been run. Paper presentations were scheduled for the two days we were intended to cover \"The Many Uses of A Navy\" and because of those and the introduction of our through (and much appreciated) discussions of citations, we didn't get to spend much time on either day's readings related to the subject. I think this is an important set of topics that answers the \"so what\" question about why this period is important to study and remains relevant, so other topics should be shifted on the syllabus to ensure that the many uses of a navy shifts to allot a full seminar to discuss it."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This course is always engaging. It takes what might seem like a narrow topic, and shows the many, many links that the development of naval power has to social history, political change, etc. Extremely well-chosen readings; Dr. Wilson leads fantastic discussion. Assignments are very fair. Take it!",
    "Yes! Prof Wilson is great. But be prepared to be graded honestly.",
    "A well below average history course. Grading seemed arbitrary and unnecessarily nitpicking. I would encourage another student to look somewhere else",
    "If you are interested in the subject, definitely. The professor was very good as well. Not a must-take if the subject does not float your boat.",
    "Take this class. Dr. Wilson is an amazing professor and is the first professor I have met that can keep a 2 hour seminar engaging till the end. The workload is normal for a junior seminar, and the assignments are spread out well. You won't regret taking this class.",
    "Professor Wilson is a fantastic instructor if you get the opportunity definitely take a class with him, you won't' regret it. He's very humorous and knowledgable. It was a pleasure to take a class with him this semester.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you have any interest in Britain, navies, or cultural and military history in general, this is a great course to take. The course material is well balanced, and Professor Wilson brings in a number of guest speakers to lead class discussions on certain topics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend \"War at Sea\" to another student. It's so so rare to get naval\/maritime history from someone who is actually an expert, rather than having sea battles folded in to broader military history courses. Dr. Wilson makes all the material accessible and understandable, and did a fantastic job of pushing and prodding us when things were moving too slowly, such as having us play around with maps and primary sources to figure out why a captain would have gone this way instead of that way, how counterintuitive some moves at sea can be, and to understand the ways the sea touched so many lives during the age of sail.",
    "Yes. This was the best course I have taken at Yale. Dr. Wilson made the long class periods fly by and was very understanding. The readings were really interesting. Dr. Wilson helped me whenever I needed it.",
    "Absolutely the best history seminar I took at year over all four years in the major. Try to take it as early as possible, because it will tremendously improve your research and writing skills in preparation for the thesis and introduce you to a lot of events outside of class. The topics are interesting and Dr. Wilson keeps class engaging and fun throughout the year. Good for those who know tons, and those who know nothing, about the Age of Sail coming in."
