   "comments": [
    "I have mixed feelings towards this course. I learned a lot, but also felt like there was too much theory. The grading was kind of tough and I was never sure if I was doing the right thing. Nevertheless, the sections are fun and you do learn a lot. Professor Davis also knows a ton about China and it's interesting to hear her talk about her experiences.",
    "Sure, but it's really specifically based on inequality in China, and it gets kind of repetitive after a while. Most of what you'll gain will probably be from your own reading for your paper, which can be interesting (and plus Davis is a really good source for bouncing off ideas and she basically knows everything and everyone in China).",
    "A really great course all around. The readings are interesting. Professor Davis knows more about China than anybody in the world. And the assignments are challenging but thought-provoking. The sections conducted in Chinese are a really nice addition if your someone like me looking to practice speaking as much as possible. it's a lot of work. You have to be on top of the readings, and the assignments require a lot of thought and effort. But it's a very rewarding class, so if you're interested in the material, definitely take it.",
    "Wealth and Poverty in Modern China is a sociology course (with elements of economics and development) that assesses the changes to post-socialist China with particular emphasis on class, gender equality, education, development, income and wealth. The students in the class were remarkable for their skill and quality of experience. There were a number of graduate students, and nearly everyone in the class had some Chinese language skills or experience living or studying in China. The workload for the course is considerable: there were involved weekly readings, a movie review, a numerical internet exercise, a policy memo, and a fifteen page final paper. Despite the difficulty of the class, I highly recommend it to a student really interested in learning about Chinese society from a number of different directions. The class is very well taught, and all of the readings and assignments contribute to a meaningful learning experience.",
    "I will definitely recommend this class to other students, it's a great course if u want to know more about China.",
    "Take this class if you want a comprehensive look at the issues that economic change\/political reform have created in China in the last 30 years. It is interesting for anyone, whether or not you have an interest in social welfare. It would probably help if you have some background in statistical analysis\/feel comfortable with data, as many of the assigned readings get pretty deep into data analysis and statistical modeling.",
    "Yes I would. The course offers a fascinating insight into the lives and patterns of social change in China. Most importantly the course is well organized and provides sufficient depth to the issue of wealth and poverty in China",
    "I think that I can safely say this has been the class at Yale, so far, in which I've been challenged to learn the most in one semester. Dr. Davis structured the course so as to challenge us to think about Chinese society in general; inequality, gender, and stratification as analytical concepts in sociology and economics; data and statistics; primary sources; and poverty alleviation public policy, all in deep and rigorous ways. And her high standards and attentive teaching ensured that we learned a whole about each of these, no matter how much background knowledge we began with.The only \"weakness\" would be that at the beginning of the class, especially, students came from different backgrounds with widely different levels of background knowledge about China, Chinese, economics, sociology, etc. and especially for the first few weeks of class, many of us perhaps feltthat much of what Dr. Davis was discussing went over our heads. Perhaps Dr. Davis could have surveyed the class more thoroughly about its background knowledge and recommended some optional background readings\/information. However, it seemed that we all \"caught up\" by the end of the semester after all absorbing so much information through the course of the class.This is a serious class that involves the learning of a lot of material, challenging assignments, and high standards. However, if you are willing to put the effort into it, Dr. Davis is an incredibly knowledgeable professor and attentive teacher, and you will walk away having gained a whole lot.",
    "East Asian Studies 408 01: a gateway to know China.",
    "To anyone who want to gain insights about Chinese societies and who want to take a fresh perspective at China other than the double-digit economic growth, this class is a must.",
    "This may be the best class at Yale for a China engaged student who has a background of experience in China or has taken substantial coursework in Chinese social science. Deborah Davis is a brilliant professor who creates a stimulating syllabus and who leads the class well.",
    "Deborah Davis is top of her field and being in her class is a really great opportunity to learn about China--everything about China. That aside, the class can be dense sometimes in sociology theory and data-heavy, so if that's not your cup of tea, maybe this isn't the class for you. Discussion is based on your section, and your experience is largely how you make it. All in all, a good class and definitely worth shopping. Prof. Davis is so nice and knowledgeable."
