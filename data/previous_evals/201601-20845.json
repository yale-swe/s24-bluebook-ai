    "Take this class if you can get in! I know it says that it's only for juniors and seniors, but there definitely are freshmen and sophomores who have been able to take it as well - I would recommend emailing Prof. Carrerras expressing interest in her course a couple of weeks prior to the start of the semester, and then crossing your fingers. It's an incredible experience, and Prof. Carrerras is the sweetest and most supportive professor ever! The workload is extremely manageable, with a weekly written response, a final presentation and a final paper, and the class itself is really fun, and a good way to become acquainted with terms used in medicine in Spanish. I absolutely would recommend it for anyone interested in learning about medicine in another language, or for anyone looking for another language credit. Again, take it!",
    "Great course, I'd recommend",
    "I would recommend SPAN 225 to a fellow student who has a firm grasp of the Spanish language and would like to continue practicing the language through the interesting lens of medicine. The course is very manageable and is a great fifth class.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking for a way to practice their Spanish in a relaxed environment.",
    "An easy class that is somewhat interesting. If you are looking for a relatively laid back class that allows you to continue learning Spanish, Medical Spanish is a great choice. Class met at 9 which was tough but otherwise it was very little work and very relaxed. Not the most interesting but interesting enough especially if you are premed.",
    "Great course to learn medical spanish",
    "A low stress, enjoyable way to practice your Spanish.",
    "A good survey of medical diseases, with particular emphasis on Spanish verbal communication. I would recommend it to another student who is interested in becoming a doctor, and would like to have good Spanish communication skills.",
    "Great course! If you want to improve your spanish and\/or are going into the medical field, this is a good class to take. The professor is funny, smart, and kind. You have two assignments per week, presentation, and final paper. Everything is well spread out.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in learning about medicine in Spanish!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student who is interested in health and enjoys speaking Spanish. Your level of class participation is mostly up to you, but if you do participate you will benefit a lot from this course. Time in class is mainly lectures with Profesora Carreras asking questions, and then other types of activities are mixed in. The workload is manageable and the homework assignments are really worthwhile and helpful. I definitely recommend it!",
    "Most interesting Spanish class you will take. Apply your Spanish skills to medical topics, very interesting and really useful if you are interested in practicing healthcare in Spanish-speaking countries. Take this course!"
