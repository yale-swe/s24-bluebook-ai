   "comments": [
    "YES. If you attend lecture and memorize the slides, you will pass this course with no issue. There's no final and only four exams, and you do not need to do the readings to do well. The only downfall is that there is a lot of information at times, and exams can often sneak up on you because they occur so often.",
    "It's a pretty good class. Interesting material, and goes more in-depth biologically than Drugs, Brain, and Behavior. I felt like I learned a good amount, and the course structure is nice with 4 exams and no final.",
    "Absolutely take this course! The best course I've taken at Yale. Learned so much. Definitely worth the effort.",
    "Really good class! Professor Brown's PowerPoint lecture style doesn't work for everyone, so it's wise to shop it to make sure it's for you. Class time is almost always quite interesting, there's no homework and no need to buy the textbook, and exams are not always easy but generally fair. Major plus: Professor Brown's wife bakes amazing baked goods every Tuesday. So wonderful.",
    "There is a lot of information presented in this course, but the 4 exams are very manageable since they are not cumulative. Professor Brown teaches directly from his slides and everything tested can be learned from the slides. His wife bakes cookies every Tuesday and he brings them to class. Great class to learn all about the different types of drugs and their effects on the body.",
    "Hopefully they find a way to expand the class in the future so that more people can take it. Professor Brown is very knowledgeable; make the effort to get to know him and ask questions. Truly a must-take if you can get in. You learn about everything from steroids to psychedelics to antipsychotics to special concerns for medicating the elderly. Very informative, very relevant for every day life, very up-to-date, and grade is based on four midterms and possibly some quizzes. If you can memorize a lot of information and are interested, it won't be a difficult class.",
    "A fantastic course. You come out of it learning so much about drugs and how they work in the body. The exams (4) are non cumulative and very reasonable.",
    "If you're interested whatsoever in drugs and their impact on the brain, I'd highly recommend it. It gives you a very comprehensive overview, and I'd say it's definitely one of the better courses in the Psychology department.",
    "I would highly recommend this for anyone genuinely interested in getting a foundational knowledge of psychopharmacology. I really feel like I learned so much from this class. However, I also feel that if you are not genuinely interested in the topic, it could definitely be difficult to get through. It is very intensive, going through the side effects, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, mechanisms of action, etc. of every class of drugs studied. There is a lot of detail, but I found it really worthwhile and rewarding to learn. If others do not mind that level of detail, do not mind a lot of memorization, and are up for a bit of a challenge in terms of exams, then definitely take it. Overall, a very rewarding class, and for me, it was definitely worth it.",
    "Psychopharmacology is a fascinating field, but psychopharmacology the course is not gripping. Studying drugs is inherently technical and memorization-heavy, and as a result, any course on the subject should try to emphasize concepts and themes. This is not medical school. We did a little theory of drug abuse near the end of the course -- why was this not near feb beginning of the course? This course should not be capped, and it should be moved out of the first floor of Dunham where there is not enough desk space to go around. The tests are mostly straight memorization, so study the slides very carefully. I don't know \"drugs brain and behavior\" very well, but that seems like a better option than this course.",
    "lots of memorization and interesting material, too much detail if not into the topic, basic bio and chem background is useful for understanding the material",
    "This is a great class. You learn so much. And it very comprehensive covering both brain anatomy and classes of drugs from a variety of perspectives.",
    "Solid class for psychopharmacology. Straightforward lectures and exams, and Professor Brown is very kind and a competent lecturer who brings cookies to class on occasion (though some may find his lecture style to be dry). The material is interesting and overall the class isn't too much work. If you're interested in learning the mechanisms behind the interactions between drugs and the brain, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was extremely interesting and Professor Brown was AMAZING. Definitely a must take",
    "Psychopharma is a good course. It's taught in a semi-dry but very straightforward manner, which definitely has its perks. The material itself, once you actually learn it, is very interesting, and definitely in the realm of information that I would never have learned elsewhere. Professor Brown is very kind (his wife makes cookies for each class and he brings them in!) and I would certainly recommend it."
