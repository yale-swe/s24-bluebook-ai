    "I'd tell them that I was most looking forward to this course, and am extremely disappointed. This is not a Yale quality course.",
    "Would recommend except for the class timings.",
    "It is actually to good course that I recommend.",
    "I would summarise it as a course that offers a valuable and broad instruction in macroeconomics, but is \"fast-and-dirty\", in the sense that it touches upon relevant models for a broad range of issues without trying to go in-depth.I would recommend Economics 546 01 to any fellow student who is curious about the content of the discipline beyond the undergraduate level but doesn't want any special emphasis on certain topics.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend the course",
    "Classes are too long",
    "I would probably not recommend the course to a non-IDE student. This is because the lectures require a lot of effort and self-motivation and a lot of the time the topic can be learnt from reading the slides. Whilst I have learnt a lot from the course in the end, I think there are much better macro courses from my undergraduate experience at LSE and having spoken with undergraduates and PhD students at Yale.",
    "Challenging and relevant course which provides ample exposure to macroeconomics. However, style of lesson is very static and dry.",
    "Good coverage of interesting topics in Macroeconomics.Yes, recommended to students with or without foundation in Macroeconomics.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, definitely. It is a good course and the regularity of homework ensures you are not left behind."
