    "overview of major problems in philosophy of mind: - what are the requirements of consciousness? can we reduce these to purely physical terms? - what is the nature of inner subjective experience? - how do we think? what must be true of the structure of our thought so that we can function as well as we do in the world? - issues in personal identity: for x and y to be the same person, what must be true?",
    "Knowledge of current and historical issues in philosophy of mind.",
    "This course definitely improved my philosophical\/analytical thinking skills. If I worked harder on my papers, it would have improved my writing skills as well. It made me aware of the major debates in the realm of philosophy of mind, which is why I took the course to begin with.",
    "Skills for deeply analyzing complex and abstract philosophical questions.",
    "I developed a broad understanding of the set of philosophical issues that emerge from seriously considering the possibility of artificial intelligence. This course helped me understand what artificial intelligence might have to look like, how it might induce new understandings of consciousness and personal identity, and finally what knowledge of the way the human mind works might be useful to represent it.",
    "We discussed topics related to the mind in a philosophical context including consciousness, thought, identity.",
    "Analytic philosophy skills including critical reading and writing. An survey of key topics and arguments philosophy of mind from analytic and anglo-american traditions.",
    "I learned about philosophy of mind, particularly some interesting thought experiments used to defend two popular views on what our mind is, and I was also introduced to a variety of questions that may arise when one asks whether machines are or can be intelligent, and what such a state would entail.",
    "familiarity with problems in philosophy of mind and philosophy of AI, most of which point toward problems in metaphysics.",
    "Better logical reasoning, better ability to identify multiple arguments within the same text and discuss them in conversation with one another.",
    "I learned quite a bit about the philosophy of mind, which is to say, what philosophers have thought the mind is and how it influences the body. I will say that the A.I. part of the course took a backseat for most of the semester, but at the beginning and end we spent significant time discussing the Turing Test and the prospect of uploading your consciousness (which gets into the question of personal identity). It was a fascinating course, especially if you're interested in philosophy of mind."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the readings were excellent and I liked the weekly reading responses. I think more reading could have been assigned, but at the current level it was so manageable that I think most people actually did it. The class was a little too large. Sometimes I felt I would have learned more if it was a lecture with students only asking questions. We were confused a lot and talked in circles.",
    "It was too large. I wish there was less focus on the turing test stuff.",
    "The group was a little large, and the backgrounds pretty diverse, so it was sometimes hard to create a mutual understanding. The readings were quite long (though I don't know if there's really a way to cut down on that). Maybe some guiding questions (e.g. instead of reading responses that were completely open) would help.",
    "The class felt a bit inaccessible at times. I think this was mainly a result of it's rather large seminar size (maybe 25 people?) and Professor Greco's reliance on students to steer the conversation. I found that the conversation tended to run in circles without much structured discussion.",
    "The class is great in that you get to listen to peer discussions and participate in full conversations about the topics rather than listen to lectures without engagement. At times the course did seem to have too little structure",
    "Interesting course content. Larger seminar led to some students dominating conversations. Hands off seminar leadership style by the professor sometimes meant there were interesting but tangential discussions that led the class away from the readings and main issues of the day. The class was extremely analytic and abstract: I would have liked to see some of the normative and practical questions like personal identity and strategies for addressing AI and the singularity take on more significance in the class than abstract thought experiments.",
    "The course is good analytical philosophy that explores interesting puzzles around AI and mind. It is interesting for those interested in analytical philosophy and does a great job bringing ideas of mind and ai together by introducing important literature on the topics from the last century. The course could be improved if it focused more on ONE more aspect of learning, at present it feels like an analytical philosophy class that is good for musing out loud. It would be improved if it also focused on either a) learning a skill in analytical philosophy such as defending a claim or outlining someone elses argument, b) a practical skill such as building a rudimentary ai, c) practical applications such as considering what different theories of mind and understandings of ai might mean to different contemporary problems such as climate change, unemployment.",
    "strengths --- good variety of readings; reading responses kept me responsible; office hours were fun weaknesses\/improvements --- perhaps there could have been more emphasis on the connections between the different topics; also i would've liked more direction\/instruction during class discussion; perhaps guiding questions about the readings can be suggested every week",
    "The main strength is Professor Greco himself -- he is a great professor who works hard to illuminate the readings and challenge student's viewpoints. We also read some very interesting material (in my opinion, the most interesting readings are at the beginning and end of the course). One weakness might be the class format -- if we met twice a week instead of once, I think we might have had better discussions since people tend to get tired after two hours of seminar (but then again, meeting twice a week gives you less time to do readings, so it's a trade-off)."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn about philosophy of mind, definitely. The readings were good and the weekly responses force to engage with at least part of the content. At the same time, the class is not so engaging that I would recommend it to someone looking for any philosophy course to take. The in-class discussions can end up feeling slow and circular. Unless this specific content is important to you, I think there are probably better classes.",
    "Highly. Very interesting coursework, structured in a way that forces you to engage with material (seminar, weekly reading responses) without being overwhelming. Consistent and good feedback.",
    "Yes, I thought it was worth taking if you're interested in the subject matter. It was mostly dealing with historical problems in the phil of mind and then touched a bit on AI stuff and a hodgepodge of problems towards the end.",
    "I would, if you already have a background in philosophy and are interested in the specific topics.",
    "Yes--Dan Greco is wonderful",
    "I'd recommend it if the student is okay thinking about very abstract questions.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student with an interest in machine learning\/cognitive science\/neuroscience who however is familiar with the way philosophy works. The combination of the two makes this course extremely useful to develop ways to think about the behavior of AI and about the real requirements of intelligence and consciousness. I would not recommend this course to any person who has not taken a philosophy course before, as some of the material is perhaps a bit hard to play with without any background. Also, if you find talking about things we might have no epistemic access to frustrating I am warning you about the consciousness unit!",
    "I would recommend this class if you're very interested in the topic. It should not be taken as a filler philosophy class as the material might not be the most engaging",
    "Would recommend this class to people who already havea good grasp of philosophy skills and want to take on higher level content and reading on philosophy of mind.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have an interest in analytical philosophy, and particularly in thinking about interesting problems (such as what intelligence is) in abstraction.",
    "i would recommend to a student who is interested in topics in (relatively) contemporary philosophy of mind and philosophy of AI, but do note that the course is split between rather disparate topics, some of which you might find more interesting than others.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to experienced philosophy students who are interested in the material and willing to challenge themselves. Because of the mix of grad students and undergrads in the course, sometimes it was difficult to participate, and so I would recommend the class only to other undergrads who are confident in their opinions and willing to speak up in seminar.",
    "Yes I would, as long as they're interested in philosophy of mind. This is definitely a philosophy (and cog sci) course, so I would caution people who are attracted by the \"A.I.\" in the title -- even though we do discuss that, it's mostly from a philosophical lens, so make sure that's what you want when you take the course. But if you like philosophy, then definitely I recommend the course."
