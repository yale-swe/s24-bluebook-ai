   "comments": [
    "YES. TAKE IT. If you need a science credit, don't look further. I literally tried everything from ornithology to planets and stars and this class is the best (and most painless)",
    "Good class, esp if you need a science credit",
    "Basically, this is a class where the lectures aren't terribly easy to understand, and because each test is NOT accumulative, you'll find yourself studying the subject matter maybe for a total of 5 days out of the term.With that being said, if you're interested in a class that will provide a spark of interest in the field of biology, this one can do it. I'm a humanities student, and I found the articles incredibly interesting to the point where I want to take a few more Bio classes before I graduate.",
    "I needed a science credit, and this class gave me a science credit. The workload was not demanding, but you do need to put in a good amount of studying before each test. I liked how the tests weren't worth too much each, and I liked how we had a lot of flexibility with the final paper. I didn't particularly enjoy lectures. They were hard to follow and kind of dull.",
    "I definitely recommend this if you need a science credit and want something interesting\/manageable. Even if you don't need the science credit I recommend it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE IT FOR A SC. It's not worth it. It's actually a fair amount of work (3 exams and a final paper) - you can find better classes with less work.",
    "Yes, especially since it was a Sc credit.",
    "If you really need a science credit then this is a good class for that. Some of the topics are interesting the lecturers can put you to sleep. Charles Sindelar was very good, Dieter Soll on the other hand was not.",
    "Very interesting insight on modern issues in the science world.",
    "I would recommend this as a science credit to a non-science major.",
    "Take it if you need a science credit. You learn applicable material and feel more knowledgeable about current issues in biology, but it can be very frustrating. It also is not a super big gut unless you took AP bio and did well and remember it all. Even then it's not necessarily a gut.",
    "You have to take this class, it's not too difficult, and it's interesting material, and the workload is really reasonable.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "If you need a non-science major science credit. I would take it. But definitely not as my first choice. It is a class that I would have done better in earlier in my Yale career and definitely in high school. It's really boring, but if you need the Sc credit, you need the Sc credit.",
    "GREAT way to get a science credit - as long as you pay attention, you'll never be stressed in this course.",
    "Chill class, not that bad, the paper is the worst part but I think its worth it.",
    "Take it if you are looking for a science credit. Go to lecture, keep up and you should be fine.",
    "Definitely recommend if you want to learn about a wide variety of scientific issues.",
    "Good class. Definitely not a gut, as there are 3 tests and a paper, but interesting and manageable if you keep up",
    "Take it in the fall, I hear another department teaches it and it's easier. If you're really interested though, there is a lot of great material here. It is taught at a level where there is some serious science, but you're never overwhelmed.",
    "Issues Approach is a great way to get a science credit. The lectures are pretty boring, with no fault of the professors (I really just think that if you're used to humanities lectures, even the best science lecture will seem dry). Thankfully, if you have any high school bio background, you don't really need to attend lecture as long as you spend some time reviewing the powerpoints and key terms before the exams. I also enjoyed section once in a while, and definitely enjoyed writing the paper. I really did feel that I got to engage with the issues in a new way, which was a nice surprise. Don't take it if you want to learn a lot of bio and don't take it if you know so little bio that you'll need to get a lot out of lecture, but if you're somewhere in the middle it's a good option.",
    "Take it.I took it for the science credit. Wasn't as easy as I thought it was, but it was feasible. Just go to class and section and pay attention (aka be a real student) and you'll do fine.",
    "Take it if you want a science credit that demands a relatively low time investment. It is interesting material.",
    "Take it as an easy Science credit. You will learn about interesting current issues like GMOs and stem cell research",
    "Interesting, and super chill too. The only class I've taken at Yale where the teacher actually told us, \"don't worry about this, it won't be on the exam, so you don't need to know it in detail.\" A fun and not-too-stressful way to get that pesky science credit out of the way!",
    "Looks a lot better than it is. In the end, I'm glad I took it, but it is a very flawed class. As a non-science major, it was a good credit, but not without its \"issues\". The class was not well organized and the lecturers were inconsistent. But the material is very interesting, and if you can get into it while you're studying for the tests, that's the best way to get through the class. Don't expect it to be too easy--the tests are not always as easy as they'd seem. Having a good TA really makes a difference, so shop around for one if you can.",
    "If you want an easy Sc credit, take this course.",
    "A very good and potentially useful course. It aims to give non-science people a basic understanding of science, which is admirable. Overall, the course helped my understanding. Sometimes, though, it got a little too sciencey or jargony (especially with Sindelar, and to a lesser extent Soll). It's structured in a great way: three non-cumulative exams, one 6-7 page paper exploring a scientific controversy. Not a gut; it could be a really great course if they made it a little less jargony.",
    "Relatively easy bio class",
    "Issues Approach to Biology is a fairly easy science class for non-majors, and by discussing important scientific issues I'd say the class is something you should definitely consider.",
    "It's Issues Approach to Bio. Take it if you need a science credit, but I'd hold off on taking it right away. There are always better science credit courses--try to get into those first, and take Issues as a backup, because it's taught every semester.",
    "Take it. It's not too difficult, and if you really allow yourself to, you can actually get a decent foundation in a lot of the topics that are discussed.",
    "Take it if you need the science credit. The material is quite interesting, and the class itself is very easy (especially if you took some science classes in high-school)",
    "fun and simple science credit. take it for your requirement.",
    "A science credit, nothing more nothing less. There are some interesting facts, but don't expect to learn anything in this class except for a coterie of specifics that will be forgotten with one or two exceptions within a year.",
    "Not too hard, so don't do the readings. Get a group to review the key terms before every exam. Don't slack off, but otherwise, real gut.",
    "An Issues Approach is definitely worth taking for the Sc credit. If you're willing to go to lecture and look over the powerpoints for exams, your grade will be fine. I learned a surprising amount throughout the semester, so I'd definitely recommend this course.",
    "Even though Issues Approach is thought of as a joke science class, I personally learned a lot from it. You learn about topics relevant to your life, like antibiotics and Cancer. I feel a lot more knowledgable now. If you keep up with the class, it's pretty straight forward.",
    "It is a fairly easy class that will get you a Sc credit. Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for non-science majors looking for an SC credit. Now I feel I can hold my own in conversation of these issues, and the class rekindled my interest in biology. Definitely a \"science gut,\" but that does not mean it can't be interesting, fun - and even challenging if you put in the effort.",
    "This class is a great way to fulfill an Sc credit. A bit less \"issues\" and a bit more \"bio\" is covered than I expected (though nothing too technical still), but the coursework is a fair load and the sections force you to gain knowledge of the material (instead of a pure discussion section, you have to work in groups of three\/four to respond to \"discussion questions\" via a write-up -- locate a fast typer within the section!). The lecture quality varies widely, with Professor Breaker being the best, Sindelar in the middle, and Soll dreadful. I'd recommend this class.",
    "Very little work and not particularly hard (especially if you've taken AP\/IB Bio) but this class is incredibly boring and VERY poorly taught. Teachers range from just unengaging to completely incomprehensible (Dieter's accent made him really hard to understand). A good section leader is CRUCIAL to this class - my section leader taught me literally everything and is the only reason I learned the material, despite going to every lecture. If you don't like your section leader, switch sections or drop the class.",
    "Yes because it is a good science credit for non-science majors.",
    "No.",
    "I would recommend it because there isn't a stressful amount of work to hand in, but you still learn a lot.",
    "Take it if you need a SC credit, though I imagine there must be more exciting SC credits at Yale. The course material is at least somewhat interesting, and I can't say I didn't learn a thing or two about biology. Just as a warning, though, make sure you're good at dealing with tedium. If you aren't, that might make the lectures--and therefore studying for tests--a bit difficult.",
    "Not great. Take it if you can't find a better science class. Almost no work, study for the exams the night before and you should do fine.",
    "Intro drive-by of issues and their biological underpinnings.",
    "Good topics. More sciency than you would expect, but completely manageable. Very good class for non-science majors.",
    "Basically an introductory biology class with some broad issues touched on.",
    "Yes, however they should be ready to study for exams",
    "Good survey class if you are interested in Biology. Not too much work and I learned a lot.",
    "Not as easy as one would think. Not always the most interesting material, but a good survey.",
    "Take it if you like bio and need the science credit.",
    "In retrospect, should have taken enviro engineering. Learned, but not much",
    "Eh. It's kind of rough at times. I think it really depends on who your TA is. Lectures are kind of boring sometimes (I stopped going eventually) and I relied on section a lot.",
    "If you're a science major this class is an easy A. Take it!"
