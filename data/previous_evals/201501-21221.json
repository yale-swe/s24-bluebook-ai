    "I would describe this course as a survey course that covers various neurological diseases and discusses the symptoms, causes, and treatments of these diseases to the extend that these are understood. I would recommend this course to a student who wanted to gain a diffuse understanding of this type of disease without going into detail on any topic.",
    "A series of seminars on neurological diseases with amazing guest lecturers",
    "NBIO 507 provides a brief introduction to a number of neurological diseases. Each class introduces a new disease. Associated readings -- usually a research article and a review -- are provided before the class to give some background. The readings are often above the level of someone with casual neuroscience knowledge, but the lectures generally present basic information about the disease in a very understandable way. It's a good class and you'll learn a lot, but it can be intimidating at times.",
    "It's a broad overview of many different diseases. Each class, someone at the top of the research field for a specific disease will give a presentation. There isn't a lot of cohesion, and you don't go into that great depth for any particular disease, but for an overview, it's really fantastic, there's no one better to be teaching this material. The course load is pretty light (reading a couple scientific papers for each class, one short midterm paper, one short final paper, and giving a presentation and leading a discussion) and the professors are supportive. My year, the class was mostly senior undergraduates although there were also a couple grad students."

   "comments": [
    "I was exposed to the breadth f the field and now have a better understanding of what we know and what we don't",
    "I learned a lot about a variety of diseases, a little about methods, and some basic biology facts that I somehow had never learned before.",
    "Again, it was a bit too broad for my personal taste - but I think that's just the format of the class, which is wonderful if you're looking for a broad overview."
