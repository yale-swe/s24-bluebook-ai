   "comments": [
    "I developed a general understanding of how our modern healthcare politics took root throughout the 21st century. I also practiced analysis of primary source historical documents.",
    "I developed a better understanding of the post-war period in the US in terms of culture and society. What surprised me was that the material related more to different trends and stories that captured national attention during the early Cold War period, as opposed to direct, strong connections to the Cold War itself. However, I very much enjoyed the survey of health\/medicine topics.",
    "Analyzing primary sources and producing historiography. Many insights into the American culture of the early Cold War era, a fascinating period.",
    "I learned how to analyze primary sources and develop a historical argument. I also became more comfortable voicing my ideas in class.",
    "My writing skills developed immensely. I also developed my ability to think about medicine in both a scientific and sociocultural way.",
    "This course helped me improve my writing skills, specifically those required to write history research papers. I also learned a good deal about the state of and developments in the fields of science and medicine in the post-WWII, early Cold War period.",
    "It's impossible to sum up everything I learned in this little box! I learned more in this class than I've learned in most of my classes. Through this course, I was able to learn all about the way that medicine was influenced by the context of the Cold War. More than that, I learned to look at events using a historical and contextual scope, which has given me an entirely new excitement for history. The content in the class was extremely interesting, and I wouldn't change a thing!",
    "- Learned to develop my argument more and elaborate on it - Medical developments in the 1960s",
    "Analysis of primary documents; we wrote a number of papers throughout the semester and Professor Rogers helped us improve our writing over the course of the semester rather than just one large final paper at the end of the term, which I preferred.",
    "I gained knowledge in the various ways medicine collided with the social, political and economic aspects of the Cold War. I developed a greater sense of how the Cold War impacted the medicinal and public health communities as well as how the groups would interact with the public during this period. I also learned about the major medically historical events within this period.",
    "I definitely learned more about American medicine and public health during the Cold War period from doing the readings for this course. I also got a lot out of writing my research paper. But I feel like the instructor definitely could have done more to guide us through all three of the writing assignments. In other history seminars Ive taken, weve talked about the final paper every class starting about halfway through the semester, done an initial proposal\/source search paper and gotten feedback from the instructor, and workshopped our essays with classmates. None of this happened in Professor Rogers class. She talked about the paper briefly during two classes about a month before it was due and you really had to go out of your way to get feedback from her."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the discussion format of the course. I also loved doing role plays or mock debates in class. I would have liked if the readings were online. The course packet was expensive. I also thought it could have bene useful to have something to guide discussion in class. Maybe one student each week could come up with a discussion guide or each student could come with questions prepared. I also thought some of the readings were boring. Like why did we have time to talk about fluoride but not birth control? We didn't talk about gender once. Last suggestion. Our midterm paper was assigned the Tuesday we left for October break and due the Monday we returned. First, that is rude. Second, our instructor's biggest recommendation to us from the first paper was to utilize the writing center, but we didn't have the opportunity to do so for the second.",
    "Some of the most engaging seminar discussions that I have had at Yale, all well-facilitated by Dr. Rogers and her historical insight. Particularly enjoyed the couple role-play debates we had.",
    "Perhaps a deadline for rough drafts of the final research paper -- though that could have been self-enforced.",
    "Strengths - lots of opportunities to discuss ideas with classmates, nice variety of class activities (I especially loved the role playing!), very reasonable workload, excellent selection of diverse primary documents, Professor Rogers is a fantastic seminar leader, detailed feedback on written assignments and tips for how to improve, fascinating weekly topics which gave me a deeper appreciation for the rich and complex history of American Medicine Weaknesses - Nothing comes to mind. Perhaps short written assignments to make sure we keep up with the weekly readings?",
    "The course is very interesting and exciting. We did many simulations and I was never bored. The class worked well together and made some very astute points. No real criticisms.",
    "The strengths of this course include the material covered and Professor Rogers' knowledge about the subject. The main weakness of this course was the lack of discussion in the seminar. I felt that the class was generally Professor Rogers asking questions about the readings and then several students offering their thoughts, before Professor Rogers would ask another question. One time when we were able to have more of a discussions was when we did \"role playing\" using the readings. I would not recommend doing more \"role playing\" but perhaps other activities during class may help foster a discussion among students and the professor.",
    "- Strengths: lot of interesting material, manageable courseload - Weaknesses: not much guidance in writing from the instructor apart from the comments on papers",
    "Strengths: the material, Professor Rogers is an engaging and enthusiastic professor I think the class could use a bit more breaking off into groups - talking in large seminars can sometimes be daunting and it's nice to get to know your classmates and to hear their opinions on the material in a more casual setting.",
    "I thought this seminar featured an interesting and diverse set of readings, an intelligent and enthusiastic professor and interactive discussions. I sometimes thought the reading was a bit long due to having to read a whole book on top of normal reading requirements. I also would have preferred that the assignments be given with more warning, in terms of being given information about what is expected sooner.",
    "The main strength of this class is that its content is really interesting and rich, in my opinion. Thats also why I was pretty disappointed. Professor Rogers just didnt seem super engaged or interested in developing us as historians and you really had to go out of your way to get substantive feedback and guidance. I got the impression that she has been teaching this course this way for a long time but wasnt particularly interested in tailoring the discussion to our interests or letting us shape the class in any way.",
    "Readings provided great breadth and interesting perspectives. I especially enjoyed the diversity of texts assigned. I wish there had been more time spent on Cold War context.",
    "The selected readings were interesting, and I liked that during class we took time to discuss each one in depth. Though the seminar had a lot of students there were opportunities for everyone to contribute to the discussion."

    "This class will be interesting if you are interested in the Cold War or healthcare politics. Taking it will give you broad understandings of the foundations of our modern healthcare climate. It wasn't the best class, but I'm still glad I took it.",
    "Absolutely. Well-selected and interesting primary\/secondary sources in the readings paired with a great discussion facilitator in Dr. Rogers. I enjoyed this course and learned more than I expected going in--would highly recommend.",
    "Amazing seminar. Professor Rogers is a great discussion-leader and a true expert on the topic. Great insights into the time period. I would recommend anyone interested in American history to take this course. You learn a lot about American culture and lifestyle throughout the early Cold War era with a variety of topics about medicine as the starting point.",
    "HSHM 448 is a gem. This is my favorite class that I've taken as an HSHM major - but I also think is class is super accessible (and valuable) for non-history\/HSHM majors! The workload is very reasonable (around 40-80 pages of reading each week, 2 short papers (4-5 pages and 7-8 pages), 1 final research paper (15 pages). We learned about a fascinating range of topics in American Medicine between 1945-65, including atomic medicine, civil rights and efforts to integrate medical training, medicine and McCarthyism, the AMA's defeat of National Health Insurance, etc. The course drew on a rich variety of source material (newspaper articles, advertisements, books, op-eds, etc). Professor Rogers is an excellent seminar leader. Her passion for and expertise in medical history truly shined. She did a great job of encouraging lively classroom discussions. She also gave helpful, detailed feedback on my writing. I have nothing but praise for this class. I'm certain that I became a better writer because of it, and the class is just so much fun!",
    "Yes absolutely! Amazing class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in the subject or who is looking to improve their writing. Professor Rogers is not an easy grader, but I believe she does this to push students to improve their writing.",
    "If you're interested in medicine\/public health and looking for a writing credit, take the course. But the professor is pretty strict in grading, so beware.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student because it features an interesting and engaging historical focus and the professor is great! The Cold War is a fascinating period and in viewing the period through the lens of medicine, you can gain new insights to the period and the major events from it.",
    "Unless youre just looking for a very low-effort and low-energy history seminar with interesting readings, I wouldnt recommend this class. You can do better.",
    "Would recommend this class to anyone genuinely interested in social issues tied up in medicine. Don't take if you want a gut - you'll be wasting everyone's time including your own. Rogers is hilarious and no-nonsense, which makes the class fun.",
    "Yes, this is a great HSHM seminar. Naomi Rogers is a great professor. She keeps seminars discussions interesting. Readings are never excessive and usually very good and easy to get through.",
    "Yes! Very engaging class, and an excellent overview of the Cold War in America through a medical\/public health lens."
