    "This is the worst class I took at Yale as a freshmen. The instructor blows through the material and is not helpful, the tests are horribly-worded, the problem sets don't help with the exams, assignments aren't returned on time, there is no real textbook you can supplement the lecture with, and you walk out of the lecture every day feeling like you learned nothing. I can't say if this is better or worse than the big lecture, but this class is actually the worst academic experience I have had so far.",
    "I'd recommend it to any student. Solid intro course.",
    "Take it if you really like econ.",
    "Take it with Sigga. She is a fantastic and engaging teacher. These sections are a welcome change from the large Macro lecture in the fall, and allow you to engage in the material and the course much more than compared to lecture.",
    "Yes because you need it for a lot of future courses.",
    "Never!!! Run away to the lecture if necessary!!!I can think of several reasons why one would take a seminar: more connection to the professor, interactive classes and material, etc.I strongly feel that none of these reasons are satisfied by taking macro with Sigga.Weaknesses:1) Rampant grammatical errors in problem sets, midterms, and final.2) She reads off of the slides. While this is convenient for people who skip the lectures, it is not engaging to sit through.3) Midterm 2 had an impossible problem (numbers didn't make sense). When she brought up this issue during the next class, she said it was her TA's fault for not correcting her mistake.4) The grading is unclear in this class. It took a long time for both exams to be graded. As of the end of the semester, we still did not know our curved grades for the second midterm, whether or not it counted towards our final grade, or how points were distributed (because of the impossible problem)5) Professor rarely responds to emails6) One on one meetings didn't help me learn difficult material. Sigga seemed rushed during our meetings, rushing through explanations and usually repeating the same thing\/idea to explain a topic I had a hard time understanding.7) This class amounts to a poorly attended lecture. There is no interaction between the professor and students, as you would expect in a seminar. I don't recall her calling anyone by their name during class the entire semester.8) Several questions on the 1st and 2nd midterm were on terms that had literally never even been discussed in the book or in class.9) It seemed that studying for the exams did little in the way of preparing for the exam. There were always new styles of questions on the same material from the problem sets. An understanding of the topics didn't help so much as being able to discern what Sigga wanted.10)Sigga seems disconnected from how the class is doing. She seemed surprised during our final that no one had passed in their exams after 2h50min of a 3hr test. She has assumed that problems and topics were easy when significant portions of the class had a poor understanding. This is partly why her explanations over problems during office hours were repetitive and hurried.",
    "There was absolutely nothing I liked about this course. While it is technically a seminar, it is taught much more like a lecture; there is virtually no interaction between the professor and the students, and the professor just reads notes off of powerpoint slides in a really mundane and monotonous way that makes it literally impossible to pay attention. Furthermore, she doesn't add much to her lectures other than what is already on the slides, and these slides are posted online, so there is legitimately no incentive to go to class at all because you really don't get anything out of it that you can't get from just reading the powerpoints on your own. There is an extreme disconnect between the professor and the rest of the class; she really has no idea how we are all doing, whether or not we understand the material, how prepared we are for exams, or even what our names are (and this is a seminar!!!). She also isn't very good at responding to emails, which DEFINITELY is a major inconvenience to students. Additionally, in terms of exams, it REALLY seems that no matter how much you study, you simply cannot prepare yourself for these exams; they are just so...random. And out of nowhere. And sometimes they legitimately don't even make sense mathematically; our second midterm of the year featured a 20 point problem with numbers that actually didn't work out. Also, exams often include questions and topics that have never been seen before \/ that we have never been taught, so, as I said before, studying for these exams really in no way prepares you for them. The professor is also really, really bad at getting exams back to students on time...we didn't get our second midterms back until READING WEEK, and even then we only got our raw score...we STILL haven't gotten (and NEVER WILL) our curved grades, so we don't even know how we're doing in the class! I honestly wish someone warned me about how horrible an experience this class would be before I took it.",
    "This is the best way to get Macro out of the way.",
    "I would recommend the lecture. The curve for the seminar is brutal, and while I've heard that Ray Fair is quite dry, the curve is much easier than in the seminar, as there is quite a sizable contingent of people taking econ for the QR credit, frequently not showing up to the class.",
    "Yes, and take it with Sigga. Also, invest in buying the mid-level Mankiw textbook. It is actually the textbook Sigga works from.",
    "Unless you need the class for a major, don't take it. The lectures are boring and all over the place while the tests are really difficult and poorly written. It's a frustrating class.",
    "The material is not too bad, but the curve is and Sigga's powerpoints could use some cleaning up. Also doesn't help that many of the test questions are poorly worded.",
    "The material is interesting, and this class definitely helps you to better understand current events-you will know what they are talking about on CNN or in the New York Times. This class was not taught very well, however. The book is good.",
    "Take this course only if you need to take Macro econ. Don't take it for fun. It is terribly taught.",
    "If you are set on taking Macro, I would definitely recommend 111, especially over the lecture format. The personal attention and access to the professor that you get in the lecture is well worth any extra difficulty in the material. This class is definitely challenging for someone who has never been exposed to macroeconomics, but definitely doable and incredibly enlightening. You'll understand more about how the economy works as a whole, and everything you learn has so much relevance in the real world. There were weekly problem sets (of reasonable difficulty), two midterms, and a final exam.",
    "I would recommend Econ 111 for another student. I think it covers many important political topics with interesting mathematical models, though there is room for improvement in the verbal explanations offered alongside the mathematical explanations. The difficulty of the course depends on your ability to plug and chug and to choose between different mathematical methods.",
    "The best way to take Intro Macro at Yale. The seminar is more engaging than the lecture and on the whole, Sigga does a good job. The competition is tough, as are the exams. Stay involved and you'll be alright.",
    "Good class, lots of opportunities to ask questions and the instructor will be there to help you. Expect to work hard, especially if you want to do well and even more so if you've never done macroeconomics before. Tests and grading are very tough. But although my grade was not the best I did learn a lot from this class and got a solid understanding of this very important part of society and our lives. In the end so many decisions in this world are guided by money and economic principles that taking economics is mandatory for every Yale student and this is a great way of learning it."
