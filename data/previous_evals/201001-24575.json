   "comments": [
    "If you want to read in french and analyze literature, take it. She is extremely nice and the books are enjoyable.",
    "This course is a great introduction to French Literature. You read a wide range of works, from poems and short stories to novels and plays. Professor Pinzka is very enthusiastic about the material and she leads very good discussions. You have to write three essays, but you can re-write the first two to improve your grade. If you're interested in improving your writing in French, while also reading important works of French Literature, FREN 170 is a good course.",
    "Good intro course. Kind of have to take it if you want to do any further French stuff. Lauren Pinzka is very nice and pretty chill about work\/assignments. That said, she can be a little hard on essay grades, but it really depended. Some of the works we read were really boring, but others were great.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 170. If you are at the L5 level and have taken advanced language practice, it is essential to take this course. The number of novels that we read seems intimidating at first, but it is a perfect pace. There is actually less work than the language speaking courses, because there aren't assignments due every class! The main time crunch involves writing the essays-but writing is soo much easier in French than in English.",
    "YES! Only if you take it with Madame Pinzka though. She's an incredible professor. The workload isn't too bad. The syllabus includes many famous french literature books that you should read anyway, and your only three assignments are 3 short papers plus an oral final. A very cool intro to French lit!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking to improve their French reading and writing skills (literary analysis).",
    "Covers a wide range of fantastic literature in a relatively short time. The focus is on the particular works, not the style of literature that they represent. Much depends on the eagerness of the other students in your section. Bad discussions can ruin this class. The workload is manageable.",
    "A great class...Madame Pinzka is great, but some of the other students can talk too long about obscure literary material. I really enjoyed improving my French writing.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are very strong in french, if not its probably not the best class for you."
