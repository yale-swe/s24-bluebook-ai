    "I would not recommend this class, only if you are desperate from a pre 1800s credit for the English major, or if you already know a fair amount about medieval Celtic literature. It's not a difficult class, and it won't take up a ton of time doing the work, but the lack of structure and organization made it really hard for me to figure out what information I should be focusing on.",
    "interesting class. not a ton of work, but very little feedback on your writing and only two assignments that determine your grade.",
    "Take it for the material or not at all.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are interested in the subject matter. It's an interesting overview of Irish and welsh literature (obviously early literature, as the course name states). Professor Gabriel is helpful and enthusiastic, and you learn quite a bit without being overwhelmed with tons of work. Worth considering!",
    "An interesting class - and probably totally different than anything you've taken before - with a very manageable workload. I'd recommend it if you're at all interested in Celtic mythology and literature; Prof. Gabriel is very knowledgable if occasionally a little meandering in class."
