    "I have a much greater and more nuanced appreciation for history -- particularly eastern European history over the last 100+ years. Also, I feel like I know how to read primary sources. The diplomatic simulations forced us to engage with the material on a much deeper. Not only did we learn the history more deeply, but we also gained insight into the practice and execution of diplomacy. There was an enormous amount of reading, so we all had to learn how to prioritize sections of the reading and where we could cut corners.",
    "This truly provided the opportunity to look at history and strategy in a new light--especially the evolution of \"truth\" in the post-election landscape.",
    "Strong comprehension of European history; developed skills in critical thinking, writing and diplomacy; Understood the complexities of history as a subject",
    "I learned about how diplomats are really fallible, like us.",
    "The course helped me think more about how history helps us to understand the present and how in retrospect, decision-making appears to be much easier and less complicated than it was.",
    "I gained not only advanced knowledge on modern European history but also the skills of historical analysis and decision making.",
    "I learnt diplomacy, politics."

   "comments": [
    "This course was a study in what not to do in many ways. The concept was fun and could have been very engaging had he cared. The professor clearly had a low opinion of his students--and it showed. It was clear that Tim Snyder thinks of his students as puppets and used simulations as a way to play with course material. I loved the setup of the course but the level of engagement from the class leadership was low at best. Prof. Snyder left many events early or showed up to class late--and we only had 1 hour of class per week! There was so little thought given to the simulations and so little clarity about the assignments that at the reception the night before our final simulation, our delegates decided to stage a walkout if they didn't receive more clarity (this didn't end up playing out, but through no resolution on Prof. Snyder's part). TLDR: simulations were fun, but it was clear Prof. Snyder didn't care at all about the class.",
    "Honestly, the logistics were the biggest headache (particularly at the final simulation where there was a lack of detail in terms of the actual mechanics, but also at our dinner out at Professor Gaddis' house which seemed a little disorganized) and the minimal feedback were mildly frustrating. We all assessed that Professor Snyder seemed to have, in general, something better to do than engage with us (which is probably true AND not entirely unreasonable AND not entirely unfair) and he remained largely inaccessible. That being said, we learned a ton.",
    "Simulations were fun and allowed a level of engagement that would otherwise not be there. However they were also disproportionately burdensome. Ideally there should only be one or two a semester because of amount of work they require Would be handy if instructor and teaching fellow could have regular office hours like other courses",
    "Strengths: Great information on European history and really enjoyed and learned from the simulations. Weakness: The course's name should be changed to \"History of the 'European' Present\", given the extremely Euro-centric nature of the course. While I did learn a lot about European history from a great professor, I wish I had spent more time learning about Asian history or African history. Their is a reason why many academics term this century as the Asian century, and if Jackson needs to keep up with the times then its required history courses, such as this one, should keep up with this. The course readings were WAY TOO MUCH!!!! While the content was definitely interesting, its virtually impossible to read every single book every week. Likewise, the assignments demanded WAY TOO MUCH work and the ambiguity in terms of expectations generated a lot of frustration. It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that this course be better organized. The Professor doesn't really care about any of his students.",
    "More engaging with the reading and more methodological teaching on how historians read texts and analyze them would be helpful",
    "Strength: The lectures by the professor and guest speakers were highly suggestive. The course gave us a lot of wisdom to become a great leader. Weakness: We received little feedback on our works and assignments. Both the professor and teaching assistant didn't seem to employ much care in fostering our understanding.",
    "I feel that the simulation are great, but they need to be executed better. I feel that the student roles of minister, pm, fm needs to strictly adhered to, that would ensure better engagement within teams and also between different teams."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend a class with a similar structure but taught by someone interested in teaching.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Snyder is, although hard to develop a relationship with on a more personal \/ one-on-one basis, an undeniably brilliant lecturer and a towering intellect, frankly. He's clearly one of the smartest people and most insightful historians \/ thinkers around.",
    "Yes--this class was a great way to learn about political philosophy throughout the ages, and how the world has come to look the way it does today.",
    "If this course was not so Euro-centric, disorganized and ambiguous, I might have recommended it to another student.",
    "This is a required Jackson course.",
    "No. I had the feeling that the course tries too much: It wants to convey at once an historical overview of the diplomatic history in the 20th century, give students an understanding of decision-making processes, and do some philosophy of history. The workload was way too high for the short 1-hour per week seminars, the texts we had to read were not critically discussed at all but rather it was a bit of a Q&A and it wasn't helpful for future policy-makers.",
    "I recommend this course not only to the students interested in modern European history but also to those concerned with history itself, but I don't recommend to the students who expect feedback from the professor.",
    "Yes I would. Interesting analysis of different world events."
