    "Yes - definitely take it!!",
    "The first few classes are lecture style, with a little bit of discussion type conversation. Most of the course is based around student presentations of specific topics with discussions questions so If you're not paying attention it is harder to learn about the topics. Big paper at the end but overall a very fun integrative experience of psychopathology and the family.",
    "Great course! Take it if you can. Abnormal psychology meets family dynamics.",
    "Good class to take if you're a psych major and need a senior seminar. Professor Lockhart is a gem, you definitely will appreciate having her as a professor! Her class has a decent workload, but she's very supportive. Just do your best and don't get too stressed out...everything will work out! I recommend this class. So yeah it's a chill class--very fun and engaging. Just do your best and you'll be good!",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a great course and you can apply these lessons to your interpersonal interactions within the family.",
    "opportunity to learn about a lot of interesting topics related to the family and psychology",
    "Great overview of how various mental disorders affect family life and how family life influences mental health. Take if you're interested in those things!",
    "It is fine. Good to take if you need another psych class but you don't learn too much.",
    "Really great psych seminar. I found the topics really interesting and enjoyed writing a reading response each week. Professor Lockhart is funny, engaging, and caring",
    "Professor Lockhart is great so if you're interested in the material tae this class. You learn about interesting topics and the workload is fairly manageable. You do have thought questions every week but make sure not to forget to work on the 20 page paper because the outline and final draft can creep up on you.",
    "This is a great class to take for the psych senior requirement. Professor Lockhart is one of the most warm, friendly professors I've ever had and she has tons of experience in the field. It is a good mix of lecture, student presentations, and discussion."
