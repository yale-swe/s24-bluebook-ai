   "comments": [
    "Don't take the course if you're taking 4 more heavy-paper\/research report classes like I did. The class is tough. Really tough, but you will emerge, battle-scarred and all, with a greater appreciation for the role of science journalists. As a science major, I feel that I learned more in this class that would apply in any future career than I have in all my science courses combined.",
    "You write four pieces: an explanation, a short (1,000 word) story, a profile and a long (4,000 word) story. You submit drafts for the latter two, which doesn't make that much of a difference since Carl Zimmer gives little in the sense of advice or support. Still, if you're at all interested in science writing, this is definitely a class to take. It gives you a real sense of what it would be like to be a science journalist, plus you do some really interesting readings, have great class discussions and get to say you took a class with the famous Carl Zimmer. I would actually recommend taking it Credit\/D; that way, you get out of the class what you put into it but you don't have to cry when Carl Zimmer fails you on your first two pieces.",
    "Definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in developing their writing skills. It's a lot of work, but truly rewarding if you put in the time to dig for story ideas, track down sources, do the in-person reporting, etc. By the end of this class you'll find that many of your writing skills have improved: clarity, voice, structure, and most importantly, confidence. Take the class Credit\/D if you don't want to stress about your grade; either way, simply working with Prof. Zimmer and a ton of talented peers will push you to try your best.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course for anyone going into enviro or science writing. It's an invaluable experience to be able to write and get feedback from someone very high up in the field, as well as from fellow students who represent the ideal readers: generally informed but often not about the specific topic.",
    "This class is extremely rigorous. You will work away for hours and hours and often receive a grade back that is much lower than you were hoping. That being said, this class will improve your writing. Professor Zimmer definitely knows what he's talking about and will be willing to meet with you to help improve your writing. My advice is to take the class Credit\/D\/Fail because that way you can improve your writing without having to worry about your GPA.",
    "Don't take it.Prof. Zimmer is an incompetent professor. He might be a nice enough person, but he has no idea how to teach. He does not seem to have experience in leading seminars. When he critiques a work, he never says anything positive about it, only things that can be improved. In fact, he said very few positive things about any works in the class, even the established examples he was showing us.Which might be okay, but even if you want to be a hardass, basically only negative is no way get people to hear your comments; everyone just got defensive, or the critiques became a sparing match, where the person being critiqued had to prove how much they had worked under an wave of criticism. No one was really going to ask a professor like that questions.Zimmer's comments on papers were sometimes helpful, but they got buried under advice that contradicted himself and seem to show that he was reading and critiquing our papers way to fast to really comment on them as a whole.Really, to get an idea about this class, you should read this satire of magazine editing. (This particular one is for a women's magazine, but Zimmer is definitely is coming from this world of editing). http:\/\/thehairpin.com\/2013\/12\/a-womens-magazine-editor-edits-a-bbc-news-story-about-syriaThose sort of the-reader-can-understand nothing remarks (ASSUMING SYRIANS ARE FROM SYRIA? EXPLAIN) are exactly the kind of remarks you're going to get from Zimmer on your articles. It's hard to say how much of that comes from Zimmer being just contrary and how much is because the magazine world where he lives is just like that and he's parroting the edits he gets, but no matter: it's no way to actually learn anything.",
    "This course is difficult. Researching and writing the articles requires constant thinking and lots of work. If you're interested in science writing, and if you find great topics to write about, the work can be fun and interesting. If you're not really dedicated to science writing, you probably won't like this class. The readings for the class are top-notch. Most of class time is spent discussing professionally-written articles. Zimmer is good at leading interesting class discussions, although I'm not sure how much I learned in terms of how to apply what I read in those articles to my own work. In terms of the writing, Zimmer is not the best instructor. His comments on drafts are often numerous but unhelpful in the grand scheme of things. He gives few general comments at the end of a draft, and mostly in-line comments. Even when you fix every in line comment, however, he marks you down in the final draft for something that wasn't mentioned in his comments on the first draft. This was frustrating, and did not improve during the semester. He also gives very low grades, and when you put hours upon hours of work into an article, getting only negative feedback becomes frustrating and demoralizing by the end of the semester, no matter how tough a skin you have. If you love science writing, this is a class that will give you experience with the area; if you don't especially love science writing, take a different writing class.",
    "Good class, I learned a lot, the hard way. Zimmer's a little scary when he reviews your writing. There is not an ungodly amount of work, but when a deadline is coming up, it sure feels that way.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class but be prepared to put in the time. It was one of the most demanding but also one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This class will give you the opportunity to write under the tutelage of an amazing science writer. He will be your editor and provide you with as much feedback as you would like. If you are looking for this opportunity - and if you want to spend hours upon hours reporting and writing - then go for it.You do NOT need to be a prolific journalist to take this class. Some of my classmates were editors-in-chief of student publications, and other had never written journalism. Many had a science background. In fact, if you have a ton of journalistic experience, some of the classes might be monotonous - you'll spend a lot of time picking apart published articles to talk about the basics of good writing. This can be greatly helpful if you've never heard it before, and somewhat helpful if you have. Just don't expect every class to be utterly enlightening.Professor Zimmer gives good grades to good work. If you want to be forced to do good work, then make sure not to take it Cr\/D.",
    "This class is hard, and you have to really put in the work required. I'd recommend taking it Cr\/D\/F if you're really worried about grades. But it's all worth it- the skills you learn and the critiques you receive really refine your writing"
