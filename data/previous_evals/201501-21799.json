    "Learning Chinese is fun! The time commitment of having class everyday and homework every night with daily quizzes, and biweekly presentations can be quite a lot but your Chinese will greatly improve and all the teachers are fun and amazing!",
    "I would recommend it, but I would caution students with very time intensive majors from taking it because it is an extremely time consuming course",
    "L1\/L2 Chinese is very intense, but it is a FANTASTIC introduction to Chinese--the best language course I have ever taken. I have taken Spanish and Korean courses as well, and Chinese at Yale is truly special--the teachers, the students, the coursework...everything. It will not be easy and it will force you to develop good study habits if you want to keep up. The work will be worth it!",
    "Take it. You will learn what you need to become a good speaker.",
    "Best class ever",
    "It's a very time consuming course, so consider that before you choose to take this course. But, if you really want to learn Mandarin, then this course is excellent.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to deeply engage in a language and is willing to put in the time and daily effort. It is a big commitment, but the language study is very rewarding.",
    "Definitely! It's a great class. Lots of work, but immensely rewarding if you keep up with it. Your Chinese will progress far in a short time.",
    "Chns L2 = Chns L1. I actually liked it better the second semester. But literally the same structure - you learn more than you think."
