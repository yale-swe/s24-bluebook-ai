    "Literally nothing. I don't come to Yale to be taught by a computer. The entire structure of this course is flawed. Seriously, who thought that forcing students to teach themselves integral calculus was a good idea?",
    "I relearned how to do calculus and learned polar, parametrics, and series.",
    "I learned more about mathematics specifically integrals and series that allowed for an easier understanding of some of my other STEM courses.",
    "Skills in Calculus II",
    "I learned how to integrate, how to evaluate if a sequence or series converges\/diverges and Taylor series.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of integral calculus: definite and indefinite integration, sequences and series, and the applications of these concepts."

   "comments": [
    "The structure of the course as a flipped course made it very easy to fall behind, especially when you are transitioning from the teaching styles used in the Math 112 course. The videos were helpful in accompanying the textbook though.",
    "Don't turn the instruction of this course into a series of videos. It's the most flawed system of instruction I've ever seen, and I went to a public high school. Every day in class we had to review every single practice problem from Canvas, and this is clearly indicative of a structural weakness.",
    "The material after midterm 2 that is included in the final is gone over very quickly and tested at the same intensity in the final and so it becomes very difficult then to learn the material by yourself.",
    "The videos were not always helpful in leavening the subjects.",
    "The homework was definitely a strength as it gave a lot of different types of problems that helped when studying for exams. I think some of the flipped classroom lessons were weaknesses in that I believe some sections should've been taught in class rather than in the videos. Some of the videos did not do a good job at teaching the information.",
    "Weaknesses: not really teaching the material in the classroom, videos didnt explain thoroughly",
    "The flipped course was a bit odd and it made the class seem a bit disorganized. I understand the purpose of the videos is to come to class with a rough understanding of the material but this made the course feel more like I was teaching the material to myself and less like there was a professor guiding me through how to learn the material. I would prefer a lighter introduction to the material and a more directed study of how to go about thinking of these concepts during class time. That being said I did find the videos helpful and it was nice to go back to them for review."

    "If you need 115, take it, if not, don't.",
    "Yes I would! This was a great course!",
    "Yes, because it helps to improve basic skills in math",
    "Yes, this course was well led and very organized.",
    "Although I find the flipped-course style to be a more disorganized way of teaching, calculus is such a fundamental subject that I believe everyone should take it, so I would say yes take this course."
