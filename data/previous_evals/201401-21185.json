    "If you like philosophy, then perhaps I would recommend it. I didn't realize it would be so heavy on the philosophy side, so I struggled a bit. Overall, it was an interesting experience and I learned quite a bit about a field of study I probably wouldn't have engaged with otherwise.",
    "This course had a thoughtfully-crafted and interesting syllabus and made good use of the theme \"consciousness and form\", using it to link together disparate texts in ways that raised interesting questions without overwhelming the independent value of the text, as is sometimes a problem in theme classes. However, this class consistently had some of the worst discussions of any seminar I've taken at Yale. The biggest problem was one of low expectations: the course centered on and rewarded the most basic, even trite, possible observations about texts. Professor Campbell consistently focused on the most obvious possible questions about the texts, and spent huge chunks of class enthusiastically considering blatant and intellectually lazy misreadings put forward by students. She personally responded to every comment made, often at length, which meant that students were never given a real chance to respond to one another and that the seminar had no sense of project or conversation. She consistently held the class well over the allotted time, despite regularly wasting up to ten minutes at the beginning of class writing on the board. Despite spending a very unusually high portion of the seminar talking herself, she very seldom put forward her own readings or knowledge, creating a dynamic that was the worst of both worlds: student conversation was curtailed but the professor's expertise was not interjected. And her inability to move the class forward at a reasonable pace meant that our discussions regularly focused on tiny slivers of massive texts and almost never provided opportunities to understand texts holistically or even really to present clear interpretations of them. I have found in Yale English classes that the level of student discussion can readily rise or sink to the level of the standards set by the professor. Professor Campbell, despite her knowledge and enthusiasm, set some of the lowest standards I've ever seen for the quality of student comments, which made class discussions almost impossible to learn from.",
    "Don't take it to fulfill the pre-1800\u2014go for a Shakespeare lecture or poetry seminar. It isn't worth the exhaustive booklist or discussions full of neurological non-sequitors.",
    "This course was very strange. It was a good class to take if you're looking to read 18th century literature, but the exclusive emphasis on \"consciousness\" really foreclosed a lot of potential discussion and learning. It's very, very repetitive, and if you're looking for a fast-paced or challenging discussion, this is likely not the class for you. If you're looking for an extended meditation on one topic and perhaps need to learn how to think about literature, this is probably a good class for you. Regardless, Professor Campbell is extremely knowledgeable and I would recommend asking her many questions.",
    "While 18th century literature was not my favorite, and I found some of the readings rather dull and annoying, the course itself and the topics we talked about regarding the literature was fascinating, and Professor Campbell is so encouraging of your critical and intellectual tastes that you can approach the texts from whatever angle you like and do good work on them. I did get bored by some of the texts, and I felt like discussions could get too digressive and long winded and lose my attention, but there were many fascinating and interesting concepts and ideas brought up which were thought provoking. I would recommend it.",
    "If you have any interest in 18th century literature or the intersection between literature and philosophy, take this course. Professor Campbell is really great. It really depends on the group of students you get in the class, but ultimately it's a good pre-1800 credit and definitely valuable to take as an English major.",
    "This course examines questions of consciousness and form in 18th century British literature. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in questions of consciousness and how minds are portrayed in literature, even if you do not have a specific interest in the 18th century. I went into the class without much interest in the 18th century but found myself engaged with and fascinated by the material because of the way Professor Campbell framed it within the subject of the course.",
    "ENGL 242 is a junior seminar in which you read philosophy, poetry, plays, novels, and essays from 18th century Britain. You write 2 papers (one short, one long) and do an in-class presentation, with which you receive lots of guidance and lots of freedom. Really fun and unique class, good discussion, and an encouraging and interesting professor."
