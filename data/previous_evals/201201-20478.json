    "Excellent",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to other students. I would stress that it requires a lot of student participation in order for it to be valuable. Students need to be self-motivated to put in the work required- there are no tests or midterms, and so much depends on the final grade. If one works accordingly, I think it will be a great course."

    "Excellent",
    "This course was valuable in my development as a biblical scholar. It is not a requirement but certainly an asset. The language skills I developed over the course of the term aided in my ability to use Akkadian texts in my research for other classes as well. Overall, one of the most valuable classes I have taken thus far."
