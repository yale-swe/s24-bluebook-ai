    "You have to take it if you're a math major, but it was actually a lot of fun. Coifman was awesome and knows so much about everything; you really should just try to absorb as much as possible from the man. Although he can seem brusque at times, he's very understanding and wants everyone to succeed. Be prepared to be slammed when you have to give presentations, but otherwise, there's little to no work.",
