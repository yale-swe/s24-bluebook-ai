    "I would recommend AMST 350 to another student because it touches on a multidisciplinary subject that seems to be evolving as we speak. The applications to architecture, law, literature, film, art, and cultural \/ sociology are endless. I think that any student can get as much or as little out of the class as he or she wishes, but Hayden definitely sets the bar high from the very beginning.",
    "This class takes a cultural history approach to American suburbs and sprawl, emphasizing mid-century vehicle culture, 50s housing fads, and utopian visions of suburbia. If you're interested in current issues with sprawl and smart growth, you'll get a bit of that at the end but probably not enough to keep you very interested throughout. The workload is rather light. Professor Hayden is very kind and extremely knowledgable, but didn't do a great job stimulating discussions or debates or very exciting engagement around the table. It often felt like we were brushing up against the same general truths (mortgage subsidies have fueled the growth of suburbia; the highway lobby always releases silly propaganda; innovative homes end up being too expensive for general middle-class consumption) without digging any deeper than we had gotten by the 3rd week of the semester. So if you consider yourself well-read on this stuff, you might find yourself frustrated during discussion. On the other hand, you'll definitely have a wide-open opportunity for whatever research paper you want, which is the main (nearly only) assignment of the class.",
    "A great class worth taking if someone is interested in Suburbs and Sprawl. The research project is a great way to investigate a topic and learn more about a particular suburban issue\/theme",
    "A really solid class where you will learn a lot if you put effort into it. I would recommend the class to any student with any level of interest in architecture or urban studies.",
    "Pretty standard seminar set-up (weekly readings and discussions, a final research paper with preparation, a small presentation or two). The readings are very interesting, and it is very helpful that Professor Hayden makes the paper due relatively early in the semester. I highly recommend the class to anyone interested in the material, because you will learn a ton and have challenging discussions about nuanced issues.",
    "I would summarize the class as an in depth study of American suburban development and would definitely recommend that another student take the class. My suggestion would be to take American Cultural Landscapes before, since a lot of the material this this class built on material covered in the lecture course.",
    "This was a class that I looked forward to going to each week. Coursework includes a research paper and class presentations. The class is self-selecting, so you really get to work with other people interested in the topic. Take if you're interested in urban studies, and of course, suburbs.",
    "YES. Especially if you're at all interested in the subject. Suburbs are a deeply integral part of the american landscapes and their implications stretch beyond their physical imprint. There's essentially one grade in this class \u0097 a 20-page research paper \u0097 so be prepared to work hard on that. It's really a challenge by choice class though because you don't really have to do the weekly readings but you'd miss so much interesting stuff if you did skip them.",
    "Take this class! Prof Hayden is an excellent professor who really knows what she is talking about. She has studied the issue of sprawl for years and even wrote some really interesting books on the subject. The class is a seminar and Hayden intends for it to be student-driven, so the success of the class depends on the classmates. However, for me, the class environment proved to be stimulating. You get to pick a topic that interests you and work the entire semester on a research paper. Hayden provides excellent feedback and much support.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking it.",
    "Take this class if and only if you have some actual interest in suburbia. It doesn't have to be an architectural interest, but I suspect that if you take this class on a whim it may seem disconnected and hard to learn a lot from. Professor Hayden is great, though, and if you are at all interested in architecture, urban design, or especially American culture, this is a must-take class."
