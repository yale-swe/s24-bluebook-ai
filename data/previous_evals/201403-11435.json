    "Ben Hayes and Marlyse Druguid offered amazing support for the course.",
    "Question 7: The learning material for the field trips was not well organized and didn't paint a clear picture of what we were supposed to be getting out of them.",
    "Ann is an amazing instructor who really cares about the students. She tried to put as many field trips in as possible, encouraged us to think critically about the material and always managed to make her class really fun. This was one of my favorite classes.",
    "Learning the concepts from a lecture based powerpoint format was not conducive to my learning style. There was a lot of text on the slides that made lecture seem as if I was reading a textbook. I could have really benefitted from a separate discussion section to go over the broad concepts from each lecture. I found lectures hard to follow and unorganized. There were a lot of detailed facts that were introduced, which took away from the big picture that I was supposed to take away from each lecture. I also could have benefitted from review questions after each lecture.",
    "Favorite class of my semester!",
    "Content was interesting, the lecture-from-powerpoint format is hard for me.",
    "Question 10: More than any other instructor I have encountered at FES, Ann Camp takes interest that students are learning the material and thinking critically about the material would be applied in their future work.",
    "This class will give you an excellent conceptual understanding on forests, their development and dynamics that affect them. The field trips are integral and well run and Ann choses readings that explain and provide discussion on the topics.",

    "The passion of the instructor. The diversity of students in the class (MEM vs. MESc MFS students). Incredible amount of information packed into one semester.",
    "The field trips are amazing! It is a great opportunity to get out and see how concepts are represented in reality. I really learned a lot from the field trips and enjoyed them a lot.",
    "Excellent field trips, which serve multiple, awesome functions: getting to know the forests as amazing resources Yale has to offer, getting to know your colleagues, and having the opportunity to devise your own lens for applying classroom theory to real settings. Presentations took a long time (3 weeks of class meetings) but were worth it since our classmates did interesting work-- it's not often that we get to share for 10 minutes and was a cool opportunity to learn about one another's work.",
    "Student presentations and projects",
    "I'd say the personal project (and the fact that we could do an annotatedd bibliography - it forced you to read a lot of scientific papers about a topic of your interest), Ann's humor and the philosophical questions that were raised.",
    "Professor Camp's lectures; student presentations.",
    "The organization of the class: the material built on the past topics in a logical way. The field trips really complemented and drove home the course material. The student presentations were really fascinating and varied at the end.",
    "The field trips were very helpful in visualizing the concepts introduced in class. I don't think I would have understood most of the concepts without the field trips. The presentation was a good opportunity to explore a topic of interest that related to concepts introduced in class. However the big emphasis on timing of the presentation took away from other more essential presentation skills.",
    "Excellent, well organized lecture and reading materials. Her wealth of knowledge and experience shines through to her students.",
    "Field trip w Tom Wessels.",
    "I liked the discussions, field trips, student presentations.",
    "Field trips were the best aspects. They quickly and succinctly synthesized all the classroom lessons. The readings are also a major value of this course. They were consistently the best and most interesting readings I had this semester.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings and presentations. The class builds on itself well and provides a very thorough overview of the evolution of knowledge and literature related to stand dynamics. Ann is also very knowledgeable and funny.",
    "The field trips, class presentations, and Ann's instruction.",
    "Class discussion was always great. Ann does a great job organizing the material and making it interesting.",
    "Ann is an excellent lecturer, and the field trips were extremely informative.",
    "The professor, the materials and the structure of the course.",
    "Field trips",

    "The tests are very applied and do not align with what we are taught and discuss in class. I loved this class, but think the we could be better prepared for the exams.",
    "Organization of learning material for field trips",
    "Not just read the slides, but also bring practical examples. Slides are full of text and sometimes confusing, making the class not interesting at all.",
    "Some papers were less relevant I feel.",
    "It would be great to have a \"wrap-up\" summary class - to put all the concepts together in the end.",
    "Lectures need to be reformatted. The powerpoints were rich with text and hard to follow. The paper discussions seemed to be diverge from the paper's main points. I think to improve discussions email the discussion questions for each paper before class so students have time to think about them. I found the pace of lectures to be extremely fast paced and it was difficult to grasp the concepts during class time. An overview slide from the previous lecture would be helpful. An overview slide of what is going to be discussed at the beginning of every class section would also be helpful. There was also little instruction given as to how to format the annotated bibliography and there were no student produced examples provided as a resource. The organization of the course schedule was often confusing. The resources on the classesv2 website often didn't match the schedule and I often found myself reading the wrong papers for class. Sometimes unfair that students who did not have a class before or after stands got extra time to work on the final and midterm. If the final is 2 hours long then all students should have 2 hours to complete the final not 2 - 3. Be mindful that some students have back to back finals during exam week.",
    "It was weird, after the midterm, how there were only a few lectures before it was three straight weeks of student presentations. It felt like things lost momentum before the final exam.",
    "I wonder if there are ways to discuss content from student presentations in class, rather than just presenting them and being done. Felt a little disjointed.",
    "My only major suggestion is to add more field trips.",
    "Some of the course materials seem a little dated, such as the power point slides. It was hard to know if all of the information was the most up to date (I think it was but, I'm not sure).",
    "I would have loved more time in the field! A bit more walking through how Ann would make management decisions- maybe some case studies- would have been useful.",
    "I don't think this course needs significant improve.",
    "Make us more accountable for the readings by forcing us to identify questions on Dropbox prior to class.",
    "Anne's lectures are good, but I had trouble seeing how the different concepts linked together and how that applies to the real world. I felt like there was a disconnect between different lectures and then between the lectures and the exams."
