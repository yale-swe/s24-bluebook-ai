    "The material was interesting and enjoyable, the workload, on average, manageable, however, the seminar was poorly run and there was no discussion. I would only recommend this course to a passionate Miltonist, plus, it covers two Comparative Literature requirements. Otherwise, the lack of discussion made one of my least preferred classes."
