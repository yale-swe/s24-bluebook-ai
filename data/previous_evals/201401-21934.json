   "comments": [
    "Professor Dimock is great but the class discussions can get pretty stale and long. The books are great but it is difficult to keep up with the reading.",
    "This was a thoroughly enjoyable class that I would recommend to anyone interested in reading American literature or in need of a writing credit. The class was a great way of exploring new novels that i'd never read or even heard of. It did have a lot of reading \u2013 A new book every week was a bit much especially in the way the class was structured. Prof. Dimock was understanding of how quickly we were moving through books but I feel like class discussions would've been improved had everyone been on the same page. At 18 students, the class also felt a bit large for an English seminar \u2013 I often felt like we didn't get as in-depth as we could have with some books. Students are also required to give a \"presentation\" aka lead class discussion for a day. The class only required two papers (one 5-7 page, and another 10-15 pages \u2013 very manageable). I enjoyed the class overall \u2013 the books were very interesting, the discussions were engaging, and i think i now have a new way of approaching novels.",
    "My favorite class this semester! It has a great reading list, and I personally didn't mind doing the readings. It is a lot though especially if you have other readings-heavy classes. Class discussions were interesting and engaging. The professor is amazing! I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "A wonderful course with a great professor, fun readings, engaging discussions, minimal written work besides two creative essays. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get back to reading without reading boring essays or ancient texts. None of these books were boring and I loved all of them!",
    "Literary Cities is a great freshman seminar. In this class we basically spend 12 weeks reading 12 different American novels. Professor Dimock is a great teacher and discussions are always interesting and never rigid. The reading can sometimes feel a little heavy at times but manageable. Every student gives a presentation at some point (just an outline with summaries and discussion points) and there are two papers throughout the whole semester. If you get a spot in this class, take it!",
    "I recommend this course if you have time with it. The virtue is in the reading, and if you don't have time to read a novel a week then it's not worth it.",
    "ENGL 012 01 is a great survey of American literature with a particular focus on urban settings. Although there is a lot of reading (and unfortunately I couldn't get to all of the novels), I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys American novels. I learned a lot about the literary culture of our nation's cities and I believe that I have become a better writer.",
    "Basically, you read 12 novels that are all in some way connected to New York, San Francisco, or Chicago. The books are all wonderful, and they range from classic prose to books written all in verse. The reading is great, and the papers are wonderful to write. We post our outlines about a week before the papers are due, and peer comment on each others. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, especially people who aren't English majors. It's a great way to read interesting and beautifully written books if you don't generally have time to read for pleasure.",
    "Take it! Take it! Take it! I'm not a humanities-oriented person, but this class so happened to be very interesting and insightful!",
    "Definitely! A really cool idea for a seminar, organizationally, and Professor Dimock is such a nice person. It is a ton of reading, but there wasn't a great degree of pressure to finish everything, and you get to read some really cool books, a good mix of contemporary and more classic novels.",
    "A fantastic booklist! Take the class just for the books -- there's a wonderful mix of literature, and they do intersect in one way or another. Professor Dimock is extremely knowledgable on all the books and offers great analysis into them.",
    "Definitely take this course! The reading list is wonderful (it's a lot of reading, but it really doesn't feel like homework because the novels are so fantastic), and we had a lot of great discussions in class. The novels are diverse and offer a range of colorful perspectives, but also present a really interesting, cohesive story of urban American literature - I loved the comparative element of this class. Professor Dimock is absolutely amazing - she had incredible insight into the novels and really encouraged us to explore new, fresh perspectives in our essays."
