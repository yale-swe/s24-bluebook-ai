   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it to someone who wants to tackle the field of political science\/political philosophy straight on, no compromises. Not for those who want a cushioned, easy ride. I was sufficiently challenged and loved almost every moment of it.",
    "Continue DS if you liked it the first semester and you don't have a burning desire to take a couple science or math classes. H&P teaches you an immense amount, though it can be frustratingly elusive at times to distinguish writer's arguments. Professor Landemore is one of those teachers who comes across as tough and strict, but this improves your writing and critical thinking abilities in the long run. Don't expect a good grade on the first paper, though it is possible, and don't expect papers to be graded with the last two in mind, each is graded on its own merit, so if you improved something form the first paper, but then did something else wrong, you may get a lower grade.",
    "I think that this class is probably the worst one of the Directed Studies semester. It begins as rather boring and, when the reading material finally picks up, you are so entranced by your other classes that it doesn't really matter. Ultimately, I would take this class just because it allows you to take the other classes in the course but by no means would it be my first choice.",
    "Its my favorite DS class because it is applicable to real life",
    "Landemore really pushes you as far as class presentations go. She's not the easiest grader, but she is very fair. I enjoyed working with her. However, she was a little out of her depth with Arendt.",
    "I would highly recommend DS History and Politics, Semester II. While the focus of this course is definitely more political than DS HIstory and Politics first semester, I feel as if I have gained a more informed \"world view\" because I now have a solid understanding of the roots of modern political theory."
