   "comments": [
    "If you need a writing credit, this is a great course to take. A couple of the papers were graded pretty tough, but the quizzes and final paper are a great way to boost your overall grade. The material is also really interesting.",
    "It is a fair writing credit, although you will have to do the readings most of the times, as there is a quiz on every single one of them. The good thing: you have the questions in advance! Take it if you are interested in reading about Newton, Einstein, Picasso, Mozart, genius in music, science, sports, etc. Towards the end of the semester, many cool speaker come in (see David Epstein), and we had some pretty exciting demonstrations as well (see chess grandmaster)",
    "If you are interested in exploring the idea of genius then take this. I don't know why this needs to be said, but don't expect to leave the class knowing what makes a genius. Don't expect to leave Yale itself with all the answers. What classes like this do for you here it inform you enough so that you can construct an informed opinion, whereas the one you would have had before you would have been founded on little study of genius. Get excited about that. It's a cool topic, and it's not a difficult class if you do the work (which is just some reading and some writing).",
    "Great course, very interesting, definitely worth shopping",
    "A great, stress-free, and interesting class discussing the definition of genius and various case studies. Wright requires five short ( 700 word) papers throughout the semester that are easy and interesting enough. Class is held discussion style, and he knows your name\/really wants you to participate. The material sort of runs out 2\/3 of the way through the semester- you get a few interesting guest lectures and some repeated material. We had a week of \"TA meetings\" where class was cancelled. The class was fun and enjoyable. Worth taking as a 5th class.",
    "Interesting, unique course material. Professor is a bit confusing at times. It seems to be his pet project, and he has the \"right\" and \"wrong\" answers in mind. Beware of quizzes - very high school \/ SAT like. But they force you to do the reading which is nice.",
    "If you need an easy WR or HU credit, take this class! It's nice because you do most of the work in the first half of the semester and very little in the second, which is opposite of most courses.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. The material is incredibly interesting and it's definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. You realize afterwards just how much you learned which is a lot. Professor Wright and the TAs are also amazing. Although the work load is a bit heavier at the beginning of the year, it gets easier towards the end. Great course.",
    "A super fun class with a light work-load and fascinating, albeit somewhat random, topic. Tons of cool guest speakers and an easy WR credit.",
    "MUSI 107 is an interesting class in that it is, as the title suggests, more exploratory in nature. As a result, the curriculum is not as rigorously defined as that of other courses. I found that the course moved very fast in the beginning (and there were a lot of readings and smaller papers to write) whereas the latter part of the course was much slower and the only main assignments were a few readings and the final paper. The readings are really interesting and the assessments are fair.",
    "I would not recommend this class sadly because even though it was an interesting subject and I learned about a lot of geniuses I don't know how much I will take away. I think that there are other classes at Yale that I would get more out of.",
    "Definitely take this course. It is one of those special Yale courses that carries you through a fascinating idea. We explored everything ranging from the history of the definition of genius, the changes in our perception, the neurological basis of creativity and genius emerging in different fields. Although the readings started as long, they were very interesting and it was a pleasure dedicating time to this course. The scope of our course was broad and detailed and I definitely learned a lot. I highly recommend this fascinating and special course."
