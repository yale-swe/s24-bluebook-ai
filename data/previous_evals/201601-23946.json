    "An examination of the role of historical fiction (of various kinds and in various mediums) plays in expanding or complicating our understanding of the past. The first few weeks are spent on theory, which I was personally not a fan of, but after that you explore the genre in terms of micro history, novels, plays, art, and film.",
    "Take this class if you like history writing or want to think more about the perspective of the historian.",
    "This course deals with the truth-telling of past events through historical fiction. It seeks to find the line between history and fiction, if one exists, through several mediums: literature, art, film, theatre, and traditional historical scholarship. Max is a gem of a PhD student, and teaches the course better than any professor ever could, so don't worry about his lack of formal credentials. He makes up for this with his towering intellect, accessibility, and devotion to his students. Two papers, leading discussions, and hefty reading. This course is manageable, but it cant be your 5th.",
    "This is the best course if you want to experiment with writing history. If you want freedom, if you want to write what you want without fear, if you want a really amazing history course with a great list of books, movies and music (at times...Hamilton!), then please, take this course. Though, it's new and a one-time thing, so I don't know if you can...Do you know? I don't...cause I thought...But yeah, if you can, take it. It's absolutely amazing, and Max is the best.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Not only is it taught by Max, who is a brilliant, funny, and a great mind to learn from, but the syllabus itself is incredible. A nice mix of academic work and actual examples of historical fiction that flow together seamlessly. This class will teach you: 1) how to think about history from different perspectives, 2) how to write history, and write it well, 3) a concrete and grounded example of the often illusive 'historiography', 4) how to write you own piece of historical fiction. The final essay, although challenging and thought-provoking, was so much fun to create. It required the same amount of research as a regular history paper, but allowed students to flex their creative and stylistic chops. I think this is the perfect course for anybody whose interests lie at the nexus of creative writing and history.",
    "This is a must-take. It changed the way I think about history, pop culture, the CIA, film...basically everything. If you're not a history major, I would recommend this class over a normal history seminar because you learn so much about consuming history in everyday life\/through pop culture."
