   "comments": [
    "This class was very skills-focused. I learned to make observations, conduct interviews, and keep and synthesize field notes, and finally to write an argument based on what I observed.",
    "I learned how to conduct my own research and write up a paper using the research I conducted.",
    "One of the most utilitarian courses I have taken at Yale. Great survey of research methodologies that one can use doing their thesis (or even later if they pursue academia\/research). Provides a really valuable opportunity to test out what it's like doing thesis work without actually doing your thesis, and the practice Research Proposal assignment at the end of the course is one of those secret skill things that you just can't find in most other courses.",
    "I learned how to better perform research for my senior thesis. We did a lot of work in each of the different types of research areas (archival, interviews, etc.), but specialized in ethnographic research. I feel that this course helped me become a better writer.",
    "This course was a hugely valuable introduction to ethnographic research. This class helped me learn methods & techniques to ethically conduct research and also built a supportive community of scholars amongst the group of WGSS majors taking the class.",
    "I learns a lot about carrying out a research project start to finish. The most important skill I learned was how to collaborate with peers on my work. I learned how to give them information to understand my work without context, and I learned how to engage critically with my peers work and provide constructive feedback. It was such a pleasure to see my own work, and my peers, culminate into insightful, valuable knowledge."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was great. The class was very self-propelled by student interest. In the small class, all students took an active interest in each other's semester-long projects and gave helpful feedback. We became a community of researchers supporting each other's work. The class does go over research ethics generally, but its focus on practice over theory is super helpful thesis preparation and a nice break from pure theory\/reading\/discussion in WGSS. The class' main weakness is how it did not prepare us to incorporate theory into our research writings. Scheduling this course in the fall was essential because it allowed us to prepare for thesis writing and proposals without the stress of being in the process itself; we had time to learn the skills before we will have to use them.",
    "This course was amazing! I learned so much from both Professor Pepi and my fellow students. I loved that it was taught in the fall since I felt it allowed me to start to think about my senior thesis without being stressed about it.",
    "Its wonderful that this class is in the fall - do not change it back to the spring. We were afforded the opportunity to fully engage in research that was low stakes in regards to our senior thesis and it wouldnt have been that way in the spring. We could focus strictly on research techniques instead of overwhelming ourselves with the huge idea of senior research.",
    "The fact that the WGSS major is very small means that this course was facilitated for student learning and dialogue. I very much enjoyed the ability to talk about my notes and get feedback on my project from my peers and Professor Pepi.",
    "The course's biggest strength is that it operated outside of the typical reading\/homework-discussion-assignment structure of most seminars. Instead, we focused on one huge project the whole semester, and our weekly assignments were each opportunities to work on the research for the semester project. This helped me enormously to comprehend how to set out on a large research assignment, and assuaged some nerves about the senior thesis next year. Also, Professor Pepi is an incredible asset not just to her students but to the WGSS department as a whole.",
    "This course benefitted from being taught in the fall so that we could prepare our research proposals in advance of fellowship deadlines. We also all loved Professor Pepi's approach of helping us carry out one project start to finish. The sense of ownership we each developed over our projects I think enabled us to feel like our learning mattered. It was also helpful week to week to learn a research skill for our toolbox then put it into practice. Please continue to offer this class in the fall as a practicum with the bulk of in class time spent workshopping each-others' work."

   "comments": [
    "This course is great for building community between WGSS majors as friends and scholars. It is also a must-have for thesis preparation; I felt confident about coming up with and writing my thesis.",
    "Yes! I learned so much and felt that the point of the course was for me to learn, not just to do useless assignments to fulfill requirements.",
    "YES! This class will change your life. Ive never done research for this long or engaged so heavily with my own work. It will prepare you to challenge yourself as a student and intellectual. And Professor Pepi is simply the best - she is so smart and cares so deeply about the information and her students.",
    "Absolutely, if they're a WGSS major (that's the only reason they'd be taking it). It's truly a wonderful experience.",
    "Absolutely. Although this course is required for WGSS juniors, it's a rare example of a required course that is actually helpful & transformative enough to merit being required. Getting the chance to research something of my choice in-depth for an entire semester, with the help and support not only of Professor Pepi but also of my peers in the class, was academically and personally so fulfilling. It also felt like great preparation for the senior thesis, but clearly removed from it.",
    "Well... if you are WGSS you have no choice, however this was my favorite class in the sequence so far and a joy to go to every week."
