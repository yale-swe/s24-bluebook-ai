   "comments": [
    "To understand how to use lights work for a play and how to paint the stage by colors from lights. Also I know much more about the differences between different types of lights.",
    "It is always valuable for me to learn more about the lighting designer's process and lingo, as a director. It helps me to understand the nature of that collaboration and how to work more closely and creatively with these designers. I'm glad to be in the class with designers from all other disciplines, but I do wish that the lighting designers were in the entire class with us, or that directors were only in the class when the lighting designers are also there, as that is the part of class that was most beneficial.",
    "Having access to the lighting lab and the instruments it provides was very valuable. It helps to have the tangible objects in the room and to be able to see what they do when learning about something that is not so physically tangible. The visitors that were brought in to class were valuable to in that we learned a lot about being a lighting designer in the industry and about lighting.",
    "The practicals we did were the most valuable. I definitely needed this technical aspect of the course to really understand the logistics of lighting design. I wish we had seen and done more of those; even just seeing Jennifer fix other people's was very helpful in visualizing what needed to be shifted in order to be effective.",
    "The course was interesting, and dealt with a lot of important issues in lighting design - in a clear and comprehensive way. Robert succeeded to explain the material step by step, with patience and generosity, in a way that made it accessible and interesting. The practicals were extremely helpful and educational. The meetings at the UT\/ Rep were very helpful. I wish Jeniffer would explain more HOW and WHY she chooses to amend the lighting pictures that the students created. This would have helped to develop a critical approach and the tools to approach lighting design."

    "I 'd like to know more how to draft for the lighting design and how to transfer the paper work to the actual show.",
    "1) Directors should only be in the class when the lighting designers are also there. 2) The class, from a director's standpoint, should focus on the collaboration between artists, how to talk to each other, how to engage on a project, rather than the nuts and bolts of how to draft a lighting plot. This is useful information, yes, but to spend an entire semester on this felt like a waste of time and resources. 3) Play discussions in this class were awful. There needs to be a better way to engage people in discussing a play, and it has not been figured out. Let the directors lead the conversation! Let someone else. The way it is currently set up is just incredibly unhelpful, and so the conversations tend to be just useless. What is the point of these discussions? That is not clear. 4) Please find a way so that the directors don't have to leave just when the class becomes interesting - the practicals, and actual work with lighting designers.",
    "I liked the idea of working on Mice and Men for a full semester. I liked the idea of really taking time to break down each scene and what it needed. However, I feel that since most of the classes were in a format of show and tell with lighting plots, cue sheets, and magic sheets, rather than doing - it was difficult for me to grasp the steps needed to execute a lighting idea. I think it would've been helpful to start with the idea and execute them step by step. When we got to drafting our rough ideas it was easier to understand, but there was no time left in the semester to follow the idea through to execution. I felt like a lot of time was spent on talking about the idea, rather than executing it.",
    "I think we should do work sheeting much easier in the course. It really helped to shape how a lighting designer thinks and what problem he or she needs to solve and how.",
    "1. In classes that we have practicals - to start with the practicals, so that the directors can see it entirely, OR > Just let the directors stay at least until the end of the class with Robert (before the 2nd and 3rd year join). It would only take about 20 minutes from our next class - but it's definitely worth it! 2. I would suggest that all the guidance about working with the lighting board\/ computer would be longer, deeper, and backed up with a cheat sheet. Unfortunately, we learnt about it too quickly, and without any written back-up."

    "There were a couple weeks when Robert was away and we had another designer teaching the class. These weeks were wonderful, and so helpful. I would suggest bringing him back more, if not full-time. The class became engaged and excited about the work. I think Robert is incredibly smart and talented, but is unable to keep the students engaged and excited about the work. I understand that the class is about teaching us the basics of lighting design, but it should also be a place for us to get excited about what is possible in this world. What can lighting achieve? And how? I did not leave this class feeling like I have a better grasp of the power of lighting, or excited about how to use it.",
    "The lighting practicals at the rep, with the magic sheet, were the most helpful for me. Especially when I worked on the War magic sheet. The practicals that were done in groups were also helpful, but the critiques for them were very vague. I would have liked more specificity and clear reasons why a certain lighting cue wouldn't work for a scene. It would also be very helpful to have a lesson in how to critique lighting. This is something that I struggle with.",
    "I wish we hadn't spent so much time on one play and I would have loved to get a little more history of lighting.",
    "Great course. Too short! I wish it was a year long."
