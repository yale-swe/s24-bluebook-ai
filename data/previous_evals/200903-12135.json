   "comments": [
    "Very interesting material and very helpful in becoming a better historian and writer but it is a lot of work.",
    "Take it take it take it!! This was a GREAT class. The material was fascinating, and Professor Gage is amazing. The discussions we had in class were always engaging and challenging.",
    "This is a very strong class and I recommend it. The discussion is always pretty solid, the readings are interesting and reasonable, and the final paper is a pretty interesting part of the course because Yale's collection is so strong. Take it if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in exploring the role of the radical left and its critics in American history. This class will challenge preconceptions of \"communism\" and Professor Gage does a good job of leading engaging discussions.",
    "This class studies the different manifestations of communism\/anticommunism in American starting pretty early. You may be more interested in the later material, but the early information is important. I recommend this class because Professor Gage is great, the paper was really a learning experience, and the material gets fascinating.",
    "Take the class because Professor Gage is a great professor and you will have fun exploring American intellectualism, but don't expect it to be a great class experience because the combination of anti-comm\/comm as a huge topic coupled with a max. capacity-seminar class make discussions disappointing.-----------------------Professor Gage presents compelling big-picture questions during class, forcing us to place our readings within larger historical continuums. The readings illustrated, many times, the most personal levels of communism and anti-communism (extreme fears and senses of purpose being the two most common), giving human faces to ideas that I think most students were prejudiced against, in one direction or another.The weakness of the class is that it was a bit too large for a class whose readings were so profound and two-sided, and for a professor who had so many ways of provoking our thoughts and ideas. The go-in-a-circle format made it harder for students to respond to comments, or made what they said seem out of context by the time it was their turn. I think the only way to tamp down the craziness of about 20 kids (rather than 15 or 12) would have been to say, \"Okay, today we're going to talk about these four questions,\" rather than to merely divide the classtime amongst readings. Personally, I did not feel encouraged to talk because I knew my comments had a very low likelihood of being attacked or responded to, because there were just so many ideas going on at once.Furthermore, many of the discussions sometimes veered off into larger philosophical debates about American politics or values [lots of YPU students]--I often wished these comments were more restrained, or at least, dealt more directly with the texts at hand.I was also a little sad that anti-communism and communism pretty much after 1968 was not covered, and that we jump to the 2000s after that. Perhaps it's because the history has not been completely written in the time period, or maybe it's just not as intellectually vigorous as those decades, or a combination: it's not as useful to prospective history\/thesis writers to think about decades in which they can do less historical work. In any case, it felt a little annoying to be discussing Coulter without really considering the resurgence of the Right in the 1980s and 90s (although I guess that's what Gage's other class is for?)",
    "This class is one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale! (I'm a junior history major). If you have any interest in American history, you have to take this class! Professor Gage was absolutely brilliant in leading discussion."
