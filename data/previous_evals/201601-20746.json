   "comments": [
    "Yes! This class is difficult for people outside of AMST or AFAM but I think having said that anyone would benefit from it. It is knowledge everyone should have. At times it might seem inaccessible because seniors in the major come with a background in theory and history but still everyone can bring a valuable perspective",
    "The title is accurate. It is a class about race in America. We read a book a week, had a weekly one page response, and a 15-20 page final paped. Fairly standard upper level seminar format.",
    "It was one of the most interesting courses I've taken because each student was not only expected to contribute to the seminar atmosphere, but was also occasionally given the chance to speak on the identities that they represent. The books are generally interesting, and professor Jacobson is a great discussion leader and lecturer. Also, I enjoyed that the course tied things to the current moment whenever it could.",
    "HIST 148j is very important to developing a timeline of race in America and also beginning to understand the various layers that affect our perceptions of the \"color line.\"",
    "Absolutely take this class. If you get in, take it. That simple.",
    "This class was one that at the end of the semester, left me in awe. The readings on the syllabus are important, the classroom environment and the interplay between different students was complex and challenging-- this is a class that critical thinkers take. I was lucky to be in a class where the Professor, the syllabus and the seminar environment that was created as a result of those first two aspects made for a phenomenal course. This is a must-take.",
    "Take it. We talked mainly about what was happening on campus\/in the real world, which was quite inspiring and instructive.",
    "Take this class!! This is easily the best and most important class I have taken at Yale. I never knew that I knew so little about the truth and the way our world works until I took this class. I was honored to be in this class, especially surrounded by so many incredible classmates!",
    "A wonderful seminar, would highly recommend. Jacobson is thoughtful and generates strong discussions.",
    "A wonderful class by a wonderful professor that provides an extremely good background on race and ethnicity in the United States. As I have mentioned before; take this class.",
    "Essentially a round table discussion on race for the semester. We sometimes didn't touch enough on the readings for my taste, but I still would recommend the class! I learned a lot about my country and myself.",
    "If you want to engage in important conversations, with wonderful peers and under the guidance of one of Yale's most knowledgeable professors, take this class! Just be prepared to listen -- you'll be astounded by what your peers have to share."
