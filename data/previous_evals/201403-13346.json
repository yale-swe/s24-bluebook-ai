    "As a survey course, China's Global 20th Century did a good job - especially in making the learning process a vivid and lively one. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Chinese history, and doesn't already know a lot about it.",
    "highly recommend this course",
    "Chinese History in the 20th century is a time period of much tragedy. I liked that the professors didn't shy away from these tragedies but see part of their job as historians is to make sure these things are not forgotten. I think the class did a good job of communicating the feelings people had at the time and making the history real. On the negative side, the class sometimes lacked structure. Expectations about work were often ambiguous. Discussion sections were inactive.",
    "Take it!!! As a history major who is primarily European history, this was my first foray into Asian history and I LOVED IT. I shopped Prof Perdue's other history course (that he has taught for years and years) but this was far more enjoyable. Gives you a good coverage of modern (1949-present day!!!) Chinese history which you can't really get anywhere else. If you can get Huasha as your TA, absolutely snatch that spot as she is kind, brilliant, and covers the material thoroughly, making it easier to digest. Standard history course format: one 10 page paper, one midterm, one final. Take it!!! (And if you need an LAAA credit, THIS IS IT. But take it just because Professor Perdue and Professor CJ Huang are hilarious, so enthusiastic and knowledgable about the material, and play Bob Dylan\/ other music throughout lectures!)",
    "Take it. It is really informative as to the direction China is taking. Not terribly hard workload, and provided one keeps up with the reading it is very manageable.",
    "A fun and rewarding introduction to modern China if you are willing to put in the work. There is both a final paper and a final exam, and there is a decent chance you will only know 20% of your grade by the end of the term.",
    "An incredibly interesting lecture, but definitely a lot of information to keep up with!",
    "It is a good summery of the modern history of China. But it needs to be more structured",
    "I would recommend this course because the Chinese history in this time period is very interesting. The class is not so intense.",
    "Interesting course that tracks the development of China and the Chinese nation from the sino-japanese war in 1895 through the early 2000s. Also spends time looking at the developments of China on Taiwan. Covers a lot of ground and deals with pretty large questions of: nation building, liberalism \/ democracy, economic growth, etc. Lectures can be a bit boring but combined with textbook and primary source documents, the course provides a pretty strong basis for those looking to get an introduction to China. Definitely not for someone who has in-depth knowledge of the country. Assignments aren't too troubling: 1 midterm (10%), section (20%), a final project (kind of weird since you're building a timeline for a historical figure you are \"following\"), a 10 page term paper (a bit weird since you can write about whatever you want), and a 3 hour final exam (long and tedious since the essay questions were very broad). Consider taking the class if you are interested in China and the whole arc of history from 1895, otherwise shop it and see from there. Overall I felt I learned a lot, but the course needs to have a few changes to make it special or better.",
    "Lecture course of Modern Chinese history from the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 up until the present. Focus falls on the heart of China's modern century, WWII and the Chinese civil war between the CCP and the Guomindang. Weekly readings taken from primary sources accounts of different events. Film clips, both primary source and re-interpretation add to understanding of the times. Very informative, very well structured and delivers what it says it will. I would definitely recommend EAST 317 to another student."
