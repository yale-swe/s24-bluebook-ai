   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely. This course provided a unique interdisciplinary window onto the music.",
    "I'll recommend anything Daphne teaches to my fellow students. With this course in particular, I would let them know that they're in for a heavy workload and high expectations, but that no other course would balance coverage and comfort in the same way.",
    "AFAM 514 is an incredible course that explores an amazing variety of materials related to music, race, performance, and literature. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone committed to the thoughtful study and exploration of African American music and literature. This is a course that requires a lot of time and commitment, and feels absolutely worth it.",
    "ENGL 950 is an exploration of the connection between African American music and literature through time. I would recommend the class to anyone who was interested in this material because I learned a great deal in such a short time."

   "comments": [
    "It really will impact my future thinking on music. In particular, the connections Professor Brooks encouraged us to think about between music and literature are something that will stay with me from this course.",
    "This course was absolutely invaluable to my growing knowledge of African American Studies, and deepened my enthusiasm for and commitment to this discipline. The reading and listening offered so many new ideas, concepts, and frameworks for thinking about the almost limitless complexities of African American and American music, and I know I will return to many of these texts as I continue my studies. In addition, the course gave me an opportunity to pursue a research topic that I believe will eventually be central to my dissertation. In short, this course has been incredibly useful in helping me think through what I want to do during the rest of my time at Yale. Thank you!!",
    "I was able to read several critical texts that I previously had never heard of, texts I know I will need in the future. The class also caused me to think about African American literature in new ways, a few of which I hope to pick up on in the future."
