   "comments": [
    "You should definitely take this. This class is not \"niche\" enough that non-HUMS majors or music majors feel uncomfortable with the material, but the subject matter is not dumbed down to a point where the material is dull. This class is a great combination of two very interesting topics that I think any student who is remotely interested in music history would like.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this class. The material was stimulating and accessible. The work load is manageable, and the seminars inspiring. The course is interdisciplinary. It juxtaposes material, which focuses on philosophy, history and politics, with music-orientated reading. Moreover, seminars address the intellectual context in which musicians composed. The seminar follows the reading closely, and alters between lecturing, discussion and music listening. This is the one seminar where I payed attention from the first to the last minute. Professor Plantinga is captivating, has a wonderful sense of humor and is a great listener.",
    "From my perspective as an instrumental performer, I enjoyed this class because it gave me another approach to understanding music from its historical context. I would recommend it if you want a chill class that has little workload. Some students credit D\/fail the class, but this may not be necessary if you put in good effort. Note that this class is more broad than it is deep."
