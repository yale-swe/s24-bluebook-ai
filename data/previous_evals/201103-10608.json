   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to any student who only has an introductory understanding of microeconomics and would like to build on what he or she already knows.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student because it is a good review of fundamental economic concepts. The course shows how the concepts are applicable to real-world issues through diverse range of article\/journal topics. Because the Professor has many, and flexible, office hours, there is ample opportunity to ask questions and discuss areas in the textbook or other readings that are difficult to understand.",
    "I personally am interested in economics, but it does not come easily to me (most of the time). As such, this was an appropriate course in terms of the subject matter covered and the level. The articles were interesting and generally thought provoking. For a student willing (and with the time) to engage the book, it should solidify concepts learned in prior principles of economics courses, while adding a few new ones.",
    "It is a good class for those who do not have a strong background in economics. It's challenging but if you work hard, you can get a lot from this class."

   "comments": [
    "Because I was able to get a comprehensive background on economic principles from the course, I am confident that it will be of tremendous help to me in my future studies (because economic principles are omnipresent.) I am sure that the principles I learned from the course will assist me in my dissertation\/research because it will help me understand how the specific issues I am studying can be applied to different areas of society, namely the economy. Furthermore, given the state of today's economy, I also believe that having a good foundation of economic concepts is extremely beneficial when trying to understand how the economy of the state affects other salient issues (education, environment, health, security, etc.)",
    "While this course did solidify some of the concepts I had learned in my pre-req principles of economics courses, I did not feel like I made a significant step in terms of my understanding of economics and my ability to apply economic tools to real world problems. I accept responsibility for much of this, but it was unclear to me what the objectives of the course were, and what students should have been able to do with confidence by the end of the semester."
