   "comments": [
    "Absolutely not. It is technically an \"easy\" way to fill a QR, but it was such a miserable experience that I would wish it upon no one.",
    "yes",
    "Yes! It is heavily based around pests... don't get into hypothesis testing until the end so it doesn't get extremely strenuous at all til the last few weeks.",
    "If you can get in, take this class! Professor Donegan is very eager to help, and offers generous office hours to get to know his students better and help them succeed. There are ~15 problem sets, which get increasingly difficult. Since Professor Donegan can be confusing in his explanations, I would recommend students form a study group when necessary. The class is more of a discussion of statistics rather than a math heavy lecture. If you pay attention during the first half of the semester, you won't have to do the readings during the second half, since many of the same ideas are rehashed.",
    "Definitely recommend for an introduction to statistics. He can be slow at times but extremely fair and you only need the problem sets to study for the exams.",
    "Definitely. I haven't found a more manageable\/applicable QR. If you are a freshman\/sophomore looking for a QR and wanting a basic understanding of statistics, take this class! I would also highly recommend it for anyone who prefers seminars over lectures.",
    "An interesting way to look at the fundamentals of statistical analysis. Sometimes dry and I kind of feel like problem sets aren't counted quite heavily enough. Study psets when prepping for exams.",
    "I would definitely take this if you need a QR - if you do the readings you'll be fine. Prof. Donegan can be a bit long winded and lose track of the original question asked in class, but is a super nice guy who is really approachable and flexible with his office hours.",
    "I wouldn't reccomend it because I just don't think it is a well taught class",
    "Absolutely. If you need an unbelievably easy QR with an unbelievably nice man. I found classes really soothing, the problem sets and tests were super fair. You can email or have dinner with him WHENEVER. Warning: this course is for people who REALLY FEAR QRs - if you are \"okay at math,\" or have taken an AP Math or something - you'll be frustrated out of your mind. This course is very, VERY gentle, and does not feel quantitatively challenging at all. It can be challenging, but in more subtle, conceptual ways. It is NOT math-y.",
    "Yes--a good QR with interesting material with very important social implications.",
    "A great course to take if you are genuinely interested in the subject but are not primarily a math student; Manageable difficulty for non-math\/science kids but still engaging and informative; Recommended as a fun and fulfilling QR credit"
