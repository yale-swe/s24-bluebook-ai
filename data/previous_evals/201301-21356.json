    "Yes, it is very interesting the topics and updated.",
    "Good course to take if you need some idea about how structural pharm is like.",
    "You look at crystal structures and learn how different drugs interact with different classes of proteins. The course work is low, but the exams are sometimes difficult because of their open-ended style.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to someone who is interested in protein structure and function.To me it was especially helpful because I come from a synthetic organic background and didn't know much about protein structure at all.",
    "I would recommend the class; a thorough exploration of the various ways that structural information can further drug discovery."

   "comments": [
    "This class gave me knowledge in other areas that I did not have the opportunity to explore before.",
    "I learned a significant more detail about the proteins and machines described in the latter part of the course than I have been exposed to in the past. I appreciated the lectures on the techniques used to develop drugs. Of greatest interest to me personally were the lectures about x-ray crystallography and Denton Hoyer's lecture.",
    "It definitely gave me a good foundation about GPCRs, RTKs, kinases, and transporters.",
    "It will be very beneficial for my research as it is likely that I will have to determine the structure of a protein at some point in the next few years.",
    "Very helpful; a good centralized place to start learning about structural biology."
