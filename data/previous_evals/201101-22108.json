    "ORGO II \u0097\u00a0you gotta do it, so suck it up. Study hard or else you will get owned. Start studying at least five days in advance to each midterm and MAKE FLASHCARDS. MEMORIZE THOSE REACTIONS LIKE THE BACK OF YOUR HAND.",
    "Continuation of 220. Hard to say if it's more or less difficult than 220. Felt like there's more material covered, but the professors (Schepartz and Ellman) are better than Ziegler.",
    "Its hard, lots of reaction, lots of memorization, lots of practice, lots of work. Take it if you are premed or are actually interested in understanding how certain organic molecules combine in the presence of certain reagents.",
    "Much better than first semester Organic Chemistry. Topics are more interesting, and more relevant to pre-med students.",
    "You're only taking it because you have to, but it is really interesting! At least this semester, the tests were really fair. I did very well and didn't put in any time besides the weekend before a test. At first I wasted time doing practice problems and reading the book... just organizing your notes and reviewing problem sets is enough to excel in this class.",
    "harder than the first semester, only take it if you have to.",
    "Yes, it is as bad as they say..but HEY, atleast its interesting!!",
    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend it because of Professor Ellman.",
    "look you are probably taking it for your major or pre med so you have to get through it. It is never going to be a great course but with these teachers it is bearable",
    "lots of memorization (obviously), more reactions than first semester, easier than Ziegler's class, but therefore less rewarding. For some reason I found it less enjoyable than first semester.",
    "Second semester orgo was a good continuation of first semester. You begin to use the basics you learned in first semester and apply them to more complex mechanisms. It was extremely well taught, especially compared to first semester. The course starts to falter towards the end (it was the first time the professors got to finish Wade), but I'm sure it will be improved for the future. The tests are fair, but you have to always stay on top of the material because it is too easy to fall behind. There are four exams and the option to drop your lowest score, which is always nice to have.",
    "If you're pre-med or considering majoring in the sciences, then the class is required for you, so you have to take it anyways. Overall, though, I would recommend it because the professors are good, not because the material is particularly interesting or good though. Be prepared for a lot of work though, as the material is VERY difficult, MUCH more so than the first semester.",
    "This class overs more organic chemistry including nucleic acids and peptides. This class is actually pretty awesome. When you're done it feels almost as though you understand how a whole different world functions. Although this is a tiny molecular world of little consequence for most.",
    "You probably have to take this class, but it is also interesting. It is a lot of memorization of reaction after reaction.",
    "It is organic chemistry, do not let yourself fall behind because it will be difficult to catch up. If you are having problems understanding the material, TA's are super helpful! Work and study hard.....and you'll do fine.",
    "This class is infinitely better than first semester orgo with Ziegler. The professors are much more organized and the psets, while not super easy, didn't make me want to cry. That being said, this is still orgo, so be prepared for lots of work in order to master the material. I think it goes without saying that you shouldn't take this class unless you have to, though, so if you're premed or a chem major, try and enjoy this class!",
    "This is a great course when taught by Ellman and Schepartz. Both were engaged and very competent. I enjoyed the course. If you spend time and are diligent, this is very doable. Don't be intimidated by organic chem any more. Much better than first semester, which I took with Ziegler.",
    "The class is probably worth taking (since this is probably a requirement anyways) for Professor Ellman. I thought he was a really friendly and fun lecturer, and he made the concepts very easy to understand.",
    "CHEM 221 is the second semester of the organic chemistry sequence. This semester focuses more on reactions with given types of reagents, rather than mechanisms and underlying principles of organic chemistry (covered in the first semester). While memorization is a key component of being successful in this course, it is also essential to understand the reaction mechanisms, as well as how reactions can be strung together to get from starting material A to final product B.",
    "This course wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. There is a lot of memorization required with all the reagents and mechanisms, but once you get down the basic mechanisms, the course really isnt that bad. It is more difficult than first semester orgo, but still manageable if you have the time to commit to it. Problem sets took me about 3 or 4 hours a week for the first half of the semester and a little longer as the psets got a little harder.",
    "Excellent course. Yale is the place to take chemistry. Both Ellman and Schepartz were exciting and engaging. Some of your peers might be competitive, but you are bound to make good friends nonetheless. Get psyched for peptide synthesis, if your prof makes it that far.",
    "This was a great class, much better than my first semester of Orgo with Ziegler (CHEM 220). Ellman in particular is a fantastic lecturer, and I really learned from lecture like I had never done before. Schepartz is pretty good as well, although she did rush through a lot of reactions and was slightly inconsistent in her notes and expectations at the end of the fourth unit (proteins and sugars), the instruction on the whole was very good. Also, the tests were very fair (average low-mid 70s, no surprises ever) so that made the course a little less stressful. Although, the 200+ reactions and the macromolecular structures you had to memorize\/understand did make the course pretty daunting at times, but the fact that it's split into 4 exams actually works out better in the end because you're able to compartmentalize the material nicely and recall it better when studying for the final.",
    "I would recommend taking this course with Professor Ellman and Professor Schepartz",
    "It is hard, but manageable if you stay on top of the stuff",
    "The first 1\/3 of the course is pretty easy conceptual stuff but is more interesting.The second part is not too difficult conceptually because it is basically the same concepts over and over but very difficult to memorize all the specific reagents used.Problem sets are well written and promote problem solving. Tests are fair and weighted but again just require so much memorization.Course matches book well so that is good.Do extra book problems and go to tutor sessions. Understand the problem sets. All about practice",
    "Second semester Orgo. It's like first semester Orgo. Profs Ellman and Schepartz are good; which is good, because there's apparently a ton of orgo professors here who aren't.",
    "If you can get Ellman for orgo it makes your life so much better. This semester is a memorization marathon, but you cover more interesting material than first semester. If not required, do not take.",
    "Thisclass will challenge you and frustrate you, but you come out of it knowing a LOT. Put in the time to stay on top of things and work through the problem sets, and you should do fine. Professor Ellman and Professor Schepartz are both great lecturers, though problem sets and exams are not easy.",
    "It is SO much better than first semester. Ellman is amazing!",
    "In a heart beat. I cannot believe that I can happily say that organic chemistry 2 was my favorite class of Yale thus far. This was an absolutely fantastic course! Professor Ellman is an incredible instructor. I really enjoyed, savored, relished doing practice problems (dramatic, I know, but true!) and going through all the reactions that were very well explained by both Professors Ellman and Schepartz, although Ellman was really top-notch. I wish he had taught the full semester. And I am so happy that we have him at Yale. The problem sets and exams were very straightforward and at just the right level of difficult, no tricks or random questions -- which I REALLY appreciated. Last semester, organic chemistry was absolutely awful with Professor Zeigler, but Ellman made this class a wonderful, enjoyable experience. I am so sad to be done with organic chemistry. I was even thinking of taking physical chemistry because of the passion for chemistry this course has ignited in me! TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR ELLMAN. IT WILL BE AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.",
    "You're taking it because you have to. And if you don't have to, don't. The class is stressful, if only because of the intensity of the other students (and this is coming from a self-proclaimed pretty intense pre-med). Could be worse, but you'll spend so much time on this class that it isn't worth the effort\/stress if it's not required. The best advice you won't take: keep up with the reactions. If you learn them week-to-week as they're covered in class, the prep for the test won't be difficult. There are a TON of reactions 2nd semester, so you really need to be on top of them, and you'll know them much better if you memorize them gradually!",
    "Profs. Schepartz and Ellman are MUCH better professors for orgo than usual. They make the course understandable, and if you realize you just need to memorize, memorize, memorize, you'll do well in the class. You're going to need to take this as a premed, and I recommended these professors. Just set aside time in your schedule to devote to orgo, and you'll do fine.",
    "This course placed far too much emphasis on memorization. Test questions did not test problem solving ability but instead asked students only to regurgitate reaction conditions and products. Professor Ziegler's Chem 220 tests were far more interesting and indicative of students' abilities.Overall, when compared to the first semester Chem 220 course, this course was an absolutely miserable waste of time. Professor Ziegler and the first semester TAs were very clearly dedicated to providing us with a well-formed introduction to organic chemistry. This semester, the students and the class were very obviously an afterthought in the minds of the instructors and the teaching assistants.Problem sets were returned weeks after they were due. Frequently they were given back after students had already been tested on the problem sets' material, making the homework exercises nearly meaningless.Furthermore, all two hundred copies of a given assignment were generally graded by one single teaching assistant, which, although it resulted in a grading standardization, was unfathomably stupid. It was undoubtedly the reason the TAs were so tardy in returning assignments, but it also meant that it was nearly impossible to argue a grade. This was especially trying because these TAs frequently made arbitrary, trivial deductions.Last semester, problem sets were ready within a day of being turned in, and test grades were posted the day of the examination (versus within a week or two with the present set of TAs and instructors).Also, it seems that Professor Schepartz was confused about the class she was teaching. She seems to have mistaken organic chemistry for biochemistry. She asked students to memorize the aldohexoses, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases. If I had wanted to waste my time with rote memorization, I would have majored in biology at a community college.Overall, this class succeeded in transforming my love of organic chemistry into an abhorrence.The textbook is not particularly well-written.",
    "Orgo is the hell class. Take it if you need to take it, but prepare to put a lot of work into it.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Orgo II is to orgo I as sex is to masturbation (http:\/\/xkcd.com\/435\/, sort of)",
    "It's pretty solid and requires lots of work definitely. Yes if you're interested in the material.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. But chances are, if you're reading this, you have to. Practice practice practice. Don't underestimate the power of doing that and although reading the book is good, you shouldn't spend all your time on it. I found that out the hard way.",
    "Orgo is one of the most stressful and difficult courses offered at Yale. It is a course that you should not take unless it is absolutely necessary for your major or graduate school preparation. Orgo creates a year of constant stress and is simply an awful course.",
    "Don't do it unless you have to or you love it for some reason.",
    "Why not? Take it, it's fun, enjoyable and better than many other classes out there. You learn useful info. Make sure you keep up w\/ the reactions. This class is not HALF AS BAD as all others say, if they do say so, that's probably b\/c those people are history\/english\/humanity major. If you are good @ science, this is a fairly easy class...seriously. Just make sure you keep up with reactions...",
    "This class was by and large well taught -- Ellman was EXCELLENT and the clearest chemistry professor I've ever had, and while Schepartz was sometimes scattered and tangential, I think she would have gotten a much better reception had she not been preceded by Ellman. Moves at a fast pace and, as always, extremely competitive, but lots of resources available to do well if you are so motivated.",
    "It's orgo, so it's hard, but the second half was definitely better than 220 with Ziegler.",
    "Work hard, put in the time and you will do fine in the class and learn some cool reactions.",
    "I would recommend it as a course that provides a thorough background on important mechanisms and reactions to be known by any chemistry\/biology major.",
    "You probably have to take it for pre-med, etc. so it's a necessary thing. Don't worry - work hard, there's a lot of memorization and connecting different reactions in different chapters together, especially for the final, so keep the big picture in mind and think of the material as a whole instead of discrete individual chapters. You'll be fine! Good luck. :)",
    "No escape. This year, they added a bunch of biology based concepts to the end of the course, in addition to everything they usually cover in previous years. Basically it seemed like 2-3ish new chapters worth of material covered on a 4th midterm, after 9 chapters split into 3 midterms. Shephartz herself said that they never got that far into the textbook before. The last unit was really interesting, especially since it applied some of the reactions we learned throughout the course, but it was just way too much material. Ellman is very fair and he played a large part in making this course better. Both professors are good lecturers and seem really passionate about the field.",
    "I would say take it if you have to, but otherwise don't. Everyone in the class is battling for an A and it is not a fun environment.",
    "Preferred this class much more than first semester orgo with Ziegler.I actually felt like class time was useful because concepts were thoroughly explained then. Ellman is absolutely fantastic. Try your hardest to take this class when he's teaching.",
    "It's orgo. Much as I'm weird and like chemistry and kind of enjoyed it (while hating how much trouble I had learning the reactions), it's something you take because you have to, so this is somewhat irrelevant. So, go ahead--might not be as bad as you think.",
    "Organic Chemistry II is most likely not going to be a class that you enjoy. There is a huge amount of material that is covered and it is not easy to remember. The professors are good (better than first semester) but it is still a difficult and stressful class. The final exam was one of the most miserable test-taking experiences of my life, so hopefully that changes in the future.",
    "Really great -- I highly recommend. Schepartz and Ellman are both fantastic teachers -- really, they made all the difference in my enjoyment of the course. Over the course of a semester, we all get busy and it's tempting to skip lecture and learn the material yourself. Don't! The lectures for this course are very worthwhile and you'll stay far more engaged in the material if you go.",
    "Take this if you need it for a requirement, or take it Credit\/D if you're interested in the material. It is actually pretty interesting.",
    "No lie, it is hard. But more interesting than Orgo I and as long as you dedicate the MAJORITY of your time to studying\/preparing, you will be fine. Everyone is in the same boat.",
    "Let's be serious: you probably have to take this course anyways, but honestly with Ellman (and even Schepartz) it really isn't that bad. As long as you give yourself ample time to prepare for the exams (at least 5 days of solid studying per exam) and complete the problem sets yourself (don't just copy, at least try them), it is actually a very manageable andinteresting course. Keep a good attitude about it, and you will be just fine. There is a lot of work though with 4 exams, a final and 12 problem sets, so don't kid yourself about that.",
    "So if you're taking the second semester of organic chemistry, you already know it'sgonna suck, because at some point you took the first semester and that sucked too. Listen, if you can avoid it, avoid it, or at least avoid it with Alanna Schepartz. Maybe one day only Jon Ellman will teach this course, because his half was probably the best chemistry class I've taken at Yale. It all took a turn for the worse with Schepartz at the helm. Organic chemistry does not get any easier, and the volume of things you have to know is expansive. Here's some advice if you still must take this course: make friends you can study with, always check problem sets with each other, go to the tutors whenever possible, keep up with the reading. There's FOUR test in this class, which makes it feel like you've got no life every other weekend. Oh and there's still a final, which was so difficult I wanted to cry. I know this is depressing, but you should know what you're in for.",
    "Chemistry 221 is an excellent course for second semester organic chemistry. The course goes over a great material in a well-organized way that makes organic chemistry easier to understand. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in the basics of organic chemistry.",
    "Whatever your study method is, do the practice test a few times before each of the exams. I wish I had done this especially for tests 2 and 3. To study for the final I went through the old exams, practice exams and problem sets and felt like I did fine.Don't compare yourself with your classmates too much, pre-meds are all talk and no game.",
    "This class was different than first semester. It is much more memorization since you have learned the concepts already. There are just a million reactions. Find a study group to do psets. Ellman is a really good lecturer. He does the first half of the course and I never had to look at the book for his sections. Shepartz on the other hand does not specify which material will be on the test so you actually have to read the whole chapter.",
    "Do not take it unless you have to. (Which is the only conceivable reason you would anyway.)",
    "If you really do love Organic Chemistry, take it. Don't let the pre-meds scare you away. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with your orgo book. And pre-meds, please stop giving orgo a bad name. Maybe if we all liked it more, it wouldn't be so bad. Although, the many nights of studying and problem-setting and tutor-sessions really did bond us :).",
    "This course is actually much better than Orgo I. It is better taught (as if anything could be worse than Ziegler...) and you get to drop the lowest midterm grade because you take four. Don't be scared, you'll get through it!",
    "CHEM 221 is much better than CHEM 220. You're probably required to take this class, but don't dread it too much because the material is actually interesting (especially the biochem at the end) and the professors are actually good. Most important suggestion: stay on top of the reactions and do NOT plan on cramming for the exams at the last minute. 20 minutes a day (every day) reviewing the reactions will make a world of difference. Also, don't skip lectures, because unlike CHEM 220, CHEM 221 lectures are worth going to (and the exams are based off of lecture material, not book material).",
    "Do all homework; practice questions using the answer book!",
    "Pretty good course. I loved orgo 1st semester with FEZ - this was a good follow-up. Prof. Ellman is an AMAZING lecturer, Prof. Schepartz was good. The psets were time consuming but constituted only a small percent of the grade. Professor Ellman's exams were very fair. I liked the bio applications that Prof. Schepartz brought into her half of the course. While I understand why the professors each gave a \"special lecture\" specific to their field at the end of the year, I don't think we had enough background to get a lot out of them. There were four midterms - one every three weeks. This was both good and bad. It meant less material on each one, but they were so often you could never let your guard down and it got exhausting by the end. Good news is that you get to drop 1 of four midterms and your lowest two psets (assigned weekly). There was always 5 hours of optional test review spread out over Sat and Sun before a Monday test. These reviews were conducted by the TAs and were generally helpful.",
    "Ellman and Schepartz were both quite good lecturers. Premeds continue to be premeds so it'll be a lot of work. You basically learn more and more and more reactions. Good news is that it doesn't draw too heavily from first semester so if you're not that great at the intricacies of alkene reactions or stereochem, don't worry. All in all I'm glad I'm done.",
    "Tough class. Get a tutor!",
    "This was a good class and was very well-taught. I learned a lot and by the end had an even greater appreciation for organic chemistry.",
    "Orgo II is a lot of reactions, yes, but it's not difficult if you put a fair amount of time into the course. Do your reading before lecture (20 minutes), do (yes, really, do) all of the practice problems in the book, and you'll be just fine. All of the tests were very easy compared to the problem sets. Seeingas how most of you reading this evaluation are forced to take this course due to premed requirements, I suppose my recommendation to take this course is irrelevant. Regardless, it's a well taught, interesting course, and I would have taken it even if I didn't need it for my major.",
    "Organic chemistry gets a bad reputation and chances are if you're looking at this class, you have to take it anyway. Just know that it's not as bad as all the hype. You will need to study hard - there's no way to do well at orgo without putting in the time (I ended up going to two sections a week), but if you do that, the material will start making sense. There are many more reactions in this semester, but not so many knew concepts. If you did well in orgo 1 and learned how to think about orgo, you should be fine. Ellman and Schepartz were both wonderful as far as orgo professors go - quite engaging and knowledgeable. You'd be lucky to have either. There were four midterms (a bit excessive, but you do get to drop a grade), plus a final and weekly problem sets (which really weren't so bad). Just do the work. You'll be fine.",
    "if you can avoid it, don't take this class. if you're premed, then just gun it out.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "You should take this course if you are required to or if you have a very deep interest in Organic Chemistry, but keep in mind that it's a ton of material and that a lot of time is required for the class.",
    "Chem 221, Orgo II, was a great class. You go over some more orgo, it is more applications based, and at the end you learn the synthesis of DNA and peptides, which was fascinating. I would definitely recommend the course to another student. This semester it was more memorizing than last, as there were many reaction conditions that did many things. Make sure to get a good TA to explain the fundamentals and consolidate the material; I thought Eugene and Chris were the best. Be warned, you need not read the textbook or do the problems at the back of the chapter unless you don't understand something from lecture. If you thoroughly understand your lecture notes, that is if you go to lecture and take good notes, that's all you need to get that A you are seeking. Take the class though, I thought it was great. And if you can get Ellman, you should, as he is fantastic.",
    "Orgo",
    "Much more material than Chem 220. But I think conceptually, a little easier to understand.",
    "Do it, just not for fun. Then again, the Ellman\/Schepartz team was great and if you get them you're very lucky.",
    "It's orgo. Fascinating material but a TON of work.",
    "This was actually my favorite class this semester. Granted, I\u0092m a chemistry dork, but orgo with Ellman and Schepartz was actually really great and not nearly as miserable as it could be. Yes, you will have to spend a decent amount of time memorizing reactions, but at least the lectures are good and follow the book pretty closely. The problem sets are also not bad and actually help a good amount for the tests, which were always reasonable. Four exams plus a final seems like a lot, but it breaks up the material in more manageable chunks and you can drop one of the exams, which is nice. Definitely take this with Ellman or Schepartz if you have the option.",
    "CHEM 221 was a lot of work, by far the hardest class I have taken at Yale. There's a lot of content, so make sure you keep up with the work.",
    "Very fair. Very tough.",
    "Overall, one of the better Orgo classes you can take anywhere",
    "It's a fine second semester orgo class. Ellman and Scheparts were both good, though watch out for the amount of biochem that's included towards the end of the class, it's very different from the rest of the course.",
    "It's orgo. Deal.",
    "This was a moderately challening course. Once you get the hang of orgo and you get used to the textbook, its not bad at all. Studying becomes a breeze and can be done a few days ahead of the exam. If you really want to learn the subject really well, then that takes some extra effort, but to pass the exams and do well in the class, all it takes is some good memorization skills and some basic intuition of how organic reactions occur. Compared to first semester, it was harder because of the greater diversity and depth of reactions one needs to memorize and understand, however it was easier in that there was very little conceptual material to understand, and the patterns in the reactions became very clear. I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in how everything around them is made using chemicals. Its fascinating subject and it would behoove people to know this stuff.",
    "Orgo is difficult. Its a lot to study so I recommend you find the best way to learn and retain the material ASAP. I figured it out when studying for the final but unfortunately it was too late. If you want to do well, make time for the class.",
    "Orgo is 85% mental. Do not let people freak you out going into the class. It really is the type of thing where if you put in the work and memorize your reactions and do enough practice problems, it is no harder than any other science class. Do not let people freak you out.",
    "Second semester orgo is a lot more enjoyable than the first. Profs Ellman and Schepartz are both great.",
    "Orgo II contains about 3x as many reactions as first semester. So get ready. You also have to know a lot more little details, and it is very easy to get confused between reactions. There are four exams (once every 3 weeks - keep that in mind) and you drop one. When you study for a midterm, make sure you establish a systematic way to approach the material (i.e. one chapter a day over three days). Otherwise, everything will all get confusedin your mind. As always, find a good study group for problem sets - Ellman's are fair but Schepartz's have weird \"reach\" questions. This course is hard because all pre-meds want an A, and there are fewer people than last semester (so a harder curve). Work hard and do your best!",
    "It's an interesting course! The topics are fun but it's also a lot of work.",
    "This is not a class that I would recommend, but I guess you have to take it for major requirements or pre-med prerequisites. If you aren't on top of everything from the get-go, you're going to drown in this class. Seek help as early as possible!",
    "If you get Ellman or Shepartz you should take it.",
    "If you're not premed or a science major or really enthusiastic about organic chemistry, I would not take this class. It's hard, especially if one is not passionate about the topic. But it is also interesting."
