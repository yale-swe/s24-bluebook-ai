   "comments": [
    "The material was interesting, but the class was a bit all over the place and that sometimes made it hard to keep track of what was going on.",
    "The course was extremely PowerPoint heavy, and I wouldve liked a more interactive and engaging course.",
    "Interesting and engaging lectures organized by themes. Deadlines for papers and other assignments were reasonable.",
    "The procedure of the course was a little confusing, as we kept hopping back between different cultures. I would have preferred if we did all of Egypt, then all of Mesopotamia, then all of Islamic magic rather than bouncing between them. It was nice to have loose direction in terms of the presentation and paper and final because I felt like we had a lot of room to explore, but at the same time, a little more specific direction might have been nice. I also think that the 2 hour block was a little much, and I would have preferred this course to meet twice a week for less time as opposed to once a week for more time."

   "comments": [
    "yup! really interesting!",
    "Its an interesting class and theres a lot of flexibility in what you chose to write about, so yes.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who was already interested in the subject matter.",
    "Beware that there is an actual final exam. So take notes and pay attention during lectures because you are expected to know lots of stuff. Take this course but keep in mind that its contents are designed for students of Egyptology\/NELC\/religious studies. Readings can be burdensome sometimes and, again, the final exam can be quite stressful. Professor Darnell gives good feedback on your papers and research project, so take advantage of office hours.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to dive deeply into magical and ritual practices of ancient cultures. However, if someone just wants a broad overview course, I wouldn't recommend it."
