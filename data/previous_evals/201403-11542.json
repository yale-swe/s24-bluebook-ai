    "Rather than a shallow examination of many methods, some of which the students were unlikely to actually implement in their research (judging by the presentations), I would have preferred deeper learning of certain key methods",
    "I think for people who already have a social science research background, the course just covers topics we've already learned in undergraduate classes. For people who have never conducted social science research, they probably got a lot more out of the class. I think Justin's sociological perspective was new to me, so I got to learn some new methods. However, adding these methods made the course less able to go in depth on any one topic, which I felt was a drawback.",
    "Question #4: Amity went too fast in her lectures. Justin's pace was about right. If Amity slows down during each of her lectures, the pace would be perfect. Amity's lectures are packed with excellent information and are extremely interesting but the speed makes it really difficult to process and absorb.",
    "The readings were great in general. We went in a little deeper on a few topics than I thought was helpful for most participants, like in network analysis. While the out of class assignments were useful, I think it would have been better to focus more on aspects of the research proposal. Also, if we had handed in the proposal earlier, we would have then had more of a chance to polish it with the help of the professors, TA's, and other students. It was great to have the two different approached from Amity and Justin on social science research, Amity's being more traditional and Justin's taking advantage of more recent technology."

    "I really enjoyed Amity's lectures and knowledge. I also really enjoyed sharing my research with a group and receiving feedback. This was the most helpful part of the class.It was enriching to hear all of the other project proposals as well. I wished we got to work in groups more often. I learned a lot here.",
    "I'm a big fan of how Amity and Justin built a comfortable, discussion-based, and close-feeling student experience in the classroom. I also appreciated the amount of time we were encouraged to work in small groups Great breadth of topics (but could be a bad thing (see Q15).",

   "comments": [
    "An increase in the time spent on specifically working through individual research project ideas and design.",
    "The weekly response questions seemed to be kind of cursory, not very challenging or thought provoking. The assignment didn't require significant engagement with the reading and we weren't able to see our classmate's questions, so it seemed like a pretty shallow exercise",
    "I think the course design, as mentioned in question 13. I learned some new methods because we covered wide scope, but at the same time we didn't get to go in depth so that was a drawback. If there was a way to merge the two, that would be the best.",
    "Would have liked to have more focused work on project and have had assignments pertain to project more.",
    "The discussions could be more structured. Also, we could focus more on economics and the more quantitative social sciences. Right now it is focused more on sociology\/anthropology type field work.",
    "The class should be taught slower and have students be more prepared for the final presentation and paper. It would be helpful if each part of the final paper were taught in depth.",
    "While we covered a lot of methods this semester (and I appreciate this is probably the point), I don't really feel like I digested them. We only spent one week on interviews AND surveys which make up the bulk of many people's research this coming summer. Other schools similar to FES devote entire classes to this one topic. I felt like we did less practice and more reading\/response questions\/lecture. I would have really liked the class to be more hands on, especially outside the classroom. Instead of so many readings, maybe a shorter assignment each week where we practiced that week's skill. Readings sometimes seemed repetitive (within each week's set) and often unnecessarily long. Could we be more selective about the readings? Instead of writing reading questions that we often struggled to generate and often weren't discussed in class, could we have more meaningful assignments? I liked having 2 professors to offer different viewpoints but it was often really awkward and embarrassing when Amity would interrupt something Justin said. He has great things to say and it makes students uncomfortable when the profs teaching a \"team taught\" class aren't really a \"team\". I found Justin's sections really interesting but often found the lectures to be tedious. Most if not all of the class grew up with computers so we're pretty comfortable with the ideas of \"big data\" and technological advancement. I would have liked if we could have just skipped to the methods and applications with much less background. We can move faster in this class!",
    "Flexibility for those who are at a more advanced stage in their degree and research, or for those who have already taken at least one (or in my case several) methods and anthropology classes before. (Especially if this class is going to continue to be required for everyone pursuing an MESc.)",
    "It would be great to structure in more of a focus on creating polished research proposals."

    "Discussion and in-class activities practicing certain methods were good. Since people often tend to sit in the same spots and then group themselves based on seat location, some greater mixing between students for in-class activities might be beneficial",
    "Yes, effective.",
    "The relationship between the course lectures and discussion was effective when the person teaching stopped to engage in conversation.Often times the discussion was curtailed because there was a separate day for discussion. However this \"separate\" discussion day was usually reserved to discuss readings which were minimally useful. A better way of doing this would be: 1 - slow down on the lectures. The lectures by Amity were very very interesting and contained a lot of useful information. If taught slower the students will be able to grasp the concepts much better. 2- discussions should be based on students projects and how (if at all) the particular readings could be applied to the projects.",
