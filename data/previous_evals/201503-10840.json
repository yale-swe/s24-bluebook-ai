   "comments": [
    "CHEM 523\/01 includes lots of useful synthetic methodologies. I would highly recommend this course. It not only gave people fundamental knowledge of organic chemistry, but also increase people's presenting abilities.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to another student.",
    "I would not recommend it in the way that it was structured this year. However I would recommend it based on the material that is covered.",
    "above",
    "CHEM 523 is a good yet brief introduction to various organic synthetic methodology that has been developed in the past several decades. In addition to learning about the reactions themselves and their applications in synthesis, you will also gain mechanistic and stereochemical understanding thereof and use some physical-organic aspects (e.g. stereoelectronic effects) to rationalize reactivity trends. The course covers a breadth of topics, such as alkene functionalization, additions to carbonyls, aldol reactions and pericyclic reactions, to name a few. Since the class tries to accomplish so much in only one semester's time, the pace is usually fast and some topics end up being covered only shallowly in class. Doing the reading assignments (which are usually fairly long) will help you keep up. The roughly biweekly problem sets are good practice and do not take up a lot of time. The tests can be pretty challenging, but I appreciate it that they're designed such that you don't need to memorize all the stuff you learn in class, but rather fundamentally understand how things work. The problem sets and exams are complemented by a presentation and a written project, both of which might be tedious to prepare but which target your essential scientific communication and literature research skills, which usually don't get much attention in traditional lectures. As an organic student, you're probably required to take class and for good reason. It really teaches you essential synthetic knowledge and mechanistic understanding, and it is quite exciting to see how the selectivity of many reactions can be explained in terms of fairly simple models. The format of the class is non-traditional but I feel it will help you develop as a chemist in multiple ways.",
    "It provides a general overview of interesting topics in Organic chemistry, with stress in principles such as stereoelectronic factors etc.",
    "Learned a lot, would recommend",
    "It was a highly informative course and a collaborative, friendly environment. I would recommend this to another student because I learned a lot in just one semester.",
    "Very educational, must-take for any synthetic chemist!"

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned about electronic effects on selectivity--stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, chemoselectivity--more systematically than they had been treated in any course I had taken hitherto.",
    "It is the most important course for me, giving me inspiration to design my research project.",
    "The course was a great resource for expanding my professional knowledge.",
    "This course exposed me to aspects of reactions that I had never seen before. Stereoelectronics is highly stressed and seemingly everything boils down to sterics or electronics. I learned to dig into the literature without going to a textbook. This course does a good job of forcing you to shed undergraduate tendencies and start becoming a graduate student who'll have to solve problems independently.",
    "Essential knowledge about the organic synthetic methodology of the past couple of decades. The knowledge of reactions themselves is complemented by understanding the mechanisms by which they work and the models by which one can rationalize and predict enantio\/stereoselectivity. This is extremely useful because it teaches you concepts or ways of tackling chemical problems that will be widely applicable in the organic research you undertake in grad school.",
    "The course underlines principles in organic chemistry. There was some overlap between this course and the Advanced Organic Chemistry, hence it provides a good chance for you to see application of those principles in the field of Org Chem. Independent projects are very interesting and offered students an opportunity to explore field\/topic of special interest.",
    "Learned a lot of new material and defnetly have a better grasp on the topics",
    "Having only taken two organic chemistry courses in undergraduate school, this course helped me to understand organic chemistry and synthesis in a deeper way. It widened my perspectives on what is being done and what has been done in the research community and taught me useful methods that can be used in the laboratory.",
    "I know more reactions, but more importantly, i know where to find others if i need them."
