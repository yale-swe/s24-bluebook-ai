   "comments": [
    "I can't recommend this course highly enough. The readings were wonderful, the professor is brilliant, and the workload isn't too bad. There is a 25-page paper at the end, which I recommend getting an early start on. The topic is very open-ended. The readings are engaging, if a bit dense. Discussion was a little hit-or-miss: sometimes very interesting, sometimes a bit dull. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "The subject is interesting but sometimes elusive. I don't think I would have had a sense for what was going on had I not had some exposure to the topic before. Professor Dove is an engaged teacher and amazing scholar, but his busy schedule made our access to him limited. His office hours get full quickly, he doesn't always respond to emails, and he never gave us feedback on our reading responses. Given the long paper at the end of the semester, I would take this class if you have something you already want to write about: something about environment and culture. That thing will keep you engaged in the material throughout and make it easier to write the paper at the end. Without it, you might feel a littlelost.",
    "Good course, interesting to anthro- and enviro-oriented people alike. The work load, however, is pretty extreme. You end up writing over 30 pages for the class, and it isn't a writing credit. The readings are interesting though, and class is nice.",
    "It is a wonderful course that opens your eyes to the human nature interaction, and everything in between. The readings were, generally, great, so keeping up with them shouldn't be too difficult. The work load isn't bad and I felt that this course changed my whole perspective, or at least broadened it, on the topic of the worlds varied perceptions and interactions with nature, which I find truly important.Make sure you put some time into your final paper before reading week. I found that by having all my readings done by the end of Thanksgiving break really helped. Make sure to write on a topic that interests you, and you will be surprised at what you learn.Great course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It truly changes the way you think: about nature, culture, and anthropology in general. Professor Dove is brilliant and is clearly an expert in his field. The readings are also fascinating. The final 25-30 page paper can be difficult however if you don't plan your time well. There are no deadlines besides an initial proposal and then the final paper. Make a schedule for yourself and follow it.",
    "This class has an extremely interesting textbook with fascinating readings (compiled by Professor Dove), but the class is less than captivating. Professor Dove lectures for almost the entire class, giving students very little time to discuss. Also, his voice is, unfortunately, very soothing and hard to pay attention to in the late afternoon. I would recommend this class only if you are extremely interested in the topic and how anthropology is discussed.",
    "This class is pretty good--the reading is interesting, but if you really hate philosophy I'd recommend against it--there's a lot of discussion over what words really mean, and how our definition of nature and wilderness affects our relationship to the environment. The lecture part of the class lasts for an hour and a half, which can get boring, but then the discussion at the end can be interesting.",
    "Lots of readingevery week, three 4-page response papers\/you lead the discussion three times, and a final 25-30 page research paper worth half the grade means that the work can vacillate between feeling like nothing at all (if you choose not to do the reading one week) and being overwhelming (if you leave the paper to reading week). Start the paper\/thinking about a topic AS SOON AS the semester starts, do not delay! Also, do the reading! It feels really easy to say that it's the last thing on your to-do list, but then class is never as good if you haven't really dug into the readings, as dense and they could be. On the other hand, some of the readings are amazing and so different from anything else I've read at Yale, and gave me a new window on the world. So I would say, if you have a certain amount of patience and perseverance, a fascination with the topic, and academic curiosity, take this course!"
