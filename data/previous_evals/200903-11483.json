    "I would recommend it if Khalil is teaching it. He's one of the nicest profs I've had, and pretty funny, though he doesn't know it. It's a typical ENVE course so no surprises there, but because our class was so small, we couldnt get a TA and so problem sets weren't ever turned in. Jackpot.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for an easy class in engineering. The class consists of one lecture each week and then a problem solving session where Professor Khalil goes over the homework problems for the week. He also gave a few lectures on topic in renewable energy that he happened to find interesting. The tests were simple, multiple choice mainly focusing on knowledge of the lecture notes. There was also a term paper, which is most of the work of the course, but really isn't that difficult. Most people did research papers on a renewable energy topic. Summary: light workload, fun professor, fairly interesting material.",
    "Take it if you are an environmental engineer.",
    "Yes. Professor Khalil is a really chill professor. There also was not that much homework at all because we had no TA.I would also recommend it if you would like to learn more about what is in the air pollution around us and different abatement techniques."
