    "Literary Politics was quite interesting, especially if you are intrigued by the social and political aspects of literature and how they influence and are influenced by such writings. We had to write 4 essays, each on a different set of writings which we read during class.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in good literature that challenges prior thoughts on politics.",
    "I really enjoyed the course, but I think more could have been done to help us with writing. There was less emphasis on improving our papers during class than I would have liked, although the content of the novels was really interesting. Overall it was helpful in improving my writing about literature. I would recommend taking English 115 if you want to read a lot of good novels while working on improving writing skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend Literary Politics to anyone who is interested not only in reading great works but also looking at the historical time periods in which they were written. Professor Kreiner is a tough grader, so expect to put some serious work into the essays. Overall, this was a great class.",
    "Amazing class!!"
