    "I really appreciate this course that provided me with a good atmosphere to speak out and organize my own talks. I learned a lot of skills to behave better in a scientific presentation.",

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the practice talks each student has to give twice over the semester, and the input from different faculty members about their own preferences when it comes to talks. The practice talks are incredibly useful both for having practice organizing slides and building your story, as well as for the actual speaking and question answering practice with immediate honest feedback. Feedback about story and slides and method for explaining concepts from people outside of the lab is very useful. The input from other faculty guests was also a strength, as it was nice to hear more than one perspective on how things should be organized or presented. One weakness of the course was time. It was scheduled to be a one hour class and 90% of the classes ended up being 1.5 hours. This was frustrating for the first several and then I learned to adjust my schedule and plan for the class to be 50% longer. I also think it would have been useful to have a slightly more formal feedback system for speakers.",
    "The instructor's feedback on the talk is extremely helpful.",
    "Strength: giving students opportunity to give presentations and get feedback.",
    "Strengths: provided very useful skills and comments for each student. Weakness: each student only has two chances to present in the whole semester, a little bit less.",
    "The course felt organic (i.e., went in directions that were most desired by students) and student driven. I enjoyed hearing about the research being conducted by other INP students. I felt the faculty guest sessions could be stronger.",
    "Strengths: 1. High interaction with the teacher 2. Teacher had exceptional mastery on the topics covered in the course 3. Great interaction with peers 4. Demystified talks for me. Weaknesses: None."

    "Yes. I think it is great practice for talking about science and learning what your own strengths and weaknesses surrounding speaking are.",
    "A great course to receive insightful feedback from the instructor and other students.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "Sure. Most INP courses provide professional background of neuroscience, but this course is more focused on ability itself. it is like a line to link all the pieces of knowledge together.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any science student preparing research talks.",
    "Yes, this course will greatly improve your presentation skills, which is an often overlooked but very important point for scientific success.",
    "Yes."
