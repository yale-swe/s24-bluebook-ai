   "comments": [
    "It is amazing to me how much French we learned over the course of one semester! It's definitely a lot of work, and meeting every day means that you can't let yourself fall behind, but it's super engaging and you will learn so much. I liked the weekly test format because they didn't feel nearly as high-stakes as a midterm, and it was helpful to see how you were doing as material accumulated.",
    "Strength: Professor Ngame. He is very kind, approachable, and willing to answer any questions. He has also made me genuinely excited about learning French.",
    "No weaknesses, only strengths. The videos make me so freaking happy.",
    "During the last two weeks of class, we had one extremely dense exam, a final project (six minute presentation or a ten minute skit), and a final exam. The chapter 19\/20 exam should have been a bit more spread out. Additionally, required work over fall break would have been helpful in keeping the work level consistent.",
    "strengths: meeting every day, immersion teaching technique (Capretz method) weaknesses: outdated cultural references in the videos",
    "Great class.",
    "The immersion is a real strength of this course, as is the workbook and audio exercises. Weakness: The Jean-Pierre pickup artist videos. They're REALLY awful. I know this will never change, but maybe at least take out the test question asking how to start a conversation with a woman? I ended up struggling because I didn't want to describe any of his horrible techniques but I didn't know the vocabulary for anything else.",
    "I would suggest giving students more time with the weekly exams when they are handed back so that they can learn from those mistakes."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are committed to spending time and energy practicing French. The French in Action immersion method was definitely a little intimidating for the first few days, and having a background in Spanish made learning the new verb tenses and certain grammatical rules much easier. I think it would've been difficult to pick up grammar for the first time having it explained in French.",
    "Yes",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Professor Ngame is an amazing teacher. The class is also very interactive and engaging. Taking this class is without a doubt rewarding.",
    "100% if Professor Ngame is the one teaching the course.",
    "Yes. If you want to learn French, take this class. It is not an easy A or a simple challenge.",
    "Yes. French has many uses and because the French department at Yale is very active, the class segues into a strong learning community.",
    "Yeah1 If you don't know which language you want to take, French is great. It's useful, but unlike, say, Spanish, basically everyone in the class is genuinely new to the language."
