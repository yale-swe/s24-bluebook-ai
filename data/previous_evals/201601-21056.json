   "comments": [
    "It is a relatively low work advanced lab class that will help you learn about inorganic chemistry.",
    "Take it if you like chemicals to be pretty colors.",
    "Overall it's a good lab class, much much better and more interesting than Orgo Lab. It basically covers 4 distinct areas in inorganic chemistry, Crystal structures, Coordination Chemistry, Organometallic Chemistry and Homogeneous Catalysis. The results obtained were analyzed and rationalized with some really cool methods and the lab reports had to be written in a scientific format, which was interesting and useful to do. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Really fun course! Experiments are great, lab is chill. Great lab elective! Learned a lot, and didn't feel stressed at all. Sometimes you get to learn the most when you have to provide the information yourself (Ie reports), and not having the stress means you can focus on learning the material.",
    "sure, if you are a chem major take it, but not otherwise",
    "A solid lab class. Experiments were not especially challenging to carry out. Lab reports were very useful in solidifying material learned in the Inorganic Chemistry lecture and helped me to improve my scientific writing. Dr. Parr was very responsive to questions about the labs and reports.",
    "It was ok. I recommend taking is concurrently with the intro or advanced inorganic lecture. On their own I think each of them do a poor job of teaching the material, but possibly together, they could reinforce each other.",
    "It's a great advanced lab class for the chem major or a way to get a WR credit. Interesting and fun labs. Not too difficult lab reports. They teach you more how to write a JACS article, which is a good skill.",
    "Great introduction to scientific writing, fantastic introduction to inorganic chemical techniques.",
    "Great laboratory companion to Chem 252. Dr. Parr is a great instructor who is super enthusiastic about the experiments and will make sure you understand what is going on.",
    "Very different from orgo lab, but not necessarily in a bad way. Experiments are cool and very colourful and you learn a ton of chemistry along the way - builds on the lecture relatively well but at some places the theory goes way beyond what you learn in 252 so you're on your own. Dr. Parr is a great instructor - he's always willing to explain things and work with you on your reports. Reports are probably very different from what you've done in the past, and require a ton of research and reading - the first few are pretty painful but once you get into the hang of things they're rather doable. Take it WR for an easy credit if you need it - you do the same reports as everyone else and just write an extra 2,000-3,000 word paper at the end.",
    "Would recommend- it's a good class and Professor Parr is a great professor.",
    "I would only recommend this class to those who are interested in learning about inorganic chemistry because the reports are a significant time investment and do take some background research to fully write, and the time investment may not be appealing to those who are taking the class to satisfy the advanced lab requirement. The grading in the class is pretty lax though.",
    "Inorganic lab is a pretty cool course and I would definitely recommend it for the chemistry major. If you need a writing credit, I would also take it WR because it isn't that much extra work. You have to do a brief writing assignment that takes ~30 minutes, do corrections for one of your lab reports, and write a final paper. The only big time commitment is the final paper, which can be frustrating if you have a lot of extra work during finals, but is probably better than doing an entire semester of another WR class. If you want to make things easier on yourself, write the paper over spring break, because you can turn it in whenever and then you won't be busy during finals. Professor Parr is a great instructor and will teach you the importance of lab techniques and make you understand them. I think this class taught me more about inorganic chemistry than the inorganic chemistry course did, and it was fascinating. The lab reports can take quite a bit of time, there are four of them, but overall this class isn't a huge amount of work and can be quite enjoyable.",
    "A great lab course to fulfill upper level chemistry requirements. Workload was definitely manageable- just be sure not to procrastinate on lab reports. Professor Parr is a great instructor who will make sure that you'll learn what you need to know, and the experiments and material that were covered in the course were very interesting. Lab reports are long, but you'll be satisfied with the final product, and learn useful skills in scientific writing. Definitely the best lab course I've taken at Yale."
