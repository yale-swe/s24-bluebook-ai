   "comments": [
    "This course is packed full of pretty interesting content! I learned how to find double and triple integrals of vector line functions and 3-D surfaces. Generally, I feel a lot more confident in my math skills as a result of this course.",
    "I developed my 3D thinking and problem solving skills.",
    "Applications of multivariate calculus",
    "I learned basically everything related to multivariable calculus. From vectors to derivatives to (so many kinds of) integrals.",
    "I had never taken multi before and so obviously I learned all of that info. The approach to problem solving was also good to learn.",
    "Multivariable calculus, especially the major theorems for vector integrals (FTLI, Stokes', Green's, Divergence)",
    "I developed countless skills in this class. First and foremost, I learned multi variable calculus, but more importantly I appreciated the math. Unlike other courses where student students subconciously complete problem sets or just answer the problems, Sudesh made us appreciate and understand the math we were doing. Everything connected in the class and I loved all the math we were doing. I left the course inspired to continue to pursue math!",
    "I learned a lot about vector calculus and how to apply it to my other classes such as physics that are built on these concepts.",
    "Multi variable calculus and how to study for a very fast paced course",
    "S U D E S H. good math. good class. fun times",
    "Multivariable calculus topics and critical quantitative reasoning skills.",
    "Being able to think in three dimensions.",
    "I learned all of the fundamental concepts of multivariable calculus and how and when to apply them. Sudesh taught them in such a way that so that problem solving was made easy and he also made sure that we understood exactly what we were doing rather than just solving problems and getting meaningless numbers.",
    "Everything from math120 - it was well taught so every skill was taken in.",
    "Great multi variable math skills.",
    "Multi variable calculus, critical thinking and perserverence when working through problems.",
    "I gained a reasonable proficiency in multivariable calculus, including 3D vectors and line, vector, flux integrals.",
    "I developed the ability to look conceptually at problems rather than using memorized formulas to solve a problem.",
    "I think this class further developed my problem solving and critical thinking skills. Additionally, it gave in depth knowledge about multivariable calculus and how this math applies to the real world.",
    "This course was just the right level of challenging that pushed me to fully understand the material.",
    "Through this course I built upon my calculus foundation and was able to expand to multiple dimensions. The skills in this course directly applied to the math required for my Intensive Introductory Physics class which was a lifesaver for tests. The class clearly explains key concepts in multi variable calculus which one is set to master.",
    "Learned how to apply one-variable concepts to multi-variable calculus problems. Learned lots of different techniques to simplify problems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course material builds in a way that makes sense. I felt like a learned a lot and there were good resources such as online practice problems with Ximera. I wish the course was a bit less focused on computation.",
    "It is a fun course.",
    "Sudesh is a fantastic lecturer (great at explaining material), and he tells you exactly what you need to know to understand the material covered by the course. He provides great notes, and was very available during many office hours. The textbook is also pretty clear, though notation can vary (Sudesh also gave us every iteration and explained it). I've heard so many complaints abut this course, but none of them held for my experience. Problems in the textbook and from lecture are similar to the tests and problems.",
    "The course pace might be a bit fast for some people, but Sudesh made everything so clear and engaging that it wasn't an issue for me at all.",
    "I thought that Sudesh's teaching made difficult concepts very clear, and that the course was well-organized and well-designed to help us understand how all the units connected together. It's very fast-paced, especially since my section had only 2 classes per week, but the lecture note sheets were always very helpful in staying on track.",
    "Strengths: everything is learnable. It's not terribly hard. There are tons of resources if you want extra practice, but at the same time if you don't then you do not have to use them. The psets only ever take like 2 hours and are twice a week. Weakness: it doesn't feel that applicable to real life. Doing the math isn't hard but no one really knew what we were doing on a meta level and why any of the theorems worked.",
    "The course was well-structured and Sudesh was seriously an awesome instructor.",
    "Strengths: SUDESH!!! I can't say enough about him. He makes packets for each lecture, constantly provides extra practice problems, and is all-around the BEST math lecturer I've ever encountered (I took multivariable calc \/ linear algebra in high school, and things made so much more sense this time around). I've heard the Math 120 experience is subpar with other instructors, but with Sudesh, a huge strength of the course was its clear explanation of concepts and the availability of practice problems. \/\/ Weaknesses: grading felt harsh, especially given the prevalence of tricky true\/false questions. If you lost the all-or-nothing credit on those, your grade took a severe hit. In one case, I did nearly all of the math flawlessly on the midterm and didn't get above a 90 because I messed up 2-3 true\/falses. You put a lot of effort into the weekly homework for it to be only worth 10%, although it's totally manageable.",
    "There are only stengths to this course as I was lucky to have Sudesh as a professor. He was wonderful and such an amazing lecuturer and professore who offered countless office hours and review sessions. In lecture, we were given packets which helped us stay organized. The problem sets seemed a bit outdated but they allowed us to practice the skills we learned in class. Most of all, the ximeras were extremely helpful as they allowed us to watch videos to review each topic and practice with conceptual true and false questions as well as normal problems.",
    "The math reviews were a strength, and my professor Sudesh Kalyanswamy was excellent with his handouts",
    "SUDESH===STRONG. WAKING UP === WEAK",
    "Tons of practice and resources for the course. A weakness was maybe the fast pace through all the topics, but I think that was unavoidable.",
    "The main strength is really Sudesh. Multivariable calculus can be difficult but the content is the same regardless of the teacher, it was really having Sudesh that made the difference. The note packet he gave during each lecture made studying a lot easier and so did all of the resources he provided us with.",
    "strength - structure, textbook weakness - monotony",
    "Sudesh teaches the class very well.",
    "The course is good, it just moves extremely quickly. I needed to dedicate more time than I did to reach full proficiency. Simply doing the PSets is not enough.",
    "The course was largely understandable to even a non-math major like myself. I did not see any weaknesses of this course.",
    "I think the course is very tough, but taught well. The only suggestion I would have is to make the coaching more pronounced and available to students.",
    "The weakest part of this course is that it is inconsistent across sections. There also seems to be a lot of course material for one smester, and at times the pace seemed ridiculously hurried. However, I really liked my section and found that there was a lot of help available if I had the time and put in the effort.",
    "The course is exceptional in its ability to have students master several key ideas in multi variable calculus. The concepts are very fleshed out and explained well. Where this course falters is in helping one prepare for exams in that some integration techniques can surprise you because all the examples use simple integrals to explain the general concept.",
    "Student experiences vary dramatically from instructor to instructor. My experience with Sudesh was great but other students had worse instructors. Perhaps general standards for each instructor would help, things that every instructor should do."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you get Sudesh as an instructor. He is super welcoming and helpful, and he genuinely wants students to ask questions and feel comfortable with the material.",
    "Yes. It is a good continuation of calculus.",
    "Yes, if you need it - otherwise there's not much point, since it's only applications. Do everything you can to be placed in Sudesh's section. I'm an average math student (formerly a humanities major), and he made everything make sense, and connected the material to linear algebra.",
    "Yes. Sudesh is a wonderful instructor so try to get into his section if possible. But otherwise, even though the material is difficult, I found that doing a lot of practice problems and taking advantage of office hours\/resources makes it pretty manageable. I actually really enjoyed this class even though I was taking it as a prerequisite.",
    "Would recommend this course. Obviously you're probably taking it because you need to on some level. I actually did not have to take this class for my prospective major, but thought that it would be interesting to learn and like math. I enjoyed it and am glad I took it even though I did not have to. If you like math and are decently good at it or willing to put in some work, you will probably do well in this course.",
    "Yes if you can take it with Sudesh",
    "if you get Sudesh, REJOICE. I would only recommend taking it with him. He's the best math lecturer I've ever seen. Be prepared to put in the effort and you'll see the gains under his teaching.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to any student interested in math who wants to be challenged and enjoy the math they are doing. It is an amazing course (if you get Sudesh!!)",
    "Yes definitely. If you are interested in the vector calculus, you will learn a lot by the end of the course.",
    "Yes, because I think the class content is important to learn in general",
    "yeah. I like math. Sudesh is a great guy with lots of office hours. super chill",
    "Yes I would recommend to students who need it as a prerequisite. But if you just like math, I think this course is great as well.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course especially with Sudesh.",
    "yes if they need to take it",
    "Yes I would because it was very rewarding.",
    "It's multivariable calculus. I wouldn't suggest anyone go out of their way to take it unless they need to for their major or are just REALLY into calculus for some reason. That being said, it's structured well and I believe I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend the course to any prospective stem major.",
    "Yes, the class sparked a love for math, which I previously never had. I also think as an intro level course it is very difficult, which may deter some, but I believe it prepares one for a typical college course-load.",
    "Yes, but I would tell them to pick their section carefully and to prepare for a heavy workload outside of just the problem sets.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. This was an amazing introduction to math at college and at Yale. The instruction is engaging and the course is complex, but it does not compensate with more work. The workload is exactly what it should be to learn te interesting concepts in the course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you love math and are willing to put in the work to explore it further.",
    "If you managed to get Sudesh as an instructor then I would highly recommend it. Any other instructor and you might be taking risk."
