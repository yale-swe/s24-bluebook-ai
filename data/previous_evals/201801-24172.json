   "comments": [
    "An understanding of the NGO\/INGO world from an organizational perspective An understanding of the types of challenges that these organizations face How personal change is just as important ie we need to be ready and prepared to change our own behaviours beyond those of the organization A reminder on building personal networks as a building block to success An opportunity to practically apply this knowledge to specific problems that these organizations face",
    "Gained practical insight on how the field of development actually functions. The many levers that motivate change and how to best prepare for such a career.",
    "Strategic thinking",
    "Learnt about how leaders in different organizations are dealing with change in the development world.",
    "This class was a wonderful addition to my graduate education. I loved the mix of practitioners perspective as well as academic perspective. I feel that I really gained an understanding of how the development world is changing and how i can be a better manager and leader moving forward.",
    "This course offered a foundation of knowledge leading change in global development. Students gained skills in strategic thinking, writing consulting memos, working with others. The guest speakers wonderfully supplemented Professor MacCormack's teaching style in a way to prepare us all to enter the field of global development as young professionals.",
    "The course provided a good overview of the current challenges facing development organizations and particularly the need for transformation in response to these changing challenges. The approaches taken to change management within organizations has been really useful.",
    "A really nice introduction and overview of the field of global development - ranging from the types of organizations that exist in the system, different roles\/jobs that people can have, how organizations are funded, etc. Additionally, introductions to the types of \"disruptive forces\" that are impacting organizations to change how they go about their mission. A nice focus on personal leadership and career goals. That practical level of discussion and advice is often absent from Yale courses, in my experiences, and it was refreshing to have conversations with other students, as well as seasoned professionals, about what is necessary (outside of issue-based knowledge alone) to advance and grow in a career over time.",
    "Leading an organization through change",
    "I learned quite a bit about the field of international development as a whole, but also from the guest speakers, I learned what it means to be a professional in different types of organizations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: 1. Structure of class: guest lectures 2. Practical assignments 3. Consistent feedback on assignments, class, and being continually asked for feedback on the class 4. Small class size Weaknesses: 1. Not everyone in the class was engaged which occasionally led to one sided monologues during the discussion section",
    "I wish Charlie lectured more. The guests were interesting but there were too many of them and it took away from building a cohesive syllabus. Also, Charlie is one of the kindest professors I've had!",
    "Charlies experience was great to hear but our talks rarely tied back in the readings - this could be improved and talks be more around readings. He brought in some awesome speakers though that shared a lot of great information.",
    "Great Prof! Having guest lectures in person",
    "I would have liked to discuss the readings and to maybe learn more about development theory.",
    "This was Pr MacCormack's first class and it was great content-wise but I think he could have improved the time management and pacing of the class.",
    "I think the course could be improved with more structure, and having a higher focus on the readings",
    "Strengths: consulting memos were a good skill to learn, guest speakers were amazing, Professor MacCormack's ability to relate our lessons to his personal experiences By the end of the class there were no weaknesses. Professor MacCormack routinely asked for feedback and adjusted the course accordingly.",
    "The guest speakers were of great value to class discussions. The readings however were excessive and often repetitive and were often not discussed during class sessions. It would also be useful to think about some current case studies of development organizations undergoing change management.",
    "Wealth of knowledge from instructor; weekly speakers with valuable insights from across stakeholder groups (NGOs, Foundations, UN, US Govt)",
    "Strengths: - Guest speakers - some were really strong, and it was a great opportunity to hear directly from leaders in their field! Charlie did a great job pulling in speakers that represented different parts of the system. - Charlie was a fantastic teacher and clearly has a wealth of knowledge and experience in this field! - A good overview of different issues facing global development, different roles played within the system - Diversity of student experiences and expertise - what an amazing room of people! (SOM, Jackson, Forestry, Public Health) Weaknesses: - Guest speakers don't always tie directly to the readings - There can be little incentive to do the readings if they aren't discussed in class. Perhaps more frequent reading responses, or other in-class activities could more directly reference and draw upon the readings. - Some guest speakers were less dynamic than others - Some speakers\/discussions stayed more at the surface level and didn't dive deeply into disruptive changes they were facing, how to tackle them, etc. - Consulting Memos and Change Management Plans - might make sense to line up organizations ahead of time as partners\/case-studies so students can pair up and have real-world organizations to examine throughout the course of the semester. - More time for discussions in-class! While guest speakers are so valuable, there was also a lot of student expertise in the room from people's careers and experiences before Yale. I wish I would've heard more from my classmates.",
    "Unfortunately we did not rely on the readings. The lectures focused on conversations with guests. As a result not everyone got to ask questions. With time it became very boring",
    "The guest lectures were amazing and Charlie was a wonderful support and mentor and clearly loves teaching. I felt that there could have been more structured lecture time, or even just more class time in general."

Professor MacCormack clearly cares so much about his students and is willing to share his knowledge, advice and connections freely. It's also a great opportunity to connect with students across Yale from different programs and perspectives.",
