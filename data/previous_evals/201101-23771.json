   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you were interested in developing your somewhat basic knowledge and interest in education, this class is perfect.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to others (but be aware that the final project is a LOT of work, and that the professors have very high expectations).",
    "This isn't entirely relevant since Matt and Greg are getting their JD and MBA respectively, but if one of them is around and can somehow offer the course, TAKE IT!! It's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and really makes you think. Reading is decently heavy but really interesting so it doesn't feel heavy in the least, and it's probably the only seminar I've taken here where the class discussion was truly engaging (though I guess to be fair, I'm a QR person, so I've only taken 4 or 5 seminars here total)--to the point where I felt awful about falling asleep a single time.",
    "Definitely. If you have an interest in the American education system or educational reform in general and this is offered again... take it!!",
    "Yes! You should absolutely take this class if you're lucky enough that someone teaches it again! Even if you don't have a strong interest in education, this class is great and really expands your understanding of an issue that is very current, very pressing, and very practical - how many Yale classes do that? Not a lot.",
    "I enjoyed this seminar. The topics were interesting and the readings were good. The professors are thoughtful and approachable and plan out every minute of each class session with group discussions \/ activities. At some points this was engaging, at others overbearing. There is a ton of reading for the class and they cold call students for content. The assignments were interesting but time consuming.",
    "Take the class. AMAZING. So informative. I don't think I've ever learned so much in one class.",
    "Absolutely - if you want to learn about the big issues in American education, do it",
    "The \"goals\" section of the syllabus provides a good summary:This course has three goals. First, students will become conversant in the major issues and debates in American public school policy (e.g., the history of school reform in America, the complex governance structure of public schools, the history and impact of desegregation, accountability reforms like No Child Left Behind, the rise of charter schools, and experiments with vouchers). Second, students will build the skills necessary to interpret empirical research and use those skills to inform analysis of school policy interventions. Third, students will meet public school teachers and other education leaders to build anunderstanding of the impact of various reforms \u0093on the ground.\u0094After an introduction to the American education crisis (broadly summarized as the achievement gap between white and underprivileged minorities and between rich and poor), student potential, and the history of education policy, there is a heavy emphasis on both learning empirical tools and then applying them to evaluations of different proposed solutions, which include desegregation, NCLB, merit pay, building better teachers, school choice, and early childhood intervention. The capstone project is a policy proposal and analysis by the student. The instructors, who will not be returning next year, were great.",
    "Excellent. Professors Matera and Rawson were responsive and eager to engage us. Participating students were sincere and hopeful. Good introduction to the challenges of school reform. Take it if you want to be a teacher, or if you just care about public education in America.",
    "Kind of. If you are interested in education, I\u0092d recommend taking it with the reservation that the course can be really frustrating. You\u0092ll do a lot of reading that you never get a chance to discuss because you spend so much class time doing activities that seem basic and high school-esque. The instructors provided rubrics for assignments, and always told students to refer to the rubrics, but never really explained what they were looking for (in terms of an assignment description) and gave little guidance about how to do the assigments. Since I had never written a policy proposal and had no experience researching education, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out exactly what I was expected to do and how to find the needed information.If you are not that interested in education, I\u0092d recommend that you skip it since it can be so frustrating. That said, if this course is taught again, it will be very different because both Greg and Matt are graduating, so the instructors will be different and all bets are off.",
    "I would urge Yale students to take this course as it provides a good overview of the education system as it stands today. The instructors lead the class well and hold each student to high performance levels."
