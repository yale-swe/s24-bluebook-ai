Marjorie's passion for the subject matter and real-life anecdotes from her ample experience created a fun and learning-conducive environment. Nice to get a practitioner's perspective!",
    "Marjorie did an excellent job of satisfying all different interests and levels of knowledge throughout the course. Even though the class was small it was comprised of different disciplinary backgrounds that could have made it difficult to teach the course, but Marjorie made sure that no one was left behind."

The course might function a little more smoothly if oriented toward one group or the other, but regardless accomplishes it's purpose to cover an area of law often overlooked in law school. Sometimes class could go off on a tangent, which could be fun or a little frustrating depending on your interest in the tangent."

It is very important to understand local governance in dealing with environmental problems, and Marjorie does an excellent job of explaining this system. It is very helpful regardless of whether you desire a career in land use.",
    "Marjorie is passionate about land use law and committed to students understanding the material. It was a great introduction to case law for me. I have a much stronger grasp on legal vocabulary and process and feel better equipped to participate in land use law-related conversations now. Due to our small class size, we were able to frame the course material around students' specific interests."
