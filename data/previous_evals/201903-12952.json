    "I significantly improved my knowledge of jazz",
    "Knowledge: Modern jazz history and artists. Some of the most interesting material I've ever learned from a Yale course. Skills: How to write a 6 page paper the night before it's due! Thanks",
    "I developed my musical, cultural and historical understanding of jazz in the 1960-2000s period massively. It was a very in-depth chronological discussion of jazz players and important movements\/ideas, which was really interesting.",
    "I learned about the jazz narrative and its stylistic fragmentation from the 1960s forward, and I learned to think about jazz from different perspectives - global, economic, political.",
    "Better understanding of the musical developments in jazz from 1960s onwards, as well as the sociopolitical changes with which musicians were in dialogue.",
    "A general sense for the history of jazz from 1960 to present, including some discussion of cultural trends that contributed to musical and ideological shifts.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the different types of jazz from the 1960s and on, and I think the course really strengthened my listening skills and my ability to identify different musical characteristics.",
    "I learned countless stories of Jazz moments in history. I learned how to differentiate Free Jazz from other forms of jazz and that there is not truly one form of music that encompasses the entire genre. This course taught me that music can be respected for a variety of reasons and that there are countless factors that can influence an artist or musical movement.",
    "I really learned to think about jazz from different perspectives, even surprisingly non-musical ones. It is helpful to get out of the music-theoretical approach to analyzing music. There is much more spiritually and socially to jazz than just the notes.",
    "I gained a very mixed history of Jazz after the big band era.",
    "A variety of jazz styles between 1950ish and 2000, including bebop, hard\/post bop, free jazz, third stream, avant-garde, jazz-rock fusion, and smooth jazz. The development of jazz musically and culturally and its relationship to the music of specific cultures around the world.",
    "We learned about important figures and developments in response to bebop, including hard bop, post-bop, and Latin jazz. We additionally listened to and read about later styles of jazz such as free jazz and jazz-rock fusion. A good amount of time was spent discussing the historical and social influences on the music.",
    "Gained a survey knowledge of male jazz musicians from the 1950's on to the 1990's. Learned about different aspects of jazz music making and about the industry and musicians themselves.",
    "I learned so much about the history and politics of jazz in the latter half of the twentieth century. This class introduced me to the movements that began in the music in the 1960s and continued throughout 2000 as a result of the social and political events and attitudes in American and global communities.",
    "I gained a huge amount of knowledge covering the breadth of modern jazz, and I learned to analyze the music in context, picking apart its cultural, social, economic, and creative influences."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: It's all in the material. Jazz history is really interesting, specifically modern stuff. I knew coming into the course that I like jazz fusion, and the course introduced me to many jazz fusion artists as well as other modern jazz genres and artists. I now have a new appreciation for jazz. Weaknesses: The course itself is horrendously run. The professor does not respond to emails (does he even check?), essay prompts were released 6 days before they were due (which is not nearly enough time), the workload was way too great for anyone to keep up, feedback was unclear, and more.",
    "The course was really interesting and we had lots of great discussions, and Professor Veal knew and explained everything very well. The few things I would change would just be clarifying the course more initially. Whilst what we covered was very interesting, it totally excluded vocal jazz (and mostly any female artists), and that would have been very helpful to explain in the course description.",
    "I think that this course did a really good job in surveying a large span of jazz history. The syllabus was relatively well thought out to make sure that many important topics were discussed. I also enjoyed the way that we discussed the jazz from musical, cultural and historical perspectives. There were definitely some parts of the syllabus that connected better than others and I sometimes found it difficult to place the area of jazz that we were discussing into the larger trajectory of the music. I think this course could be improved by better integrating the different eras of jazz as well as including other types of musicians like singers and women into the discussion. At the same time, I think that the last 3 lectures did not add anything positive to the course and, if anything, it left me leaving the class on a sour note as it was hard to figure out how these discussions really related to anything that had come previously and had some problematic moments in them.",
    "The class was well organized in terms of the readings and listenings, and Professor Veal was an engaging and funny lecturer. The biggest change I would make is that instead of having one day of the syllabus devoted to women and gender in jazz, I think the syllabus could simply include women as they become relevant to different stylistic periods (like the way we studied men). I would rather have studied particular women alongside their stylistic peers for their formal innovations, touching on the question of gender imbalance in jazz as needed but not including women solely to ask the gender question. Also, I think Professor Veal felt that we weren't pulling our weight if we didn't do the large amounts of reading for the day an essay was due. Usually most of the class always did the reading, but sometimes they had to forgo completing the readings to perfect their essays. Shorter readings on those days might mitigate the issue.",
    "Though Prof. Veal was generally knowledgeable, this class was badly organized both in lecture and assigned work. The lectures seemed to jump entire periods of time without any disclaimer -- one day we'd be on the 1980's, the next day we'd be back in the 60's without more warning than a small passing comment. We also failed to address certain key issues in the jazz world today, especially as they pertained to members of the class. In terms of work, paper prompts were not assigned until a week (or sometimes even less) before the deadline for no good reason other than that the professor was still devising them. Our final paper was originally assigned to only have nine days between choosing a topic and having a completed 12-15 page paper -- in reality, we got about two weeks, but that is still a ridiculous timeline, if you ask me.",
    "A major strength of the course was the listening assignments and listening portions of the class. They provided ways to apply the knowledge we were learning from lectures and readings in an incredibly interesting and engaging way because of the variety of sound sources. One weakness was the use of the readings class. The readings were often long and tedious, but we didn't really start discussing them in-depth until later in the second half of the semester. The organization of the class into different stylistic periods was helpful for understanding the material, but there was a significant lack of material on the women in jazz who were prominent during this time period, which was unfortunate because women should not have been so overlooked in class as they often are in the real jazz world.",
    "The course covers material that would not be covered in any sort of generic Jazz History class, which is great. It involves artists that are imperative to the genre and are often overlooked. However, this course was advertised as a course that non-jazz musicians\/historians could and should take. This is not the case. My previous knowledge of the history of the genre severly hindered my ability to contribute to class discussions and was a weakness when writing essays. The course was also only on instrumental jazz, which was not in the course description, and dedicated the biggest portion of the term to the free jazz movements. It should also be known that it is taught with the bias and opinion of the professor. Not a weakness, but should be known by the students before joining.",
    "The major strength was opening my eyes to jazz rock fusion and avant garde jazz that seem to be neglected by normal jazz discourses. Also, the analyses and discussions and lectures were fantastic. The major weakness was the lack of linearity\/progression in the curriculum where it was hard to tell why we were covering some things at some times.",
    "For a class that markets itself as a basic jazz history course, the curriculum could be radically restructured in terms of how it groups material. Although a main focus of the class is how jazz was fractured into many different forms, there was at times very literal coherence to the associations between topics or epochs.",
    "I am very glad that this course was taught for the first time this semester, and based on the size and engagement of students, I think it was a clear success. The weaknesses that I bring up should not be seen to discourage this course from being continued to be taught; as with all new courses, it simply needs some adjustments. I think it would be helpful to have a textbook for this class to at least partially replace the disparate readings that were assigned for each lecture. As someone with little knowledge of jazz prior to the class, it was sometimes difficult for me to engage with the dense and abstract texts that we were assigned. I think I would have benefitted more from a thorough review\/preparation for content, perhaps with the extra detail the Prof. Veal did not get to in class. This would also have been helpful on our three shorter essays. I often felt that I did not have sufficient command of the basic historical material and struggled to piece together and argument from all of the different readings. The difficulty of these short essays was compounded by Professor Veal's failure to give us adequate time to complete them. For two of the three 5-7 page essays, we had less than a week to think about the prompt, write, revise, and submit. I have no idea why it took Prof. Veal so long to post them, especially after we struggled to get the first one in on time. Unfortunately, the inadequate time given to complete the third essay delayed my ability to start the term paper (for which the details were distributed rather late, considering that there was little actual guidance provided) and made the entire process much more stressful than it needed to be. We had to write a total of ~30 pages throughout the course, which I believe should qualify it to be a writing credit.",
    "Professor Veal is well-versed in many of the topics we discussed, and the vast majority of the class was extremely interesting. However, we did not get to cover all of the material assigned, which was disappointing at times. Occasionally, we discussed some issues that felt a little bit thin in terms of content, especially towards the end.",
    "Weaknesses: The course does not attempt to include female jazz artists despite acknowledging multiple moments and opportunities throughout the course to be representative. Also, the course assumes a huge amount of prior knowledge, both historical and musical, that makes it hard to access in the beginning and throughout. strengths: music listening is fun and engaging. Covers a diverse amount of opinions and attacks jazz from many different points of view and mediums.",
    "This course provides students with many resources to delve deep into specific and niche jazz movements, communities, and musicians. It covers a broad time period in a short time successfully. However, within the curriculum, there is extremely minimal mention or discussion of women in jazz. This is an African American Studies course, yet by making the decision to only focus on instrumental jazz, the professor actively cut African American women (who traditionally were pushed away from instrumental jazz and towards vocal jazz instead) out of the picture. In the first half of the semester, the professor successfully created a narrative surrounding each movement\/musician studied that routinely forced students to find the connections and differences between them. In the second half of the semester, this chronological and explicit narrative became much more ambiguous and vague and it was difficult to find cohesion in the course curriculum at times because of this.",

    "if they were interested in the course material",
    "Maybe, but probably not. The material is very, very interesting, but I did not have a good time in the class. The environment was not suited to incentivize anyone to learn the material other than to avoid the wrath of Professor Veal when he berated us for not doing the readings the night before long papers are due. And these papers' prompts are ridiculously vague, not to mention they get released mere days before they are due. I came into this class thinking it would be a fun, sixth class to complement my rigorous, STEM-heavy schedule, but it turned out to be one of the hardest, rigorous, and least satisfying classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes - it was really interesting and insightful and accessible for people at different stages of jazz\/music.",
    "Yes, I think that the topic was very interesting.",
    "Yes! I feel like I can use what I learned in this class to provide a meaningful historical context for various artists and jazz recordings made after 1960. If you're at all interested in musical development over time, this class will illuminate those processes and much more.",
    "Overall, this is a great course and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in jazz, especially if you (like me) aren't already familiar with the more adventurous post-60s movements in the music. Michael Veal is a great professor: he's a super engaging lecturer, his passion for the music is infectious, and his office hours were always helpful and enjoyable. The content of the course was fascinating: the socio-political context was a really productive route into the music, and I learned to appreciate a great deal of music that I would, in all honesty, have skipped over in September. Huge shoutout to Matt for being not only an incredibly thoughtful, intelligent section leader, clearly committed to helping us get the very most out of the course & filling in any blanks left by Prof Veal, but also just a truly lovely person. I would, however, call for future versions of the course to be structured slightly differently. First, I think it would be helpful to have a synthesised narrative arc (or several) running through the course: in the latter half of the semester, I often felt lost \/ didn't know how to relate the content of any two classes one to another. This goes for both socio-political and musical elements: I found that my analyses became less sharp as the semester progressed because of the increasing fragmentation of the course. That might be a product of the increasing fragmentation of the music over time, but it would be helpful to have some more broad, overarching themes to provide some continuity. Second, while Prof Veal is providing some much-needed representation for music that's not often covered in music depts like Yale's, I think there could have been greater thought afforded not just to the role that the jazz canon plays as a counter to the exclusions created by the dominance of Western art music in music studies, but also to the exclusions made in the construction of the jazz canon itself -- a process which is reflected in the syllabi of courses like this. The music of female jazz musicians, for example, was artificially divorced from the rest of the course, and could have been integrated more deeply throughout the syllabus. We got bogged down in discussions over whether there exist essentially feminine \/ masculine musical elements, when it might have been more balanced to consider the socio-political factors that have served to exclude women from jazz or to restrict their roles within it. Equally, in the same way that race informed but did not dominate our discussions throughout the course, gender should be one of many access points to the work of female musicians. As such, I think it would be productive to sometimes discard the lens of gender entirely and subject the music of female musicians to the same rigorous, formalist examinations given to the music of their male counterparts.",
    "Not without some serious restructuring. Essay prompts need to be handed out well in advance of the due date. Readings need to be posted more than a day and a half before class. The grading was meant to be intentionally harsh, almost as if out to prove something, and papers which disagreed with the professor's narrative of jazz history were graded as if they contained false information. There was very little room for personal interpretation of the material. The class was not well-structured to facilitate discussion; it felt like the class was in a constant lecture-vs.-seminar identity crisis.",
    "Yes, as a musician, this course was very interesting, but even someone who does not have a music background could enjoy it and learn a lot because the professor often made it a point to discuss things in regular terms in addition to and instead of musical terms. The music we listened to was always incredibly interesting, and I really enjoyed the discussions on how the political and social ideologies of the time period influenced the music. The papers were a bit intense compared to my other classes, especially since I had never written essays about music before. However, I took this class during the first semester of my first year, so take that as you will. Beyond the papers, the only other assignments were readings, and though they were a bit long, they were manageable.",
    "No. I feel like this course does not know what it wants to be yet. It was in its first semester, so that is understandable. It is slightly unorganized with its subject matter and needs to decide which jazz movement deserves the most attention.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone trying to get into jazz and understand its significance. This course does not require background knowledge. It is eye-opening for me, a self-proclaimed jazz musician, and I'm sure for rookies.",
    "I would recommend another version of this course to another student. The material of the course is very interesting, but the class itself needs some reworking.",
    "You will learn a lot about jazz!",
    "As a former casual musician, I felt that this course was accessible and not excessively based on music theory or esoteric topics. Anybody who has basic music history\/listening experience would be fine and could enjoy this class.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they had a base level knowledge of music theory, jazz history and technique, and enjoyed jazz. Often the professor referenced musicians that would be irrelevant to someone without any knowledge of jazz music. We thoroughly discussed jazz as an African American art form, yet only touched on instrumentalists, so I would not recommend this course to someone who does not enjoy instrumental jazz or who is looking for information about women\/African American women in jazz.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in broadening his or her understanding of jazz and its history.",
    "Yes"
