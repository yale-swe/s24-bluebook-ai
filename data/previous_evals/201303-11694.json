   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who is interested in the history of dance and its place in society. I would NOT, however, recommend it for someone looking for a gut class. It is challenging work that's worth it if you're engaged with the discussion, but it definitely is difficult.",
    "Summary: This is how film grew up, this is how dance grew up, this is where they got tangled and oh my goodness wait what is going on arggggg stahhhpppp eek NEW GENRE DANCEFILM LOOK AT WHERE HE IS NOW.Recommendation: if you love dance, or movement in film, take this. Talk with fellow avid Fred Astaire fans, Bollywood lovers, crump junkies. Get guidance from someone who knows this stuff inside out and still manages to see it differently every single time. Artistic expression will gain some substance in your mind, particularly dancefilm, as an effective method of political manipulation, emotional communication, historical documentation. It's an elegy to the union of body and technology, an accolade of experimentation. Take it take it take it you get to make a movie!",
    "Definitely consider this one when you are looking for freshman seminar, a really good class.",
    "We would watch films\/read texts before class and post discussion questions on the class blog. Classes were all discussions, sometimes we'd watch supplemental films, students made their own presentations throughout the year. 2 long papers but we got more than enough time to complete them, and one final movie project. The combination of dance and film is kind of a niche topic, but I feel like I gained a better understanding of both.",
    "I would highly recommend this class because it's not just limited to talking about dance or film. You engage in discussions about sociology, politics, art, psychology, and philosophy.",
    "I would highly recommend the Dance on Film seminar. Although there is a substantial amount of reading, it is always worth it for the discussions, and the essays and projects are thoughtful and fun. The readings and films for this class are broad and always very interesting. Why wouldn't you want to sit in a circle with your shoes off on the floor of a dance studio with 15 other students that love films and dance, and for an hour, discuss everything from classical ballet on television to the rise of LA krump as documented by a fashion photographer?",
    "This course is great for any student that truly has a deep interest in visual arts. That is to say, any student that loves the arts can enjoy it, but it takes an eye that is great at analyzing images and movements to enjoy and critique the films presented in this course. The writing component of this class is not extensive, but it is important to keep track of all the readings and viewings that you are assigned so the writing comes naturally to you. It also helps to stay very involved in the discussion or you will become lost in thinking of ideas later on. This class is truly for the artistic minds, but I suggest it to anyone that wants to cultivate his or her view of the art of dance.",
    "This is a really great freshman seminar. If you are interested in dance or film (or both obviously) I would highly recommend it. The readings cover a wide variety of scholars, choreographers, and critics and, although they can sometimes seem dense or pedantic, actually offer a really solid background in movement and film theory. The films you watch in the class are beautiful, and itis wonderful to hear Professor Coates talk about them because she has worked personally with many of the choreographers covered in the class. All in all a great experience!",
    "If they are interested in the subject matter, I would definitely recommend the course."
