    "I liked the class and I would recommend it to other students, but I would strongly advise that they hold off taking it until having a much more solid foundation in linguistics and Semitic languages than I had when I started.",
    "Wonderful intro to the Semitic languages. If you're a Linguistics major with some background of a Semitic language as well, definitely take this class. It'll give you hands-on work on real historical linguistics, which is useful to apply to any kind of historical work. The professor teaches at a fast-pace but is very clear and answers questions very thoroughly, so be sure to ask questions if you're confused! There's a lot of data to memorize but because the test questions are given beforehand (you're given some of them on the test and can pick some to answer), it's very fair as you know exactly what to study among the sea of data. Hopefully it won't be at 7:30AM again!!!"

   "comments": [
    "It was extremely helpful in advancing my knowledge of Akkadian and understanding the underlying linguistic principles that had previously been a mystery to me.",
    "As a Linguistics major and a learner of Arabic, I was very interested to both learn about the roots of Arabic as well as learn the techniques required in Historical Linguistics. I will now be able to apply my techniques to the language families I am interested in with more precision as this class offered me good experience."
