    "This course really helped solidify a lot of grammar that I thought I learned in 140. Aside from grammar, the stories and plays that we read in class helped to improve my vocabulary a lot.",

    "This course has a very heavy and consistent workload each week. Because of this, I really did improve my vocab and grammar, but the workload was hard to manage at times. Some weeks we would have grammar work, reading, and a 2 hour movie to watch all for one day. The work was manageable but I had to work pretty hard some weeks to plan ahead.",
    "Strength is that you really do learn a lot. There is a great variety of materials covered, from grammar to literature to film. The only weakness is that the work load is a bit too big."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is serious about improving their French, but I probably wouldn't recommend this class as a fifth class to take just for fun because it really is a significant amount of work.",
    "You learn a lot if you are willing to put in the effort. Would recommend!"
