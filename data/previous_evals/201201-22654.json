    "This class was very similar to Spanish 110, with a greater focus on verb tenses. Otherwise, same format and same level of difficulty relative to the course. We didn't have as many workbook assignments.Great class! Profesora Juliana (Ramos-Ruano) is GREAT! I've had good grad student Spanish teachers too, though, so try to shop sections if possible.",
    "Definitely. The Spanish department is awesome. Juliana is a WONDERFUL professor. She's super encouraging and enthusiastic. She'll make you speak in class and participate, but even if you say something wrong, she'll be really nice about it.",
    "Yes, it is good way to learn the culture and language.",
    "Very well structured, organized, and well taught! I learned a whole lot, and I cannot emphasize how great Prof. Ruano was and how her enthusiastic attitude brightened my morning every weekday! The writing and interactive activities were very fun and the culture aspect of the class was super interesting!",
    "Yes, take this course. It is more difficult than 110, but you will learn Spanish.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. Very useful course.",
    "There is a substantial jump from L1 to L2 in terms of difficulty and time required. Professor Ramos-Ruano is excellent."
