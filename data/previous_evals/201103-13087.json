    "Fantastic professor and fantastic course. However, be prepared to read, and read a lot. Each week, four students write a paper on four different subjects. Then, each student \"presents\" the paper to the class--that is, Kagan asks questions about the student's subject for twenty or thirty minutes. It's intimidating but fun, and an unique format for a seminar. Two pieces of advice. First, be sure you like ancient history. And second, know that your classmates will be an interesting bunch. Kagan's seminars tend to attract a particular demographic, which may turn some people off. Also beware: you'll be taking the class with students who are very familiar with Greek history, some of which have taken Kagan's other seminars before.",
    "If you want to take a course with a legendary professor and you are willing to do the work, you should definitely take this course. I truly enjoyed the opportunity to defend my arguments in class with Professor Kagan's probing questions. Prepare for each class and you'll do well!",
    "YES. Take it. Take it now. There is a lot of reading, but it is amazing. Kagan is splendid.",
    "I could not recommend it more strongly. The structure of the course is unlike any other seminar I've taken - papers are written on a rotating schedule during the term, and each week those who had papers due present them to the class and are \"grilled\" by Kagan, leading into a discussion with the whole class. The system is challenging and forces you to really take command of the week's reading, and the reward is the level of the conversations you are able to have in class. You will never feel like you are making vague generalities or \"bs-ing\" - everything is grounded in specific facts and passages and subject to the sharpest kind of questions. Kagan is not only the leading expert on this topic - he is also an exceptionally talented teacher and great person to work with. He really cares about his students and insists on pushing them hard without ever coming across as stern or judgmental. All his students have a great deal of respect and admiration for him. As for the subject matter, if you like Greek history you will definitely enjoy it. I had never taken a military history class before this and it is definitely something that everyone should do, especially history majors. Even so, you learn about a lot more of Greek civilization that just battlefield tactics and the like.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Professor Kagan is the absolute master of Greek history and the Peloponnesian War. This course will force you to learn the material inside out, and will challenge the way that you think. Professor Kagan leaves no leaf unturned when describing and exploring the events of the war, and is not afraid to tell a student that they are wrong or to push them to delve deeper with their answers and reasoning. In that sense, this class will prepare you for the real world. Beware, there is an immense amount of reading that is easy to follow behind with and nearly impossible to catch up; you have to really love the subject matter. It is somewhat daunting to have a final for 50% of your grade, not having been given letter grades on either of the two papers that precede it. If you're willing to work hard, you can get alot out of this course, but don't take it lightly.",
    "Yes. I took it Cr\/D, and it was a lot of work, but if you are willing to put in a little more time than I did, I think you could still get a lot out of the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Kagan is an amazing professor.",
    "A great course with an amazing professor. Be prepared for a ton of reading. Also, there is a final exam in this course, Professor Kagan does not do a term paper like most junior seminars. But, especially for history majors, it will be foundational for anything you study. Take this class, but don't be prepared for an easy time."
