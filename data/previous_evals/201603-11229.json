   "comments": [
    "As a first year student, taking MATH115 was a good choice. Even though I had taken Calculus BC in high school, I learned a lot in this course.",
    "Calculus skills",
    "I learned quote a bit on different methods of evaluating derivatives and integrals, as well as series, power\/taylor series and polar equations.",
    "In this class I learned better to apply what I knew. I had never taken a class where testing made up so much of my grade, but with this class I did. I learned not just to do psets, but to actually try to learn from them.",
    "I learned different applications of calculus concepts and how to problems solve more efficiently.",
    "Learned integral calculus",
    "Integration, convergence\/divergence of series, using Taylor and McLaurin series in unique ways, general problem solving and study skills, math that will be useful in my other classes",
    "I solidified and developed the calculus knowledge I had before.",
    "I got a lot better at taking derivatives and integrating. I learned a lot about series, and I learned about the applications of integration.",
    "Integration (more fully) Series Differential Eq's Polar functions",
    "Not much that I think would be useful in the real world for just anybody, but as I am interested in a STEM field, I think I learned some useful math skills and about concepts that will definitely show up in classes later on.",
    "This course helped solidify and strengthen my skills in single variable calculus. I believe it will provide me with a very strong mathematical foundation to take more advanced math courses at Yale and will help me in any of my QR and science courses in the future.",
    "I developed better study habits and independence.",
    "Evaluating the correct methodology when approaching a question. For example the series unit was helpful in doing so",
    "Some understanding of convergence and divergence.",
    "A better idea of series in general",
    "I learned how to solve area under a curve problems, volume by rotation, how to check for the convergence of infinite series, and how to use integrals with polar and parametric coordinates.",
    "I learned to think analytically and solve challenging problems.",
    "MATH 115 offered a chance to think more critically about Calculus and to gain deeper understanding of functions that have been introduced to us before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought that learning the material in class was much more helpful than the Coursera videos. Danny did a much better job of explaining the concepts we were learning, and I strongly believe that a more effective course structure would have been to introduce topics in class, and then watch the corresponding video and do the corresponding prep problems afterwards.",
    "I did not like the idea of a flipped classroom and I have learned that it is not the learning style that I work well with.",
    "I liked how there were lots of online resources and teacher resources. The textbook was very helpful and the tests were challenging but fair. Sometimes I felt like I could just skip class and study the book though.",
    "One of the strengths of this course (at least for me) was having a great TA, as Prof. Montealegre went above and beyond to help his sections learn the material.",
    "So the video component of this class wasn't great. Most of the videos shed a little light on the subject, but usually they moved a little too slow. The most irritating part of this course was that Coursera was often down\/difficult to use.",
    "Correspondence with the course head Brett could be improved, I had many unanswered questions for him.",
    "The problem sets were appropriately difficult and working through them (including at office hours) was what helped me learn the most. I did not like the flipped classroom format.",
    "This course has very many options for extra help such as office hours and peer tutors",
    "Danny is gifted with an ability to simplify and explain.",
    "I really liked having the videos to watch before class; this was very helpful because then when I went to lecture I already felt a little bit familiar with the material. I also really liked the pace of the class and I felt the problems sets really reinforced the concepts. The midterms study materials were very helpful. It would be helpful to have better materials to study for the final. For the midterms, we had lots of recent exams with detailed keys to study from, whereas for the final we only had one of these, and the rest of the practice materials were old and the keys did not have worked solutions and often contained mistakes. I appreciated that there were lots of review sessions held, however some of the review sessions were really quite useless as some of the teachers did a poor job of explaining concepts.",
    "The flipped classroom aspect of the course is both the strength and weakness of the course. Watching the videos before each class really helped me grasp the concepts, but sometimes the videos are confusing and not as helpful as they can be. Coursera also had a tendency to not work.",
    "Strengths are that the problem sets are difficult and require one to get engaged. Weaknesses are that coursera videos didn't help much and I didn't feel reversed classroom was that effective.",
    "I like the flipped classroom accountability piece, but it could be improved by making coursera less clunky and easier to input answers",
    "Small size, much support, great teacher Strengths",
    "Coursera was not helpful.",
    "It really all depends on the teacher. If you have a good TA, you will have to work but the course is a breeze. If you don't I've heard its very difficult, even if you have taken BC Calc before, so make sure you get the right teacher for you. The online learning is different for everyone, but again if you have a good TA that you can ask questions in class, its easy to follow.",
    "The course is very strong in presenting new mathematical material in a very linear, logical manner. It does a great job of explaining new concepts to student, through both the online videos on Coursera and the lectures with your instructor. However, I do believe the Coursera videos have some glitches that need to be worked out, as the administrators of the course already know.",
    "Coursera was very hit or miss in terms of whether or not it worked. Also sometimes the videos were confusing, so the flipped classroom aspect was hard to work around when that happened.",
    "The course is conducted using videos which I found hard to be engaged in and didn't always cover the scope of what was seen on the Psets and midterms.",
    "I didn't like how it was a flipped classroom. It's better to do the prep problems after class when you have a better understanding of the material.",
    "Danny is a fabulous teacher. However, I think the math 115 umbrella is a disaster. The videos were not helpful, the pre-class problems were more of a headache than a help. Additionally, the second midterm was much too hard. You gave Danny bad material and he was forced to make do.",
    "The class itself was slightly confusing and the videos were more tedious at times than helpful",
    "The majority of what made the class hard seemed more like simple algebraic gimmicks or tricks where if you were unable to see the specific route the problem required then you simply would not get it correct regardless of whether or not you understood the concepts behind the problem.",
    "I was not a fan of the flipped classroom teaching style. I think I learned much better when Danny explained the topic on the board, whereas the videos did not help a lot, and often made more more confused.",
    "I like that we watch a video before class, but I wish class time was longer and we go over materials\/proofs more in depth.",
    "The course was strong in the area of organization. The order of which subjects were covered (approximation, integration, volume, etc.) made sense and was easy to follow. The flipped classroom experience (videos by Jim Rolf) was very effective in that I was able to learn the material before class and then review during class. The course seemed weak when it came to outside-the-classroom support. While my instructor offered many opportunities to help us at office hours and study sessions, assistance seemed to vary among all 8 sections."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "If a student has solid background knowledge in calculus, I would recommend this course. There is a pset due every week, but the work load is definitely manageable. If you are planning to take this course, it would be helpful to have already had exposure to Calculus BC.",
    "I wouldn't unless you're dead set on a major that requires this class. Not worth the hassle. Just got more tedious as we went along. Midterms and final were sort of frustrating. If you take it, take it with Danny because he's the best. Too bad he never made it into Overheard at Yale. Danny, if you're reading this, I'm gonna miss you :( (but not gonna miss this class)",
    "Only take it with Danny if he is teaching. Really cool guy that taught pretty well. Midterms were fair and the final wasn't terrible but the class is boring.",
    "I would recommend this course because calc is a highly useful subject and the workload was not too much.",
    "Personally, I was not much of a \"math person\" before this class. However, now I really see the beauty of mathematics and gain a great deal of satisfaction from it. Definitely gave me the confidence I need to take 120 next semester.",
    "Yes",
    "Depends what they want to learn! It is a good way to learn this type of calculus, and I think understanding up to this level of calculus will be important in other courses (including for non-STEM majors).",
    "Most certainly. You must take it with Danny. His office hours are excellent and there's a reason why his sections are grossly oversubscribed.",
    "I would recommend this class, but make sure you get a good teacher, like Danny. Also lots of people taking this class, including myself, had taken integral calculus before in high school, which can be frustrating for students that actually had never taken it before.",
    "I would recommend this course to another freshman because it is a good first math course that is not too hard nor easy.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in math then this class is definitely one to take.",
    "I would reccommend the course because it is so introductory. But I would caution the aspirant because I had a lot of difficulty with the second half of the semseter.",
    "Great introductory math course for those who have already taken AB",
    "I would recommend this course if you need to get a math credit out of the way and you are able to find a good TA. The course itself is fine, but I'm not sure how useful the material is in the real world if you aren't going into a STEM field, so if you aren't interested in STEM and just need to fulfill the requirement, maybe take a more interesting class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was challenging yet enjoyable, and the workload was very manageable. Additionally, it provides a great foundation for more advanced math classes moving forward. I would make sure to tell future students to keep up with the coursework, especially the Coursera videos and practice problems, and that will make the class much smoother sailing.",
    "Yes- great way to develop math skills",
    "Yes, but with my specific teacher (Danny Montealegre) because I've heard other grad teachers were not as helpful\/clear or willing to explain things more.",
    "No because of the program. But, Danny was great.",
    "I would not recommend it if it was not necessary for them to take it.",
    "Yes because I think it is an important subject to know, but not because I thought the structure of the class was particularly good.",
    "This is a great course, the videos are helpful and give good preparation for class. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend MATH 115 to all students, especially to those who have been exposed to Calc II before and are not 100% sure they've mastered the material. Again, the flipped classroom style of teaching is done very well (props to Jim Rolf for his videos and Daniel Montealegre for his instruction)."
