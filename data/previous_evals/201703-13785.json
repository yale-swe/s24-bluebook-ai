    "This class advanced my knowledge of sociological theories behind crime and deviance. I developed critical reading skills, writing skills, and presentation skills taking this course.",
    "Critical assessment of policy and ethnography",
    "The course taught me the nuances of neighborhood networks and the complexity of social efficacy. A large initial portion of the course focused on the theory behind neighborhood social structures and disorder which all accumulated at the end with a term paper on my topic of interest.",
    "I learned about sociological theories, methods used by ethnographies, the relationship between race and space and crime, how to conduct a neighborhood case study, and much more. Excellent course."

   "comments": [
    "There were no weaknesses. I enjoyed every moment of this class.",
    "Everything was great.",
    "We spent the final 3-4 weeks reading different books as case studies. During these weeks, I would spend a bit more time applying the relevant theories that we learned in the first part of the semester. I also think we could have worked more on the neighborhood study earlier in the semester it seemed pretty backloaded. I ended up working on my project most during the last week of classes and reading period.",
    "Some key strengths come from the syllabus reading list and the class discussions on the material. Additionally, Professor Papachristos always made himself available to meet even with his ridiculously packed schedule. One weakness in the course was a lack of reinforcement in methodological studies and techniques. This flaw may be left for another course, but it would have helped to have gained some stronger course material for the term paper.",
    "Only strengths: combination of lecture style and discussion, readings fascinating, real world examples discussed in class, grading is fair, one large assignment throughout rather than many individual assignments. Extraordinary feedback from Prof. Papachristos."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, although without Professor Papachristos, I'm not so sure. He is what made this class so special.",
    "Absolutely if you have any interest in crime and neighborhoods.",
    "Unfortunately Professor Papachristos is no longer teaching at Yale but this class was great! I learned exactly what I came for the connection between neighborhoods and crime. Coming into this class, I had heard a lot about terms like \"broken windows theory\" but I wasn't exactly sure why this theory was dangerous or wrong. In just one week, we effectively disproved the broken windows theory and identified a new theory that explained the connection between neighborhood disorder and crime.",
    "This is the best class at Yale. Papachristos is Yale's best professor. Sadly, he is leaving for Northwestern, so he won't teach this class again. However, if this class is ever offered again by anyone, TAKE IT!! It's incredible course material, and you learn so much, and it's so fun.",
    "Yes, amazing stuff!",
    "Absolutely. Not only did I learn about gangs as a cultural phenomenon but I learned the sociological and ethnographic approach to studying crime, the racialization of space, and much more. An amazing class and Professor Papachristos was an amazing professor. Sad he's leaving!"
