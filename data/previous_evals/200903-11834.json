   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. Although it is reading heavy, the material is interesting and Professor Brotherton does a great job of engaging the class and making lectures interesting.",
    "Anthropology 114 was a really interesting course about the relationship between patient and healer in many different cultures. It pointed out the limits of health care systems and posed questions about how to improve global health. I would recommend it to another student because, although there is a lot of reading, the course is very eye opening and gives students a new perspective on health care.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who would be interested in cross-cultural medicine. The class overall is not much work. There is a lot of reading every week which sometimes has to be summarized. We also read 3 books that were analyzed in a 1000 word\/4 page essay each. Professor Brotherton is great and as long as you do the readings and go to lecture you should be fine.",
    "This was a great introductory course to the field of Medical Anthropology, covering a very interesting variety of topics and case studies. This course was an eye-opener to some of the most pertinent and pressing topics of our current times. I recommend it to every student.",
    "This class is very interesting and easy. I would recommend it to anyone, even students who are not pre-med.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course, hard grading. You only need to read the material and not go to the lectures.",
    "easy good grade",
    "If you are genuinely interested in the material, you will LOVE this course. It can be hit or miss.",
    "It's an interesting class. It isn't too much work either.",
    "Great course, very relaxing, lectures are never longer than 45 minutes, article readings are pretty much covered in class so never truly necessary to read unless its assigned to you in section. Reading the books would be helpful for essay composition, but not completely necessary either, overall a very interesting course with engaging thought provoking material with a doable workload.",
    "It is a good introduction to the field of medical anthropology. However, if you find anthropological methods frustrating, take a sociology course.",
    "This is a great course. Definitely not a gut-- a hundred pages of reading per week-- but totally worthwhile. Will allow you to think about medicine in a new way.",
    "take this class. it helps put medicine into a cultural perspective which is very relevant for pre-meds especially. short papers, easy midterm, very engaging professor",
    "Interesting introduction to medical anthropology and to public health. Class forces you to think critically about the biomedical institution. Interesting class, lectures are always posted online, there's a lot of reading.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Slightly dry material at times, but enjoyable nonetheless. Lectures were good if I went, but I never felt like I missed anything if I didn't go.",
    "Be prepared for a class with a heavy workload. The course itself has some interesting topics and is not too difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "It was a good intro anthro course.",
    "Great introduction to the fascinating field of medical anthropology. Professor Brotherton is knowledgeable and fun to listen to in lectures. The lectures themselves are informative and well-structured. It's a broad survey course and covers a lot of topics. It's a lot of work, if you choose to do all the readings-- 4 books whole semester, + 2-3 articles before each class period. I would definitely recommend this class, even if you're not big on anthro; it's definitely one of the most interesting I've taken, and has changed the way I think about health care and medicine.",
    "It's a good class. The set-up is nice (at least it was this year) with mostly take-home exams. The reading was interesting, and lectures always ended after 50 minutes (even though it was a 75 minute class).",
    "Take this class. You'll learn a lot and probably do well. Professor Brotherton is excellent -- just beware it's a lot of reading.",
    "Interesting material for a pre-med student. The exams were fair and I learned a lot about public health.",
    "If you like anthropology take this course. If you don't like sitting around listening to a bunch of freshmen talk about theoretical nothingness and whether or not medicine is real then don't. But if you're looking for an easy class take it. There are 2 short papers, a super easy midterm, and a take-home final. Class attendance and doing the readings are not necessary.",
    "An interesting class for pre-meds, you have to read the books to do well. Some of the readings are very interesting, but they can be excessive. I would take it as a 4th or 5th class, but only if you have time to read the books.",
    "Anthropology 114 is an interesting class that simultaneously won't kill you with coursework; after the midterm, you essentially don't have to do any of the reading. Make sure to keep up with the books and at least the first half of the articles for the midterm.I'd recommend the class. It's not horribly difficult, and it has moments where it's really interesting.",
    "Yes, very interesting, helps you understand health and international perspective towards health. Good for anyone who wants to be a doctor, go into public health, or politics.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in medicine or have not done a lot of anthropology. I don't think it goes into enough depth for those who are already familiar with the subject, but it was really interesting for me as someone who does not plan to go into the major and I really enjoyed professor brotherton.",
    "This was a great course. It is also a nice introduction to a more contemporary form of anthropology than is the stereotype. It provides a useful lens for analyzing individual health practices, public health policies, and the interrelationships of global trends and local health. You should take this course if you are interested in public health, understanding alternate systems of healing, or an anthropological view of health. There is a lot of reading, but the papers are short and the class as a whole manageable.",
    "Take it! Even if not pre-med, the subject material is interesting and the workload is manageable.",
    "This class mainly deals with medicine through cultural lenses, all the while questioning what exactly that means. I would highly recommend this class to another student, because it brings up interesting issues that I would not have considered otherwise. It certainly gives you something to think about!",
    "Until it undergoes some deep changes, I would not recommend Anthro 114 to another student. Medical Anthropology is itself a vastly important and interesting issue in the world, and a class about it has the potential to broaden our conceptions of other cultures, complicating factors in global health and development, and indeed our understanding of our own bodies. At this point, however, unless you commit to diving deep into the readings and committing time to thinking critically on your own, this class will not encourage you to gain this type of understanding. Instead, I felt often that I was in a high school class, being presented with a plate full of facts which I was supposed to internalize, rather than thinking and generating understanding about the world. It is especially frustrating that the facts that we are being handed are \"facts\" like, \"X health system is based on racism\" or \"With Y practice, Western doctors are imposing colonialism on the bodies of people in developing communities.\" Intriguing and bold issues to discuss, but the problem was we were not asked to discuss them; we were asked to answer true or false questions about them.",
    "good class",
    "It is an incredibly interesting class with a more than normal work load. The readings usually take up most of my time outside of class, yet I usually enjoy reading them. Section is incredibly helpful to clarify points discussed in lectures.",
    "Yes- Two papers, a midterm, and a seven-eight page take home final. The readings are a lot and you could get lost in procrastination, but you will learn a lot. It's a great course",
    "It's a good intro course, because a broad range of topics are covered. I would recommend it because Brotherton is a good lecturer, and a number of important, relevant topics are covered.",
    "YES! It was a great course and had a very interesting topic.",
    "Cool class, helpful if you're interested in learning more about the medical field from an anthropological point of view. Some of the readings are more interesting than others - the Fadiman book is great! The professor is super awesome too.",
    "I would recommend this course because I learned a lot about medical anthropology and I found the readings and lectures to be interesting and informative.",
    "If you're looking for a class with easy material, this is great, but the grading is not as easy as people say. The midterm was nice and went over good information. The following papers tended to be dry and tedious, the prompts were not always well written, or expected more questions to be answered than space was allowed. The discussion section was for the most part, unhelpful. This is one of those classes where you can either go to lecture or do the reading, doing both can get redundant. Professor Brotherton was enthusiastic and engaging, which made class fun. But most of the reading, especially the books, were unnecessarily long and boring. The first book, by Anne Fadiman, was great, it definitely hooks you into the class during shopping period. Unfortunately the rest of the reading gets really dull.",
    "Yes, for an introduction to the study of anthro and for a class similar to HSHM but outside the major.",
    "Introduction to Medical Anthropology is a course that will keep you on your toes. With the multiple pages of reading to do, unfamiliar vocabulary to learn as well as interesting topics to discuss, this course certainly challenged my time management skills, analytical, writing and memorization skills. It helps one to study public health through social,economical, physical, and political lens. I would recommend this course because it helps one understand the contemporary issues like HIVS, poverty, health and wellness, the biomedical model, other forms of alternative therapies, drug ads, etc.",
    "It's easier than most classes, but I wouldn't call it a gut class. Really interesting material and a must for any pre-med student.",
    "If you're interested in anthropology, human rights, medicine, or international development, I definitely recommend this course. It was one of the few courses I've taken that has prompted me to look at the subject matter in a new way. There is a fair amount of reading for each lecture, but the articles and books are interesting as a whole. A warning, however, that if you're not interested in the subject matter the course can get repetitive quickly.",
    "Yes. It was a fabulous intro course that talked about the various issues of and surrounding medical anthropology.",
    "The professor is really engaging and wants everyone to do well. The course dives into more of the specific religious\/medical practices of different cultures\/countries than I particularly cared to know. I would have preferred a closer focus on current public health issues (which you get in the second half of the course). You'll read some very interesting books and although there are a lot of articles you can by on skimming. Overall I would recommend it!",
    "A class about different medical systems and problems that arise. It is very interesting and definitely worth taking, mostly for the readings though, which are very interesting. The lecture is a little boring and not really necessary to attend, but the section has great discussion and debate. This class has given me great perspective.",
    "Recommend the class. Student must be aware that a lot of reading is required for this class.",
    "It's a pretty interesting class in a topic you probably would never learn about otherwise. It's packed full of pre-meds but I think that this lends it an interesting sort of vibe. It's difficult to be cut-throat in a field with no answers and so it's a great place to be able to just have ideas and express them. This class changed the way I look at medicine, health, and medical treatment. It did stray into the frustratingly academic but I think what I gained from the course\u0097a new body of knowledge, new perspectives on healthcare\u0097outweighed those annoyances.",
    "Super interesting, just take a look at the syllabus and you'll see. Sometimes the reading gets to be a bit much, but the most frustrating part is that there's never enough time to read it all and it's all so fascinating. Prof Brotherton is AWESOME, so passionate and knowledgable. TAKE IT!",
    "I would recommend this class. It was interesting, not that hard and overall worth it!",
    "pretty easy class with not a lot of work, going to lectures is not necessary, but all the papers are on assigned books so you kind of have to do the readings.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in anthropology, medicine, or public health ... Professor Brotherton is an awesome lecturer and presents a lot of interesting material throughout the semester. His Powerpoints are easy to follow and he always ends class at least 15 minutes early. The workload is manageable, but this class is NOT a gut. The articles and books are pretty dense and there is overall a lot of a reading (if you do it all). However, it's well worth the effort because everything fits together - the articles are especially helpful when it comes to writing the assignments. There's a midterm, two 1000-word assignments, and a take home final ... not too bad! Overall, it's an interesting and manageable class.",
    "Good class. More reading than possible, but overall not very hard and really interesting. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in anthropology. I would also recommend this course to anyone interested in entering a health profession (premeds!). There is, however, a tremendous amount of reading for this course. If you have no problem with that, then take the course.",
    "Med Anthro is a course that covers the hegemony of biomedicine, alternative medicines, medicalized bodies, and global health. I found all topics to be interesting, although not espeically well connected from one to the next. I would recommend the course to other students, especially ifthey are interested in medicine, social work, or global health.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "Yes I would recommend taking this class. It's definitely an easy A if you put in the work for it. (Not alot) Also the material was very interesting and I now can hold conversations in various fields of medical anthropology. It has also sparked an interest in Public Health.",
    "ANTH 114 is a nice, relatively low stress class for a social science credit (especially if you're someone like a pre-med who needs those So credits). It is an interesting way to take a look at culture and medicine, such as in the section of the course where you look at different medical systems. Do the readings, most of which are pretty good anyway. For the books, you'll end up going over most of them in section, which can definitely help for the essays. Even with the readings, the workload isn't bad, and this class isn't terribly difficult."
