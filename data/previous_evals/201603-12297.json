    "I think the concept of professional seminar is helpful, but some of the topics that are covered are not relevant to graduate students at all levels. For example, covering \"how to write a paper\" is much more relevant for a first year graduate student than a 5th or 6th year. In lieu of topics like this, I would suggest that the time could be used for the students to pair up in small groups of 2 or 3-- older graduate students with younger ones -- for a mini mentoring session. (I am not suggesting this for all days, but some of them.) The students could be given discussion questions on topics like writing papers or designing professional websites, but they could also be allowed to branch out into other topics of their choosing. I think this would provide a formal opportunity for older grad students to advise the newer ones on their concerns. Also, I think the length of the meeting time is a bit long, and maybe some days wouldn't require as long of a time. I enjoyed and benefitted from the scientific presentation mini-workshop at the end of the semester."
