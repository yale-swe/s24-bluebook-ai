    "AN INCREDIBLE COURSE!!!! TAKE IT!",
    "This is a thoroughly broad overview of theater history from the early 1900's through today. You will get as much out of it as you put in, so I recommend listening to everything, reading everything, and participating with genuine thought. By doing this, you will create a personal perspective on theater over time, which will help solidify where you think it should go in the future.",
    "This is a wonderful survey of the musical theater tradition, which will equip you with the skills to evaluate contemporary and historical works. It absolutely has a distinct viewpoint (don't expect to come away thinking that \"Hairspray\" is a good piece of musical theater), but if you appreciate musicals then you should enjoy it. Be forewarned, though: you will never know what Dan wants or expects of you. He doesn't clearly establish expectations and your grades are completely arbitrary as a result. He also doesn't read rough drafts, which is ridiculous when he simultaneously maintains such high standards for writing.",
    "This is quite simply a phenomenal class. If you're familiar with musical theater and have always wanted to take an academic and rigorous deep dive into American theater over time, this is for you. The readings, assignments and seminar discussions are crafted such that each week we're \"playing the game\" together, critically examining elements of this country's most beloved musicals - looking at music, text, critical reception, engagement with the cultural era, genre, compositional style, revivability - and so much more. Every week we'd be assigned to watch or listen to 2-3 musicals in addition to pertinent relevant readings. I eagerly looked forward to \"doing my homework\" for this class - and therefore the 2 hours of seminar discussion always flew by. Dan Egan is a phenomenal professor, and he compiles a fabulous combination of undergrads that can bring different theatrical perspectives to the conversation each week. Highly, highly recommended.",
    "This class is great if you are at all interested in musical theater. Course work consists of listening to 2-3 shows and readings each week, and classes are a combination of discussion and lecture which is fun and fascinating.",
    "This class is amazing! I felt like I knew a fair amount about musical theater history before I took the class, but I learned so much more than I expected and look at theater in a totally different way now. Dan leads wonderful conversations, and while he's tough on your writing it's always fair and his comments are useful. Definitely take this class!!",
    "It's a comprehensive course on the developments of Musical Theater in America! What's not to love?? Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you have any interest whatsoever in musical theater, or theater in general, or music in general. Dan is an incredible professor and really cares about the material and his students. Even though you can't get to everything in musical theater history (you'd need many more courses for that) you get a wonderful overview.",
    "I would recommend Musical Theater History to another student, particularly one unfamiliar with musical theater. For the theater nerds, this class is great because you get to revel in your knowledge that you previously thought was not academic. But for the casual musical theater fan, or for those who claim musical theater is dead, this class is informative and interesting.",
    "If you are a lover\/consumer\/producer of musical theater, then you will love this class! Professor Egan is a wonderful and caring professor -- you will have the opportunity to build a relationship with him over the course of the professor and be welcomed into the fold of students with whom he frequently engages through the Shen Curriculum for Musical Theater. The course moves pretty fast, and you won't necessarily get to listen to\/talk about all of your favorite musicals, but you'll have quite a repertoire of shows under your belt by the end of the semester. Most everyone in the class already had a substantial exposure to the genre of musical theater going in, so I sometimes felt a bit left behind\/left out in my relative lack of knowledge. But Professor Egan did a great job at getting everyone to contribute in class, emphasizing that with human media like musical theater, everyone's voice is important.",
    "A must take if you enjoy musical theatre or, more broadly, thinking dramatically.",
    "TAKE IT (if you can get in). it's such a good class. The material was fascinating and fun (i mean, COME ON, our homework is to do like 3-5 relevant readings and listen to MUSICALS), and Dan Egan is a wonderful professor. Discussions were lively and informative and Julie Andrews made several cameos."
