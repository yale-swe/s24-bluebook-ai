    "Yes, this is one of my favorite classes at Yale. The reading was fascinating so you want to do all of it and there is a very reasonable amount so it's not too overwhelming.",
    "An introduction to the economics of a really interesting subject, addiction and government policy towards drugs. Highly recommended.",
    "This is a great econ seminar. You get to apply many of the concepts you learn in basic econ lectures to the problem of drugs and addiction in order to develop thoughtful public health policies. I really appreciated that Prof. Sindelar provided us with much information about the topic and also made us go back to basics through problem sets in order to better understand the problem of drugs and ways to address it. I really enjoyed learning about the topic in an objective and analytic way, especially when the topic is such a controversial and confusing issue.Prof. Sindelar is a great professor, very thoughtful and helpful and engaging. She was always willing to meet with the students and help us out.The only bad thing is that there were too many people in the class so it was difficult to have good discussions that were not structured through debates. I would have rather have a smaller class and have better discussions.",
    "Yes. The course is interesting, and the discussions are informative. Prof. Sindelar is lenient and fair.",
    "A good course if you are really interested in this material, as I am. If you're not, there may be more engaging seminars.",
    "Yes -- fun class that applies some econ to public health."
