    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about Israel as a society rather than it's place in the world as a whole. The course has interesting readings and documentaries with class discussions that wonderfully articulate key themes within the society.",
    "If you're interested in learning more about Israel, I would definitely recommend the course. The readings were always reasonable and enjoyable. Additionally, Dr. Roginsky is a fantastic instructor: she made every class extremely engaging. Overall, the class is a lot of fun and a terrific experience.",
    "Yes! Great class!"
