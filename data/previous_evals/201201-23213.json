   "comments": [
    "The course begins with a covering of tensor calculus and manifold theory (also a very silly, unrelated digression into Newton-Cartan Theory which isn't necessary or useful for anything else). Then it covers the basic Field Equations, the ADM formalism, Stellar Models, cool black holes (rotating and charged), cosmology, and gravitational waves. There are approximately weekly problem sets which were reasonable, and two take home midterms which were challenging but fun.General Relativity is a crucial tool for understanding modern Cosmology and much of theoretical physics. Whether this is a good course for covering it is questionable. People coming from an astronomy perspective would probably get a lot more out of ASTR\/PHYS 600 than this course. The course as a whole is very interesting though for people who are interested in mathematical formalism and cool black hole physics.",
    "Definitely, it is one of the most interesting things you will ever learn.",
    "Pretty good class. Take it if you want to learn about general relativity.",
    "recommand",
    "Physics 538 is a great course. You will cover a lot of material, but the workload is manageable and the material is really rewarding."
