    "Concept of course is interesting. Course itself was very disorganized - problem sets were posted late, pushed back, and on occasion canceled. Requirements and deadlines for the final project were slim-to-none. Far more stressful than necessary.",
    "It does a good job covering the material. It doesn't go much further or to more advanced math.",
    "This course wasn't structured particularly well, in that I don't feel like I gain a coherent set of knowledge from the topics we covered. That being said, Magee is leaving so this course will be structured differently in the future.",
    "The focal point of this class was the professor's incompetence, but since he is leaving Yale, I cannot offer useful advice regarding whether the course will work for you."

    "Not clear to me that the course is consistent across professors. Can't give any information on what this course will be like in the future.",
    "This class covers introductory number theory. If you've taken 350, you have more than enough background. It probably depend a bit on who's teaching it, but it was fairly easy as a math course, not covering especially advanced or abstract material, and is not too much work.",
    "Yes, though it's hard to say what this course will look like because Magee is leaving.",
    "Professor Magee is condescending and crass. He asks questions of the class and then gets frenetically frustrated when he receives answers. He will get angry at the class when he is simply lecturing and not interacting with the class in any way, let alone in any way that could justify anger. He took the class at a pace suitable for the top three students in the class and was unapologetic in his hospitable treatment of the rest. He is the worst professor I have ever witnessed, although I and many others in the class who have been in other classes and seminars led by him can confirm that this is somehow an improvement. When approaching a mathematical problem, in particular a proof, professor Magee will not understand why people do not see his goal or logic. He is as of yet incapable of seeing the problem from the perspective of the student who is unaware of the \"answer.\" He is pedagogically ignorant. Additionally, when students offer alternate intuitive thinking to help confused students understand a particular result, he has been known to viciously shut down their thinking as \"the wrong way to think of it,\" which I can confirm is incorrect in every instance I have witnessed. In each case, the professor's logic helps no-one, and the student's is the correct path to grapple with the concepts for the first time. He needs to film his lectures and study them personally in comparison with other lectures. Professor Magee is very smart, to his credit, but likes making the class aware of that in a manner that is not beneficial to the student. If he teaches it again, do not take the course."
