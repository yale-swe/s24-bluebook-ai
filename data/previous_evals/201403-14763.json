    "Nice course to work on your own research project under a professor.",
    "EENG 235 is an excellent way to get your hands dirty in some field of electrical engineering or computer science that youve always been curious about but never had the time for. It is also a great way to get to better know the faculty and the work theyre interested in. Though Ive had a number of research experiences on campus (some paid, others not), I have to say that EENG 235 was the most professional and productive of these experiences, and I would definitely recommend the class to anyone who is looking for a different spin on the same old pattern of psets and tests in most other technical classes."
