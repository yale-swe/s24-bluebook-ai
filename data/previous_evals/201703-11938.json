    "Good insight and conceptual basis for classical mechanics and thermodynamics.",
    "I learned about Lagrangian and Hamiltonians, which are interesting and useful tools. I also learned a lot more about relativity.",
    "I developed knowledge of Newtonian, Lagrangiaj, and Hamiltonian mechanics in addition to Special Relativity and Thermodynamics.",

    "Lectures were clear and accompanying textbook matched lectures almost exactly. Office hours and study halls helped solidify content.",
    "Professor was very engaging, which made the class very interesting. Material is basically a glorified version of 200, but still very interesting. Section was unhelpful.",
    "I thought the course was taught in an extremely interesting way, and that there was a well-implemented support system. All in all, a very good course.",
    "Very good course BECAUSE of the professor!!!",
    "The class is well organized, a comprehensive course on Mechanics concepts, and the course prepares you well for the tests.",
    "The course is well-structured and well-taught. The study halls were also helpful.",
    "Very little feedback is given. Psets are never discussed after their return.",
    "Professor Shankar was a real joy to have in the classroom."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great class. I skipped the prerequisites and it was a perfectly manageable introduction to physics. I don't think this is as rigorous an introduction to mechanics as 410. Shankar gives the intuition behind things and gives a rough outline of the mathematics behind it. The class focuses on core concepts and the problem sets reflect it (they are not unnecessarily tedious). Take this with Shankar! He is amazing and enjoys explaining things to you.",
    "Would highly recommend to any STEM students looking for a basic run through of classical mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics (and a bit of stat mech).",
    "Yes, you learn advanced physics under the eye of a caring professor.",
    "Take it if you're not a big physics person but really like math.",
    "I would recommend this course if and only if it is still taught by Prof. Shankar.",
    "If Professor Shankar is teaching this course, I would absolutely recommend it. He is very clear in his teaching and an excellent lecturer. The way he introduces new topics is natural and intuitive. The course helps you get into how certain Physics concepts came about as well as calculations and applications of the results.",
    "yes! definitely",
    "A fantastic class that exposes you to some really interesting and useful ways to think about physics. Prof Shankars great! He makes the material accessible, and is also very willing to explain difficult concepts again if you ask questions. Some parts were hard to wrap my mind around, but it was a satisfying and enjoyable experience.",
    "Only to a student who needs his Physics requirement for a non-Physics major.",
    "I'd recommend it if a student were looking for somewhat of a survey course in physics. If that's the case, it was a great class."
