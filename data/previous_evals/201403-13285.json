    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn a fun, new language with little pressure. The workload is very reasonable and it makes a good fifth class, as long as you don't mind that it meets every day.",
    "IF you want to learn an East Asian language, Korean would make a great choice. With its simple alphabet and phenomenal professors, KREN 110 makes learning a possibly intimidating task casual and enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. The workload is about the same as any other beginner language class but it was definitely doable. The small structure of the class was also helpful.",
    "good class, more time-consuming than expected.",
    "Absolutely. It's a very fun course!"
