    "A must take. If you have any true interest in the theater as a career, either in creation or performance, you do yourself a great disservice not to take this course.",
    "If you are at all interested in theater you must take this class!",
    "Take it. You will be a better theater maker from taking it even if you dont like this type of theater. Robinson will help you think about theater in new and interesting ways.",
    "It is an overview of experimental theatre in America from the mid 1900s to now. It is a weekly seminar and screening. The work is alot, but if you're interested in this stuff it's great.",
    "Take this class if and only if you're extremely interested in the subject matter. Prof. Robinson is great and the workload is not overwhelming, but it's really all about the level of interest you bring. If experimental theater really gets ya goin, you're gonna love this-- honestly. If not, you'll probably find yourself sitting through the middle of a Foreman video or an early Mabou Mines video recording praying silently for death.",
    "The class is really designed for experimental theater lovers that are incredibly open-minded. It's likely to be self-selecting. I might recommend it to one friend, but not another."
