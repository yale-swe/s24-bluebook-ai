   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you're genuinely interested in the details of agriculture. I think this class has good intentions and will improve its second time around, but be sure you're comfortable with ambiguous discussions that often don't lead to concrete solutions. This was something I knew several of my fellow students were frustrated by. However, getting the chance to learn from Mark, visiting the Farm a few times, and being able to really pursue our passions for the final project were highlights of the class and I am still glad I was able to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. I am pretty sure that Mark Bomford will be offering another class next year, but I do not know if it will be this one. I hope that he offers a lecture class next year, because there was great interest in this course and many people were turned away. Since this was his first class at Yale, the course was a little bit of a work in progress and I think that the next class he teaches will likely have worked out these kinks. I learned a lot in this class and Mark was a great lecturer. I wish the discussions had been more structured at times because I felt like we kept circling back to the same big questions that we just couldn't answer. The reading load was on the heavy side.",
    "Take this class if you are passionate about issues in the food system. Our main themes were local, organic, urban and food sovereignty. This class is mostly discussion-based, but we got to go to the farm three times! A lot of reading, but it's interesting. 50% of your grade is based on your final project.",
    "Take this class if you really want to probe at the food system in a thoughtful and engaging way. Honestly, the best part of this class is Mark, the professor. If this seminar is turned into a lecture there really is no reason not to take it. The only frustration for me was a sense of redundancy during student discussion periods.",
    "This seminar was great--work heavy near the end. The reading are dense and you'll want to do them thoughtfully. The course is really fun and interesting. It helped me stop thinking in binaries about food issues.",
    "Interesting class on food. Not for beginners. If you take it without background knowledge or experience, you may feel lost or not get references that Bomford uses. Takes apart various food movements and makes you see that nothing is simple or easy.",
    "CSPC 300 is a class about food systems. It's a class about problems, about ideas, and about solutions. Mark Bomford does a tremendous job with his presentations, and the class discussions that follow are always invigorating. Definitely take this class if you can! Hopefully it will inspire more food studies related classes at Yale!",
    "This course is for students who not only are interested in engaging with the thorny, often ethically challenging topics pertaining to the study of food and agriculture, but also those who are WILLING to. As Mark said in one of the earlier classes of the semester, \"Studying food and agriculture is depressing...there is no clear answer to the problems we are facing within our food systems.\" The reality of this statement proved to be quite true through the semester, as we discussed the various problems and challenges facing our world's food systems. So, be prepared to critically grapple with some tough questions! Also, be prepared to be in a classroom with people who may have radically different ideas of what you have of the food system and our role in it. It's important to have an open mind when taking this course!",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone and everyone. Understanding the food system is necessary for anyone living in this day and age, and the class can definitely provide such an understanding. Many people in the class didn't have a background in the subject and came out able to intelligently talk and think about what's going on in the world of sustainable food. The class did an especially good job addressing myths of the food system and oversimplification thats people make when discussing food. Overall, fantastic class.",
    "You explore food systems through modules of local, organic, food sovereignty, and urban agriculture. Classes are led by students who summarize readings and provide discussion questions. There is a large final project and reflective reviews of the readings are due throughout the semester. Participation on classesV2 forum was also very emphasized.",
    "A really interesting look at the challenges facing sustainable agriculture today. Most of the other students were in some way related to the YSFP, and they're all incredibly knowledgable about the subject. This, at times, made the course a little less accessible for the people who didn't know as much about food already, but Mark does his best to make the material accessible for everyone. There is a lot of reading, a presentation, and a final paper, all of which are pretty manageable.",
    "It's a good course that I think would only get better. Mark is fantastic, and I'd highly recommend taking courses with him whenever offered (especially lectures, he's an amazing speaker). This course had some growing pains, but was still a great course to engage with sustainable food issues. This go around, the course was focused on cricking popular conceptions of food sustainability: food miles, organic, local food, urban agriculture. The workload was average: weekly readings, occasional responses, and a big final paper\/project.",
    "Take this unique course, if it is offered again. Mark Bomford is an amazing individual with a warm yet sharp-minded teaching style. The lessons are enlightening, bringing you perspectives on the food system that you likely aren't familiar with.",
    "This is a class about measuring - what we should measure, how we should measure it, and why - as applied to the sustainability of the food system. If that sounds appealing to you, take it! Also, you need to be comfortable with not arriving at \"the answer\" by the end of the semester (because there isn't one...). This is an extremely informative class with a dynamic teacher focused on an extraordinarily important issue."
