   "comments": [
    "A valuable subject to understand, but Perdue's class was a less than thrilling way to learn about it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. The most I learnt from this course is through Taisu's section not Perdue's lecture.",
    "Yes take it, even if not with Spence",
    "You will need to do a lot of independent studying in order to take advantage and truly grasp what is taught. That being said, if you take the time to learn the basics, that course is enthralling. You can get by happily without doing this, but it would be a much more valuable class if you go into it with a basic but solid understanding of the chronology and implications of major CHinese events of the period.",
    "The course was a good survey of modern China from the fall of the Ming Dynasty in the 1600s to the early 1970s.Strengths: The course covers a lot of material, and gives the student a very good overview of the most important facts of Chinese history. It gives the student a good historical background for further study in other fields (such as literature).Weaknesses: The readings were only somewhat related to lectures, or only focused on a few aspects of that week's lecture. And there was no textbook for the period after 1911. For a survey course, much of the reading consisted of primary documents. And section for me anyway focused a lot on close reading of those primary documents. I would have rather had in a survey course someone just tell me these are the historical facts of what happened in the period. Seminars are the proper venue for going in depth and figuring out nuanced motivations and reasons for events. In lectures, I expect someone to give me the popularly accepted version of what happened.The class before and after 1911, also did not cohere very well. They were two very separate periods. Once we got to the Revolution of 1911, anything before that period never seemed to show up again. This is not necessarily a weakness, as it is a survey course, but it just seemed strange that I could have started showing up and doing the readings at the start of the Revolutionary period and have been totally fine for the 2nd half of the course.",
    "A very interesting course with very pertinent information. Although the lectures can be a little monotonous, the reading is really engaging, if not always necessaryily related to what is eventually on the tests.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who has an interest in China. However, I would make a note that Professor Perdue is an extremely dry lecturer and highly unengaging.",
    "Take this course if you know nothing about China and would like to learn. It is very informative and you will leave the course feeling a little better about how much you know about an influential nation.",
    "Relatively dry class that gives an overall history of China from 1600 to the present. Don't take it if you're looking for excitement or engaging lectures, because they're really nowhere to be found here. Take it if you're interested in Chinese history and\/or you've got that 3 credit world history requirement that you have to fulfill.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking for a relatively easy course as a history major in the category of \"Rest of the World.\"",
    "I would recommend the class as a great combo: an easy history lecture with interesting reading material.",
    "I learned a lot of interesting things about the Qing dynasty era. The lectures were sometimes disorganized or very very sparse. I recommend shopping the course next year to see if the instruction is improved.",
    "Don't bother. If you heard of Jonathon Spence's amazing, legendary History of Modern China course, this is not it. You will be disappointed. This guy makes you lose faith in Chinese historiography. Very accomplished man in terms of field research and published books, but terrible lecturer and professor. The assignments and lectures are a waste of your life.",
    "Take the class on the merits of the subject, which is vastly important to understanding the China of today, rather than on the strength of the teaching and reading. Prof. Perdue is knowledgeable but his lecture delivery isn't phenomenal.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class. While Prof.Perdue is a wonderful person, he's not so great at giving lectures. His lectures are hard to follow, and disconnected. He likes to use confusing historians' big words, and read many quotes off other people's books. If you are interested in the material, I recommend reading it in your spare time.",
    "Yes. It is an interesting course covering a long period of history of China. You can't expect it to give much details, though. But if you want to know something, this is certainly one of the places to start.",
    "The course was overall good. I learned a lot about China, which is important because even as a history major I had only ever known about the recent era of Chinese Communism, not much of the backstory and the huge themes running throughout Chinese history. Perdue is a rather dry lecturer; he's endearingly enthusiastic about the subject, but presents boring lectures with utterly unhelpful powerpoints. The readings are very good; there are too many and some are unnecessary, but the central textbooks provide an excellent and clear overview of the history.",
    "Good course. Professor Perdue is nice but not a great lecturer. The TA's in this class really make or break the class, Taisu, i hear, is the best. The books for the class are very interesting and was the main method of learning for me.",
    "Don't take it. Just don't.This class supposedly used to be good with Spence taught it. But Perdue is an absolutely terrible lecturer who made the course completely uninteresting and irrelevant. His lectures don't talk about any of the important things, he's not helpful, and the essay prompts are just flat out stupid.There are better ways to meet your History\/East Asian Studies requirements, trust me. Even after attending lecture, going to sections, and reading the assigned material (which by the way is equally useless) I still felt like I had learned nothing about the history.",
    "I learned the basic history of China, but the class overall was mediocre. Perdue was not very organized, and his powerpoints were often useless.",
    "A solid survey of the past 400 years of Chinese history. Lacks some unifying structure - the only 'textbook' is pretty dry and reaches the end of its scope at the end of the early 20th century. However, readings in the form of source materials (mostly drawing on Spence's sourcebook) are excellent by and large if you really spend some time with them, as are all four assessments (especially the two papers).Peter is pretty dry and his lectures very scattered, so if at all humanly possible get into one of Taisu's sections to compensate.Try not to be put off by Perdue's lectures; take this course!",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it for a comprehensive overview of China. Professor Perdue is an okay lecturer, but the coursework is very reasonable. 2 short papers, 1 midterm, and 1 final. What is on the midterm and final is very clearly given to you, so it was just a matter of studying the material. Take this course if you are interested in knowing about the history of China; otherwise, you might find it tedious.",
    "If you are interested in Chinese history, I would recommend the class. If not, it was not engaging enough to be worth it.",
    "Interesting material sometimes plagued by boring delivery.",
    "If you are interested in learning more about China, then History 316 is the perfect class. The work-load is manageable (2 essays and a midterm) and the reading is sizable but it is all interesting.",
    "Absolutely! It's a really well-taught class with a great professor.",
    "Subject material fascinating, especially for an American like me with minimal prior knowledge about Chinese history.The lectures were somewhat poorly organized.It was hard for me to keep track of the Chinese names.",
    "This course gives a general history of China from the late Ming to about 1990. It's a decent survey course if you don't know much about modern Chinese history, but it doesn't go into depth on any particular topic in Chinese history. Too much time spent on the beginning on the Ming Dynasty, and I felt that a lot of important events and people in the 20th century were glossed over. Professor Perdue isn't the most engaging lecturer either; there wasn't much continuity to the lectures. Not much work at all--just two papers, a midterm, and a final. Not sure how the curve will be. Also, Taisu is a great TA.",
    "The class covers the history of China from around 1600 to the 1990s. Comprehensive overview of significant historical events and people. Very interesting material for anyone interested in China, Asia, and\/or modern history."
