   "comments": [
    "I came into the class knowing very little about climate change policy and with the goal to be able to enter into conversations about the issue. By taking this course, I have developed such abilities and feel more engaged with international climate change policy.",
    "Understanding of some of the major climate milestones in the US and internationally, and lots of Esty's background.",
    "I gained knowledge about the US and the global climate policy regime, and skills on policy-memo writing.",
    "I really learned a lot about trade during the course. I also loved Professor Esty's stories from his experiences in the field.",
    "It was really interesting to hear Professor Esty's perspective. I appreciated the range of topics he covered and thought they were well-selected. Some topics offered a nice review with differing insights. I liked the process of writing the policy memos. I found it to be a useful skill and still challenging!",
    "I gained policy memo writing skills in addition to a vast depth of knowledge on various climate change policy issues from the instructor.",
    "Honestly, not much. Its a very general overview of a lot of different subjects.",
    "This course gives you a great understanding of: - domestic climate change policies and how they have evolved over time - evolution of the US energy policies - brief overview of international energy policies",
    "The various dimensions of climate policy What to weigh in evaluating climate policy The complicated politics of climate change International comparative perspective on climate change",
    "Understanding of regional and international climate policy. Writing policy memos.",
    "International, national, sub-national issues related to Environmental policy and governance, History of climate action, treaties and actions, issues around energy and its relationship to politics, policy, legislation etc.",
    "Good overarching knowledge of the policies and perspectives surrounding climate change",
    "I learned a lot about policy making for climate solutions as well as differences around the world",
    "The politics of climate change, global interactions about the crisis",
    "I learned a lot about U.S. climate policy and energy. I also learned how to write a policy memo, which was an extremely helpful exercise.",
    "Great class",
    "Good insight into politics of energy policy.",
    "Enjoyed the gaining knowledge of climate finance and energy policy. Learning how to write a policy memo. Environmental policy history in the US was interesting. Applied knowledge for policy solutions.",
    "Useful background only all things climate change policy. Great readings and resources. Very useful context.",
    "General vocabulary to discuss climate change, was especially helpful in thinking through pragmatic potential solutions and engaging with folks who might be less interested in \/ sure of the climate change problem. Course readings were relevant and topical, current events discussions were helpful at the beginning of class but often surface level and repetitive.",
    "Being a seminar course, this was a very new experience for me. I felt the course content covered the discussions around climate change pretty well with a strong bent towards international politics surrounding climate change actions and negotiations. The setting of the classroom was much bigger than usual and it was more of a large group discussion on particular sub themes of climate change, led very eloquently and diplomatically by Dan Esty.",
    "I learned about myriad climate change issues and approaches including policy, energy, finance, and international governance. I also developed my ability to write concise, tailored policy memos.",
    "comprehensive understanding of climate change and how policy can help fight it.",
    "Intro to international and national level climate policy Intro to climate change as an issue in general and solutions",
    "This course presented an overview of the history of climate change policy in the United States and current trajectories for future action. This course greatly improved my policy memo writing, a skill I was hoping to develop in graduate school.",
    "Learned about climate policy on the local, regional, and international level."

   "comments": [
    "They aligned well with my expectations. The only thing I would have preferred to learn more about was climate change policy in the majority world (we skipped the lecture on LDCs and SIDS).",
    "Not quite what I was expecting. I thought it would be more focused on legislative policy rather than international agreements.",
    "This class aligned with my expectations.",
    "I had hoped that class would go a little deeper into clean energy policy.",
    "The insights from this course exceeded my expectations.",
    "Very well!",
    "It was too remedial to be impactful.",
    "Much lower than expectations. The class is really just a very quick-and-dirty overview of a ton of different topics, and never really dives into any of them in enough depth to develop much insight or skills. I really wish that had been made more clear to me, but FES does not have a good way of indicating the depth of courses to interested students. Would not have taken this course if I'd known.",
    "My expectations were mostly met, with the exception of the amount of information on international policies. I thought that the course was going to cover a bit more material on international issues.",
    "Very well. Prof. Esty covered a ton of ground.",
    "They exceeded expectations.",
    "Extremely well",
    "I was expecting to learn more about best practices for drafting policies but otherwise I feel I took away a lot from the class",
    "Very well",
    "This class definitely met my expectations.",
    "Yes",
    "Very well.",
    "Exceeded expectations. I learned new sectors of climate policy and new ways to think about mitigation and solutions that I had not been exposed to previously. Could have learned more skills for policy memo writing. Was a fun assignment but not sure it is an applied skill after this class.",
    "Good background. Less engagement \/ back-and-forth than I would have liked.",
    "The course met my expectations as it painted a good high level picture of climate change and green economy transitions. It helped me catch up with the developments on an international level - to gain a better perspective. As I worked primarily in the renewable energy sector it was helpful to gain a more strategic understanding of the politics, emerging regulatory and technological innovations that are associated with climate change actions.",
    "On par",
    "This course went above my expectations and I learned a lot more than I expected including issues of which I was already familiar.",
    "Aligned very well",
    "The course material aligned well with my expectations.",
    "Wish I could have learned more about policy mechanisms that are not market or techno based solutions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course did a good job at maintaining its lecture format but also providing space for student-led discussion. The main improvement I would have liked to see was more timely feedback on student's written work.",
    "Esty has lots of experience and opinions on this topic, which is both good and bad. Esty is clearly very committed to this topic and discussions with him can be insightful, both in and outside of the classroom. He's so opinionated on the topic that it can feel like we're probably missing other content that he isn't as focused on or doesn't agree with. The policy memo writing style for our assignments is a valuable skill to ask us to work on. However, it seemed like the specific formatting and expectations within the policy memos was forced. Feedback on the policy memos was not generally valuable.",
    "One weakness of the class was that it was too big which made active participation more difficult. In addition, I felt like it was not extremely helpful to only get feedback on policy memos from TAs who were not necessarily any more experienced than I am (they took the class one year before, but basically are one year ahead of me as an MEM). There were also way too many readings.",
    "Professor Esty's stories and engaging lecture style was the highlight of the course. In terms of constructive criticism, I wish there were more opportunities for small group discussions like has had in law and policy.",
    "I found the course to be really engaging. It was a good exercise to try to defend ideas publicly in front of the whole class. However, for students that are less comfortable with public speaking, actively participating was likely difficult.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is in the design of the lectures itself. They're packed with information and highly engaging.",
    "This would be a great introductory environmental course. It is not a good high-level environmental course in the least.",
    "I'm not sure it can be changed that much because FES needs an intro-level class for climate change, but it needs to be renamed to \"Intro to Climate Policy\" so that students know it's very much just an intro-level class and doesn't really have much depth for students who know about climate change already. But it should go more in depth into economics, because it's not really a \"policy\" class as much as a \"political science\" class if there's not economics at all. Also, specific classes should not always be taught from an energy perspective. For example, the class on China was purely from an energy and climate perspective, which really does not give the big picture for topics like the Belt-Road Initiative, but never discussed things from an international relations, or a China studies, or a foreign policy perspective.",
    "Weaknesses: - not a lot of information on international issues - large class size Strengths: - Professor Esty is a great lecturer - Policy memo assignments are a great exercise - TAs were great",
    "Strength Memos - Writing assignments that help you in real life for practitioners. Content - Esty's legal and economics background made it very policy and practitioner heavy as opposed to academic. Negative Access to professor - Wish Prof. Esty offered office hours or another way to interact with him. Participation - tough to weigh in and as a climate novice often wasn't sure of what to say and when, but that's why I took the course to learn, so not really a negative :)",
    "Too much assigned reading. It is impossible to complete it all. The top 2-3 pieces should be highlighted for each class.",
    "Strengths: Dan is a very good speaker and moderates the discussion very well. He is very knowledgeable on the topic. A lot of reading. Weakness: Most issues are based around energy and how it plays a central role. Very little on Climate justice or the role of consumption in environmental degradation. Dan also doesn't use slides, so highly recommend making a lot of notes. A lot of reading.",
    "Professor Esty brought a whole world of knowledge to this course. The lectures were well organized and he was great at incorporating view points and questions from the class. I really enjoyed the course and looked forward to coming to class every Monday and Wednesday",
    "I like that there are no slides and that the professor just talks, but the class could be kept smaller to facilitate engagement",
    "Focus on other regions beyond the US",
    "Lectures were interesting. Too many readings.",
    "Great teaching mix",
    "S: good overall content, especially on US energy policy and UNFCCC negotations. Esty's experience brings a lot of insight into how politics really work. Great lectures W: focus on US and mitigation, with less attention to adaptation and international, especially developing country experiences.",
    "Esty is a great lecturer who appropriately engaged students, allowed them to challenge him, and challenged them right back. TAs were great resources, very very helpful and responsive, and were a huge asset to my success in this course. Some of the material felt old and outdated.",
    "Not a huge fan of the lecture format; hard to participate without dominating the conversation. Maybe better to have sections where students can learn from one another?",
    "Serious repetition from class to class, and often felt like things were only discussed at a very basic level. Obviously, there is a lot of material to cover in a class like this -- but I think if repetition were cut down on there could be more room for more thoughtful discussions.",
    "The course covers a wide level of topics that are essential in understanding climate change. Dan's delivery is also fantastic to watch and there are many lessons that come from this. I would also have liked to see a bit more coverage on trade with respect to climate change as it is a topic I am quite interested in.",
    "Slides and interaction as opposed to just a speech",
    "I found lectures fascinating and the policy memos practical. I think the course could be improved by reducing the number of readings and embeding them a little more in the lectures. The small island developing states class would have been far more intruiging than the guest lecturer who was too academic and dry.",
    "No weaknesses.",
    "Strength: Gives you a broad overview of climate policy and issues, Helps you develop practical skills such as writing up policy memos Weakness: very little focus on adaptation, very mitigation focused. Should perhaps be titled Introduction to Climate Change Policy",
    "The readings overall were interesting and generally easy to complete. I liked that the course focussed on energy solutions. I think the section on climate justice could be improved to better emphasize the existing climate justice movement and indigenous rights and sovereignty.",
    "Professor Esty is a great lecturer and knows a lot about the subjects he chooses to talk about. I enjoyed doing the policy memos as well and felt that it was a practical skill I could take from the class. However the class is very limited in its discussions on environmental justice and equity. As well as policy solutions that are not carbon markets and cap and trade."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "This is mostly on international agreements and how that translates at the national level; not much law involved.",
    "The readings seem like a lot, but you don't really have to do all of the readings to have a good understanding of the material. Esty's lectures go into a lot of detail. However, you will need to do all of the readings plus a fair amount of outside research in order to write effective policy memos. Plan out your semester wisely from the beginning because the policy memos can definitely take up a lot of time. I would also say don't be afraid to challenge Esty's thinking. He is really open to receiving input on different opinions and I learned a lot from my classmates who brought up new ideas.",
    "Professor Esty's stories made the class and you should appreciate the opportunity to be in the same room with him.",
    "I would recommend it. The readings are interesting and the lectures are engaging. I wouldn't worry about reading everything and taking notes on every sentence. It is a good course to understand a certain, prevailing perspective in Democratic environmental leadership.",
    "If you have a general working knowledge of environmental topics, look elsewhere.",
    "Do not take this class if you have familiarity with climate change, you are better off taking a higher level class instead.",
    "Take advantage of the TA office hours when preparing your policy memos. Start working on memos\/ideas for them early on and bring your ideas to the TAs to flush them out.",
    "Take it 100%. Even if you think you know a bit about climate policy, Prof. Esty really lays the foundation for you to take any future course on the issue.",
    "Take it!",
    "See above",
    "You get from this course what you put in. I took this class in conjunction with the Environmental Law and Policy class and felt that both courses supplemented each other well. The class syllabus is a huge resource and having the readings compiled together in that manner is helpful in learning about a specific issue even if someone is not enrolled in the class. The readings can really add up, so try to form a group and split up the readings. Having a shared google doc for the readings was very helpful",
    "Great course for those interested in environmental issues at a global context",
    "TF's were extremely helpful, especially in preparing to write policy memos. It was also important to stay on top of the readings.",
    "Sometimes very high level but great overview of climate change policy",
    "Attending lectures are the best use of your time. Follow policy memo guidelines precisely.",
    "You will get a lot more out of the reading than you realize. Split the readings with a group of people and meet to review\/discuss. But still skim the rest. You'll get more out of it to become an expert on a few pieces than skimming all of them. and the discussions with peers are very engaging and allowed me to get more from the reading than I anticipated.",
    "Probably okay to just do the course readings \/ current event readings on your own.",
    "To understand it is a seminar course and it might be useful to put forward own opinions during discussions (as they really shape each class)",
    "Collaborate with classmates",
    "Show up to each lecture and don't be afraid to speak in class. Attend the policy memo session or office hours before the first policy memo.",
    "Definitely take it",
    "This class requires a lot of reading",
    "If you want to learn about climate change policy, this is the class to take. Dan Esty brings an additional layer to the course with his decades of experience working at the federal and state level.",
    "If youre looking for innovative policy solutions that center equity, this isnt the class for you"
