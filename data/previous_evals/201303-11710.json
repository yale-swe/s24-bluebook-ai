   "comments": [
    "ECON 110 was one of the most information-heavy courses I've taken, but well worth it in the end. I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes if you are interested in Econ but if not you should take the lecture because this class is significantly harder.",
    "A very essential class to take, content and level of difficulty is right, though effort has to be put in to do well.",
    "You learn more behavioral economics than the lecture. There isn't much work except for the one midterm and the final, but because of that you could end up feeling unprepared for these two exams. Lectures are somewhat helpful to learn the material but reading the book helps as well.",
    "I would most definitely recommend Econ 110, as it is essentially the lecture in a small environment taught by a really good instructor.",
    "Absolutely only take the seminar if you're very okay with a much harder curve!! And definitely shop both sections to see if you can learn from the teachers. Tolga is a nice guy, but some people really do not like his teaching style as it can sometimes seem like a waste of time. Katerina doesn't really explain well so people in her classes just end up reading the textbook. While it's nice that Tolga answers the PSet Qs in office hours, it makes it hard to study until the final. Also, try to decide if you like econ before taking the class. If you don't it'll be a long semester of graphing profit maximization curves and screaming that you just don't care!",
    "I would recommend Economics 110 01 if you are serious about econ. It was a challenging class, especially since I had never taken econ before. It's a great introduction to the subject, but you do have to put in the work.",
    "A great introductory economics course. Definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, because I feel like it gave me a very strong foundation in microeconomics.",
    "If you need a QR and are not sure where else to turn, I would take this class. But keep up with the reading (ie do it ahead of the lectures-- I did much better in the class when I did that) and actually attempt the p-sets instead of just going to office hours and getting all the answers from Tolga. I'd also suggest doing problems from the textbook and online resources throughout the semester so you can make sure you know how to do the different types of problems.",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 110, particularly to students who have the study habits necessary to keep up with material in a course with infrequent problem sets (pre-reading, reviewing lecture notes often, setting time aside to do extra problems). The pacing of the course is definitely reasonable. Because of the grading distribution, however, the overall vibe of the course is not quite one of eager cooperation. Students tend to review with select friends or seek out study buddies from Professor Simons' sections.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this course. Take the lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I believe that every student should have some basic level of microeconomics, and there is no better intro class than this one.",
    "Definitely choose the seminar over the lecture if you're willing to put in the extra work. Yes, the curve is more harsh. But in my opinion, it was SO worth it because of how entertaining the class was. If you take the seminar, TAKE IT WITH TOLGA.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. A great intro to micro."
