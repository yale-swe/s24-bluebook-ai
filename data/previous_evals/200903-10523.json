    "The course provides a general overview of topics in microbiology relevant to the ecologist and evolutionary biologist. Overall, I would recommend the course to anyone interested in knowing more about microbial evolution.",
    "Definitely recommend it",
    "Would recommend in following circumstances:- An interest in developing critical reading skills.- Not afraid of taking on unfamiliar material, and thinking of new approaches to research with a basis in material covered in the course.- Developing a general interest in science and the scientific community.Would not:- If he\/she has little time for background reading...unless you work in microbiology it will take a LOT. (...but will be worth it).- Is uncomfortable in speaking up in group situations, the course is very discussion and participation oriented.",
    "I would recommend it to other students because for me it was an effective way to broaden my knowledge of two growing and important fields. Additionally, the style of the course was very friendly and informal."

   "comments": [
    "Gave me some excellent ideas for ongoing research projects, and helped highlight some (currently) under-explored interdisciplinary fields. It also helped me in approaches to critically reading current literature, and evaluating interpretations and conclusions with reference to data presented in the manuscript (i.e....not always brilliant!)In general, did not complement my own research in terms of covered material (but did so in some cases), but was excellent in developing approaches to research, specifically with regards to designing a project, and interpreting the results."
