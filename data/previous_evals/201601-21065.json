    "Believe Professor Lofton when she tells you at the beginning of the semester that this course will change the way you see the world. One of the most enriching, zany, and fascinating classes I've taken at Yale. A must-take.",
    "Regardless of academic interest, everyone should take this course. The lectures are incredibly engaging, the readings are interesting and not ridiculously long, and I cannot say enough good things about Prof. Lofton. Even on the very last days of the course, I did not want lecture to end, and many people in the lecture would talk about how interesting the last topic just was. Prof. Lofton is truly the best professor at Yale. She is so approachable, intelligent, and passionate. After this class, you will begin to notice things that you never would have before because Prof. Lofton makes the subject material so relevant and accessible--even with really hard theorists. Outside of the classroom, Prof. Lofton meets with her students and goes out of her way to help them or just talk about their lives. You should really take this course!!!",
    "Great class to take Credit\/D. Not super easy, but interesting and taught well.",
    "Amazing course. Kathryn Lofton is one of Yale's best lecturers. She is so passionate about the subject, so hilarious, and so engaging that you really want to know everything she has to say. The course is kind of a hodgepodge but it holds together well. 4 small papers (2-750 word ones and 2-1000 word ones) that have great specific prompts that still allow you to take your argument where you want it to go. Midterm focuses more on content (do your reading! Look at the reading questions!) and final is more what you think. Incredible course, take it take it take it.",
    "Overall, I had a pretty good impression of the class. Up until the final, I hadn't really had as much of a chance to synthesize all of the information from the course, so it felt somewhat disjointed right up until the end. The class is very fairly graded. Kathryn Lofton grades the first paper, and it's really either a hit or miss there - sometimes there is a sharp learning curve to discover the writing style appropriate for her class. But from there on, the TFs grade the papers, and they're much more lenient and reasonable. Kathryn Lofton is intense, in every sense of the word. Sometimes her lectures are very hard to follow because she speaks at a mile per minute, always performing her lectures as though they're a monologue. This is engaging, but it can also be tough to determine what is important in her class. To offset this, she is ridiculously reasonable about her examinations. She gives reading questions to go alongside the readings she assigns, and the midterm consisted entirely of those reading questions alongside ones that she put in writing in her PowerPoints in lecture. For the final, she straight up gave us weeks in advance the piece of paper that she would be giving us during the final, so we had essentially unlimited time to prepare. The class is not meant to be tricky in any sense of the word, but it is meant to make you think. Many people have described this class as \"life changing\" or say that they \"feel fundamentally different\" after leaving every lecture. I am glad that they've had those experiences, but I don't feel the same way, to be frank. I think Kathryn Lofton is good at what she does, and I think she's one of the most brilliant scholars in her field, but I think I left this class with more questions than answers (which is probably exactly what KLoft wanted, to be honest). Would I recommend this class? Yes, I think so, but with hesitation. It's not for everyone, and I think I realized by the end that it wasn't quite for me. I think you'll learn a lot from her, but I also think you'll really have to struggle to get there, intellectually.",
    "It's a crash course on how everything is religious and secular at the same time. How people are organized and construct sexualities. Take it!",
    "One of the best classes I have ever taken.",
    "For sure! Professor Lofton is a power house and a thrill to learn from. The readings are fascinating, and section is super interesting as well.",
    "100% I think it's a course that people should take first semester of freshman year to learn how to hone their ability to write. It was honestly more useful than my freshman english class, and far more interesting. Take it if you really want to engage with the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend AMST 111 to a friend. It's a really interesting course. There is quite a lot of work (4 short essays, midterm, final), but I think it's worth it.",
    "It's an amazing course that everyone should take. There are a ton of readings, but it's a great class to Credit\/D\/F if you're a stem student.",
    "Would absolutely recommend. Please take this class.",
    "Definitely. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Kathryn Lofton is amazing and you should take the class just to hear her lecture.",
    "This is an excellent course for developing tools at analyzing religious and political material--both historical and contemporary. Don't expect any easy answers, there is no comprehensive thesis to the course on the intersection between sexuality and religion, so I was able to discern, from the course, but you come to appreciate several different religious movements' philosophies on their intersection. And you will come away with awareness of a lot of new ideas!",
    "Amazing course that will make you think about religion in a whole new light and sexuality. More importantly, how much overlap and mutual dependence these two have on one another. 10\/10 would recommend this course.",
    "Sexuality and religion is a journey, but if you are committed to diligent reading and active participation in section, I can promise that it is a journey worth taking. Professor Lofton's lectures are downright enjoyable--I never once felt bored. And the readings are tough but so interesting, and discussion section helps with comprehension. If the title of this course is even peripherally appealing to you, shop it and witness the magic that is Kathryn Lofton! You won't regret it!",
    "interesting subject matter but a lot of reading and work",
    "Lofton is brilliant and fun, you learn to think about two frameworks that vastly shape our lives (religion and sexuality) in new ways.",
    "A hard class but an amazing one too",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale, lecture or otherwise. Lofton is absolutely the best lecturer I have ever had; she's brilliant, funny, and speaks as though she is putting on a performance. Never in my life did I think I would take a class cross-listed in the Religious Studies department, yet after sitting in on her first class during shopping period, I knew I had to take the class. I feel like I have learned so much in such a short period of time - probably because the workload is a lot. But it's soooo worth it. I started Credit\/D, but ended up switching because I couldn't bring myself to treat the class like it was only worth a C. However, I would recommend at least starting off as Credit\/D; it's nice to have the option. For fellow students, I would suggest at least shopping the class. You'll know then whether or not you want to take the class.",
    "Absolutely amazing!!!!!! Take this class. I don't know exactly what I learned but it completely changed the way I think about things. Lofton is the best lecturer I think I've had at Yale and going to class was something I looked forward to every week. Your grade is based on 4 short papers and two tests, so it's not too labor intensive and if you pay attention and don't get behind its pretty easy to do well. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and I highly recommend it to anyone at all interested in the history of religion, the concept of sexuality, or the way American society is structured. This class blew my mind and will blow yours too.",
    "Take this! It's approachable to all majors and you'll learn a lot! DO THE READINGS.",
    "I might recommend AMST 111 for someone looking for an intro course, willing to do reading for their own sake, and who is excited by a popular class. If you do the readings, you can get a lot out of the class - the readings will really change the way you think!",
    "If you do the reading it's super easy, but there's a ton of reading and in my oppinion not all of it is was interesting or fun. I would say this class is mostly about Lofton. So I'd say during shopping period focus on if you're into her particular kind of humor\/approach to things. If you are, you'll love the class. Otherwise it'll be a pretty tedious experience.",
    "This class gives you the world and tears it apart with the cases the world doesn't want you to know about. The inquiry is so real and importanthat it sometimes doespecially not even feel like a course! Please take it. Everyone needs this.",
    "Credit\/d please for your own sanity.",
    "ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. This course could do to focus a little less on Christianity in America, but given the breadth of our discussions I'm not even bothered. I've never been in a class that I was so overjoyed and engaged by. Professor Lofton is beyond incredible (someone VERY ACCURATELY described her as lecturing \"like a spoken word poem\"), and the readings were so fascinating. It can be a significant amount of work, but you get out what you put in, and I thought it was totally doable. If you have even the slightest interest in these topics, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Take it!!",
    "I don't say this often. THIS. CLASS. WILL. CHANGE. YOUR. LIFE. It reminds you why we study, why we work and think and sweat. There are moments of divine inspiration. Do it. Be there.",
    "This course is constantly showing how sexuality and religion interact with each other. We look at specific religious groups (some you probably never heard of). We spend a good amount of time reading Foucault's History of Sexuality. These readings are all fairly interesting (some more than others), and the written assignments are not too bad. The midterm is essentially testing to see if you did the readings so make sure you at least review them for their big takeaways before heading into the midterm. Also, definitely come to class because Professor Lofton gives you MANY hints about what kind of questions will be on the midterm. The final is essentially a take-home final in the sense that you have the questions before walking into the exam. You do have to take the exam during finals period, but it is not very stressful since you were already given the questions. Beware: This class is a good amount of reading.",
    "Sexuality and Religion will seriously affect how you perceive the world. I'm not sure if this is the same for WGSS majors, but as a non WGSS major I found this class the perfect entrypoint into gender theory and some of the more complex topics of both religion and sexuality. Kathryn Lofton was one of the BEST teachers I have ever had and I looked forward to her mind-blowing lectures every week. Side note: I did take this class Credit-D and so found the difficult grading\/multiple papers to be less stressful than others did and probably enjoyed the class more; would highly recommend taking Credit-D.",
    "Interesting!",
    "Fantastic. Professor Lofton is brilliant, and my mind was blown every single lecture. I love that she's so prepared and introduces complex ideas and synthesizes everything together. I've learned how to think differently in this class, and am now super interested in everything related to sexuality, religion, history, and American society! I got so much out of this class would highly recommend to anyone!",

    "You NEED to take this class. It's not unmanageable, you will learn an immense amount about sexuality and its entanglements with American religions, you will leave with a better ability to analyze Yale's sexual culture so you can either game the system or appreciate the intricacies of what's really going on, you will be walked through Foucault in a way no other class will, and Lofton is an unbelievable professor and lecturer. You would be insane not to take this class. I wish I could take it again, honestly.",
    "This class is wonderful but the grading is harsh and it is an intro class. The material and presentation are fascination but if you have taken WGSS classes before much of it is familiar. It is a really great intro class especially to work on writing. I would highly recommend the class especially as a C\/D\/F option.",
    "Definitely. A hard but very engaging course.",
    "AMST 111 studies the intersection of religion and sexuality in a variety of different contexts. In addition to specific cultural examples, it deals with more abstract Foucauldian theory, which can be challenging. It's important for a student to be aware of the workload and the expectations of the course, but I would recommend it because it's insightful and fascinating.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can. It has been the best class I've taken at Yale. It's not a gut by any means, but if you're willing to put the work in it is very worthwhile.",
    "A truly phenomenal class that does challenge its students.",
    "An excellent class! The best part is that Lofton focuses on teaching you to think carefully and critically about what you read and how you explain it. If there were a \"Sexuality and Religion Part II,\" I'd take it in a heartbeat."
