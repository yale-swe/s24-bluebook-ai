    "This is a course to help you cram for the exam. The amount of work is extreme, but this is necessary for the aim of the course. I would recommend it to anyone taking the theory exam unless you have some kind of unbelievable background in contemporary theory. But even if you do, you should still take this course to discuss those works with other students.",
    "I would recommend it either for someone unfamiliar with the material wanting to get a broad overview of political theory or to those preparing for the exam, immediately prior to taking the exam. However, I would add a caveat that the workload is extremely great and can be overwhelming."

    "This course is a good preparatory course for the exam.",
    "This course did not so much deepen my knowledge - it did, but not my much - but broadened it considerably. It is unlikely to contribute in any significant way to my research, at least directly, but some of the themes we touched upon are things I am likely to explore in future."
