   "comments": [
    "So, you're looking for a gut science class. You're in luck -- this class is very, very easy. The only thing I'll say is that if you don't actually have a real interest in conservation\/environment\/nature -type stuff, you'll get bored very quickly, and might be better off choosing one of the several other very, very easy science classes. If you do like talking about trees etc., though, you're in for a treat.",
    "Yes! really easy",
    "A gut class like no other. More than 50% athletes. The material is important, but presented in the most basic and dry way possible. If you are looking for a science credit, please look for a class where you will actually learn.",
    "The course is an accessible SC credit for non-science majors, and the information in the course is relevant to any student, regardless of major. Most of the course is lectures by professor Puth, but there are some really awesome case studies by guest lecturers sprinkled in. I would recommend E&EB to students interested in conservation.",
    "I'm not sure I learned the depth of information I was hoping to-- this course would be good for someone who has very little understanding of the ecological world and would like to know the basics.",
    "If you're desperate for a science credit, this class is OK. It looks more interesting on paper than in real life - the material itself is very dry and theoretical most of the time, and we spend very little time on case studies (the actually interesting part of the class). It's not much work, and the lectures are basically exactly the same as the textbook so you don't really have to do the reading. Prof. Puth is not a great lecturer.",
    "No, it was a tough class. The lectures were boring and unimaginative. The grading on the midterms was harder than I would have liked.",
    "This is an interesting intro to conservation bio. I appreciated how the info was accessible even for those without a science background. I'm glad I took this class because this is a topic that affects all of us.",
    "This class was exactly what I was looking for: a relatively interesting science credit (for a non science major) with little work. We essentially only had three tests and a few short readings. If you study for the tests you'll do fine.",
    "No you will learn random technical forms for simple, boring concepts",
    "super easy. no work at all (not even psets). i'd say the material is interesting, but you won't learn anything in detail. if you need an easy science credit or an easy fifth class, take it.",
    "If you are looking for a science credit that is interesting, relevant, and not too difficult, take this class. Although the lectures aren't all that riveting, the material is very useful for understanding the effect human activity is having on the planet. You should be fine if you keep up with the material; it is not difficult at all.",
    "If you need a manageable SC credit, take this class",
    "This class discusses current affairs regarding human activity and its affects nature. Thee affects include climate change and global warming and the harm caused to different organisms and animal species through the destructive activities of human beings.",
    "This class is okay. The problem is it's really vague when it comes to the tests. You can interpret a lot of the exam questions in different ways and when you answer them you pretty much won't get credit unless you regurgitate the info that they put on the slides. Giving the correct answer isn't necessarily good enough if it doesn't match their grading scheme and that was pretty frustrating to me. If you have a lot of other background science knowledge the material will seem pretty easy and logical but in the middle of tests it felt like I had to avoid using knowledge from outside the course to make sure I put what they wanted down on the page... Not very conducive to critical thinking if you ask me.",
    "It seems like a gut but it's not. It depends--can you live with ridiculously deceptive (and or unwittingly specific) exam questions, in exchange for a few intensely comical moments (one student raised her hand during a lecture on tuna farming--while a gruesome, bloody picture of a thousand slaughtered tuna was on display--and said \"But they're so tasty!\")?",
    "A pretty dry class, but it wasn't incredibly difficult or demanding if you are looking for a science credit.",
    "Good science credit for people who \"aren't science oriented.\" This class will address many things that are easily applicable in other disciplines (health, politics, ethics, etc.) You read scientific articles, but they're all quite understandable. A little vocab heavy, but that's par for intro courses. I surprised myself by enjoying this class. Good TA's all around.",
    "Eh. Take it if you need the science credit but I feel like this class could be so much more.",
    "This is a great course. It examines conservation from biology from a standpoint that isn't strictly scientific but also includes things like anthropology and econ. I'd definitely recommend it to someone who needs a science credit but isn't really a science person.",
    "If you need a science credit, this is a good course to take. Also if you are interested in conservation this is also a good course.",
    "If you need a science credit it's a decent class for it. It's not super well presented, but the content is mostly interesting.",
    "This is a very good class for students who are interested in the environment. It relates very well to many of our worlds biggest issues. It could also serve as a great class to simply fill a requirement. The professor and TAs are very good and the information is interesting and different every class.",
    "Take it, but you must know how to apply the knowledge which I found to be challenging.",
    "It is a good overview on conservation topics.",
    "Students looking for a Science credit should definitely take E&EB 115! Tons of people told me that the class was disappointing, but it was really enjoyable after Professor Puth's restructuring. The three hour-long (or so) tests were really fair. The other assignments were not very difficult. It is a very chill class about discipline that's good to have knowledge about. I learned so much.",
    "Really straightforward introduction to conservation. The workload is light and the tests are fair. Take this if you need a science credit that is not quantitative.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone. It teaches about important issues and topics that are relevant in this day and age of species extinction and global warming. It is a fun class and as long as one puts in the work, they will be happy with what they get out of it.",
    "I would recommend this course. It isn't very hard and the materialis pretty interesting.",
    "Good science credit.",
    "This is a good course to take to fulfill a science requirement if you are not a STEM person while covering interesting subject matter.",
    "The work is basically attending lectures, reading the papers for section, and attending a lecture and writing a report about it. The work is manageable and the topic is interesting. I do not know why this class is not more well-known. I took it because I needed a science credit and I was very happy with it.",
    "This is a straightforward, well-taught Sc credit with some interesting real-world applications. Exams are theoretically easy, but can end up vague and tricky; there are one or two additional requirements -- attending and writing up a relevant on-campus talk; briefly presenting a simple assigned paper. When I took it, the course had recently been restructured, and I found the new organization effective; it also uses an excellent textbook.",
    "I would maybe recommend Con Bio to another student. It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, but if you go to lecture and review the slides before the exams you should be fine. Overall not that much work, just short readings each week before section and review before exams."
