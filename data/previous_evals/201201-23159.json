   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class because it is not just a course but an experience, as are all Deb Margolin classes. There's a definite lack of specific constructive criticisms that you might find elsewhere, partially due to the nature of the class in pointing out that which was good about the work rather than that which was lacking, but overall it is a class that any theater-maker should take while at Yale.",
    "You meet, you sit on the floor, you talk in class, you write in class, you do fill-in-the-blanks, you share scenes, you get (positive) critique. You write a full-length play.",
    "TAKE IT. If you are looking at this evaluation you should already just be going to the class. I mean any class with Deb. Just do it. Who are you kidding",
    "Yes! Take it, one of the best decisions I've made at Yale, and I had no previous experience with playwriting. :)",
    "A great way to learn about playwriting. The actual writing of plays.",
    "Deb is delightful and caring. She really does encourage you in a way that produces great work.",
    "TAKE IT A CLASS WITH DEB MARGOLIN. DO IT. DO NOT GRADUATE WITHOUT HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN WITH HER IN SOME CAPACITY. If you can't get into the course, at least try to talk to her or come to Theater of Desire. She is a phenomenal human being and an unparalleled teacher. One thing she said in class was \"the world is littered with beauty, littered with horror, littered with signs of mortality.\" Deb's class is littered with beauty, art, and humanity. She is kind, she is giving, she will push you to observe the world differently, to listen harder to experience more fully, to be abetter writer and a better person. Do you have a soul? Take this class. If you can't get in, go to Theater of Desire (email her about it). Meet her, learn from her, don't let scheduling conflicts interfere with this if you have the opportunity to take this class IT IS A PRIORITY.Take it.",
    "A great course. If you've had Deb before, you know what you're getting in to. Not that much different from her regular play-writing course. A joy to go to."
