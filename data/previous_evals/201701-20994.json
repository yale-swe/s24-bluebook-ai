    "Through this course, I learned the basics of utilitarianism, Kantian ethics, and contractarianism. I was able to facilitate my learning about the foundation for philosophy.",
    "Intro Ethics teaches you to grapple with questions of 'right and wrong' in a structured and rigorous manner. The course provides you three major ethical framework, through which you learn to derive coherent answers to tough questions. This class has very little emphasis on the literal views of dead, white men, and much more emphasis on the actual philosophical ideas of these men - Professor Kagan is not afraid to state when believes to have found an incoherence in the writings of Kant or Hume, and he'll help you think independently rather than merely follow the thoughts of others.",
    "This course improved my ability to write an argumentative more than anything else ever has. Greatly improved understanding of moral phil",
    "I learned the basic of making a philosophical argument.",
    "I really did not learn much from this course. Maybe a little bit about Kant.",
    "Philosophy is not intuitive. I'd claim that is one of my central takeaways of the course, at least as much as it concerns what insights I made. Beyond that, I do believe I garnered a new respect for the field, and certainly for Shelley Kagan. I think as an academic pursuit, philosophy is one of the most systematic ways of thinking I have been exposed to, and the course's content one of the most \"above the clouds\".",
    "Learned about Kant, Mill, Hume, Hobbes, etc, basic philosophy concepts.",
    "This is an excellent first philosophy class to take. You learn about morals--what frameworks we can follow (we covered Utilitarianism, Kantian deontology\/categorical imperative, and Contractarianism, as well as brief sketches of free will and motivation), the upsides and downsides of each, and what they might look like in practice. The explanations might be a bit basic if you already have experience with them, but Shelly does a wonderful job at painting a picture of them--I feel confident that I can win an argument against many of my upperclassmen friends when discussing Kant now. You also do get better at writing--the grading is tough, but I always got excellent feedback from the TF grading my paper, and that was so helpful! I really grew as a writer and as a philosopher.",
    "I learned how to write a paper about philosophy and better engage ideas with each other. Before this class, writing a paper about abstract ideas would have been impossible for me.",
    "This class made philosophy intellectually accessibly and extremely enjoyable to learn. Prof. Kagan's lectures are insightful and engaging - a great class. The essays were graded very stringently, and it made me a better writer and thinker (it made me check my logic and clarity of explanations).",
    "I gained insight about Utilitarianism , Kantianism, Contractarianism, and Humianism. I also learned about why humans might have an obligation to act morally. Most importantly, however, I learned how to write a philosophy paper by taking this class. Although the grading is brutal at times, it forced me to legitimately develop how I analyze and present philosophical arguments.",
    "Learned much about ethics and the different moral frameworks proposed by various respected philosophical thinkers.",
    "This class is not very reading intensive but it requires a lot of thinking and logical deduction.",
    "I gained skills of learning ethics and now I have a good sense of philosophy basics.",
    "I believed I increased my ability to create well organized and clear arguments. Because the course required such precision of language and argument, I learned how to effective counter opposing arguments and how to build a strong foundation for my arguments.",
    "Understanding of different moral theories.",
    "I learned about various approaches to ethics, and how to make ethical arguments through papers.",
    "I learned how to think critically about a new area of study and how to write a philosophy paper. I learned how to deeply assess specific ethical questions.",
    "None at all.",
    "I learned to think for myself. I learned to think about all the potential objections and counter arguments that could be applied to an argument. I learned that good discussion in section involves thinking through your points before you present them.",
    "This class is graded so subjectively. It is by far the most unfairly graded class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "This class has *actually* made me develop my critical thinking skills. In papers, sections, and lectures, I was prompted to think critically and favorably of material. The limits of my ability to analyze were stretched, and I am grateful.",
    "Writing philosophy papers, being careful of the steps I took in my logic.",
    "I learned how moral systems are constructed and the logic that goes into them. I got a foundation in several interpretations of morality.",
    "Explored the philosophical concepts of utilitarianism (Mills), Kantianism, and variations of contractarianism (Hobbes, Rawls) with a final take on \"why be moral.\"",
    "As a senior, the material being covered was not new to me. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that i learned a lot about how to critique philosophical arguments, and how to correctly imterpret the theories we were studying.",
    "The course nuanced my conception of morality and changed my worldview as a result. It also tightened my writing and improved my argument-crafting abilities. It was an excellent introduction to philosophy.",
    "I really really got to practice thinking hard. I feel like the philosophy we learned, while interesting and important, was less important than the ability to think, discuss, and write about that philosophy with discernment.",
    "I learned the core ideas of a few philosopher's ideas on morality.",
    "This class serves as an excellent introduction to ethical thinking, as well as a useful instruction on clear writing no matter what level of philosophy instruction you may have.",
    "Ethics -- how to think, write, and debate in the sphere of moral philosophy.",
    "Philosophical thinking, how to make and defend an argument properly, how to think morally"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of ti=he course was the intellect of Professor Kagan. He was very knowledgeable and a great lecturer. The weaknesses were the difficulty of the grading. When a student doesn't do well on the first paper, there should be more support for helping the student improve.",
    "The biggest strength of this class is the sheer intellectual development you will undergo if you commit seriously and effortfully to the class. Many people are averse to the supposedly gruesome grading of this class, but it seems that this reputation is self-perpetuating. Sure, if you take this class credit\/D and only put in an afternoon's work on your essay, you will not get more than a C+ or a small B. But if you dare take it for a letter grade, and put in the thoughts required to compose a good philosophical essay, this is by no means an impossible class to do well on. This is not a class to take if you are simply looking to maximize your GPA with the least possible effort; it's the class to take if you are simply looking to hone your intelligence.",
    "More constructive feedback on essays",
    "The lecturing is fantastic and entertaining. Discussion sections were good and bad at time. Of any course I've taken at Yale, this course by far had the most rigid section participation guidelines. As a result, many of the student comments felt very forced.",
    "I really did not like this course at all. It's two strengths were my TA (Yuan, who was great) and Shelly's enthusiasm for the material, which a student always appreciates. However, I found lecture boring - Shelly repeated material over and over, and I felt like we could have covered 5 times what we did. We do not need to spend so many weeks on utilitarianism - it is an easy concept! We wasted so, so much time.",
    "Strengths: Shelley Kagan. Exceptional lecturer. Greatly enjoyed his lectures even if I felt frustrated with my grasp of the material. In terms of weaknesses, perhaps not enough spaces for students to technically learn how to write philosophy papers. It is a highly niche skill and think if there had been workshops or venues for students to sign up or go to in order to refine those skills, it would have served students greatly.",
    "Interesting lectures, discussion section is difficult because a lot of times people just say stuff that is not related to get participation credit. It was hard to keep up a valid discussion many times in section. The papers were definitely interesting though, and it was a great introduction to the field for people like me who had no background.",
    "Shelly's lectures are just awesome. Point blank. He even got on the table and clucked like a chicken once. You will have such a thorough understanding of the frameworks. We went through contractarianism a bit briefly, and I'd have liked more on that, but I understand how we only have so much time--perhaps could have spent a little less time on utilitarianism, because I don't think people really had that much trouble understanding it given that it is a bit more concrete. Also, if you get a good TF, section can also really shine. This is the first class I've taken that I've actually looked forward to going to section (get Daniel Moerner if you can!). Also, the class has the strength of making you a much more robust philosophical writer, so I thank it for that as well. Shelly is old-school, no lecture slides or visual aides, which might be helpful for some people. The reading was interesting, although I think the class was certainly doable without doing it. I love how you're specifically not supposed to quote the reading in the papers--it's so much more liberating to write just what you, yourself, think.",
    "This course has incredible lectures that are beautiful but like art and not like class. If you appreciate the art, the class is good. It could be better if there were more written opportunities to engage with the material. Lectures can sometimes feel intangible.",
    "There is a reason why everyone takes this class credit\/d\/fail - the grading is HARD! Those of us concerned about graduate school should not take this for a grade (as I did). But the essay critiques and lectures are amazing. Note: the participation grades in section are crazy - what does it take to get an A?",
    "Lectures are very interesting. Would have preferred ifbit were in the afternoon. The new policy of having a different TA grade every paper is terrible. I spent the same amount of time on all three papers and hought they were similar quality but got a B-, a D and an A-. If I had gotten those in the reverse order i may have not kept the course credit\/d and then ended up withh a terrible grade because the grading was inconsistent.",
    "Shelly is an incredible lecturer, in fact, the best lecturer I have had at Yale. He exudes passion when he presents the material and makes otherwise difficult concepts approachable. Resultantly, I became passionate about the coursework and actually wanted to dive deeper into the paper topics presented. Additionally, the discussion sections for this class proved more formative than any other discussion section I have had at Yale.",
    "They grade soooooo hard. it's kind of absurd",
    "Interesting topics. Lectures are not always very interactive.",
    "I disliked the way section was graded. The quality and quantity of our comments was what determined our grade - I thought this was unfair to quieter and less confident students. This grading tactic also produced more frenetic and scattered discussion; students felt pressure to contribute, even if it was not on topic.",
    "Strength was student participation in section and depth of lectures. Weakness was that a little it more feedback as to how to successfully write paper.",
    "Shelly really is the highlight of the lectures. He is very animated and very comprehensive in terms of providing all sides of the argument.",
    "Strengths: Kagan is engaging and makes the material interesting and approachable Weaknesses: everyone takes section way too seriously and grading deflation is ridiculous",
    "Shelly is an amazing lecturer. The material is super engaging and interesting. Grading is hard, as you can find out from the course's reputation. Your grade is not correlated with the effort you put in. Put differently, to be able to get a good grade, it is not enough to just put too much time on the paper. You need to understand the papers, and theories very well. If you want to learn the material, yet dont want to stress to much, take it credit D.",
    "Strength: number and timing of formal assignments Weakness: Perhaps an opportunity to discuss the meaning of our readings, hard to participate in section to the participation guidelines because not always called on",
    "This course has very interesting topics but it is incredibly challenging to excel in this course.",
    "As a lecturer, Shelly Kagan is animated and engaging, although his rambling, circuitous style limits the amount of material he can cover in a given amount of time. TA quality was very intermittent: While Yuan Yuan's section was wonderful, Daniel Ferguson's was mediocre and Daniel Moerner's was better spent playing videogames on my laptop than listening to the nonsense that spewed from his foul-smelling maw. The approach to grading, too, was strange. For the first paper, I followed the instructions on the \"How to Write a Philosophy Paper\" handout, spent three hours writing what I believe was a formulaic, boring paper, and received an \"A.\" For the second paper, I spent 8 hours writing what I thought was a creative, inventive, and substantively dense paper (that did not follow the handout's instructions), and received a grade of \"C.\" Rather than evaluating students based on their ability to absorb the readings, this class rewards those students who are most able and willing to twist their minds into the restrictive Kaganic model of what philosophical writing \"is.\" This course would be better if exams were given in lieu of papers, and if Shelly Kagan were made to standardize his approach to evaluation with those of other professors of this university.",
    "Have the same who teaches a given section grade that section's papers. Or at least have the same TAs grade the same students' papers every time. Under the current system, there is little continuity in the grading (what one TA sees as an issue, another does not), but, more importantly, there is no single person a student can talk to about their semester's work. Unless by chance the same ta graded all of one student's papers, there is no one the student can talk to about how he has improved or where he should try to improve going forward.",
    "The strengths of this course were how engaging Professor Kagan was and receptive to students' questions. Another strength was the reasonable workload for the class in terms of reading-totally doable. All courses should assign around that amount of reading-just perfect amount so we can really engage with each author. Another strength was the quality of the discussion section I had. A weakness was the harshness of grading in terms of section participation. I felt no matter how much I improved the quality of my commentary in section, my TA would not give me a better grade. This was a bit frustrating as I made a concerted effort to think before making comments in class. I felt the harsh participation heading disincentivized free discussion as many people were just trying to make random points they thought would impress the TA (including me towards the end because of fear about my grade) vs just engaging without anxiety about the TA. I felt the grading of the essays was a bit too tough as well but am more concerned with the harsh participation grading.",
    "The assigned readings were truly not pertinent to the class. I would prefer that they be tied in to the papers\/coursework or not assigned.",
    "The lectures were fascinating but sections are rather disorganized. They are like shark feeding frenzies for participation, which would be ok if the comments were insightful.",
    "The lectures are incredible. The readings can be dense and superfluous.",
    "Kagan is an amazing lecturer. Class is always incredibly insightful, and engaging as Kagan thoroughly tackles every angle, side, fault in logic, counterargument, and rebuttal with a fun attitude, stimulating a lot of discussion and intelligent debate for sections. Grading is certainly harsh, particularly for an intro course. This unfortunately leads to nearly everyone taking the class Credit\/D\/Fail, which kind of takes away the ambition to do your best and get the most out of the course.",
    "The wording of the paper prompts was a little old fashioned. Didn't appreciate seeing people with mental illness being described as \"The insane\" .",
    "This class is EXTREMELY harsh grading!!!!!!!",
    "I would not change anything about the course. The readings were interesting and pertinent. The essay prompts were thought-provoking and deepened my understanding of the texts we read. Shelly's lectures were captivating and extremely well-thought out. My discussion section was well-organized and solidified my understanding of the lectures. I wish I had received more specific feedback from my TF about my participation in section.",
    "The course structure is perfect. Highly engaged section is amazing. The trouble with philosophy lectures is always that sitting and being told philosophy is not nearly as interesting as thinking about it and discussing it, so lectures were just okay (though I doubt they could be much better than Shelly makes them.) I wished Shelly spent one more lecture on Hume and two fewer lectures on utilitarianism, but mostly I felt that we spent a good amount of time on each idea.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it gives a super broad overview of a few philosopher's ideas about morality (Mill and Kant). The weaknesses are that it's easy to learn so little in this class -- Shelley's lectures move incredibly slowly and aren't engaging at all.",
    "The course is very well-structured and easy to follow in terms of the material. There are many opportunities to get nuance out of this material. Occasionally, it might benefit from some more supplemental reading. One defecit of the anonymous grading policy that professor Kagan uses, however, is that your TF is not allowed to read any drafts of papers, which can inhibit some of the learning process.",
    "very flexible class that didnt sacrifice rigor by having a lower workload. Only apparent flaw seemed to be that Shelly left us with some very unsatisfying conclusions.",
    "Strengths: lectures are very very good (yes 2 verys), emphasis on improvement and progression Weaknesses: quality of course depends quite heavily on TA quality",
    "Anyone considering taking this class knows that the grading is a little harsh, however, beyond this fact Into to Ethics is a wonderful class. Shelly Kagan is one of the best professors I've ever had the pleasure of watching teach and this class is incredibly engaging and fun to be a part of."

    "I wouldn't recommend this course to someone that isn't sure they want to go into philosophy. If they want to try it out, they should take it Credit\/D.",
    "Hands down, this is the best class I have taken at Yale. The high standard demanded for the papers pushes you to thoroughly work out some philosophical positions, rather than just regurgitate the views of others. If you at least somewhat interested in ethical questions, the lectures will be a treat. The readings are not too long, and while Kant is tough to read, it was generally satisfying to engage with the original works. Naturally, the discussion sections will depend on your TA and classmates, but in my case, they were both stimulating, entertaining, and challenging. Be prepared to think your positions through in a thorough manner - you won't get away with the usual well-formulated BS in the section (nor in the essays.) TAKE. THIS. CLASS. It will be so incredibly rewarding if you are willing to put in the required effort.",
    "Yes. Is a must take course. This course improved my ability to write an argumentative more than anything else ever has. Not to mention Shelly is a great professor, and this class is super interesting",
    "Having never taken a philosophy course, I took this course Credit\/D during the spring of my senior year. Shelly will try to convince you NOT to take it Credit\/D because you won't try hard and won't learn much, but I actually feel like I learned an incredible amount just by sitting in lectures and section without doing a single page of reading all semester. Shelly is a fantastic lecture, and this course was a great and thoughtful first experience with philosophy.",
    "I would not recommend this course. (I should note that I am biased because I had to take this for EP&E.) You really learn so little - in lecture, we just go over the same concepts, which are quite easy and could all be explained in about an hour (not an hour each - just one hour total). I do appreciate Shelly's enthusiasm though - he seems to care that students learn. The grading is a bit sadistic, although I Credit Dd, so I didn't need to worry about that. Credit Ding is definitely the move - while it is definitely possible to get a good grade, the grading can be totally arbitrary. One of my friends, who is extremely smart and always gets As, got an A on the first paper and a C- on the second. That is also true of my suitemate.",
    "I had to take this course for my major and did end up taking it Credit D. Yet, I think that if you are invested in learning how to write philosophy papers, this course could certainly be taken for a credit and a high grade earned. It would though take a meaningful time investment, at least in my own experience. In sum, take the course even if just to have Shelley as a lecturer. The man is brilliant, electrifying and absolutely hysterical.",
    "Yes, if you want any idea of ethics and the principles that people have used for hundreds of years to figure out morality and the point of it. Kagan is a good lecturer, he's interesting, and yes, the papers are difficult. I would recommend Cr\/D the class, like most people, because not worrying about grades made this class much more enjoyable for me.",
    "Yes! If you care about philosophy and why we care about doing what we do, this is a must. It is very accessible to people new to philosophy, and if you put in the work, you'll grow so much! Some notes: -People say to sign up Cr\/D, but if you like philosophy or are fascinated by what the course will cover, I think that to do so could be doing yourself a disservice, because the only way to get anything out of the course is to work as if you're taking it for a letter. He scares you at the beginning by saying that \"B means very good, so if you write a very good paper, that's what you get.\" People did get F's on the first paper. However, he throws in the caveat that if your papers improve over time, your later ones will be (perhaps quite) more heavily weighted. The second paper is due right before the Cr\/D conversion deadline, so even if you do sign up credit\/d, then if you don't do well on the first paper, you will still be taking a leap of faith to convert it since you won't have your grade back yet for the second paper. I'm pretty sure the paper deadline is set that way intentionally on his part. But do know that the paper grading gets better and that if you take in the feedback you get on the first paper, you really do have the potential to do well if this is your thing. -The class looks like it isn't that much work... only a required section and three 5-page papers. But be warned... if you want to do well on the papers and you don't have much background in writing for philosophy classes, then you will probably need to start the papers really early in order to have time to organize your thoughts--often I would completely scrap mine and start over with a new idea. His \"How to write a philosophy paper\" is only marginally useful, but I think one important thing is really, just write what you think. Think about what you have learned, and then use that in combination with what you, yourself, think about the issues at hand. You might do better than you think. -Section is required, but if you get a good TF (Daniel Moerner is awesome!), it can be a lot of fun. Go into it with a good attitude and you might be surprised.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wonders about moral obligations and cares about the answer. This class will not be engaging to someone who doesn't pull it into applications in their own life. Especially with the limited assessment, most of the engagement with the material happens on your own time.",
    "Highly reccommend credit\/d even if you get a good grade on the first paper unless that change the policy of a different TA grading eqch one.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class, especially to students who have never before studied philosophy.",
    "It's a great course, but they do not grade fairly.",
    "Interesting topics. Harsh grading. Section participation also counts for an exorbitant amount of grade.",
    "Yes, great insight to ethics",
    "If you are even remotely interested in ethics or philosophy, this is the class to do. If you put in the effort and go to TF's office hours, the grading is also very doable.",
    "Take it if you have to take it or if you want to learn the basics of ethics and have a credit d to spare. Going to lecture is 100% advisable and it's pretty engaging. All the TAs are instructed to take section really seriously and the grading is stupid and ridiculous.",
    "If the student is very interested in philosophy or is ready to commit a large amount of brainpower to this course, I would recommend it. But if the student is only taking it out of mild interest, they will not get much out of this course because of the intelectual intensity it demands to truly grasp all of it.",
    "Yes, take it for sure. Start credit D. Wait for your first paper to see whether you should keep the credit d fail option or move to letter grade.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, as it gave me a strong foundation in ethics, a field which I had never been exposed to before, but I think everyone should be exposed to.",
    "Yes, this course is awesome and Kagan is a great lecturer. The grading in this course is very difficult.",
    "Aardvark! Now that I've got your attention with that ridiculous word, I have a warning: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS (unless it's required, in which case you should wait as long as possible and take it Cr\/D\/F). Many others offer exposure to the same ethical philosophy (DS, Classics of EP&E, and so on). If you really want a serious class on ethics, take Kagan's normative ethics seminar. But don't be lulled into a false sense of security by the extremely light workload (3 5-page papers). This course is intellectually bankrupt (billing itself as a class on \"ethics\" writ large, it considers only western philosophers' work). Kagan is a fascinating man and professor, but his approach to writing papers in this class allows little to no room for creativity or self-directed learning (again, Normative Ethics is a better bet, with its free prompts). WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SAY THAT NOBODY WARNED YOU. Because I did.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to be challenged in terms of thinking, writing, developing both written and oral arguments, without being overworked, this is the class to take. Lecture was always interesting, presented in a very easy-to-digest, applicable to real life manner. It was a class where I really felt I was able to focus more on thought processes rather than just content.",
    "Absolutely! My experience with Shelly Kagan has been one of the defining moments of my freshman year, and certainly of my Yale experience. I believe that any student would greatly benefit from taking this class, or any other offered by him in the future.",
    "I 100% would recommend this course. The content is fascinating, and Shelly does a great job making sure lectures are engaging. The essays aren't too bad, especially if you're credit\/D.",
    "This class is worth taking for the sake of testing your moral mind. Many ideas and ways of thinking are presented that can influence your approach to other fields of study. Worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Even if your major is entirely separate from philosophy - mine sure is - this class represents the beauty of the Yale experience and will change your view on the world. NOTICE: Definitely take this Credit\/D\/Fail if you care about your GPA.",
    "Just talk in section and do a good job on the papers and you will be fine. I didn't do any of the reading, the lecture and section is more than enough to properly understand everything",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS EVER!!!!!! WORST ONE AT YALE",
    "Absolutely. Most intellectually stimulating course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. Philosophy lectures suck. They always suck, but Shelly makes them suck to the least possible degree, and the setup of the course can't be beat. The papers are great and discussion section is amazing. Take it for those things, and get excited! That's the best way to learn and enjoy this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. Shelly thinks quite a lot of himself, but the lectures themselves cover so little material and hold little substance. Shelly tends to talk in circles, and the lecture just don't go anywhere - he could say in a few minutes what he takes a whole lecture to say - so the lectures feel like a frustrating waste of time. By far the best part of the class was my section, led by Yuan, who was amazing - she's so smart, and led a really engaging section. So, if you have to take this class, do it credit d, and try to be in Yuan's section. Besides that, I'd do your best to avoid it.",
    "This course is extremely useful to anyone who wants to improve their writing. I did not find Professor Kagan's grading policies to be overly strict, as the final grade is improvement-based. Definitely worth taking!",
    "Yes, but not as a place to learn your ethics. It's ok to study some of these thing, just like chemists study poisons;not to inflect their blood with it, but to learn its properties.",
    "Definitely! If you credit\/d then you'll probably end up simply not going, so id recommend taking it for a grade. If EP&E I'd definitely save the credit\/d for Intermediate Micro. Overall great class that challenges you without swamping you with work.",
    "Yes, take for the knowledge of philosophical argumentation that will be useful everywhere. don't use credit\/d\/fail on this, you'll be tempted to because of the tough grading standards Kagan says he has, but the improvement you will show over the course will get you a good grade.",
    "Yes. Credit D it if you're worried about grading, but the way Shelly presents the material is so much fun. Great readings too."
