    "the concepts in the BG, new ideas about spirituality and God",
    "So much! This course was essential in developing (indirectly) my understanding of Hinduism and God.",
    "I developed an appreciation for the Bhagavad Gita as a religious text and had the opportunity to read it for the first time. I derived many meaningful lessons from the Gita, and found it to be an enlightening experience. The weekly discussion posts allowed me to engage with the text and ask questions to the professor that always elicited interesting responses. Overall, I developed an appreciation for and understanding of Hindu theology as it relates to the Bhagavad Gita.",
    "The course provides an overview of the main themes and teachings of the Gita.",
    "You learn a lot about India's religious history and the Gita is a interesting text if you allow yourself time to get used to it.",
    "Knowledge about hinduism, its history, and its context. More specifically we developed insight into the Bhagavad Gita and a few translators analyses. Some meditation techniques and practical spiritual advice were also shared!",
    "learned several different views about the Gita's teachings that I didn't know of before",
    "Great course. Helped me understand the practical meaning of the Bhagavad Gita, and how I can apply the teachings to my life",
    "I read the entire translation of the Gita and really got to take an in depth look of many of its elements in a meaningful way.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge from many different perspectives regarding the Bhagavad Gita, and I really enjoyed reading the Gita and the supplemental readings.",
    "a deeper understanding of the Bhagavad Gita",
    "I had never read the Bhagavad Gita before and this course helped me understand what the Gita was all about. Professor Flick's translation of the Gita was simple and easy to understand.",
    "I learned about eastern religion and how it has many practical applications to our lives in terms of living purposefully and happily.",
    "Though the Gita is a religious text, I learned how to conduct my life in a different way apart from the religious nature of the text.",

   "comments": [
    "I wish everyone had been a little more engaged. I was often kind of embarrassed to speak up because everybody else was so quiet. But I liked that we got to do the discussion posts.",
    "Strengths -Professor Flick is so kind, understanding and passionate - the workload allows students to really dive into the material that they read as they see fit -Material is really interesting and applicable to life Weaknesses -Sometimes Professor Flick's understanding nature made it so that students tended to slack off and not participate, which made the course less valuable than it could have been as a seminar",
    "Terrific professor.",
    "The strength of this course is its consistent schedule and workload, which allows students the ability to closely analyze one book of the Gita every week and interpret its meaning. Yet another strength of the course is that the content lends itself to writing papers about the Gita, which were incredibly rewarding. Since Professor Flick encourages students to write about their own personal journeys to find meaning, writing the papers for this class was incredibly compelling.",
    "I feel like this course should be structured a smaller seminar, especially since because of the large class size, many many people did other stuff on their laptops. Strength: Prof. Flick.",
    "I appreciated that the course's structure allowed for detailed discussions of each book of the Gita. I don't see any major weaknesses in the course.",
    "Well organized, curated, and thought out weekly reading list! In class lessons were thought out, comprehensive and include student reading responses. I just wish it could have more student-student\/peer-peer discussion, but I also know that religion can be a sensitive subject so it can be hard to be open about it...",
    "A bit too large of a class for conducive discussion. Discussion posts weekly helped to alleviate that, but still not the same as being able to exchange in back and forth dialogue in person.",
    "The course is well taught, and the translation is written by Prof Flick himself. This is a strength, because we can discuss the text directly with the author, and the weekly discussion forms are helpful in getting to read the thoughts of others in the class too.",
    "Strengths- the pace of the readings makes it very easy to follow along and really dive deep into the narrative.",
    "I really appreciated the freedom that Professor Flcik provided throughout the course in being able to explore different texts and perspectives on the Gita.",
    "weaknesses - I wish we did more small group discussions, because talking directly to such a large class was intimidating",
    "The class did not have much workload and the readings were interesting. The class met only once a week for almost two hours and lectures could get a little dry.",
    "I really enjoyed the way that Professor Flick conducted the class. He would answer the questions that we posed in the discussion forum at the end of the class. I think the only way the class could be improved is greater accessibility to those who did not grow up studying the Gita. I know that the assumed prior knowledge discouraged some people from taking the class though it would have been beneficial for them.",
    "No weaknesses. Everything is amazing."

    "Yes, low stress way to explore your own life perspective",
    "Absolutely. The course is super applicable to life, not an overwhelming amount of work, and incredibly interesting. Professor Flick is also amazing!",
    "YES.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in the Bhagavad Gita and is willing to challenge their assumptions and viewpoints regarding the world. The Gita most definitely changed my approach to many facets of my life, and if you are an open person, you will find yourself growing both personally and intellectually by taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Indian philosophy.",
    "If you are interested in the metaphysical makeup of a human, existential philosophy, and\/or moral commentary then this class should be a good match for you! Interest and openness towards hinduism helps a lot! It can be a lot of new terms in the first two weeks.",
    "This is a very chill class with a low workload and a professor who is very knowledgeable about the literature. You will get as much out of it as you put in.",
    "Yes, take it if you're interested in learning more about the philosophy of Hinduism",
    "Yes, Prof Flick is a great professor, and is very knowledgeable. The course is well organized, and classes are very helpful at understanding the Gita in depth.",
    "Yes, the class can get dull, but the readings and discussion posts are fascinating.",
    "Yes, this was one of my favorite humanities courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes - it was interesting, and a low time commitment. Allowed me to balance a cool class with the more time consuming ones for my major.",
    "Yes! Great 5th class to take and a very good introduction to the Gita.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because the content of this ancient text has caused me to look at many things in my own life very differently and has taught me valuable lessons.",
    "Absolutely -- the class is well-suited to furthering one's own understanding of their religion.",
    "Yes because it teaches you important spiritual concepts."
