   "comments": [
    "Take any one of his classes if you can.",
    "Absolutely take this class if it is offered again! I do not love the Pre-Raphaelites or even British art, but the discussions bring in and relate to a huge range of art historical, historical, and even social thought. Future students will not have the benefit of a major exhibition curated by the professor on view concurrently at the National Gallery, but it will still be a fabulous class! Not too much work, so much fun. Professor Barringer is the best: take anything he teaches.",
    "If, by some miracle, Professor Barringer offers this again, TAKE IT. It is a truly fantastic class.",
    "Whirlwind tour of Pre-Rapahaelites, the movement, people, history, time; history of criticism of the movement, place in history, related exhibitions, study of 2013 exhibition of Pre-Rapahelites and its development, absolutely recommended",
    "Yes! Take it! I would recommend any class with Professor Barringer, but Pre-Raphaelites is a real treat. Prof. Barringer is so passionate about the subject, and for good reason; the Pre-Raphaelites are fascinating.",
    "YES YES YES - Professor Barringer is amazing and the class was incredible.",
    "Take a Barringer course before you graduate, even if you're not a history of art major!",
    "An amazing class with more than enough material to sink your teeth in. The subject is fresh enough to allow each student to bring a new insight into the field."
