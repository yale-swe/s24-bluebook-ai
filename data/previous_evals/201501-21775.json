    "A requirement for the CS major. You have to take it. Good luck, and pick something you're interested in.",
    "If you are a CS major, you have to take it. Otherwise, you can take it if you want to do CS-related research for credit.",
    "Here's my advice for senior project: 1) Choose an advisor you know and are familiar with 2) Choose a project that fascinates you (it will be much easier to work on) 3) Start early (actually :) 4) Try to do a little over a long time It can be a pretty fun class to apply what has been learned in the core CS classes\/ electives.",
    "Chances are that you'll only take CS 490 if you're a CS or CS joint major. It's an amazing opportunity to learn a lot. Make sure you choose a professor with a hands off or hands on approach based on what works for you. Meeting with your adviser each week or every other week does help put the project back on the priority list if it's dropped down.",
    "Well if you're a computer science major you have to. It's not something that's super stressful, but you really get out of it what you put into it. Don't feel pressured to do research if that's not what you're interested. Feel free to make an app, website, or video game -the department is generally supportive of almost any project. Just be sure to pick something you like, and you'll have a great time with this project.",
    "You have to take it if you are a CS major -- if you are not, you may find it difficult to find a professor who has the vacancy to work with you. However, if you are checking out this course in earnest, then perhaps you already know what you are doing and know why you want to do it \/ who you want to work with. So basically take it if you need to \/ know what you want to get out of a CS project and can make it happen!",
    "It's your senior project. Do something you enjoy that is not overly ambitious.",
    "You have to take it, and the requirement is extremely flexible, so take some time to actually think of a project you're interested in doing, and then find an advisor who will support you in it. The worst part of the semester can be not knowing what the final product of your work will be, so at least be committed to one idea going in. You might fall short, but having something concrete to work towards is key. And obviously, don't wait until the last month of the semester to start working.",
    "Go find a professor and do open ended research on a field your interested in."
