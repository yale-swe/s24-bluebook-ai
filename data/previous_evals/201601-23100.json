    "Highly recommend.",
    "Yes!!! Awesome class. Amazing reading list, Homans is wonderful.",
    "Take it! Great class, great professor, great books.",
    "Yes we read really great works and the class is an excellent introduction to queer and feminist literature.",
    "Fantastic books with a great instructor!",
    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough! Professor Homans is an absolutely brilliant and wonderful seminar leader the type of professor who stands in a league of her own among the Yale faculty. I learned more in this class about race, gender, sexuality, literature, and politics through the reading, writing, and discussion in this course than virtually any other context at Yale. Professor Homans gives such thoughtful feedback to her students, whether on papers or in office hours, and maintained a consistently high level of discussion over the semester. The syllabus is incredible, working its way forward from the late 1960s to present with one groundbreaking text after another. Honestly, if you have the opportunity to take a class with Professor Homans, don't pass it up and the syllabus of Imagining Sexual Politics is truly amazing.",
    "This class is so good, especially if you're looking for an in-depth discussion of feminism and race in well-known American literature. The reading list is wonderful, and the workload is challenging but definitely doable (especially the writing - 18 pages over the course of the semester is so manageable and allows you to really focus on writing well rather than just filling a page quota). Margaret Homans is a wonderful, thought-provoking, attentive professor. She will follow up on your comments and press you about why you think what you do, but not in an intimidating way - so there was very little BS and a lot of substance in our discussions. She's really supportive and helpful with paper feedback and just an all-around awesome person.",
    "An excellent class on an important subject. Professor Homans does a great job assembling a diverse syllabus and encouraging students to think critically, and she works hard to keep the discussions grounded in the shared texts. Bear in mind that it is primarily an English class, so if you're more into theory or social science you may be disappointed. As a straight white male, I found it to be a really valuable contribution to my education. Professor Homans is also a genuinely lovely person, and is willing to work with students when they have things going on outside of class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "This class is an overview of feminist texts from the 1960s to the present. If you want an extensive introduction to this era of literature, this class gives you a great starting point. We read A LOT, and not just sections, but full books. It's great.",
    "A great reading list and a great professor, but didn't completely come together as the excellent course I was hoping for. Seminar discussion often stalled. I wish we read more articles and theory to supplement the literature. Paper feedback is great.",
    "You will read incredibly important txt by women writers - many of which you will most likely not have read before. The connections you can draw between the texts are illuminating (and inspired my thesis) - and Professor Homans is the most wonderful."
