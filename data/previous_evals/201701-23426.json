    "This is an excellent class, by far the best class I have taken at the School of Public Health. It is not theoretical, and we go through a wide range of health disparities. Shelley is very passionate about her class, and makes updates to our syllabus to reflect the most up-to-date state of the country. The long final paper is a great learning opportunity for students to apply what we learned in class and delve into a topic that they are interested in.",
    "This class is excellent. The class size was a huge strength. We had less than 10 people, which was great for allowing really deep discussion. People were really honest and willing to engage with one another and the material, and were not afraid to debate when there was (friendly) disagreement. Everyone should be required to take this class, though if everyone were required, the class size would be too big to allow such rich discussion.",
    "Class discussion is student led, which is a benefit to the students leading the discussion but can hurt the experience of the other students in the class. A more structured format where students may feel more comfortable having constructive discussion may be better. Seminar style is great but favors bullshitters and extroverts.",
    "I think it would be beneficial for more lectures from Shelley and for Shelley to lead discussion more. That said, I greatly appreciated the chance to present and to listen to my classmates' presentations.",
    "Professor Geballe is one of my favorite professors at Yale. Her articles are masterfully curated and the timeliness of the topics are spot on. She is an amazing facilitator and created a safe space for each of us in the class to share our selves on some pretty personal and intense social\/cultural\/political topics regarding health. Perhaps a 15 min of lecture would be great before the students lead discussion, but I really loved that she allowed us to express ourselves and learn from each other. I once spoke about my mother in class and Professor Geballe wrote me an email saying how much she appreciated that I shared my personal story with the class. It was truly humbling. She even checked with us from time-to-time to measure how the class is going for us in terms of pace\/workload.I also really appreciated the role-playing\/debate\/real-life fiscal budget in the Connecticut legislature. These experiences really helped me understand real-life processes\/stakeholder dynamics. Professor Geballe is an amazing professor and caring human. It can't get any better than that. I'm inspired by her brilliance and humbled by her humility. Yale is fortunate to have her as faculty."

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an absolutely amazing professor. I have never had a professor who cares so much about her class and treats each of her students as humans. Because we can tell that she devotes so much time and care in preparing each class, I think it motivates students to do better and work harder. She is not only knowledgeable in the several areas we learned about, but is also a passionate instructor. Leaving this class, I think the students feel more empowered to take action about the current state of health disparities in this country.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is obviously amazing. She TRULY cares about her students and about the material. She's a fantastic professor and pushed us to really think about the readings and apply them to health issues that we cared about. I can't imagine taking this class with any other professor. Just take one look at her bio and you'll get it.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe is truly a great professor. She is patient, wise, knowledgable, kind, and pushes her students to do their best. Keep doing what you're doing.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is absolutely wonderful. She is perhaps one of the most caring, wonderful, and exact professors I have ever had. Her advice with regards to my studies, writing, reading, and life in general was invaluable.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Please see above..."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in learning something more in-depth and the theoretical overviews that survey lecture classes provide, this is your chance to develop meaningful connections with the professor and your classmates. Shelley does an amazing job making sure that her students come from a variety of backgrounds, from different schools at Yale to different home and life backgrounds. I highly recommend this class if you are interested in health disparities and social justice, and are ready to devote time to understand the topic better.",
    "One of my favorite classes at YSPH. A really excellent overview on health disparities. Will make you want to dedicate your career to these topics.",
    "It is a survey course of health disparities across a wide range of topics. It culminates in a final research paper. I would recommend it for students who are looking for a smaller classroom setting for a change.",
    "I would recommend this course as an excellent survey of the determinants of health for various groups throughout the United States, as a way to ascertain where-- and to an extent, how-- to intervene, and why it is important to intervene.",
    "The Health Disparities course is honestly the best course I have ever taken at Yale. It saddened me to have our last day of class since I know it's going to be difficult to top. The content of the course touched on all aspects of Health Disparities to give full breadth and depth of the topic and she taught it masterfully. I treasure the articles\/readings for her class since I know I will need to reference them for my thesis. I absolutely and unequivocally would recommend and have recommended this course to other students. We need more courses that talk about the root cause of health issues instead of the traditional symptoms-based approach to medicine\/health\/environment. Courses like this are fundamental to any health and even environmental professional and should continue to be offered."
