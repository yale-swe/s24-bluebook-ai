    "Some of the assignments (recovery plan analysis, op-ed) were very useful and helpful. But a couple of the assignments (write a page about what you've learned, and the pocket guide) were less helpful towards my learning and more just felt like busy work. I would not include those assignments in future courses or see if they could be modified to be made more learning-focused.",
    "There was no participatory application of the frameworks in class. It was all theoretical and up in the air. The class would have benefited from applying the framework to made up or real cases in class as a group exercise for practice. The class would have also benefited from having more discussion - the way the last class went.I felt that the framework was often presented dogmatically. It was this way or no way, which makes me reluctant to embrace it. Dr. Clark is a wonderful and friendly person, but I think her teaching style did not facilitate discussion or engender participation.",
    "Although, Dr. Clark is incredibly knowledge and I found our discussions outside of class useful professionally and personally, but classroom teaching style made it hard to engage in the material. I felt that discussion was stifled instead of facilitated.",
    "The course was well designed and provided very useful conservation tools to students who will engage inacademically or professionally in research and conservation projects. The instructor touched-base critical aspects and factors which are affecting species survival worldwide, including climate change, land tenure and use, and other anthropogenic-based actions. Students worked on individual and group species projects which made the class very useful as students could manipulate data to predict the current and future distribution of their species. This exercise was very important for students, mostly those who are heading to their professional endeavors on species conservation in the field.",
    "The readings were great but perhaps a better explanation of them from the Professor versus the class discussion.Also, the start of of the class was slower with way too many assignments towards the end. It would be better if the assignments were well paced with each class."

    "discussion topics that are not traditionally discussed in most other classes. Encouraged students to think outside of the box.",
    "The field trip was a great opportunity to meet people and get a sense of the conservation landscape in Jackson, WY.Prof. Clark was available and accessible outside of class and genuinely cares about her students.The written assignments in the course were excellent. More clarity at the beginning of the semester in terms of what these assignments would be and where they were due would be helpful.",
    "it is a comprehensive course that included more that ecological concepts",
    "The readings and introduction to the policy process.",
    "Over the summer, I will be assessing great ape distribution and abundance along with their habitat as well as the impact anthropogenic actions on their population shaping. This course has provided me with skills, knowledge and tools which will be used in carrying this project scientifically and professionally.",
    "The field trip was definitely the best part of the course. It was useful to see the different ways thatorganizations approach human-wildlife conflict on the ground. I think the course material is generally useful, but have some qualifications of how it is expressed (see below).",
    "Case studies really helped to make complex concepts more clear",
    "Prof. Susan Clark is the best aspect of this course! She is highly knowledgeable and is an amazing human being. She is great outside class and is supportive of discussions beyond what is taught in class.The content of the class is great too"

   "comments": [
    "Lectures.",
    "The workload in this class was totally unbalanced. There was nothing due before break and then a stack of work required after it. Assignments were worthwhile, but not organized in a manner that allowed progressive learning. The pocket guide should have been required almost immediately to help solidify conceptual understanding of the material, instead of at the end, by which time it was nearly pointless.The syllabus offered no indication of the deliverables, dates, or expectations.",
    "Their was great improvement as the semester progressed on being clear about expected deliverable but it was frustrating for most of the semester as it was unclear what was expected and when. It would also be helpful to have more specific outline of the semester so that we could clearly see where we are going and where we have been. The weekly letters are helpful but it would be nice to know that things were planned a little further in advance. I understand the need to have a flexible semester outline but a little more structure would be nice.",
    "Class time itself would benefit from more discussion, less lecture, and more clear learning objectives for each class.Readings and assignments generally were often not discussed in class, so students stopped preparing. I think it would be more effective to select a smaller number of readings and to provide more structure and opportunity for class discussion.",
    "More structure or discussions facilitated by students would have helped. I think the most useful part of the functional accounting framework is application which we had little exposure too. Casestudies would have been useful to think through the process.",
    "The course was well designed, the content was consistent and it was taught in a way that I leaned a lot from it, and to be used in my conservation projects. I didn't see any needed improvement in the course.",
    "The seminar part of the course was not well organized, often repetitive, and did not enhance understanding of the readings. This course is too repetitive of the fall course and did not add much new material beyond it. The policy process book should have been addressed in the first two or three weeks of class (either the fall course is a prerequisite or students must read the book in the first two weeks of class) and then the class should move on, instead of rehashing the book over the entire semester. The powerpoints were also repetitive - I think we saw the same slide with the eight values at least four times.The outside assignments were useful but could have been spaced differently. The handbook should have been done before spring break.Also, the readings start to seem repetitive after a while (you can only read the phrase 'we introduce a multi-disciplinary framework' so many times). Papers by other authors should be used more often (Brunner, for example).",
    "Structure within and between lectures and more integration between readings, assignments, and lectures",
    "A better clarification of exercises and deliverables."

    "No. The class did a terrible job of teaching the fundamentals before jumping into more abstract components. It is generally assumed that you have taken Clark's earlier class, or perfectly absorbed her book. If either of these are untrue, you're sunk. An organized TA-led section, or perhaps just a few of them, would have gone a long way towards clarifying what was happening in that class.There were very few opportunities for genuinely engagement or debate. Mostly the instructor offered her viewas fact and left it there. That said, outside of class, Clark is extremely approachable and receptive. She pushes you to take your thought process a step further and consider alternatives you had not thought of. I wish the class were taught hanging out with her in a coffee shop.",
