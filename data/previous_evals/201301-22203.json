    "Great introduction to Caribbean poetry! Must take course in AFAM, and a great English credit.",
    "Yes! I enjoyed the class and was exposed to poets I never would have read otherwise.",
    "Definitely take it -- Professor Reed is brilliant and a great discussion leader, and the material is really interesting and important.",
    "In depth readings of works from the Caribbean poets and their contributions to world literature and the ideas of post-colonialism. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for an insight into a very interesting topic, Caribbean literature should be just as important as any other."
