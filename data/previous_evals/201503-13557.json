For instance, organizing case reading materials a little bit earlier or scheduling make-up classes with more notice.",

    "The course structure\/style takes a little bit of getting used to, especially if you're not from a social science background. The professor can ramble a bit at times and can be hard to follow during lectures. However, most of the class is student-led discussion, not lectures, and here the professor does a good job of poking at interesting questions. It is a valuable addition to more application-based CSR classes from the business school, as this course gets you thinking about the \"why\" rather than the \"how\" of CSR."

    "I believe the 3 hour classes are too long, breaking the course into two classes a week would probably be better for students.",
    "The readings could use some fine-tuning, given that they're such a critical element of this class. Less time should be spent on the readings from the earlier half of the semester, which is dominated by governance models and frameworks. 3 hours is a too much time to have to analyze 4 governance readings within a small class. It would be beneficial if the earlier model\/governance articles were paired with concrete examples of CSR so that our discussions could be more grounded. The second half of the semester was more interesting, in my opinion, as we got to pick our case topics. However, we should again strive to keep them grounded in specific examples of CSR innovations (sometimes the readings for the \"cases\" were just governance\/model articles).",
    "I think this course should not be three hours long! we ran out of things to talk about and started talking in circles. The length seems unnecessary for the material we cover, two hours would be plenty of time. Or more topics should be covered per class (but with fewer readings per topic) or the professor should lecture for at least part of the class. I also think the case studies should have been of individual\/company initiatives in different industries (perhaps comparing different initiatives to tackle the same problems).",
    "-Needs more structure \/ formal lectures so we can take the information to another level --it was a lot of shallow analysis that resulted in asking the same questions repeated. -DIRECTLY address in a pre-planned lecture, how to apply all this CSR knowledge in practice --the theories mean something, but how can we take this knowledge with us and apply it!?! --> this is important"
