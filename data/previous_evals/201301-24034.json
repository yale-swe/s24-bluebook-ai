    "Loved that the course was discussion based",
    "great way to practice epi skills with focus on perinatal topics",
    "Strengths: very discussion based. Gives students a great opportunity to hone epidemiology skill, ask questions, and take some leadership of a topic of interest.Weaknesses: It would have been nice to a have a bit more instructor-led background on the topic of perinatal epidemiology.",
    "The course was strong in teaching about perinatal epidemiology methods. The student-led format did not lend itself well to getting a foundation of perinatal public health. We also did not receive feedback throughout the course.",
    "Great discussion format. You learn a lot about different current topics in perinatal health. I liked learning from classmates and having productive discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Very interesting for anyone interesting in perinatal epidemiology, good practice with communication skills and critically evaluating peer reviewed articles",
    "interesting topics, not a lot of work, intimate class setting",
    "A largely student-led seminar on topics of interest to students a professors in the field of perinatal epidemiology. Students who have not had a year of epidemiology first should not take this course, as the course is almost a capstone to the epidemiology learning completed at YSPH. It's a great course to go out on as a graduating second-year MPH student because it solidifies a lot of concepts learned in other courses, and give students a chance to interact with material and ask questions.",
    "The course was a good for reinforcing epidemiology methods. It was relatively unchallenging but the student led format made it a little less educational than it could have been.",
    "Great way to learn in a small group setting. Be prepared to really analyze the papers and learn about a variety of different topics. The presentation was a great exercise in preparing for a prolonged presentation format."
