    "Perhaps the most practically useful MENG lecture offered at Yale. The homeworks might get a bit scary sometimes, but the midterm and finals are very reasonable and a good test of comprehension. Certainly worth taking if you are interested in engines.",
    "This course is not as good as it reviews are. Take it at your own risk.",
    "Great MechE elective that does a really nice job of combining fluid and thermo. Pay attention in class because the textbook is useless - highly recommend buying Shapiro's Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Compressible Fluid Flow. Also, NASA has a bunch of helpful tutorials online that cover the material better than the textbook. Professor Lehrach is great and super approachable.",
    "Propulsion is one-of-a-kind in the MechE department. Lehrach comes from a background in industry and references his past projects every once in a while. The course has weekly problem sets, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. I found the material very challenging at times, but I also had no foundation in thermodynamics after taking MENG 211 last year. (I think most of my classmates were in the same boat.) So this class solidified some of those fundamentals for me. Lehrach would keep hammering home the point to start with continuity, force-momentum, and energy conservation for every problem.",
    "This was one of the classes I enjoyed the most at Mechanical Engineering at Yale - and one of the hardest. I took it as credit D and so did almost half of my class (around 15 out of 30). If you don't have a strong thermodynamics background it might be pretty scary. However, it is a great course, you do learn a lot about propulsion systems and about the thermodynamics\/aerodynamics of propulsion. Ron is a great guy, very kind and comprehensive, and he knows a lot about the subject because he worked in that industry for years. If you are not afraid of taking a hard course with some pretty challenging problem sets, I recommend taking this one! The midterm and final are take-home and are quite doable.",
    "I would shop this class to see if it's something you would be interested in, but yeah, I would recommend it. Some parts are very confusing (like the homework over spring break), but Lehrach is really good at getting back to you if you email him with questions. It's really interesting to see how what we learn in class is related to real world projects. He's also very relaxed with due dates, which can be extremely helpful. It wasn't extremely hard, but can be frustrating if you get stuck. The book isn't the best - it could use some examples, and the problems can be really daunting.",
    "This course was good, but not great. I don't know what everyone was raving about in the reviews last year. This course got great reviews when it was taught last time, so I was really excited about it, but it turned out to be very underwhelming (and I think many of my classmates felt the same way). Certainly does not deserve an \"excellent\" rating. The title \"propulsion and energy conversion\" is a bit misleading. The title of this course should really be, \"thermodynamics of jet engines and rockets.\" That is what the course is about: devices that burn stuff to make things fly. Don't expect power plants or any other kinds of non-aircraft \"energy conversion\" devices. Professor Lehrach is a really nice guy, and it's nice to take a class from someone whose career was in industry instead of academia. However, his teaching was on and off. Often he explained things well, but there were a significant number of times when someone in class would ask a clarifying question and Prof. Lehrach would simply repeat what he had said before. This was very frustrating and unhelpful because obviously if we were asking for clarification, we didn't get it the way he explained it originally, but he would just repeat himself again and again. Eventually, if I was asking the question, I would just give up on trying to understand that part of the material until I could look at the textbook. Overall, this class was okay. If you are someone who loves airplanes and rockets, then you would probably enjoy this course. If you're not that excited about airplanes and rockets, then there are better electives to take. Personally, I wish I had taken Prof. Lee's Photovoltaics class (EE 406) insteada much more interesting type of \"energy conversion\" in my book.",
    "If you did well in fluids and thermo, take this class. If not, I might look for a different class. Part of the secret to this class is to do your homework early so that you can ask questions about it. Also, a lot of them are online if you look hard enough (a lot of finding the solution to one problem and then going back in the directories of the website until you find the solutions to all problems assigned for THAT class).",
    "I learned a lot from this class. Propulsion systems basically come down to a fusion of thermodynamics and compressible fluid flow. I feel a lot more knowledgeable when I fly places now. I can't decide how difficult to say this class is. Often he assigned nice problem sets that were instructive but not too long. The one over spring break was very long. The material was somewhat difficult but once to get the crucial ideas and somewhat of an intuitive sense of how things work, it is better. Exams are take home and open everything, but that doesn't mean that they are easy. Especially because a lot of the stuff is pretty in depth (I.e. You can't really just google it) Grading is sort of old-school.",
    "I was disappointed in this class. It had rave reviews, but I found that it did not live up to them. Whether this was because the previous classes were smaller, or had a better background in thermo, or were just more theory-oriented, I found that the class fell short of my expectations. I thought that it was very inconsistent, with some parts being very difficult, and others being almost too easy. FOr the most part, the class was quite difficult, and there wasn't a whole lot of help available, as there was no TA, and this class is at that point where you can't easily find help online. In short, I would not recommend this class to a fellow engineering student, as there are so many other, better electives that you could take instead.",
    "Jets. Turbojets, ramjets, scramjets, jacuzzi jets. And then a little bit of rocketry at the end. Also very difficult. Take this class if you are interested in jet engines and have a lot of spare time to kill."
