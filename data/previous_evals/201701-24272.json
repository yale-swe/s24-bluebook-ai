    "My ability to perform close readings of French texts and films greatly improved in this class",
    "This course pushed me to analyze text in French. It also gave me the tools necessary to analyze film with a critical eye. On top of that, it helped refined my academic spoken French.",
    "This was my first upper level French literature course. This course really helped me develop my ability to hone in on the skills of literary analysis that I have been developing over the years in English, but in French.",
    "I learned about areas of French literature that I had never engaged with before, and this was my first real exposure to french film. I learned how to talk about film, and I think that my overall french writing skills improved over the course. I also",
    "I learned a lot about close-reading, and specifically about close-reading French language texts, where grammatical operations allow for a different sort of play than that possible in English."

   "comments": [
    "I wish that our discussion of gender could have been more attentive to race and class. I also wish that there could have been more space to talk about French colonialism and the politics of the texts we were reading (e.g. during the week when we read Bouraoui)",
    "The course looks into women vagabonds as represented in literature and film. It fails, however, to always address several major intersections with race and class that sometimes make the discussion a little difficult. A part from this fact the course challenges its students to look at text and film critically, and sharpens the mind to this type of analysis in French.",
    "I felt that this was overall a very strong course. I loved the syllabus, and felt satisfied overall by the discussions we had of the content not in the sense of getting to everything that there was to talk about, but in the sense that I want to keep thinking about the things we discussed!",
    "While the course did offer a variety of ways to approach women vagabonds, my classmates and I felt that it did not adequately address the issue of intersextionality, which was always present throughout the syllabus.",
    "I thought our class was engaging and I learned a lot from the range of texts and films. There were some discussions on colonialism and racism, but I would have like to see more of them. I liked the design of the class, thought it was well paced and the readings were the perfect balance of challenging and manageable. I also really appreciated the variety of films-- all of them were very different from one another, but added another dimension to the topic.",
    "Except for a few titles, the choice of works for this class was superb there are three or four texts that I will take with me long after the end of this course, and almost all were very interesting. The professor is very smart and led lively class discussions. We truly learned how to close-read in French, which was great. The themes of the course (gender and movement through space) were also compelling but perhaps could have been traced with a bit more continuity between texts not by flattening texts into each other, but perhaps by paying a little more attention to theoretical frames."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to any French speaker who is interested in WGSS or Sociology.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. This was my first upper level French lit course, though the course was challenging for me and involved a fair amount of time outside of class, I found it really rewarding I am so much more comfortable now conducting both written and spoken literary analysis in French. Professor Cadieu is wonderful: great at leading discussion, incredibly smart, and just a really kind, thoughtful person I would recommend taking anything you can with her, though this is an especially good syllabus.",
    "I loved this class, but I will warn I credit\/D it. Which was a great choice. I read interesting novels and had great class discussions but I didn't have to worry about the essays. I just had to write them and know I would probably be fine. Such amazing books. It is a good amount of reading for each class, which was sometimes hard to keep up with, but the class discussions and the way she facilitated conversations made the reading worth it.",
    "Yes. Thought it was engaging and really interesting, plus the workload was nicely paced out. and I loved Morgane Cadieu.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in a) getting to read formally interesting contemporary french lit and b) really learning how to close read in french. Furthermore, take this course if you want to be taught by a truly intelligent professor (who is also a native speaker, which is really nice). Prof. Cadieu's textual analysis is deft and insightful, and she's obviously very smart, which makes being in her classroom a pleasure. I appreciated, too, that she would pause to teach us relevant information (vocab, grammar, little facts, types of discourse), even though this was not the core of the course. My one personal criticism is that sometimes the classroom could feel kind of sterile as if there was nothing but the text, and no history or social sphere outside of it, or as if we in the room had no relation to anything being discussed, and were simply nodes of raw, \"neutral\" intelligence doing objective operations on its contents. More generally Prof. Cadieu maintains an impersonal vibe, which it is certainly her right to do. However, there are some academic consequences that could have perhaps been attenuated (within a still fairly impersonal academic sphere) by a bit of meta-attention to the acts of reading and interpreting that constituted the core of the course. Overall, however, Prof. Cadieu is one of the better professors I've had at Yale, and her selection of books\/films is for the most part great. Recommended."
