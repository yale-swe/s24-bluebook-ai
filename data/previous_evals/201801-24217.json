   "comments": [
    "I have learned so much! This was my first time taking a class in which case studies were such a tool for learning and it will not be my last. The chance to apply basic theory as well as discuss real life scenarios and events was exhilarating. I, of course, learned a ton about entrepreneurship, social enterprise and impact investing.",
    "An in depth understanding of the social enterprise sphere covering everything from NGOs to social investment.",
    "So much knowledge on how social enterprises works, all the challenges of the organizations and successful initiatives. Awesome part on impact-investing as well. Teamwork too as the class is centered around a team project with a social enterprise in Africa in the summer. All the preparation and knowledge become practical (no other class at Yale like that).",
    "This class was a great introduction to the social enterprise space and questioning what it is, who it benefits, and how. It followed a case study structure where we looked at cases (from HBS and elsewhere) on the dilemmas facing different \"Social entrepreneurs,\" some of whom ran non-profits, others businesses, that sought to either engage or address problems facing people at the bottom of the pyramid. Considerations that organizations\/entrepreneurs need to take to be successful. Feelings of people who engage with these organizations.",
    "Learned about the theoretical framework behind social enterprises, impact investing, and completing case studies",
    "I knew nothing about business or issues of development, let alone specifically social enterprise, before this semester. Bo's class was such a great introduction. I really liked the structure: the readings and discussion on Mondays provided a solid technical understanding (the readings and Bo's explanation were digestible and not too complex), and then the cases on Wednesday were a great way to put the actual skills into practice. I learned general business skills such as mapping out a business model, the different actors, value proposition etc.; I also learned skills specific to the social enterprise\/impact space, like evaluation metrics for impact investors and different ways of measuring social impact.",
    "GLBL 305 changed the way I think about how businesses, nonprofits, and governments can work to resolve intractable social and economic problems. Perhaps more importantly, GLBL 305 helped me better understand entrepreneurship conceptually and practically and its enormous utility. We read a decent number of business school cases for the course - reading and responding to those is much different from a lot of the academic reading \/ thinking \/ writing we're expected to do at Yale. Responding to business cases helped me to consider how to implement theory (from this and other classes) to practice."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course structure is flexible: I think this is good because it allows the professor to adapt to the interests and pace of the class; it also reflects the nature of the field in which the class is based. (Note: it is not that flexible--just a few readings may change). The structure of the course is conducive to thinking like an entrepreneur, in some small way. The bulk of the learning comes from working on team projects, which do not--and cannot--follow a set structure.",
    "The one weakness is perhaps that you have to take it for two semesters, but this is also a strength as it is an incredible course with an incredible instructor.",
    "Strengths: All the preparation and knowledge become practical (no other class at Yale like that). Weaknesses: Maybe some quantitative analysis exercises can be included --> all was essays and responses and QA was indirectly made in there",
    "Wonderful class, would highly recommend. Am looking forward to the trip to Africa this summer and the rest of the course in the fall semester. Really enjoyed the case learning structure and chance to look at things from a practical point of view since so many of my courses\/yale courses are purely theoretical. Also one of the few yale courses to really focus on poverty alleviation which is so so important!! you would think there's more courses on poverty at yale but nope. Bo is an amazing professor and good at asking difficult questions + provoking discussion. also really loved my classmates because I think the course attracts at least people who care about the world\/ want to make a difference in the poverty\/development space",
    "How the spring term of the course goes is very dependent on the level of engagement from your host organization and their responsiveness",
    "So far, the course is great. I think a clearer definition of social enterprise could have been established earlier on; in the first couple of weeks, the definition was very nebulous and was a kind of checklist of things like, \"has a good social entrepreneur leading it!\" which was a bit recursive. Once the course progressed, the definition became much better defined. I think an earlier discussion of how both sides of a social enterprise - the financial returns and the social impact - are measured, could lead to a quicker understanding of the exact nature of the balancing act of a social enterprise. A strength that was great for my group was our pairing with GETF, and Brian and Dr. Nyarko in particular. They, especially Brian, have been so fantastic and involved; we had a specific project from as early as halfway through the semester, and established a recurring, regular fortnightly skype call so we always had new things to work on throughout the semester. This is something all students should do, as it let us get started on the work for that side of the class during the first semester, while also learning the principles of social enterprises in the regular class sessions.",
    "Professor Hopkins is very knowledgeable, engaging, and supportive. He chooses a similarly exciting group of people and the class focuses on genuinely fascinating (and urgent) issues. My only constructive criticism might be that the class could benefit from a no laptops policy - I know that I was guilty, along with others, of getting distracted during the class (because the style is conversational and the summer project requires a lot of logistics, it's easy to find oneself on Google Flights). Professor Hopkins also provides an enormous amount of support with planning for the summer project, including help with fellowships."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. The chance to work on a project (which I think is the real sell of the class) for an entire year, including field research across the Atlantic, is something that most undergraduates will not do. It is relevant to almost everything that one might want to do. It looks good on your resume. You learn a bunch of transferrable skills--academic, professional, life skills. The professor is a dope teacher and very chill person; he knows a lot about this stuff and is incredibly personable.",
    "If you have any interest in social investment or working for an NGO, take this class. You wont regret it.",
    "DEFINITELY!!!! ALL THOSE GOLDMAN SACHS PEOPLE SHOULD BE TAKING THIS CLASS! You will see an alternative to traditional finance and business.",
    "yes",
    "Yes yes yes! Learn a lot and very cool summer projects",
    "Highly recommend! Bo is a warm and funny lecturer, the class attracts some top-notch fellow Yalies who care about the \"bottom of the pyramid\" often with personal connections to the issue or region (the class is focused on Africa), and you really explore problems that come from outside of the Yale bubble. You're exploring important issues and an exciting new\/growing space, and it gives you hope for ways through which markets can push equality and economic fairness. Also, the class means you actually have a chance to go to Africa--am excited to see how our project turns out!",
    "Yes!!! This course is very practical and hands-on in its approach to real world problem solving, which is rare to find at Yale",
    "I absolutely would. It has been great so far, and I am very excited for the summer and for next semester!",
    "100% definitely. The course is two semesters, and I've only completed the first so far (but I'm very excited for the second which is probably a good sign). This has been one of the better courses I've taken at Yale because it helps join theory with practice."
