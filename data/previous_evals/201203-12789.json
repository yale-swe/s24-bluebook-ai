   "comments": [
    "Stressful but survivable. I would not recommend it unless you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend the lab to a student taking the accompanying chem 115 and plans on majoring in science. I would not recommend the course to a nonscience major, because the lab does not correlate that direction to chem 115.",
    "Chemistry 117L 01 is basically taking what you learn in your chemistry 115 01 class and seeing how those theories work in real life. I highly recommend this class because it made me feel so much more comfortable with my ability in chemistry since now I have a brief understanding of how chemistry is used outside of just theoretical calculations. Also, it improved my lab abilities by teaching me how to work efficiently and understand what I'm actually doing during the procedure instead of just blindly following instructions.",
    "It's a long four hours of lab, and lab reports are stressful, but it is what you make it. I actually started to enjoy it after the first three weeks, as I got used to the rhythm of the course.",
    "I would take this lab if you are currently enrolled in gen. chem. lecture because the two go hand-in-hand.",
    "I would recommend you do not take this course.",
    "Take ONLY to fulfill a requirement.",
    "This is a basic lab course. Experiments are comparable to AP chem-like procedures (i.e. spectrophotometry, titrations) but are typically more in-depth than AP chem. The lab is 4 hours long (1 hour for pre-lab lecture and quiz, 3 hours for the actual experiment) so it is VERY laborious, time-consuming, and requires a lot of concentration. Don't let that come as a surprise to you. If you're pre-med, chances are you'll have to take this to fill a requirement anyways.Overall, I'd recommend. Especially considering that pre-meds don't really have a choice.",
    "The labs aren't as bad as people say. Obviously, you're only taking this because you have to. If you work quickly, you can be out of lab anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour and a half early. The labs are easy. The real work is doing the lab reports. There are full lab reports due each week and a prelab quiz before each lab session. When you're done with your experiments, you turn in your handwritten procedures. The reports could be challenging (some of the calculations were confusing) but they were mostly tedious and repetitive.",
    "This is a basic lab course. The experiments and lab reports are a lot of work, but it could be a lot worse. Always make sure you are focused when you come to lab.",
    "It's a course people only really take because they have to, but, that being said, with the right attitude this lab is fine. The lab reports can take a long time but collaboration really helps.",
    "According to many people, GenChem lab is the most difficult lab at Yale because of the sheer amount of time you have to put into prepping for quizes and lab days. Though I don't agree, I do feel like many people either end up putting a lot effort in to reach for that 95% A or just give up because it is so much work and only half a credit. With that said, I loved Dr. G! I was kind of miffed that he was not actually teaching our course because he a class simultaneously with ours; however, he was always open to having you come in during office hours and made a point to drop into our lab room two or three times throughout the day. And definitely utilize office hours! Unlike the TAs, Dr. G will give you straight answers about what to write in your report.",
    "I would recomend it. It goes along well with chem 115 and the instructions are clear.",
    "This was a basic general chemistry lab course that covered what you need to know in order to take upper-level chemistry labs. Definitely take this if you need it as a major\/pre-med requirement!",
    "I had not realized how fast paced it was going to be. Labs range from very simple to very difficult. The final exam, where all of your skills are supposed to come together, was quite stressful. The quizzes prior to each lab were painful and the lab reports are harshly graded. Take the class if you need it for your major.",
    "4 hours, 1 lab report, 1 pre-lab, 1 lab quiz every week. Only .5 credits. A 95 is an A, which is pretty difficult to get because losing points on lab quizzes and on the practical is fairly easy. Overall, things are stacked against you, especially for a half credit class. Take it only if it's a requirement or if you are willing to devote the time of a single credit to only a half credit course.",
    "It's a lab, and so the amount of work it requires does without saying. You'll spend a lot of time on reports and writing your sheets during lab is stressful but Dr. G is really nice and very approachable with questions. The labs themselves aren't too insane and it's not too difficult to follow through with the calculations in the report sheets but make sure you know excel!",
    "It was a relatively easy lab, not to much work except for the lab report write-ups once a week. It is the same lab program as my high school however and so the labs seemed redundant to me.",
    "Definitely take this class! Be forewarned that this class takes up just as much time if not more than that of classes worth one credit or more though.",
    "This lab is work-intensive, with huge lab reports every week. Don't take it for kicks. However, if you need Gen Chem lab for some reason (major, pre-med, etc.) don't despair. If you have really, really good lab preparation from Yale or high school, this lab may not seem impossible at all.But if it does seem awful and just too hard, suck it up and ask for help. Dr. G is so willing to meet with students and help them out if you just ask nicely. Also, DO NOT do your lab reports the night before--plan ahead! Basically, CHEM 117L is like that part in any superhero movie where it seems like said superhero is just not going to make it out alive but does. If you're really determined to succeed in CHEM 117L, it's possible, but you just have to find the strength within yourself to do so.",
    "Chem lab is something you have to do if you are pre-med, but other than that I would not recommend taking this course. The quizzes during each class are difficult and unpredictable, and the labs are graded harshly, making it hard to get an A. Lab took more time and work than most of my other classes, even though it was only worth half a credit.",
    "I didn't like it overall, it was stressful and long. Only really take if you have to.",
    "Chem 117L is a challenging lab; you have to work hard to be successful. The lab reports can be time-consuming and difficult at times. This lab is usually taken to satisfy a requirement (typically the pre-med requirement) however, if you want lab experience, this is a good introductory lab to gain exposure."
