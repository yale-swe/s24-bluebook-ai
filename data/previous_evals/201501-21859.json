    "Yes, for sure! KREN 140 01 is a very fun class. Even though it is a higher intermediate level, I do not find the assignments to be stressfull. Instead, they are very fun to do. I definitely learnt a lot.",
    "KREN 140 is an L4 course that will really help you with your speaking proficiency. I recommend that if you take L3, it will be extremely helpful to take this course to refine your abilities.",
    "! I feel saddened to think I won't get to spend more time taking Korean. is one of the most dedicated, personable, funny professor I've had the privilege of learning from. My class felt like a family (there were 8 students) and I really didn't mind getting up every day for this 9:25am class. She has a clear focus on teaching useful language skills, like speaking and listening. The workload is actually more manageable than what I got in her L1 and L2 classes. By L4, the focus is on developing (again) speaking and listening skills, as well as the more difficult colloquial grammar required to approach language proficiency. I highly recommend the class.",
    "If there is one thing I regret from my 4 years here at Yale, it would be not taking Korean earlier. I enjoyed starting my days off with the bright and bubble Professor Lee and my classmates. It was truly a great cultural and language learning experience.",
    "A great (fourth) class in Korean! In L4, you mainly focus on expanding your grammar and vocabulary for use in a wider range of realistic scenarios. A lot of the class is spent working on speaking and listening, both prepared and impromptu. The class is fun and engaging (for 9:25 in the morning) and you learn a bunch about Korea idiosyncrasies, culture, and destinations to visit in the process. Professor Lee is amazing! Take a class with her if you can, she is the absolute best language teacher. When it was clear that nobody in the class knew how to do quotations, she immediately switched to teaching us quotations and we spent the next couple days learning how to use the grammar structure. It turned into the most useful thing ever! She also makes delicious Korean food on Fridays for our class and KREN 142. Korean, though small at Yale, is an awesome language. Workload is great too, 1 occasionally 2 small assignments a day."
