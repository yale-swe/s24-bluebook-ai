   "comments": [
    "You get a great base overview of biotechnology and how to write grant proposals.",
    "This course offered a comprehensive overview of design thinking and implementation in low-resource settings, which was presented with relevant statistic and qualitative analysis. Professor Gonzalez tasked us with thinking critically about existing infrastructure and the social implications of these target areas, and encouraged us to understand the limitations to be faced by a given intervention. While some emphasis was placed on understanding the underlying principles of the innovations themselves (e.g. vaccine development), the bulk of our time was spent discussing the applicability and appropriateness of existing programs rather than product development and grant writing.",
    "I have never taken a global health course before and the information in this class was so interesting, and helpful, and incredibly engaging. The ability to work in a group to consider a variety of factors and come to a final project and presentation was amazing and are skills that can be translated to any field.",
    "Gained a very broad understanding of global health and the challenges of implementing biotechnology. The class covered very applicable and relevant material such as how the Gates Foundation grants worked.",
    "This class taught me about how I can apply engineering and science to help the developing world- quite a unique topic because the intersection of these two is not taught elsewhere at Yale.",
    "By the end of the semester, I felt as though I could actually go out and design a real biotechnology with real impacts, which was pretty cool.",
    "I hoped that I would gain more skills going into this course. The first few days were very interesting, and we got experience writing and developing a grant proposal, but I feel like I did not learn a lot about the specifics of global health and biotechnology. The class jumped around a lot.",
    "I learned about many of the important considerations in developing biotech for the developing world. This course taught not only scientific concepts, such as the basics of vaccination and the immune system, but also about the socio-political and economic aspects of biotechnology and the challenges it faces in the developing world. We also learned about the work of many organizations currently attempting to improve health in the developing world, and our incredibly distinguished and varied guest speakers provided interesting insights into fieldwork and current research. Finally, we gained hands-on experience in analyzing and generating proposals for the developing world.",
    "The class gives a general overview of different applications of biotechnology within the developing world. I would have appreciated more depth into subjects, as I feel as though we were only given a cursory glance of topics that I would have liked to delve further into. I thought the variety of guest speakers really contributed to the course, given we had everyone from the former head of MSF to a graduate student working on implementing low-cost toilets in rural regions. The material was also nearly always interesting and engaging.",
    "I have gained valuable insight into how to properly implement a technology into a developing country. There are many aspects of this kind of work that I had never considered before taking this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the concept of the class was really cool, but to be honest some of the lectures fell flat of my expectations...like I think that a lot of the lectures were too basic and about stuff that most of us already knew anyway. It would have been better if we focused more on case studies of specific technologies or had more guest speakers rather than learning generic info about global health.",
    "I wish that this class focused a little more on the final project, throughout the course of the class. I think it would have been really cool to see everyone physically develop prototypes.",
    "Strengths: Prof Gonzalez is really great and engaging professor Weaknesses: lectures could be dry and unorganized, requirements for assignments were usually posted late and kind of unclear",
    "This course is highly accessible, with only a basic knowledge of biology and engineering methodology necessary - and if you are uncomfortable with the level of science in discussion, it's nothing a quick read of the assigned literature wouldn't fix. The course's strengths lie in the animation and enjoyment of Professor Gonzalez, as she guides the class through frank discussion of the reality of global health interventions. The emphasis on lasting effects of application and cultural understanding was refreshing as well, and poses a unique opportunity for growth following general science courses. I had hoped that the class would be more structured towards biomedical engineering principles, with distinct examples and criticisms of existing programs. However, this gave us more time to focus on wide ranging ideas, so this was not a loss.",
    "I'll start with weaknesses. Some of the flaws involved just some curiosity about the breakdown of our grade throughout the class. In addition, I was a little stressed about the prospect of finishing a project to help the developing world, it seems so heavy. The strengths of the class was Prof. Gonzalez and the knowledge that she had to impart. In addition, the workshops and guest lectures did a lot to enrich my learning from people who have lived it first-hand and get my hands on the technologies that we talked about.",
    "The course was extremely interesting. It covered very relevant material in often untraditional ways. Gonzalez's focus on group work and practical problem solving methods made the class more engaging. Overall, the workload was fairly light which allowed me to dg deeper into the material that interested me the most. Overall, I felt like Professor Gonzalez did a wonderful job teaching the material.",
    "The course teaches a lot about the design thinking process and the organizations that encourage technology development that is applicable to impoverished settings; I wish we did more class sessions where we learned how to build things and utilize different tools because I am not quite sure how to go about manufacturing technologies- I had to rely on others for this.",
    "The class was very great and we evaluated a lot of important issues in global health. I wish the class was a little bit more discussion-oriented. I know it is a STEM class but I think a lot of great things could have emerged if we were to have an open discussion about some of the topics in class. It seemed a lot of times like a smaller lecture.",
    "I think this class could use more structure. There was a lot of interesting material, but there was not a clear progression throughout the class and I did not feel like I got a full picture of the field or an in-depth picture of any technology specifically. We spent a lot of time talking about design thinking, but I'm not sure exactly what I learned from this process. We didn't use design thinking when building our final products and I feel like the concept of it is seeped in buzzwords that don't provide to the classes educational experience.",
    "One of the major strengths of the course is Professor Gonzalez, who is committed to making the course as great of an experience as possible. She went out of her way to set up an incredible array of guest speakers, ranging from an expert on research ethics to the former International President of Doctors without Borders, which provided especially interesting insights. Although the microfluidics and heart rate monitor labs were interesting, one suggestion would be to substitute these with in-depth case studies of specific biotech interventions, which would be an interesting way to learn about the factors that determine the success or failure of a technology.",
    "I was most looking forward to this class at the beginning of the semester, but I think I might have had too high of expectations for the course given my prior interest in the subject. While the professor was extremely enthusiastic and the material was always super intriguing, I felt as though actual class discussion and engagement fell flat. Nearly no one spoke and the attempts made to engage the class were halfhearted. There was one kid who answered all the questions, and nearly everyone else was on their laptops. Moving forward, I would institute a no laptop policy and make the class more of a seminar format. I also didn't really understand the final project. While it was cool to create a Gates Grant proposal, there was absolutely no attention paid to the technology behind said proposals and many groups presented concepts that they had no idea about how to actually implement. If there is no technical knowledge required for the class, it did not make sense for the final project to be a technical proposal.",
    "I had such high hopes for this class! Maybe that was the issue. I expected that the class would be far more project-based (class time would be used to lay the foundation for biotechnology methods and assisting students in their project development). But, instead, the class was led like a disjoint mini lecture with 2 projects thrown into the mix with minimal coaching and support."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course but know that it is VERY on your own. That is, the assignments are pretty much up to you to do, which I didn't love but if that's your learning style go for it. The lectures could seem a little pointless at times but that might just be me. The project at the end was as interesting as you made it.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "I would recommend this course because Professor Gonzalez was a really great professor who cared a lot about the success of her students. However, the course was not very well organized and the requirements of assignments were often unclear.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student - although it should be understand that the course itself is not particularly oriented towards engineering. Rather, the class focus on human-centered design thinking and evaluation of existing programs. But if you take this class for anything, take it for Professor Gonzalez, who is an incredible and inspiring human being. She provides comprehensive discussion of the appropriateness and applicability of any innovation, and encourages you to be aware of the real needs and preferences of those you intend to aid. This core understanding is vital for any real-world health intervention, and I strongly encourage you to take this course.",
    "Take this course! It's such an amazing experience and the knowledge you gain goes beyond creating technologies for the developing world--it's about having the the insight about design thinking and keeping in mind the perspectives of your target. I highly recommend. There are exciting guest lectures and great workshops and you get to work towards a project that could actually be submitted to the Gates Foundation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to everyone at Yale!",
    "I would recommend it if you are passionate about applying a scientific background in the developing world.",
    "I would not recommend the class as it was taught this semester. Professor Gonzalez is a very interesting and engaging lecturer, and I feel like with significant changes to the calendar and the syllabus this course could be good.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about and designing interventions to improve health in developing nations. The course covered a wide array of subjects, culminating in the final project where we designed a technology for the developing world. I think the most valuable takeaways from the course were not necessarily specific facts or knowledge, but rather an understanding of the process of developing biotechnology and the important considerations to critically think about and evaluate an intervention.",
    "I would recommend this as a fifth class, as it does contain interesting material and does not have too much work. That being said, I hope there is some reconfiguration of how the course is taught to increase student engagement. The professor and TA were both lovely people, the material is fascinating, and yet something fell flat. It was as if no one really invested time and effort into the class, which made me so sad because there is so much potential in the course itself. If you are interested in the subject, as I was, I would still recommend taking it because you will enjoy the work that you do. However, I do hope that there are some changes made to the course structure itself to make it more of a priority in students' eyes as well as a more enjoyable experience within the classroom itself.",
    "I don't think I would recommend the course to other students. I generally felt like my time in class was being wasted on unhelpful and irrelevant lectures when it could have been used more effectively and productively on actually learning about biotechnology and being guided on how to propose\/prototype an innovation. In the end, it felt like the projects were a rushed afterthought and not the focus of the course.",
    "Yes! any student in any major should take a course like this sometime during their Yale career."
