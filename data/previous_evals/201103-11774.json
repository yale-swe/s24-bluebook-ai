    "Yes! If you have some French knowledge before, you can definitely take this course. It was a little bit struggle for me at first, but I finally caught up and found it very rewarding! Also, take this class with Mme. Skorupa!",
    "If you place into L2, do whatever you can to get Madame Skorupa. I personally dropped from L3 to L2 because I needed more practice speaking. The course itself is well constructed, although it can get a little work intensive once in a while. You'll be watching 3 really great french movies, and the readings are interesting. My only complaint was the tedious workbook. Skorupa is a gem...the best professor I have had at Yale thus far. She is absolutely amazing. You will learn a lot.",
    "TAKE IT (w\/Madame Skorupa =) ).",
    "I would absolutely recommend it",
    "Take it with Skorupa - she's the reason I passed French this semester, and is WONDERFUL. I actually looked forward to going to class every day."
