   "comments": [
    "Math 231 is an intensive course that builds on Math 230 and develops toward Stokes' Theorem, discussing manifolds and differential forms. I would recommend the course as long as you're aware of the time commitment and really enjoy the material. As an art student, I was especially interested in visualizing the manifolds, and I thought this semester included more topics with interesting spatial implications than the previous one.",
    "If you really want to get to know calculus-- like REALLY understand what's going on, you have to take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who really wants to learn math.",
    "You are probably taking this after 230. I'll try to outline some of it.Basically you will be learning some basic topology, stuff about manifolds, and using this knowledge to get to results in vector calculus like the general stokes theorem.I liked the material in this semester better than the first semester (we got to apply the implicit function theorem, learn about quadratic forms, lagrange multipliers) but I felt that the treatment was too rushed, especially towards the end. Especially when we got to topics like manifolds with boundary and orientation, we didn't go much into the details, which often I felt were the most difficult.Overall it is a good class, being an introductory level course. After taking it I would recommend doing review on vector calculus though.",
    "This is an awesome course with an awesome professor. If you have any interest in math, take it, and put the time in. It is well worth it.",
    "When I started with math 230 in fall, I felt that the course was somewhere between one of the hardest and one of the most demanding courses I could have ever imagined to take for freshman year. Thankfully it got better with time and my 231 experience was definitely better: my Psets did not take 25 hours of my week anymore, they took around 15 and I understood more. The TA's were much more lenient on grading, which took some pressure off too. Professor Biringer was great, his office hours were still helpful. Midterms for both 230 and 231 were tough, but the finals were better, especially since we got better guidance for exam prep for the finals. It is just as much work as 230, but I feel that you will appreciate and understand more during 231. Definitely worth taking once you are prepared to put in a LOT of time.",
    "Take it - if you are willing to put in the work.",
    "MATH 231 is significantly harder than 230. If you're not going to be a math major, I'd suggest considering using Cr\/D\/F for this course (I should've). To succeed in this course, odds are good that you will need to get help; I didn't, and my grade probably suffered for it. Remember that this course won't actually teach you anything practically applicable to engineering\/physics courses; it's severely theoretical. That said, this course introduces beautiful theorem after beautiful theorem, all culminating in the marvelous generalized Stokes's theorem, which is awesome. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who made it through MATH 230.",
    "If you love theoretical math, this course will prove challenging but very rewarding - I recommend it highly. If your interest is in practical math, choose another course.",
    "I thought the semester this year went really well. We built up on material learned from Math 230 last semester and learned some very fundamental objects such as manifolds, and forms. The course requires a lot of hard work and dedication to math, but if you are prepared to stick to it, it should be manageable. It's a fun course that shows you why some of the most fundamental things in maths are true, and anyone thinking of being a math or a physics major, I think, should take it.",
    "While other classes spend more time on calculations, Math 231 focuses on the principles and proofs behind the theorems. It is a lot of work and probably only for those with a great interest in Mathematics, but it is also extremely interesting and rewarding.",
    "Math 231 is just a continuation of math 230. It's a great course, at least with Biringer, and I would recommend it for anyone who took 230. It is an absolute must for any math major because it is a rigorous introduction to upper level math.",
    "It's like 230 all over again! We learned all about manifolds and integration and differential forms and Stokes's theorem. Problem sets were harder this semester.",
    "Just as in Math 230, Math 231 is a rigorous and often difficult yet interesting overview of mathematics necessary for upper level classes. You will come out of this class able to understand several fundamental proofs. The end of the course is more difficult and a bit fast, but the professor is extremely helpful during office hours and over email. The problem sets are usually 10-15 hours, so be ready to commit to this class (although you'd have take Math 230 by now, so why not). If you're interested in being a math or physics major, try it.",
    "Highly recommendable. I still wonder why we did not do lesbegue"
