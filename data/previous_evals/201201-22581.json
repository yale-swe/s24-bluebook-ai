    "this course is LEGENDARY and with good reason! the professor is really excellent: kind, funny, and engaging. the discussions are always really interesting and full of life and readings are very good. this class has an excellent balance between",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "eClavdia is a well-designed course that is unique because it uses a diverse range of teaching approaches. Diana Kleiner has incorporated online videos, a \"web portal\" of biographies of women, primary and secondary sources, and a forum. Each class will never be the same as the next, as we often would break up into debate teams or visit the gallery to look at coins. It's designed to be a fun class that really enlivens the Ancient Roman society. I would say that in order to fully enjoy this class, you must be prepared to put in an inordinate amount of time for each week's readings\/movies\/activities and for the midterm and final project, none of which is easy. Hopefully in the future, the workload might be reduced, but for now, just beaware, and don't take 5 credits with eClavdia! That would only take away from the experience.",
    "If you're interested in the connections between art and society, women's status in Ancient Rome, or simply participating in discussions with a great seminar leader, I'd recommend Women in Ancient Rome. I thoroughly enjoyed most of the readings and class itself. Professor Kleiner is wonderful.",
    "Yes! You'll learn something new, especially if you aren't super versed in classics. Sometimes the art history element of it is on the light side though."
