I was able to go to NYC several times to conduct 13 interviews with these high level officials. Each one was very open and enthusiastic to speak with me, which was encouraging. The end of the semester opportunity to then present these findings at the UN was a huge honor and fantastic experience.The student-driven creation of the questionnaire was also a good learning experience, especially for those students who have never conducted semi-structured interviews.",
    "Different format from most years - project-focused format was unique and interesting opportunity.",
    "The best aspect of the course was the experiential learning which allowed for much deeper learning than simply engaging with reading material. The course presentation process was a very tangible way to drive home this learning."

    "Collaboration, innovation",
    "The students in this class were all very competitive, yet many did not meet their obligations to the class. I think students became very discouraged when they couldn't secure meetings with the specific ambassadors they wanted to speak with. Even though the professor and other students offered interviewing opportunities, very few students in the class actually took advantage of this.I think students need to enter this type of class only if they are willing to be open minded and flexible. A lot of clashing personalities made class meetings sometimes very painful or onerous, due to the level of debating and arguing occurring. Some students I think achieved very little but still received the same benefits and opportunities as students who put many hours into contacting missions and obtaining interviews.Overall, this class definitely required a large time commitment, a greater one than many students anticipated. I think the division of 1 - 3 credits made this difficult for students to grasp. I would recommend that all students take this course for 3 credits and be required to attend a certain number of interviews, as there were plenty of opportunities to do so even if a student's own outreach failed. I also think those students who complete the most number of interviews should be given priority in presenting on results and a fair contribution to the final paper, rather than just arbitrarily assigning these roles.",
    "Multiple perspectives helpful, but more so when all involved have some shared basic level of knowledge and command of the subject matter.",
    "The group work really helped strengthen the couse, although group work near the end of the semester became somewhat strained due to high stress environments."
