    "The professor of this course was terribly disorganized and was regularly rude to the students. He frequently arrived in class late, and expected students to stay after the class had officially ended. His assignments were given on an ad hoc basis, and he did not provide some students with the main component of the course, the internship with a mission at the United Nations.",
    "This class was very intersting to take because it is divided in two sections: a theory part and a practice one. Although the theory part could be better structured, the practice gives you the opportunity to do a voluntary internship at New York's UN Headquarteres and to know form first-hand how the system works."

    "organization- weekly classes can be more coherent, students can hopefully get advance notice for presentations.",
    "The professor's organization. He assigned students presentations at random and on short notice without regard for other assignments they might have. While it is his prerogative to assign presentations, they did not seem to be a part of a cohesive plan. Also there were some students who presented multiple times and others who literally did not even participate in discussion until the second month. Also the lecture lasted an hour and a half but that amount of time wasn't necessary. There was rarely looking to the readings that were assigned and true discussion, rather the professor discussing various somewhat related themes.",
    "Better coordination assigning presentations",
    "how class work relates to current issues at the UN. We spent the entire semester on climate change, but the UN is completely focused on sustainable development. I wished we covered that topic, it would have greatly approved my internship experience.",
    "Better planning and coordinationStronger content coverageMore access to internship opportunities",
    "More classes focused on international diplomacy."

    "The lectures are painful but if you are lucky you'll get an internship with a great mission and it will be worth it.",
    "Go as many times you can to the UN. That was the best",
    "Very little learning from the class room sessions. The value of this course hinges heavily on being placed with a mission at the UN. However, there is also a possibility of not finding an internship.Take this course knowing fully well that an internship may not come through. The class room sessions are less than valuable",
