    "I would most definitely recommend this class to another student! It was fun and not too much work. The things you learn are really interesting and class is engaging. Even though its almost two hours, time flies, and you often don't want to leave!",
    "AMAZING class, highly recommended. Kate is a fantastic professor and cares a lot about you actually learning and being engaged in the class. This is exactly what a class at Yale should be.",
    "I would summarize this as a class to take if you are in any way interested in sign language. It is a topic that I knew very little about, but have much appreciation for now. I would absolutely recommend this to another student.",
    "Literally it all things science-esque of ASL\/sign languages as a whole and has everything from Deaf culture (i.e. humanities type stuff) to hardcore neurosciences (i.e. very science). You need to take this class. It's very important. Why haven't you signed up yet?",
    "take this class if you have any interest in sign languages, or in linguistics or cognitive science in general. your world view will change.",
    "The class is wonderful and the professor is personable and engaging and also wonderful! Take it if you're interested in Deaf culture, deaf studies, and linguistics of sign language. Be warned that if you're not a linguist, you will have to get through some dense linguistics readings and ideas, but if you have to learn them anywhere, this is the class to learn them in. Sign languages are so interesting, and you'll find yourself wishing you spoke one.",
    "This is one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale. I would recommend Sign Language and the Mind to any student. The professor is wonderful--she's really knowledgeable about the topic, incredibly enthusiastic about it, and also willing to adapt the course to meet the interests of the students. Unlike a lot of seminars I've taken, she plans out each class and creates a powerpoint (the powerpoint has videos and extra information we didn't read about, and also addresses questions brought up by students during the reading responses), but is also willing to deviate from the plan based on what students want to talk about. She really engages everyone in the topic and is incredibly helpful when it comes to the final paper. With the weekly reading responses (which are more lengthy than some other courses), it's a decent amount of work each week but not too much, and it ensures you really think about the material. I would take the class again if I could.",
    "It's a FANTASTIC class, and you should definitely take it!",
    "SLaM is most definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and I would recommend it to literally everyone. I went in knowing very little about sign language and linguistics, but I've walked out with both an immense appreciation for the the Deaf community and a greater understanding of the complexities of language. As for the workload, the readings every week are interesting so our weekly responses are easy to write and the two papers are also manageable since we get to write on any topics we'd like. If you want to learn more about linguistics, or sign languages specifically, or even just realize how ignorant you probably are about the Deaf community, I highly suggest you take this class. You'll gain a world of academic knowledge and a more enriched and informed perspective on life.",
    "Great class! Finally something at Yale about sign language, and a great mix of linguistics and cogsci in the course. Not too bad workload--weekly reading responses to keep you on top of the readings, one short reflection paper and a 10-15 page final paper. The readings aren't too heavy either, and the discussions in class are usually pretty good. Kate is really great. She's really straightforward with her expectations, but also super approachable and helpful and understanding. She's really enthusiastic and has a great deal of sign language knowledge to share."
