   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. This class is much more about economics research and econometrics, and it just uses Latin American human capital as the framework in which to explore these concepts. In this class you will learn a ton about establishing causality and overall empirical methods. I cannot express how amazing Professor McKee is. I learned more from him in one semester than I have from the rest of the econ department in 3.5 years.",
    "Great class ! makes all the painful hours of micro finally worth it ! you will learn a lot on how to read and evaluate real economics papers. McKee is the man always very approachable and funny ! Must take as an econ major",
    "Even if you don't think you care about the course material, it's very engaging class and Doug is fantastic. You'll look forward to seminar for once.",
    "YES. If you can get in, take it. McKee is one of a kind in every single aspect.",
    "Overview of the literature on human capital in Latin America - each week is a specific topic with student presentations and discussion of 2-3 papers. You'll learn a lot about econometrics methods that are much more advanced than what you learned in 131. Professor McKee is a wonderful teacher who's great at explaining intimidating concepts - recommended!",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this course for Ecnomics, Global Affairs and Latin American Studies majors that have taken econometrics and\/or statistics and have come to the \"so what?\" point. Having a breather from the nitty gritty proofs and theory behind it all is a great way to understand the applicability of regression analysis and other techniques. You will learn a lot from one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor McKee is a phenomenal teacher - even people who weren't originally interested in the subject material had a great time. The workload isn't bad. It's just a few papers a week, and you discuss the methods and results together through student presentations in class. But the topics are super interesting if you like development econ, and the syllabus gives a really good sampling of the economic literature in a wide cross section of development and human capital topics. You also use the papers as a way to study some common econometric techniques, which was really helpful as well. I really liked the Latin American focus, even though I didn't know much about Latin America before taking the class. There's a lot of great data on Latin American poverty alleviation programs, so academics have done a lot of cool work evaluating these initiatives, which makes Latin America a great focus for such a quantitative class. Long story short, if you're excited about the subject material, then you will LOVE this class, and even if you aren't interested in human capital or latin america, I would still recommend taking it just to learn from Professor McKee.",
    "Take this as soon as you can great class",
    "Would recommend! Great review of some of the challenges facig developing countries and the programs that are being implemented to try to confront them. You learn a lot, and it's knowledge that is useful in general. Definitely take!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course for anyone who is interested in development issues with a focus on human capital (education and health). Professor Mckee has a strong passion for teaching, which makes this course a wonderful experience for everyone. You'll give a presentation on a specific topic (ranging from conditional cash transfer programs to the drug trade) and write a research proposal throughout the semester. Latin America is a perfect region to study social innovation and policy experimentation, but even if you are not familiar with the region, you still get to learn a lot about how to use econometrics tools to implement a research. TAKE IT!",
    "Yes, good seminar for econ majors - you don't actually learn how to run modern econometric methods, but learn what they are and how to interpret the results in econ papers. The class is a manageable amount of work, and McKee is so nice and willing to help on the final research proposal, which is split up into parts throughout the semester so it's not too stressful.",
    "Incredible class. One of those rare seminars at Yale where the professor encourages understanding of topics, and probably the only class at Yale that actually *teaches* you to read the academic studies we're assigned so often to read. You won't skip the methodology section anymore after this year, so if you can take it as a junior then do it. Especially if you're an econ major; he makes you come up with an original research proposal as a part of the course (you work on it throughout so you can't put it off) soyou can possibly turn it into your thesis.Also one opportunity to take a class with Professor McKee- the rare econ professor who prioritizes things like teaching, writing and conversation. Take it and invest some time in it! The workload isn't overpowering so that shouldn't be too much of a problem.The course goes over all these really cool policy experiments in Latin America, where they actually try out all the ideas that get shopped around in America but never tried. A relevant course for anyone interested in going into policy as well as research.There are times when the class presentations seem to be useless if you've spent the time on the reading that you should've, but I think there's a possibility that this will change next year due to structural changes in the course.",
    "Econ 462 is a solid course, and professor McKee is great, but it does get a bit repetitive. The class in basically JUST about the papers you read and the specific programs that those papers talk about, don't expect to get a broad overview of theories of human capital or of human capital policies in Latin America. If you are ready to read three econometric papers every single week, do a reading response for each of them and learn a lot about econometric methods during the process, then take it. I would imagine that it would be easier to find motivation for the research proposal if you had the opportunity to use it as a first step of your senior thesis, so it would be better to take this class junior year.",
    "It's a great course if you are interested in economics research. Definitely a must take for juniors if you can get in!!",
    "This is one of the best courses at Yale. Not only is the content fascinating - just about every major issue affecting Latin America - Doug is, in my humble opinion, the best Econ professor at Yale. This is a MUST-TAKE if you have the chance."
