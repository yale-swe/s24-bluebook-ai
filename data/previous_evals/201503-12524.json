    "This is basically English 114 conducted in Spanish, with an addition of cool field trips outside the classroom. It will definitely help you improve and sharpen your Spanish composition skills by forcing you to write a lot and grapple with the revisions!",
    "I'm not sure that I suggest taking this class. I'm not sure if I really got all that much out of it other than a credit. Some of the assignments like the in-class pop quizzes seemed unnecessary and all of the course-content was disconnected. Honestly, I can't say if my writing actually improved that much or if the feedback just improved and I knew what to look for over time. The class isn't exciting or all that interesting but it is good practice in writing. I would suggest not taking it if you really want more cohesive material to study and more energy in the classroom.",
    "SPAN 250, Composition and Analysis, is an excellent Spanish course if you got a 5 on AP Spanish in high school but arent that fluent in the language yet. 40% of your grade is determined by four compositions that are 750-1000 words in length. You hand in a first draft one week, the teacher hands it back with comments a few days later, and then the final draft is due the following week. The grading is also not arbitrary, as it is done by a rubric that assesses your vocabulary usage, grammar, and argument strength. As long as you proofread your spelling\/grammar very carefully and fix the structural issues after the comments from the first draft, you should do well on the compositions. Getting an A- on one is usually not that difficult, but you do have to work a bit harder to get an A. Another 20% of your grade is based on smaller written assignments and in-class pop quizzes. Theyre not as scary as they sound, since its usually pretty obvious when youre going to have them. If she goes over a spelling or grammar concept and asks you to review it that night, you probably have a quiz on it the next class. Theyre not tricky and are graded generously. The final research paper is worth another 25%, and its pretty long at 8-10 pages, but you can write it about anything related to the Spanish-speaking world so just pick a topic youre actually interested in. The remaining 15% is just class participation. The best part of the class was the teacher, since Seora Harkema is probably one of the nicest and friendliest teachers at Yale. Shes really helpful if you dont understand something or want to improve your Spanish writing, and she made the class discussions really interesting.",
    "This is a good Spanish class - Profa. Harkema is pretty on top of things, and does a very good job preparing the lessons. Your writing and grammar will improve a lot if you take it, and it's not too much work. The reading material is good (I liked pretty much all of the short stories and Gabriel Garca Mrquez). Just make sure that you stay on top of paper deadlines and all that - there are five of them, and the professor will give you a sheet with all of them at the beginning of the semester. Do your best on the first drafts - it'll make it easier to do the final version, and you'll probably do better on it. Don't leave the final research paper to the last minute either, doing it over Thanksgiving break is probably a good idea.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to improve your reading and especially your writing in Spanish and your command of the Spanish language. While there is not much speaking because it is a writing class, my writing in Spanish has improved immensely, and I found the class to be an interesting and enjoyable experience overall."
