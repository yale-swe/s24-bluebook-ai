   "comments": [
    "Great Class. So interesting. Braken is impressive and tests are easy.",
    "Great class, take it if it sounds interesting, and show up and listen",
    "Definitely take this course if you have the opportunity!! Incredibly interesting. The reading is brief and very enjoyable. I didn't think it was possible to stay so engaged for a full 75 minutes.",
    "Very very boring and disorganized. The exam questions were very random too.",
    "Class on grand strategy with specific focus on the role technology plays.",
    "great course",
    "I would not recommend the course for an undergraduate. You will likely learn very little about technology, the Cold War, or Strategy.",
    "Do not take unless you are able to focus on smalls details in lecture. The final was unreal",
    "Interesting class. Easy midterm. Impossible final. Does not follow the syllabus. Seems to do what he wants as far as grading.",
    "Covers tech and strategy questions related to both war and international relations. Covers a great amount of history as well.",
    "This course is a study of war and international relations. It uses technology to demonstrate how countries interact with one another when trying to maintain or bolster national security. I do recommend this course because the material is interesting and Prof. Bracken has many personal stories to enliven the material. Warning: The course is not as easy as some may suggest. The exams are heavily weighted and contain some obscure questions."
