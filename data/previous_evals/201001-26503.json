    "It analyzed the role of the diva in opera and musical theater, using a wide spread of diva performances to study. I would certainly recommend this to a fellow student. Even if it does not related to his\/her major it is a fun course that exposes students to wonderful music and essential music history.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to those who are interested in musical theatre and opera and are interested in learning more. It is so much fun and even though it was small it allowed us to learn more and discuss more things.",
    "A very comprehensive view of the diva. I would definitely recommend the course."
