    "If you are just okay at math or good at math and need an easy math credit I would take it. My friends who are like that are doing well. However, if you are like me and numbers are like a foreign language to you, I would shop other math classes first and check them out because there may be some one's out there better suited for you.",

    "I don't think I would. It's not as exciting as some of the other \"fun\" science\/math guts.",
    "Take this class, but be prepared to put some effort in. I did feel that I could see the benefits of the work I put into the class.",
    "Movie Physics is a science class that explains concepts without going as in-depth as a higher level class woud. Of you can get in, take it.",
    "Recommend, but only to those who are not interested in following up with more in depth physics and math. It was good for non-science\/non-math majors."
