   "comments": [
    "I learned more about the education system in the US and more about education policy in this class. I loved this class a lot.",
    "Absolutely none.",
    "Honestly, the most impactful part of this class for me was the tutoring we did at the high school. It was a great hands on experience do see how students, of a different cultural background than what I come from, are learning and how well they are doing.",
    "I feel that I gained a lot of knowledge about a subject I knew absolutely nothing about going in.",
    "I felt I got a survey of how Economists\/researchers go about assessing the education system in the US and some of its history.",
    "Very little, Professor Jaynes is great but this class really missed the mark.",
    "I gained a more comprehensive understanding of why our school system continues to be segregated and puts low-income minority children at a disadvantage. Really great \"case study\" of path dependence and how it explains why the best policies and practices aren't already in place. Also had a great experience teaching the students at Hillhouse High. It was humbling to hear their stories and they taught me to be a better teacher. It was also helpful to see a \"real life\" example of how disparities in student family background can play out in educational outcomes. But keep in mind that this is a class where you get out what you put in! If you don't pay attention in class, you'll miss everything and if you don't ask the students about their lives or make a concentrated effort to help them with their work, you'll end up talking about basketball. Fun and interesting class if you care about students and education policies\/history.",
    "I gained a better appreciation for how difficult it is to do proper research with robust conclusions in the social sciences"

   "comments": [
    "Nothing that I can think of could be improved. I loved this class, and the tutoring we did at Hillhouse High School every week was very beneficial to my learning.",
    "Strengths: An interesting overall topic and a great idea to spend time tutoring at Hillhouse high school. Weaknesses: Absolutely no structure or organization to the class, homework assignments graded arbitrarily and harshly, and so few that they were extremely detrimental to grades. When tutoring, often tutors did not show up but had signed up and so received attendance credit. As someone who came to class every single day and tutored every single week, this was really not fair.",
    "Overall, very interesting course that more people should take. Lectures were entertaining and contained a lot of information. I would recommend more homework assignments, not because I'm sadistic, but because there were so few that they felt weighted super heavily which made grading very stressful.",
    "I felt that the problem sets forced us to interact with the material the most. I also really enjoyed the tutoring component at Hillhouse High School. I also liked that we had a choice in our final project. I thought that the tutoring component should be more structured. Kids barely showed up, especially at the end, which was disappointing because we could do some good when they were there. I found that it was best to make them bring their homework and work through it even if they said they understood it because often they didn't. I wished we had more time to talk through the tutoring component and discuss what we were all learning from the experience. As an Econ major I also thought the lectures on regressions and research analytics, etc.were too basic, given that it was primarily senior Econ majors. I would have been more stimulated if it were more challenging.",
    "The strength of the course was definitely the involvement with Hillhouse High School. Would strongly recommend working with them in the future. The weakness was Jaynes' insistence on teaching introductory statistics instead of education policy. I think this class would be much more meaningful if approached more from a political science perspective than an econ perspective. We didnt really cover anything that enriched my understanding of educational inequality because we were too focused on remedial stats.",
    "Lectures are not great.",
    "The strength of this course is the subject material because I think education history and policy is fascinating, relevant, and a really critical issue right now. The low work level (very little reading, few homework assignments, final paper) of this class and special opportunity to tutor students in New Haven high school are also advantages. Disadvantages are that the class is incredibly disorganized and the assignments seem like they're casual but then they are graded pretty hard. Although in the end, if you show up all the time, pay attention, and are engaged in the class, you'll be fine.",
    "The course needs more structure. The metric for grade calculation, and requirements for the course changed several times throughout the semester.",
    "Very very unorganized. The readings were almost never posted up in time, if they were posted at all. No point in having a syllabus really. It was not considerate at all to call for sections at the beginning of the semester that only lasted about half an hour and then not hold any near the end. It was a waste of time. We could have used that time to meet in groups and practice teaching, or do break out sessions, discussion. Lectures would repeat information every week, the title and description of the course was very misleading. The professor only really engaged in educational inequality from a Black-White racial schema which is an outdated view of the racial achievement gap. He could have taught about the various factors that influence achievement gaps and did not. Not sure what the TA's really did."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. This class was taught very well, going into a high school in New Haven to tutor every week made this class even better.",
    "I think with improvements, this class would be really fun and intellectually interesting. As it stands, it is pretty boring and a really light workload, but with no guarantee of a good grade.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who will take it seriously. The class is designed such that it's possible to slack off and still do ok, but if you actually take it seriously, you will get a huge amount out of it.",
    "YES!!! You get to go in and teach students at Hillhouse High School - one of the more rewarding parts of my Yale experience.",
    "This was a very chill class. I unfortunately didn't learn more than what I could've accomplished with about 5 hours of reading because a good portion of the class was spent explaining very simple statistics concepts. On the bright side, you don't really have to do the readings and there were only a few homework assignments throughout the semester. There was a 20 page group paper at the end, or participation in a debate, no tests. Class attendance was taken randomly and factored into your grade so you should go. I wouldn't recommend taking this if you're looking for intellectual challenge. I would recommend it for a chill 5th class.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to an upperclassman who wants a rigorous course in education research, but it is a pretty good survey course.",
    "Not if you're serious about learning what the course is supposed to be teaching.",
    "Yes!",
    "No because we learned very little",
    "While this class involves an attractively small amount of work, it is still not worth taking because Gerald's incredibly poor organization and boring\/thoughtless lectures will cause you quite a bit of frustration and anxiety.",
    "Sure, go for it",
    "SUPER chill class and huge econ gut. basically every lecture was just jaynes telling us stories. he has a lot of insight and is interesting to listen to but you kind of feel like you come out of the class not really learning anything new in the end. very very low workload... only about 3 hw assignments scattered throughout the semester. we were supposed to have a midterm but it was cancelled. final was either a group final paper (20 pages) or being on a debate team and the last class was hearing the debate. jayne is very accommodating and understanding but i just dont really feel like i learned anything from this class and my engagement was super low. only thing is you have to get into this class (he only lets in juniors and seniors). oh and there's also a \"lab\" component where you go to hillhouse high and tutor kids but you can also get away with not going as long as people in your group are. but even if you do go i heard it was chill and fun",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who cares about education, wants to tutor students at New Haven high schools, and is looking for a relatively light workload class. Be prepared that the class is disorganized and that the homework assignments aren't as casual as you think they are though. All in all, education is a critical issue with a fascinating history so stay engaged and you'll enjoy the class.",
    "Not that good. Low workload. Unclear grading.",
    "No, I would not. Unless it received improvements.",
    "Yes!"
