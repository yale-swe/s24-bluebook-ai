    "AFAM 403 has been my absolute favorite class at Yale! Professor Brooks is absolutely amazing and so is the course material. You go from Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Etta James and Nina Simone to Nicki Minaj, Azealia Banks, Janelle Monae, Rihanna and Beyonc. The class is really interesting and fun, and ties in a lot of current events (Grammys, concerts, protests, TV events, etc.), and is at the same time very academically engaging and demanding. The videos and playlists are fun, but beware because this is no gut, as you'll read serious black feminist theory and theater studies texts that will demand all of your attention. Even though it's not easy, the workload is not too much, so definitely take this class no matter what major you are. Professor Brooks is amazing and you will love her from the first minute! This is one of those professors you only find on very rare occasions and she deserves all praise. Even though this class has only been offered once, I am sure that it soon will turn into one of those typical Yale classes that you simply have to take to be able to talk about the \"Yale experience.\" This class is ***Flawless.",
    "Definitely take it if it's ever offered as a seminar. Would be a safe bet to steer clear of it if it's a lecture. There's a lot of reading, mysteriously enough, and weekly reading responses.",
    "It is a great class if you're really passionate about music. However it is A LOT of work so if you're going to take it make sure you're dedicated to the class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's the best class I have ever taken. I've never looked forward to a class the way that I did for this class (and I am honestly sad that I don't get to take it again). Professor Brooks is absolutely brilliant, and the material is fascinating. The class will change how you think. I don't have enough adjectives to give necessary praise to the class, but really, just take it. Professor Brooks will blow your mind!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's exciting and engaging and you get to learn a lot about matters that touch upon everyone's lives.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is material you can't find anywhere else, and Professor Brooks is an amazing professor to get to engage with and to learn from. It's a good amount of work, but worth it and manageable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It starts from the 19th century with minstrelsy and traces the role of black women in blues, jazz, gospel, rock, punk, pop, and more. Professor Daphne Brooks is wonderful -- her lectures are what really make this class great, they're so engaging and you learn so much. She makes connections and asks questions that you never would have thought of and her enthusiasm for this topic is contagious. She also makes a real effort to get to know her students and to encourage discussion and participation, leaving time for students' questions and thoughts at the end. The readings are interesting and the assignments are manageable and fun. This class is definitely not a gut -- you should take it seriously as a class -- but it's pretty reasonable and you get a lot out of it.",
    "I would recommend it. It felt like a bit of a crash course, but at the same time, offered amazing analysis , contextualization, and insight into the works we were studying.",
    "This is an interesting course that surveys popular music throughout American history. The workload was not overwhelming, just a midterm paper, a final and weekly music blogs. I recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about African American history from a new perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I thought this course was amazing. It not only used relevant sources (some very fun, some I had never heard of), but also used theory and scholarly pieces with which to analyze the music videos, songs, etc. I thought Daphne Brooks was a great lecturer, clearly cares about what she studies and supplemented her words with an amazing powerpoint presentation each class. Really fun and thought-provoking and challenging class, though would be better as a seminar.",
    "This class gave me life every week. If you have the opportunity to take this class before you leave Yale, you definitely should. The material is extremely interesting and relevant, covering black female performers across the American vocal tradition. Professor Brooks is amazing. She is passionate, engaging, and makes herself available to her students. She is definitely one of my favorite professors at Yale. This class is not a walk in the park though. There were weekly responses, a midterm paper, and the final exam\/paper as well as lots of reading and screenings throughout the semester. Even so, the class is wonderful and definitely a positive memory in my Yale experience."
