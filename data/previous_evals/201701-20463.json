   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of critical thinking this semester, even after havinh built a foundation in the fall. The focus on building an argument was stronger than ever, and highly beneficial.",
    "DS Philosophy is a really important basis for Western thought. It is a good way to access some of the most important questions of the human experience.",
    "I legitimately feel that this course has made me smarter. After reading Hume, Kant, and Hegel, I feel like I can approach really difficult texts and grasp at least something from them. Writing these papers has also added a rigor of description and analysis to my writing.",
    "In this class, I was able to sharpen my skill of critically assessing a text and develop a more insightful understanding through class discussion. My ability to effectively convey my thoughts and ideas on paper and in class improved immensely.",
    "Ability to translate large reading assignments into comprehensive analysis in limited time",
    "Directed Studies: Philosophy not only introduced me to the major strains and thinkers of modern philosophy, but it also improved my ability to read critically and develop cogent opinions on what I have read. Because of this class, I feel more confident in discussing the various currents of intellectual thought and in understanding the origins of contemporary ideas such as, for example, human rights.",
    "I think I got better at decoding the complex language used by the philosophers and understanding their core arguments. I think I also improved at understanding the writing on my first time reading it. I think I also got better at writing a clear philosophy paper.",
    "I refined my ability to understand syntactically complex texts, reconstruct arguments in a clear and concise manner, and conceive of challenges to presented arguments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Everything is highly informative, but please make lectures more dynamic. There's a noticeable difference between student interest in, attendance at, and engagement with philosophy lectures when compared to literature lectures.",
    "I love the level of discussion and challenge of the content. It isn't always necessary to do the reading, since most of the content is summarized in class. Some of the section will just not participate and other will participate without any real insights.",
    "The readings are the most manageable of all the DS courses. Sometimes, however, the material is so difficult that in class the professors should take a more direct role in telling us what is going on.",
    "Class discussion is lead in a way conducive to high class participation. The texts we work with are intriguing and incredibly challenging the best way possible. I also really liked the class size of 11-12 people.",
    "Strengths: Lots of texts for one semester, you learn a ton. Weaknesses: The fact that you deal with one text a week means you may not reach as much depth per text. However, in my experience all the important parts of each text are touched on.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is the quality of the professors. All the philosophy professors for this class were excellent in their ability to convey the essence of the various philosophers' thoughts in lectures and in seminars. The greatest weakness of this course is the balance between explication and analysis of the text. Because of the introductory nature of the course, much of the lectures and seminars were devoted to understanding what Spinoza or Kant had said. Consequently, the course, at times, lacked sufficient critiques of their philosophies.",
    "I think much more time could be spent on each philosopher because it is so hard to understand their ideas. I do think that the philosophers chosen for the course were good, though.",
    "Strengths of Directed Studies Philosophy include the broad extent of the texts, the informative guidance of handouts and lectures, the high level of engagement of direct conversation with the professor and peers during sections. This course also encouraged me to explore more recent philosophical ideas."

   "comments": [
    "Learning how to think is crucial, and understanding how others think is beneficial. Add to that the coincidentally fantastic, enthralling ideas discussed by the works on the syllabus, and what's not to love?",
    "Take DS. If nothing else, it teaches you to engage with important ideas and express those ideas in writing and discussion. Philosophy particularly helps with your clarity of thought and perceptiveness in debate.",
    "Take DS Philosophy. It will vastly improve your skills of analysis. It makes you smarter in a way. It also has the most manageable readings.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this class to another student. This is has been one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale in regards to intellectual challenge and working closely together with the professor\/the class as we grapple with the text. DS Philosophy in the spring semester is a must take.",
    "Don't think it's worth doing DS if you don't take the full two semesters. The second semester of philosophy recalls a lot of the themes present in the first semester readings, particularly in how later philosophers deal with the problem of skepticism. DS would feel incomplete without the second semester, so definitely consider continuing.",
    "Darwall is great",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in philosophers. The quality of the professors who teach it alone is sufficient reason to take it. Additionally, the sheer audacity of the course - its aim to cover the major thinkers of modern philosophy - ensures that the entire course is an incredible experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they really enjoyed philosophy or really like the other two DS courses and therefore had to take this one.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to destabilize his or her held beliefs and consequently gain an interest in modern philosophical ideas."
