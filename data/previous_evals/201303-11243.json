    "DS is just an amazing experience. I love when different classes I'm taking start to connect to each other or my life--DS is a program built to do that. If you're interested in examining why the West thinks the way it does, take it.",
    "AMAZING! Although I was most unsure of DS History and Politics going into the semester, this turned out to be my favorite section. The books we read are engrossing, with beautiful rhetoric that you don't always appreciate while you are reading a lot at once but see when you go back to analyze the text. Absolutely take this course! I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed it and how much I feel like I gleaned from our discussions. And try your absolute best to get Professor Garsten. He is WONDERFUL!",
    "This class is truly a remarkable section. Professor Garsten's classroom is an intellectually rigorous environment which somehow maintains a warmth and genuine enthusiasm for the texts that has been a life-changing experience for me.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course; it was the most appealing part of Directed Studies for me. It is unlike any history course I have taken, and it is unlike and politics course. The material we read is fantastic, and brings up fascinating ideas that are interesting to any section.",
    "I thought directed studies h&p was the best of the three DS courses. Much of the material will change your beliefs and make you question the world around you. The workload is worth the benefit.",
    "Would recommend to a friend. It is a really interesting and relevant class that will make you think and write better"
