    "Good for political science majors looking for an overall understanding of democratization internationally.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT",
    "A great seminar for anyone interested in international politics. Reading is manageable and there is a great balance between discussing the readings and current events and theories. It was particularly interesting to take at this time in history but would also be great any semester. It is also extremely applicable to other international politics courses.",
    "Great course, would definitely recommend to get a strong understanding of the development of democracies."
