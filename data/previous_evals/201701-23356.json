    "Strengths: Dr. Ciarleglio is an amazing teacher, with perfect slides to help us learn the material. She is very meticulous both in the slides and lecture, and she was great at putting things in terms of the big picture. Weaknesses: The final project should be a 2 person assignment without a presentation. It felt unnecessary, stressful, and there are other ways to get us to do a real analysis of actual data.",
    "The slides are very clear and good oriented. I really love the way the instructor managing and presenting the material. And instructor is also very happy to answer students' questions. One suggestions would be the workload. During the final, the workload is a bit heavy as we need to finish final project, last assignment and the final exam. I think maybe we can cut one of them.",
    "Maria is very sweet. Very detailed lecture slides",
    "Useful but too fast",
    "good",
    "Great teaching but exams are unfocused. There should be a practice exam to help focus materials. Not all materials were tested, for example, sample size was not on the final. As there are a lot of information, it would be helpful to know what to focus on. Also for final, since it is cumulative, open book is more reasonable.",
    "Good course but heavy workload",
    "Outstanding introduction to applied survival analysis, the topic is not easy and the instructor is absolutely outstanding in making the topic approachable, her slides are second to none, no book needed",
    "BIS630 is an excellence applied survival analysis course. It focuses mainly on the implementation of several regression models using primarily SAS but also R.",
    "Strengths: Detailed lecture notes. Weakness: The workload for this course is too large.",
    "The workload is reasonable. The final project is not that useful for the overall course and takes a lot of time. The exams do not reflect the homework assingments.",
    "The lecture is very organized.",
    "Materials are great!",
    "Very good notes",
    "The class was great and I learned a lot from it. Material was presented in a good manner. Assessments felt fair. I would personally prefer that there either be a project or a final test, but not both. Especially when the project was not worth very much towards the overall grade."

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is very nice. However, she is not very considerate regarding the course workload. Normally, if a course has a closed book final exam, there will not be a final project. Vice versa. Too many course workload really affects our study efficiency.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent",
