    "I would only recommend it to someone who was interested in math. I would summarize it as a normal math class with a flipped classroom.",

    "For the people who need this class as a prerequisite, it's useful and I had a good professor. For the people who need a QR credit for distributional requirements, there are many other, probably far more interesting classes to fill the credit rather than retaking BC Calculus."
