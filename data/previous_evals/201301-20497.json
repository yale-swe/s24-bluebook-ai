    "As I said before, this was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. We dove directly into an analysis of China-Africa encounters from initial historical contacts to the rapidly developing relationships of today. I have no criticisms of this course. It was absolutely fascinating, and I recommend it to anyone in any social science or humanities discipline, and I very much hope it becomes a regularly taught course at Yale.",
    "A very new research area. This class is for anyone who's looking for uncharted research space.",
    "The material for this course is fascinating, but overall I found it hard to stay engaged during class. Most of our sessions, on the other hand, were largely spent listening to the professors (mostly Helen) speak. There was a lot of good talk about paradigms and research and such, but we tended to avoid hunkering down for a focused, serious discussion about some of the major issues we came up against. (E.g., \"What is exploitation? Are Chinese businesses exploiting workers in Africa?\")",
    "Good class for its interesting readings. Prof Siu situates them in historical context well. Team teaching is tough though and sometimes the class doesn't run exactly right.. too much back and forth between the teachers and not enough discussion.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "I highly recommend the class."

    "Most courses on contemporary China naturally focus on China within its administrative borders, and perhaps also its behavior as a regional power. This course was unique in its focus on China's physical engagement with the world, far away from the context of \"Asia\". Professor Siu's understanding of China as a \"process\" is instrumental in her ability to view China's engagement with the world in a fluid way, and not bound by geopolitical biases and limitations. This unique abstract analytical tool is extremely valuable for understanding China in the global context.",
    "China-Africa is a hot issue so this is a helpful course. I used a lot of stuff I picked up in class tangentially in my MA thesis.",
