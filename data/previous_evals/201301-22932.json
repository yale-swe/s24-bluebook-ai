    "Definitely.",
    "YES. YES. YES. Take it. Probably one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. I learned much more here than in Basic Drawing, even though I had more work in BD. Take it with Sam Messer!",
    "Figure Drawing is a great studio course. There are models in class most days and some outside-of-class work, sometimes coordinated with readings or exhibitions. The larger homework assignments were a small 12-hour drawing and an independent final project. I highly recommend the course to everyone who would like drawing practice and time and space to think about using the figure in their work.",
    "I would definitely recommend Figure Drawing! Sam Messer is a great professor, and class is incredibly fun. The assignments, both in-class and homework, are really interesting and challenging. This class helped me to see the world in an entirely new way. It is helpful to have some drawing experience beforehand. It is also not too work intensive, as far as art classes go. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Yes.",
    "I recommend Figure Drawing only to those searching for an opportunity to draw. It would also help if you enter this class with an idea of the kind of drawings you like to make. You will almost certainly realize little technical development in this class because it is so loosely run.",
    "Fantastic class. You are learning how to use the human figure in your art - not necessarily how to technically draw the human figure. You have a variety of mediums to use while drawing live models in different exercises. You will end up with a good amount of work you will be proud of. We has some great critique discussions, and Sam is the wise man who says things like \"When you fuck up is when the art happens.\" I thought that was a really good saying. Take the class. Basic drawing is basically required as a prerequisite, but talk to Sam about it.",
    "I would recommend the class, but probably not to freshmen. I would also warn anyone interested in the class that Sam is a pretty lax professor, so you should be prepared to take your own initiative in your work and in the projects he assigns. It was certainly a fun class, and one in which I do feel like I learned a lot in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, it is a unique and incredible opportunity."
