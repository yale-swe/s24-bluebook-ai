   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a problem-solving based course. All of the take home questions were on applying theory and experimental technique to actual scientific problems. This is definitely challenging, and the assignments were not easy. If you are looking for a course that covers a wide variety of experimental techniques and want to have discussions and assignments about applying them, I would recommend this class. If you want in-depth theory, probably not.",
    "Recommend.",
    "You get literally no feedback in this class on any assignments",
    "Boring and required",
    "Really helpful course.",
    "I would recommend 625 to another student. Overall the course provides an introduction to genetic approaches. Although an emphasis is placed on older genetic approaches, some modern approaches were touched upon.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student since I learnt a great deal about different genetic analysis, in which the concepts and logic learned has also been valuable to my rotation research.",
    "Its okay but could be improved by covering more relevant topics, explaining complex subjects more carefully, without being bogged down by details.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student because it was a good overview of the concepts. I think weekly homework assignments may have helped me better learn the material.",
    "This course is very good for students to learn the basic concepts of genetics. I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "Would recommend course."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me better understand experimental genetics, and has better prepared me for planning my own genetic analyses, though I doubt I will join a genetics lab in which this will be commonplace for me.",
    "most of the topics discussed were not applicable to current research in genetics",
    "This is my first course related to genomics. It is not easy but it is very very helpful.",
    "I think that the genetic tests that we learned about will be useful in my future research. Refreshing my familiarity with genetic terms will definitely be useful as I continue my career.",
    "It didn't really teach me much I had not learned as an undergrad. Interesting or relevant subjects were only mentioned in passing.",
    "This course helped introduce me to some of the more recent developments in this field and gave me exposure to some techniques I was unfamiliar with. It did introduce me to some tests I could incorporate into my research.",
    "I learned a lot about genetics concepts and techniques. That definitely contributes to the future research."
