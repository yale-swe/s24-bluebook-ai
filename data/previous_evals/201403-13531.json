   "comments": [
    "Yes, important for the major and well as anyone who is interested in air quality.",
    "I felt that this was a good overview of air pollution engineering. It wasn't my favorite class, but probably because I don't want to go into air pollution engineering. If I had to use one word to describe the class, for better or for worse, I would say it was 'ambitious'. I'm sure that Prof. Gentner will work out the kinks after the first year. He is a great guy and a good lecturer. Beware of the final paper. Also, if the class is like it was this semester, expect to spend a lot more time on the class during the last 4-5 weeks.",
    "ENVE 373 Air Pollution is a requirement for the ENVE major, and it pairs nicely with Water Quality and Env. Transport - a lot of topics overlap. That being said, it's a little dry and it may seem like there's nothing more the environmental engineering than water treatment and air pollution. However it's not a bad class. The work load was a little bit much sometimes, but grading was fair and it was manageable over all. START EARLY on the paper - it's a lot of work. The style of the class (lots of interaction - very engaging and good) and Prof. Gentner are the two redeeming qualities, as well as the many real-world examples we talk about. Not a bad class at all for the ENVE major. Dry, but well taught. Occasional weeks of a lot of work, but fair grading. Overall a good class.",
    "I would say this is an interesting class for both students who have to take it and for students who are simply interested in the subject. It is interesting to understand how air pollution works, and for that reason alone I think it is worthwhile. Hopefully with a little more organization in the class, and maybe a little bit more speed, the class would be even better.",
    "The material is really interesting and really relevant. Gentner is a new prof but I'm sure will improve fast. The course was slightly disconnected but taught well. Irregular psets and a huge paper that is a major drag but kind of cool once over.",
    "Air Pollution Control was a good introduction to all the different types of air pollution and they ways that it can be reduced or dealt with."
