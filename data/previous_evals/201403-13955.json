   "comments": [
    "Interesting take on the law, definitely an eye-opener. Fair grading and not too much work.",
    "I recommend it - take it. It's only going to get better, it's a gem.",
    "Overall, an interesting survey course for those interested in how laws work in other countries.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It's a great fifth class, and it's impossible to be bored\/uninterested in the material. You learn so much about how culture and law intersect, and it leaves you forming more informed opinions about many sociocultural issues in the world today.",
    "An interesting survey of law\/culture issues around the world. There's a lot of reading, and there are difficult unannounced reading quizzes. This lecture class that should have more than one essay but doesn't.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in the law. I had taken other anthropology classes was hesitant to take another but I found this class to be structured and grounded in a really appealing way. I learned a lot in a super engaging way from Professor Lombard's narrative style lectures.",
    "This class was relatively easy, the topics were interesting and varied, and I liked the professor. I would really recommend it as a fifth class, even\/especially for non-majors. The final was a little tricky, and grading a little tough, but the structure of the grading was very easy--as in a large part of the grade was class participation and reading comprehension quizzes of which she drops the lowest. Take the class!",
    "ANTH 119 is a comprehensive look at law from an anthropological perspective. The topics are broad-ranging, from prisons to organ donation. The workload is light, though many of the readings are dense. Mostly interesting material. Professor is a strong lecturer. I would recommend if you find the idea of legal anthropology interesting and are willing to read some dense readings on the topic. If you have some background knowledge of law, that can help, as you can skim some of the readings.",
    "I thought the class was enjoyable and interesting.",
    "Good class! Not terribly difficult, but also not at all boring. The topics covered are extremely interesting, and I learned a lot. Prof. Lombard is great!",
    "I would highly recommend ANTH 119 to any student looking to study law from a different perspective than other courses. We spend a great deal more time discussing the framework of legal realism than one might expect from an anthropology course, but the contexts and applications in subjects like international law, vigilantism, or healthcare are interesting and easily digestible. If you take this course, be prepared to do a great deal of reading, but Professor Lombard spends time in lecture reviewing the material. Still, given that there were five short pop quizzes covering the night before's reading throughout the semester, it pays to be prepared.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course to a fellow student. The amount of learning that happens in this course is vast but the opportunities to practice that learning are few and far between. If the course proves to be something that you feel you can latch on to without many essays, go for it.",
    "I would recommend Law as Culture to other students if they are looking for a broad overview of law as it functions in society. Definitely very interesting course even if you are not an Anthropology major; probably a good 5th class as well!"
