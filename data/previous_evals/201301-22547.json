   "comments": [
    "It breaks up the civil war into prewar, war, and reconstruction. The course is poorly taught.",
    "This was a great course. Blight is great to listen to and the workload (except for the reading) is really manageable. It won't necessarily make you fall in love with the Civil War, but it's definitely interesting.",
    "Take it! You learn a ton and it's an important part of our history.",
    "Top 3 History class at Yale. Take this course.",
    "the civil war is something everyone should know about. this class is great.. history major or not",
    "I would only recommend this course because it is interesting material and the classes are on open courses. blight was incredibly underwhelming and boring at times",
    "Yes, a must take Yale class.",
    "Civil War history... with lots of primary sources, a quirky professor, and really interesting readings.",
    "If you do not have much background on the Civil War, I would really recommend this class. I definitely learned a lot about a relatively well-known topic.",
    "Take it, Blight is a great professor, captivating lectures, two short papers and a final.",
    "Not worth it",
    "Don't take this class Credit\/D. You'll have no motivation to do the readings, and Blight doesn't really cover the history in lecture, he spends a lot of time giving us colorful viewpoints of historical figures. I learned very little in the class because I took it Credit\/D.",
    "Best lecture I have taken at Yale. Take it.",
    "Yes, take this course. Be prepared to put in the work yourself, because lectures are essentially Blight trying to mix history with stand-up comedy for an hour (he goes 10 minutes over the allotted class period every time). The overly dramatic readings get old very quickly. But, nonetheless this is an excellent history class.",
    "Really great class. Blight is a fantastic lecturer and always fun to listen to.",
    "YES! The lectures are great, the reading are great, my TF was great. Take it!",
    "Great lecture - there's a ton of reading that's interesting but he overassigns reading so don't freak out. You can do some and still get by pretty well.",
    "This is a superbly well taught course about a part of American history that is still debated and, in many cases, poorly understood. This is one of those \"must take\" courses for anyone who has the slightest interest in history (which should be everyone).",
    "I'd recommend if you want to learn about the Civil War and how it has shaped the US even today.",
    "Definitely take it. The subject matter is interesting, and the lectures are engaging.",
    "There isn't any homework, aside from two papers and a final. I'd actually say it's pretty laid back. If Blight's poetry doesn't bother you (and it might, because it feels like you're not learning anything), and you're even slightly intrigued by the subject, I'd recommend taking it.",
    "YESYES! One of the best lectures at Yale!!!!! So interesting!",
    "An absolute must take course at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take it. Blight is a genius.",
    "This was a really awesome course, and I think it's certainly worthy of being considered one of the \"Must take at Yale\" courses. Professor Blight is a riveting lecturer, though he tends to wax poetic and cannot contain his lectures to 50 minutes. So if you plan on taking this class, don't take another one that starts immediately after it on the other side of campus. Also, though his lectures were always really interesting, I'm not sure I actually learned much from them. The reading was much more instructive. There's a lot of it, but you don't have to do nearly all of it--McPherson and Foner were the most useful for the final exam, so I read those in their entirety. For the rest of the reading, I only read the stuff that was relevant to the essay topics. I definitely recommend this course!",
    "Great class. It made me choose the Civil War and Reconstruction as my favorite era to study. I definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes. Must take course at Yale. Final Exam is not that hard either.",
    "Good history class, material is not that hard, really interesting",
    "HIST 119 covers the causes, course, and consequences of the Civil War. There are weekly readings, two essays, and a final exam. Though there is a good deal of reading, the books assigned are all incredibly interesting. Professor Blight is incredible. I would absolutely recommend the class. It is by far the best course I have taken.",
    "Prof. Blight's lectures were great, and the reading is really interesting if you have time to do it (there is a lot, but TAs are generally pretty helpful in telling you what's most important to read). Really fun and informative class.",
    "I would recomend this class to another student and already have several times. I think that is is a wonderful class even if you dont enjoy history. The lectures are fun and interesting and the readings are also interesting however there is a little too much work.",
    "Great class! Grading can be a bit harder than expected, but you will learn so much. I definitely recommend. Civil War history is very important for every American to grasp.",
    "An enjoyable history course. There is a decent amount of weekly reading which you should at least do some of if you want to have some clue of what's going on in section outside of the discussion of lecture topics.",
    "Great course, I would definitely recommend to history and non-history majors alike.",
    "Sure! One of those solid history lectures; there's a reason a lot of people take it. And, it's a history that's important to know in a depth beyond what you get in a high school survey of US history.",
    "Great course that lives up to the hype. Professor Blight is great. Take it, and you won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Definitely take this class! There is a TON of reading, but the graded assignments are not very much work and the material is mostly interesting. Plus, Blight is a fantastic professor - his personality really comes through and makes everything more interesting.",
    "Good class. Good overview of the Civil War which is an important period in American history. Also, not to much work. Take it! -- Blight is great.",
    "Great lecture! take it!",
    "It's good. You should take it. Trust me man.",
    "This is a good overview of the Civil War with its main values being Blight's lectures, the Lincoln and Douglass readings, and the Battle Cry of Freedom.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Even if you're not a history major\/person! FASCINATING! This course turned me into a history major! From biology! TAKE IT!!! Lotssss of reading but every page turns itself and you truly enjoy each book and story, it was actually pleasant studying for the final!",
    "DEFINITELY - a great class, whether you plan to be a history major or not.",
    "Really interesting class. The lectures often end up as \"Storytelling with David Blight\" but the stories are totally worthwhile, and the class as a whole helps conceive of the Civil War in a whole new light.",
    "good lecture",
    "Blight's a great lecturer, just goes off on too many tangents. Your basic Civil War survey course.",
    "YES! Civil War history is fascinating, Blight is a great lecturer, and section is fun. TAKE IT!",
    "yes, take it if only for Blight. he's brilliant and you'll want to go to lecture just to listen to him talk and tell stories.",
    "If you're interested in the subject matter (a more social history of the causes\/events\/aftermath of the Civil War), definitely take the class - but if you're looking for (1) an easy A, (2) a military history of the civil war, (3) a light workload for a fifth class, or (4) tightly structured lectures with a \"take-home lesson\" each time, look elsewhere. David Blight is fantastic - you've heard that before, and it's definitely true. If you're interested and don't mind actually working on your two papers, take it just for his stories.",
    "A great and incredibly entertaining lecture. Take this class! It has been one of my favorites at Yale",
    "Decent class, I did credit\/d and it was good to not have to do all the reading.",
    "My favorite history course yet. Blight is terrific!",
    "Take this class! The material is really interesting, and it's not much work at all. There is a fair amount of reading, but it's easy to skim and most of the time you want to actually read all of it because it's so interesting. Professor Blight is a really funny, engaging lecturer. I'd highly recommend this course.",
    "If you're interested in the subject matter, take it!",
    "Civil War is a survey of the war and the extensive literature pertaining to it. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Amazing professor, amazing class. I took it Cr\/D so I could enjoy Blight lecturing without worrying about keeping up with the (substantial) reading. TF grading varies but is pretty tough. Take it.",
    "Take it if you have even the slightest interest in the Civil War!!!!!!",
    "Yes, if you like reading. Blight is amazing.",
    "One of the best classes around. Really got me into the civil war.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as a great history class. Professor Blight is entertaining, the material is interesting, and the workload is not too difficult. The papers were a bit tricky in my opinion, but section participation weighs in to your final grade and the final exam, though cumulative, is made easier by review sessions and a study guide distributed by the TAs. Definitely take it during your time at Yale!",
    "Overall, I adored this course, mainly because my absolute favorite time period in American history is the Civil War. Professor Blight's lectures were enchanting; he has an old-school style of lecturing (no Powerpoint), and while he does project a hand-written outline using an over-head projector, he lectures mostly off the top of his head; this makes for a different sort of lecture that, while perhaps not as organized, per se, is powerful in its own way. Blight likes to read quotes from Civil War contemporaries; although I sometimes wished he had spent more time expounding on the events of the war, these quotes ultimatley added color to his lectures and made them almost magical. Blight is brilliant because he has an astute, sophisticated understanding of the thematic significance of the war and the ways in which the Civil War has been remembered in U.S. history. You learn why exactly the Civil War has come to be perhaps the most remembered, commemorated, and even celebrated event of American history.The essays (two of them plus a final; no midterm) are definitely complex and difficult, as the prompts tend to be broad. Our first essay essentially asked us to answer the question, \"What caused the Civil War?\" -- no easy feat to accomplish in just 5 or so pages. But they were definitely doable, especially if you had your TA review your essay draft. The final took quite a bit of studying, but I did not find it all that difficult in the end. Overall, I knew this was a course I had to take while at Yale, and I definitely really enjoyed it. My only complaint would be that some of the TAs defintiely seemed better than others, but just hearing Blight lecture twice a week makes up for any discrepancies among the TAs.",
    "yes I would recommend this course for another student and would summarize it as a course dealing with the cultural aspects of the war as well as the facts and details",
    "The reading is really interesting and I recommend doing it if you have the time. I wish I could've done more of it. It's a good class to take C\/D so you can just enjoy Blight without worrying about the grade too much. Essay questions were absurd though.",
    "I would count this as one of the best classes I took at Yale, and basically the top lecture class I took. It's hard to say exactly why it is so enjoyable: there's a magic in this class that defies attempts to define it. But as many people will no doubt say in their comments, ProfessorBlight has a truly exceptional voice and lecturing style; he is a poet! In fact, he sometimes even uses Civil War-era poems -- very effectively -- to illustrate a historical idea. He is mesmerizing, in short! But it is also the subject matter, which he so ably explains, that makes this course so wonderful...if you dig a bit into American history and politics, you discover that the Civil War and its aftermath underlies so much of modern America.I'm ashamed that I was not able to attend all of the classes; I missed quite a few. But thankfully this class is available on the Open Yale Course website...I don't recommend missing the live performance, though. The only improvements I would recommend are: encouraging students to write research papers on topics of their choosing, instead of just providing the general (non-research-based) prompts. Also, the reading was varied, but there was a lot of it -- and I don't think all of it was necessary; whole books were usually assigned, instead of key chapters or journal articles.I took this class as a senior and it was an amazing way to end college. One of the few classes I encountered that left me wanting to learn even more!",
    "This class was somewhat frustrating because past students raved about it but the lectures did not deliver."
