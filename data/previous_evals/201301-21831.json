    "This class is great for trolling. The profs are both chill bros. I can't compare it to PChem 2 but biophysics is super easy - about 1 hr of work per week - and the tests are not bad at all. It's not as good as biochem, but a solid MBB class that you probably need to graduate.The sections don't really cohere and it feels like a methods class where you just lean method after method but don't really understand how to apply them in your own research.",
    "I came into this class pretty interested in biophysics having worked in a membrane biophysics lab for a couple of years, and am definitely interested in the field, but I'm not really sure why, since I probably still can't define for you what biophysics really is. This class is full of seniors who are smart but also in their last semesters at Yale, so the class pretty much turned into a complete trollfest all the time, which I enjoyed thoroughly. We can pretty much unequivocally agree that Enrique is a chill bro, which is important because its important to be a chill bro when you're devoting your life to science. Yorgo is less of a chill bro but I would still definitely be down to play a couple of games of pong with him on a Saturday night. Anyway, I don't really remember what we learned but crystallography is pretty cool, and the number of jokes you can make about the things you don't know about crystallography is large and can make for a fun experience. Anyway, find your best MB&B bros and take this class. Like, are you seriously tryna pchem 2, bro?Also I'm on the way to myrtle right now, so I apologize if this eval is inappropriate in any way. HAGS!!!",
    "This course does a good job presenting complex material in a relevant and very engaging way. For a required course, it far exceeded my expectations.",
    "It's not too difficult of a course. It's very interesting and the work load isn't too intensive. It sounds very intimidating but since the professors are nice and the course material isn't TOO difficult, you'll probably be fine if you lasted this long as a science major.",
    "I really wouldn't recommend this class unless you have to take it for the MB&B major. Taking it credit-D to fulfill a science major might be a good idea though, because almost nobody in the class gets a D or F, and the class is surprisingly easy as long as your'e willing to memorize the lecture slides.",
    "MB&B 302 was enjoyable on the whole. Enrique is a great lecturer, although it was often frustrating when he would fail to cover all the material for a given lecture within the class period. Yorgo was a good lecturer, although he would occasionally stumble while explaining topics because his slides are often not structured as clearly as they might be. However,he was very good at answering questions and explaining topics further during discussion sections. The first exam covered WAY more material than the final, so be prepared.",
    "Take it if and only if you have to. There are better ways to learn this material (and, I'm sure, better class here at Yale to learn them from!).",
    "This class is really great! You cover a lot of interesting topics and the professors are both interesting, approachable, and good lecturers. It's definitely a fun class to take and a very very different experience from pchem. I would recommend it to anyone in the MBB major.",
    "Of course. ESSENTIAL for having a good understanding of biochemistry. I definitely thought this class would be a lot different in terms of subject material before beginning the class. It unifies the knowledge you garner in all of your other biochemistry, chemistry, and physics courses. Granted some parts are less interesting than others (like the quantum mechanical basis of spectroscopy or crystallography) but it's all useful nonetheless.",
    "Go find that status about the course being a trollfest.TL;DR: \"like, are you seriously tryna pchem 2, bro?\"",
    "Excellent course. Very interesting, lots of resources for help, small classroom setting.",
    "The good news is, this class is not difficult. They seem to be pretty generous with the grading. And Enrique is an awesome teacher and you're really going to enjoy his classes. But the rest of the time when Yorgo was teaching, I found it impossible to pay attention in class no matter how hard I tried.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to other students. Enrique De La Cruz was hands down the best professor that I have ever had and the class was amazing and fun.",
    "Good class! Not too hard but very interesting.",
    "This course is designed for advanced MB&B majors. However, there was one physics major in the class, and she seemed to do just fine (she did communicate with the professors about her background starting from early on). I imagine that she might have even got more out of the class than others, by virtue of the newness of the perspective this class takes. The structure\/format of this course is perfect. It is exactly what a good lecture-based science course needs to be. There are slides that stand alone, there are only problem sets when it makes sense based on how much material we have covered, there are some scientific papers, there are only two tests that ARENT impossible, and problem sets are worth a lot (which is good since in every class they take up a huge portion of your time for the class anyway). The workload and distribution of the workload over the semester is also very friendly to a second semester senior's schedule (which is what most people are who take this. However, the slides and the way the material was presented just straight up is not good. Enrique's stuff was not very well organized, but at least it sort of became clear exactly what we were responsible for, and what were the takeaways that he wanted us to know (since he really really emphasized a few things for each lecture). Still, they weren't really well organized. Yorgo's lectures just plain didn't make sense. You have to literally decode them to understand the basics of the story he is trying to tell. I get that he trying to keep the concepts simple enough for us to understand, but he makes many fundamental logical leaps that just leave us confused. It was almost not at all worth it to go to lecture for x-ray crystallography (except for the verification that no one else knew what was going on either). Nonetheless, I can tell that they are trying to make this class good. Hopefully, one day it can have as good as a reputation as the biochem courses (specifically, biochem I), but with a lower intensity level and a lighter workload. I think it makes sense for biophysics to be less intense because, like Enrique put it, we are revisiting a lot of topics we've seen before, but just calling it biophysics now. Also, there is no reference text, so we are obligatorily limited by what can be covered in depth in class. Overall, a positive experience, but there are still many ways to improve the class. Enrique is really passionate about his work and this class. His enthusiasm is contagious and he makes learning fun. I actually learned some pretty new things from him that have changed my perspective and fundamental knowledge about biochemistry and biophysics. However, his lecture slides are not the clearest. Although, I've heard he's improved throughout the years. Overall a great lecturer, who is at least very clear about what you need to know from his lectures, which kind of makes up for the scattered nature of the material on his slides. He is also always available to meet and chat, which makes him another great resource. Yorgo's lectures are very dry. You can tell he knows his stuff, but he just doesn't explain things clearly. He makes a lot of logical leaps that make the story he is telling almost impossible to decipher. I get that he is trying to simplify some impossibly difficult concepts for us, but there are some steps or transitions that you just can't skip in order for us to understand what is happening. My recommendation is, instead of organizing your x-ray crystallography slides by topic, organize them by numbered steps. I think that will more clearly communicate what is happening when we are trying to figure out which slides are background knowledge, which slides belong to which step in the crystallography process, etc.",
    "Yes. Very do-able. non-cumulative exams. Really appreciate the principles.",
    "It's a decent course. Much easier than biochemistry, but the some of the material you learn is stuff that you probably havenot encountered in other biology courses.",
    "Pretty much everyone who takes this class is doing so for that major. That being said, it is really not that bad and I a lot of the material is interesting and enjoyable to learn about. It is really quite manageable to take alongside any of the other MB&B classes.",
    "You probably have to take this class (or P Chem 2... why would you take P Chem 2??). This class is easy-going without skimping on valuable material. Professor De La Cruz is the coolest MB&B professor I have ever had - he'll make you engaged in the subject even if you're not into biophysics to begin with. Not much work, not much stress, just a good class.",
    "Great class. Over the past couple of years, it seems like the reviews for this class have steadily improved as the professors have made an effort to improve the class, and I think the current version of the class is wonderful. Professor de la Cruz is a very entertaining lecturer, and I think Professor Modis is a great lecturer as well despite reviews saying otherwise (they say he's a little dry but unfortunately anyone will seem a little dry next to de la Cruz). The topics covered are fascinating; I don't think I will pursue research in biophysics, but I feel like it's important as a biomedical researcher to know about it and to be aware of the biophysical techniques that can be used in biomedical research. If you're an MB&B major, you have to take this class or second semester PChem. I was one of those who was considering second semester PChem because I like math, but I chose this course because it's more relaxed but still a fascinating and rewarding class. Take it!",
    "It's a great course that is well worth taking. Workload is reasonable and the material is very interesting.",
    "It's rather hilarious that our major is called Molecular *Biophysics* and Biochemistry, and this class is the only education in Biophysics most of us will ever get. Anyways, here are some thoughts. Enrique is universally regarded as a chill bro, and he is pretty fantastically entertaining. Yorgo is a more typical science lecturer, and is charged with the task of teaching some pretty complicated crystallography. You'll get a basic grasp of the concepts during the course. In theory I should be in love with the subject of biophysics, being a very quantitative person and liking math chem and physics in addition to bio. In practice the course is pretty solid but definitely not some sort of intellectual revelation. It did introduce me to a slightly different way of thinking about biological problems, though, so I guess that's kind of cool. When I see this type of material in the future I should be able to have a good appreciation of the approach being taken. Hey, not too bad!As a final note, know that half the class will be second semester seniors trying to live that #swuglife.",
    "If you are an MB&B major you obviously have to take it. It is not bad and a lot of the math is diluted out. Pretty chill class. You begin learning about equilibrium, kinetics, life on the single molecule level, quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, single molecule techniques, diffraction\/x-ray crystallograpy.",
    "Overall, I thought MB&B 302 was an excellent course. I liked the modular structure, because it enabled us to cover many topics in detail and to learn about each professor's specialties.Be aware that the professor changes halfway through. I loved Professor De La Cruz, but found Professor Modis a bit confusing and thought his lectures would have been better if he had put in more preparation."
