   "comments": [
    "Although Professor Lebron says that the class is open to everybody, even if they don't have any philosophy background, as a student without any philosophy background, I really struggled. Although Professor Lebron did a lot of explaining, it was often difficult to follow the readings or the class conversation, so I could definitely feel a little bit lost at times. Just a heads up.",
    "I would recommend this class. There is a fair amount of writing, so be ready for that, but the papers aren't difficult as long as you do the readings and give yourself enough time to write thoughtfully. It's a very interesting topic with a very good professor, so if you are willing to put in the work, it will be worthwhile.",
    "If you're interested in moral philosophy, this is a great class to take. I've learned how to eloquently speak about forgiveness, blame, and responsibility.",
    "This class covers everything from free will to political philosophy, so it's a great mix of topics in philosophy. The readings are a bit long but interesting. There's also slightly more writing (in terms of pages) than other seminars I've been in, but the writing assignments are really useful as a way to review course material.",
    "This seminar is cross-listed in a bunch of different departments but it is first and foremost a philosophy class. That being said, it's taught differently from other Phil courses at Yale and so if you haven't taken it in the past, you can probably still feel comfortable. That said, the material is super interesting, a bit counterintuitive, and Lebron does a great job of explaining it and encouraging you."
