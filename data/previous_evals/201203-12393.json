    "A good seminar, but don't take it if you're just someone who likes maps. You really have to want to know the philosophy of mapping in general. I was not that person, and most of the readings made me fall asleep. But the class is good because Prof. Rankin himself is great--a really good class leader and helpful with questions you have about maps or the term paper. And his own maps are so cool: www.radicalcartography.net. Anyway, I'd recommend it on the whole, but only do the readings when you have the energy to understand what the hell they're saying--because I sure didn't.",
    "This is a really fascinating class that I would definitely recommend. It has probably, more than any other class I've taken at Yale, changed how I view the world. It will really make you reconsider not just the maps you see every day but general understandings of cultural identity formation and expression. There is a good amount of reading but nothing at all unmanageable and the readings are all actually very interesting. The projects are all fun and the work load overall is average.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, by far. Although a lot of the reading dealt with historical material (mapping during World War II, for instance), it felt less like a history class and far more like a social science course on theories of cartography, territory, identity, etc. (hence the course title). Some of my favorite readings I've done in college--wide range, but all clearly related, so it was easy to write the (very short) discussion questions each week relating reading to course themes. Beware that this class will entirely change the way you look at maps (and what you even consider to count as a map).Re: workload and strengths as a seminar, heavier workload than some because of the papers ahead of the final BUT we do peer reviewing\/mini presentations before each--which not only prevents you from leaving everything to the last minute, but also means by the time you sit down to write you always have feedback from peers and Prof. Rankin so it's hard to go wildly wrong. Even better, Prof. Rankin gave me more feedback on every paper (good and bad, and including my final paper even though he no longer had an obligation) than I've gotten from any teacher at Yale (including in WR classes!). REALLY valuable, made the class feel like a tutorial on analysis and argumentation as well (which would be useful to a student from any major). The mapping assignment stinks if you're bad with technology\/art, but he cares more about your point than the look of the final project.",
    "This is a class about the politics of cartography, territory, and identity. It is a very rigorous seminar with a lot of reading and very high expectations on the part of Professor Rankin--it requires a great deal of effort on the part of the individual to do well. That being said, this class will completely change how you think about maps and what they say (and don't say) about the world--I highly recommend it if you are interested in the subject (which we delve into very deeply and rigorously) and are willing to dedicate the time to. It will change the way you think.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class will change your understanding of maps forever. If you love maps, you'll love them more, because there will be more to love. You'll learn that a map is so much more than a graphical representation of a part of the world on a piece of paper. You'll learn what maps have meant to different people from different places at different times in history. You'll deconstruct maps and then reconstruct them again.This is a history class, but it's also a history of science class, and it's basicallyalso an anthropology class. It's hard to talk about maps and identity for a while without starting to talk about identity in and of itself. It's hard to talk about \"indigenous\" maps without questioning the term \"indigenous.\" So be prepared for discussion that isn't purely historical or philosophical.",
    "HSHM 422 is an excellent and engaging class. Professor Rankin is an excellent professor - extremely organized, thoughtful, understanding and engaged. I felt that the class had very high standards for preparedness, and that I was behind if I hadn't done one of the readings thoroughly. While this made the class challenging because there was a lot of reading, it also prepared us for thoughtful and informed discussion. This class is more about discussing the decision processes that go into making maps, instead of making maps or discussing their history. Definitely take if you are willing to put in the work and you want to consider ideas of national identity and conquest from a very different perspective.",
    "Fantastic course for anyone - even a non-major - to take. I guarantee that you will never look at a map the same way again. Professor Rankin is a fantastic professor, very engaged in the discussions and genuinely excited about the material.",
    "The best summary which could be given of this class is \"epic waste of time\" typically I would use fewer words to describe such a lacking course offering. However, in order to describe just what a pathetic expenditure of valuable class and study time this class is I think the word 'epic' is necessary. There is too much writing, too much reading, a moody closed-minded professor who loves to belittle his students when he disagrees with them, and all in all a terrible experience."
