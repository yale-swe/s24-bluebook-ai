    "An important and necessary class for any undergraduate's career. I loved how this class was secretly really involved with issues of race, gender, class, and sexuality. If you have a good TF, it's worth it.",
    "Meh. Maybe take it to see if you REALLY want to go to Law School.",
    "This course is a must take. I was hesitant going in because of the presumed workload, but my favorite class at Yale. If you're hesitant, I would definitely recommend taking the course. Amar is the best professor around and the TA's are extremely helpful and intelligent",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the class very much this year. A lot of reading from the casebook, and Amar only covers a little bit of those in class. So if you don't do the reading, you are pretty much screwed for the midterm\/final. Take the class with section, it will make your time so much easier.",
    "Yes. It's one of those Yale classes you should just take.",
    "The class is over-hyped and not worth your time. Professor Amar is incredibly biased and makes his opinions known, which detracts from an even-handed evaluation of constitutional law. I don't really feel like I got anything out of this class, especially since the lectures are disjointed and the only purpose of section is to explain the cases that were insufficiently covered in lecture. I wouldn't recommend taking this class, but I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with me.",
    "Con law is an awesome course if you're interested in issues of government and\/or are interested in going to law school. Honestly, even if you're not, the course covers really important, ripped-from-the-headlines issues, and by the end of it, you'll be able to justify Supreme Court decisions to yourself, which is really cool. It's certainly a lot of reading, and if you have a heavy courseload, you might be better off taking it Credit\/D (or at least starting it that way.) The exams are tough, but doable. DEFINITELY do a section (they're optional) if you're taking this class. Amar's lectures are good, but it's much easier to enjoy the material if you engage with it; also, it helps to prepare you for exams.",
    "Con law. It's self-explanatory",
    "Take it!!! It's worth the amount of reading. When will you ever so thoroughly learn about the Constitution?",
    "Take it, but at least start out with it Credit\/D. There isn't a ton of work, but it's definitely not easy. I learned a ton and found it all super interesting, but there are also times when the course could become frustrating. Professor Amar is super brilliant and a good lecturer about 2\/3 of the time but some of the lectures definitely get convoluted and confusing. Listening to kids from other years talk about the course, I got the impression it was basically the best course at Yale. Overall, I'm really glad I took the course but it definitely had its limitations.",
    "I have mixed feelings about the course. Professor Amar teaches it because he cares about Yale College and teaching undergraduates, and goes out of his way to demonstrate this commitment. It is an incredible opportunity to learn from him. However, lectures could be disorganized and difficult to make sense of without a firm understanding of the material. In retrospect, however, I have learned a great deal from this course and all the sections seem to be highly recommended. Do not take it without a section. I'd recommend the course if you're actively interested in the material, but as with all classes, if you are not to some degree self-motivated, it might not be for you.",
    "This is the ideal course to take credit\/D. Amar is an amazing lecturer, and the content is really interesting and foundational to understanding American politics.",
    "Great, interesting class with hit-or-miss lectures. But always interesting to hear about the world from Professor Amar's point-of-view. You cover all the most interesting cases, but you go through them so quickly (except for McCulloch v. MD) that you sort of have to learn the details on your own. Also, note that if you're taking this class because you're interested in civil rights, the class covers rights in the second half of the semester and rushes through almost all the cases. Most of the class will be on basic principles of constitutional interpretation and the balance of powers among the three branches of government.",
    "Lots of reading. Lectures sometimes hard to follow. But kickass TFs and interesting material. Also midterm and final are nothing like you've taken before. They're stressful but also very stimulating. (they're open-book and you have to rely more on tools and skills than memorization or rote work).",
    "Every American should be exposed to these cases and themes in order to be a better informed citizen.",
    "It's a class that you have to take at some point. It's a lot of reading especially for the end, so if you don't think you'll be willing to do that then take it Credit\/D, but take it nevertheless.",
    "AMAZING class. Amar is brilliant - sometimes repetitive in lectures, but his insight is absolutely incredible. The TAs are great, and Amar is also really accessible! Everyone's always like \"don't take this as a freshman!\" but it's definitely doable. TAKE this class. You'll never look at American history, or any news surrounding a Supreme Court case, the same way again. TAKE IT.",
    "Con Law can be overrated, BUT I do think it's worth taking. If you have any interest in American politics\u2014even if you're not considering law school (I'm not)\u2014then taking a course as this will definitely increase your understanding of American politics since constitutional law is so fundamental to it. A word of advice: Sign up for a section. I went half the semester without having done so and didn't realize what I was missing. I went to section for the second half and really felt like I was learning so much more. And a word of caution: Professor Amar will at times editorialize on political things that seem completely tangential to the case at hand; it's definitely annoying and distracting, but those instances shouldn't be enough to keep you from taking the class. It's still definitely worth it.",
    "I LOVED this class. Reading the casebook can seem daunting but it's awesome when you do it, and the lectures are super interesting. Definitely take it. Cr\/D if you don't have access to notes from someone else that will guide you through the course.",
    "This is a great class for learning more about politics and law. I highly recommend it. Professor Amar is great--go to the lunches.",
    "An incredible experience. Probably one of my best at Yale.",
    "Great class if (and only if) you do the casebook readings. The readings are incredible; the lectures are mostly great; Professor Amar is brilliant; the exams are pretty fun to take. This class will definitely change how you think about the Constitution, and about law in general. Contrary to what Professor Amar will say, I don't think this is a good class to take Cr\/D. It would be a very EASY class to take Cr\/D, but you will take almost nothing out of this course if you don't do the casebook readings. (The supplemental books are less important, but still very interesting.) If you're willing to read the opinions, though, I highly recommend the class!",
    "This course will open your eyes to the world of constitutional law. It may be a good idea to take it Cr\/D though because the readings are completely unmanageable.",
    "This is a lot to do as a second-semester senior (which is what I did) and a lot to do in general. If you have the desire and some good study guides (there are plenty out there trust me), you should be fine. I generally recommend the course, but it might be a good Credit\/D option.",
    "Definitely a class I would recommend. There's a lot of reading to do so taking it credit D is helpful, but it still is manageable as a letter grade. Anyone with an interest in American history would benefit from this class.",
    "This is a must-take class at Yale. Professor Amar is one of the leading scholars in his field, and an overview of constitutional law is something that every American should know. There are a number of entertaining guest speakers, and Professor Amar invites anyone so inclined to join him for lunch in the law school dining hall every Wednesday for informal discussion, which is a great opportunity to pick the brain of a preeminent legal scholar. The section TAs are all rockstars, too - Rhodes scholars, Senate advisors, and the like. A good class to Credit\/D because you can get away with just skimming the reading and still learn a ton.",
    "If you have a good grasp of American History, you're willing to work hard, and want to consider yourself an educated, good American citizen, drop everything and take this class.",
    "I took this course cr\/d as a science person who knew nothing about social sciences or law, and I'm really glad I did. Amar is difficult to follow if you don't have a good grasp of American history, because he tends to lecture thematically rather than chronologically. But even if you did no reading or extra work, you would absorb a ton about America's history, government, and culture from this class. This class made me cry on the first and last day of lecture, definitely a Yale classic.",
    "I found the class to be over-hyped. I did not think Amar's lectures were as great as they are built up to be, as they felt a little disorganized and hard to follow. I didn't love the class and the material, but do not regret taking it because it is important to have an understanding of the Constitution and significant constitutional cases in our history. Was very happy I did Credit-D because the work was mostly self-motivated, so I mainly read the cases that intrigued me.",
    "yep!",
    "As an international student, who has a burgeoning interest in Constitutional Law, I think courses like Con Law allow you the option of getting a basic understanding of American constitutional history without it being in a law school setting - where it would presumably be more intense. Two things about the course stand out for me - a)I came expecting the class to be just about the discussion of constitutional doctrine - but Amar makes the class about a lot more. He situates each of the cases in the historical context of the U.S. at the time, and he also offers these really cool side tidbits on the Justice's background or the personalities of the people involved that helps you appreciate the bigger picture to these discussions, or to understand why people think about the law in certain ways. Similarly, Amar talks a lot about the structure of the constitution - and why the Constitution is meant to create a certain structure of constitutional allocation of powers. The oft-repeated modalities of Constitutional interpretation are a really useful back-of-the-hand guide to think about any constitutional issue. b)You also get to read a lot of case-law ! Its important not to underestimate that aspect of the course - you will get a lot out of it if you do all the readings. Its run like a Law School course is what I've heard and is the vibe I got, but the expectations are lower - sort of like a law-school lite course. Prof. Amar is a luminary in his field - and you should definitely take the chance to learn from him ! Go to his lunches if they work with your schedule. Also definitely take this class with a section - the TFs are some of the most impressive people you will meet at Yale ! And do the optional research paper - its a great way to explore a topic you're interested in.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class: one of the best at Yale and one of the highlights of my undergraduate experience. Akhil Amar is absolutely brilliant and one of the most engaging and energetic professors I have ever had. Not only does he know the material better than just about anyone alive today, his own scholarship is the foundation of much of contemporary constitutional thought and interpretation. In addition to being a world-renowned constitutional scholar, he is a gifted teacher. He constantly connected the landmark cases and material we studied to important contemporary issues and current Supreme Court cases. And he was extremely good at putting cases into historical context and explaining the unspoken factors that shaped landmark decisions. Though Amar can be strongly opinionated toward liberal conclusions, his personal thoughts on cases were always elucidating and fantastic grounds for debate. And for being so famous, he was highly accessible to his students: he was generous with his time at office hours, and he had lunch with students every Wednesday before lecture. Beyond Amar, the material itself is fantastic, as much of contemporary politics, morality, culture, and government is due to the progression of constitutional law. This class doesn't just teach you what the state of constitutional law is, it teaches you how to *do* constitutional law: how to think like a judge, how to dissect the arguments of a Supreme Court opinion, and how to make constitutional arguments yourself. The class also stresses how constitutional decisionmaking is not only the job of the Supreme Court, but rather, includes the President, Congress, lower courts, and the people themselves. Overall, if you are at all interested in law, government, politics, history, philosophy, sociology, or fascinating intellectual thought, take this class. I cannot recommend it enough. A few words on the course's structure: section is optional, but I found it fascinating, helpful, and a pleasure to attend. Discussions in section were one of the course's highlights. The course has a good deal of reading (especially during the second half), though the quantity is definitely manageable and not unreasonable at all. The assignments and exams are extremely friendly and flexible: all exams are open book, notes, and internet, and each had a fast-paced in-class option, or an unspeeded take-home option (graded with a different standard and higher expectations for depth and analysis). There was also an optional research paper, which could only raise your grade if you opt to write it. Each assignment and exam was rather enjoyable, too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is very interesting and you get to meet a great professor and great TAs.",
    "I would encourage a fellow student to take Con Law Credit\/D. I did learn a bit about law and law school classes in a stress-free way. However the lack of a framework in terms of taking law school exams\/evaluations would have been stressful had the grade counted."
