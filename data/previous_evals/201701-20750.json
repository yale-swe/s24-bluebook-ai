    "This class is an interesting mix of traditional oratory (about which I knew very little and I now know a lot) and modern rhetorical theory, political analysis, and public speaking. It was a great class for someone preparing to enter into the world of public service.",
    "Great class! I learned so much about oratory and how it's related to our world through current events and everyday life.",
    "I sharpened my public speaking skills greatly.",
    "Speech giving theory and practice. Definitely useful skills.",
    "Best class at yale",
    "Overview of some of the Classics (which was nice since I didn't take DS), familiarity with famous speeches, and Hill's insights into current events. Improved my public speaking through practice and feedback from students.",
    "Good summary of history (for a non DS person) and got to learn about famous speeches and get better at speaking",
    "Oratory in Statecraft is a great class to take if you're hoping to learn about the rhetoric that orators have used throughout history.",
    "The course gives you very practical skills about speech making. Students will advise you on your tone, volume, gestures, eye contact, sincerity, etc. Besides speech giving, the course also gives you a wide overview of rhetoric and political philosophy from ancient Athens to modern America.",
    "Learned a lot about the importance of speech giving, how to deliver my own speeches better and how to constructively critique others.",
    "Stories of politics in DC and the relationship between the media and federal government. Classmates posed really insightful questions and interpretations of current events. Learned to think more critically about the underlying motives of government statements and decisions, and the media's portrayal of stories. Also had some practice and feedback writing and delivering speeches."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I love that Professor Hill takes time at the start of every class to go over current events and connect them to the material. Another strength is the opportunities to speak for your peers and receive feedback on your speeches (both the material\/content and the delivery). That's really the only way to become a better public speaker and this class offers many opportunities to practice and get feedback. One weakness is that the midterm material felt a little bit out of nowhere. There were a few questions that not a single person got right because, as far as I can tell, we didn't discuss the issues in class, so I wish the content had been a bit more closely tied to class discussions.",
    "Well-rounded, great discussions, great materials, great professor, great speeches and presentations by students. I wish there were more group work.",
    "The discussions based on present-day happenings were great.",
    "An enjoyable class. Helpful to analyze current events, especially with Professor Hill's experience. The speaking assignments were constructive. The student feedback helpful (though it became largely congratulatory). And it was valuable to study famous orators. I wish we had had more instruction in speech writing, given that we had to write two and writing goes hand in hand with speaking. I also wish that classes could have been longer. The hour and fifteen minute flew by before I realized it, each class, and there was much more we could have discussed. Finally, it would have been nice to hear Professor Hill's feedback on our speeches, as opposed to only our peers'.",
    "Super fun, good classmates, chill format",
    "This class is wonderful! It's extremely interactive.",
    "The strength of the course is you get time to actually practice giving a speech and receive feedback from your peers. You also get to watch other students almost every class and learn from them. Professor Hill also has many insights about the history of political thought and rhetoric. In terms of weakness, it sometimes felt like the course either focused on the theory of oratory that was too abstract or practical details like gestures or volume that were too specific and missed the middle ground of things like sincerity or intensity that are not that abstract nor that specific but are very important qualities of a good speech.",
    "The mid term was a bit of a curve ball. This was because very few of the things that came up were emphasized during lecture. The test felt like the professor was trying to catch us out, as opposed to encourage us to learn.",
    "The greatest strength of this course are my fellow classmates who are incredibly thoughtful, intellectual, diverse, and sincere people. Their commitment to contributing to discussions with respect for others and to creating an inclusive class environment made the course a wonderful learning experience. A weakness is that there are only 3 main opportunities to actually practice delivering a speech in front of the class. It was also expected that students keep up with all major stories in the current news cycle. Personally, this was difficult given my workload from my other courses. I would have appreciated some advanced notice of which 2 or 3 pieces of news we would likely be discussing in class. Even announcing potential discussion topics the morning before class would have been helpful."

    "This is a great class for senior year. Professor Hill has interesting stories and thoughtful insights and he brings all the benefit of his years of experience into the classroom. It's also an incredible opportunity to practice public speaking and receive direct, courteous feedback and criticism from your classmates and Professor Hill. It's not a lot of work and a big pay-off.",
    "Yes! It's a senior seminar. Very hard to get in. But once you are in, you should take it. You learn a lot about not just oratory and rhetoric but also how it's related to current events and everyday life. The workload is pretty light, and the opportunities to speak and present in front of the class are wonderful. Professor Hill is one of the greatest. Every senior should consider this class.",
    "Do recommend.",
    "Great course. Definitely take it you're a senior and can get in. One of the best classes at Yale. Great group of people. Great professor. Great overall.",
    "Absolutely. I found it a very valuable and enjoyable experience. It is a treat to take a class with Professor Hill. He's a huge proponent of a traditional, old-style liberal arts education, and the class really fulfilled three purposes: 1. Staying up to date on current events and contextualizing them in history. 2. Improving your public speaking, through practice and student feedback. 3. A crash course in classical works\/thinkers that you may not have studied at Yale but will feel like an \"Educated\" person to know. Very light workload and worth it!",
    "The chillest. You won't learn that much but you'll have fun. Set the tone of feedback giving properly early on",
    "This a Yale experience and a great time. You'll learn about yourself and feel much more comfortable speaking in public. Highly recommended.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in improving their speaking skills or learning more about political rhetoric and presentation.",
    "This class is a must take at Yale",
    "Easy 5th credit. Not much work at all. You can very easily manage without doing any of the reading. I didn't even but the course packet",
    "What makes this course great is the other students in the class. Prof. Hill has some interesting insights and stories from the White House, but I wouldn't say that this class is particularly amazing or life changing. Congrats if you get in - it's a fun class. But if you don't, you're not missing out and there are plenty of other interesting classes at Yale.",
    "This is the perfect senior spring class you're searching for. Low work load (you never have to do the readings) and perfect your public speaking skills. Classmates are the best of the senior class considering how hard it is to get into the class. Professor Hill is chill and fun."
