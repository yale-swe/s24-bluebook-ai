   "comments": [
    "More developed knowledge of playwriting and play structuring in particular!",
    "I enjoyed the workshop atmosphere but was missing an important element of constructive critique necessary for the production of fine work. The course seemed to accept the artistic goals of the writers (which is good necessary and healthy) without challenging how the writers sought to achieve those goals. I personally felt that my work could have benefited from a few pointers such as: \"I see what you're trying to do here, and I'm excited to see what you do with it. Might I suggest xxx? Because right now you're attempting yyy and I think xxx could be more effective, unless there's something I'm misunderstanding?\"",
    "I learned how to hone my playwriting craft with Deb's mentorship and expertise. I learned how to write a different kind of play than I had written before, which I think is the most important skill I could take away from an advanced playwriting course.",
    "My playwriting has certainly leveled up.",
    "I wrote another play!!!! This class helped me grow as a person and a writer and I cannot be more grateful.",
    "This class has taught me how to be a playwright. But more than that, it teaches me how to confront my inner fear."

    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!! TAKE IT!!",
    "I don't feel that this is as much a course so much as it is a workshop to write new work. Workshops aren't bad, but I didn't feel like I grew as much as I would have liked.",
    "This course is run fantastically and I have a feeling that it is adjusted to fit each class of students with its specific personalities. It's hard to pick out weaknesses in the course or the teaching.",
    "The only weakness of this course is that we don't meet more often. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale or at all. It might help to occasionally bring in actors to help us read scenes. I think it is really important and valuable for the playwrights to read other people's work out loud, but it would also help the writer hear their scenes read by people who have studied acting.",
    "This class is free-flowing in its format. It certainly allows for students to be creative but sometimes students aren't active enough in participating and making the best out of it."

    "Yes, one of the best classes at Yale, Deb is amazing!!",
    "Yes! It's fun.",
    "take it.",
    "Yes, playwrighting is so much fun and a great form.",
    "You should absolutely take Deb's course in playwriting, especially if you're passionate about playwriting like me. Deb's teaching style gives students a great deal of creative independence, which everyone should appreciate. And she maintains a close mentor-type relationship with her students that is very special among courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "This course is both a process of understanding playwriting and a process of understanding one's self, and my abilities to do both developed in parallel manners. This class is a wonderful course for anyone who is seriously interested in engaging with the study of theater.",
    "Take this. If you do nothing else, take this course. Deb Margolin is an angel. This class will help you form fast friendships and make you a better writer. If you put in the work, which is work you will actually really enjoy and get a lot out of, you will walk out that class with a play. An entire play. It's an amazing feeling to print out a play, a whole play, that YOU wrote, that you created out of nothing. This class will make you a better writer, but, thanks to Deb and her unique and beautiful teaching style, it'll make you a better person, too.",
    "Yes! Deborah is a treasure to this university and I'm lucky to be her student."
