    "fun and casual environment to talk about some current issues in research ethics. maybe could have condensed the material\/covered more topics.",
    "Content was a bit heavy. Too many exams.",
    "strength: very interactive",
    "The experience shared by the instructor is really impressive.",
    "talks about lots of real-life issues. Very vivid.",
    "The course provides important topics that we must learn about academic ethics. It was well organized with clear definitions helpful case studies and discussions. The course was mandatory for graduate students. I took the same course before as a Master student. I understand that it is important to remind students the importance of ethics issues and to refresh related knowledge. However, the material did change much. So it was a little boring taking the curse again.",
    "It is organized well.",
    "strengths: the slides are clear and informative weaknesses: it would be better if the professor could be more animated",
    "it is a concise summary of research ethics",
    "This course provides a wide range of knowledge about key concepts in scientific research, but the engagement of the students is not very high.",
    "Having the sessions over lunch rather than at the end of the day.",
    "Strengths of the class were the openness on the part of Prof. Tschudi (and guest lecturers) about the peaks and valleys of academia as well as the engagement of student opinions, perspectives, and experiences with the topics (via questions, case studies, etc.). The only big weakness is the lack of engagement on the part of ~1\/2 of the students (they and you know who they are...).",
    "I thought the course was strong given its important content and could have been stronger if the extra sessions facilitated by Kate Nyhan were included as part of the course and not just an add-on. Sessions from OCS, CTL, and other YSPH resources would have fit nicely into the course to make it more practical.",
    "Less busy homework. More group sessions."
