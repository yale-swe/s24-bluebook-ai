   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it.",
    "It is ok, the MechE version is easier than the ChemE version.",
    "I would only recommend taking this class if you have to. The course could have been structured better as the transition from Gomez to Van Tassel was a bit confusing. Professor Gomez's lectures were often difficult to understand and professor Van Tassels lectures were very well structured but they were sometimes dry. There was also a good amount of work. It was manageable, but definitely more work than the average engineering class. I think other classes, like physical chemistry, cover most of the material and are relatively easier to follow.",
    "This was a really good introduction to thermo. It covers a lot of material but doesn't move too fast. The class splits at a great moment if you're a ChemE major, but Gomez's section gets a bit confusing. The workload is very manageable and the tests are reasonable. Gomez's midterm was much harder than the Van Tassel final. It's a bit silly to recommend this or not because if you either have to take it for your major or not, but for you engineering majors out there, this can be a class that you look forward to rather than one that you dread.",
    "Gomez is awful - definitely take the CENG track with Van Tassel after the midterm.",
    "A great improvement on the previous arrangement. In the past few years, only MENG 211 was offered and was taken by both mech E and chem E students. I hear it was a frustrating experience, especially for chem E students. This year, the solution was to have one class for the first half of the semester to teach the basic principles and then split into two more major-specific sections. While continuity between the two was a bit of an issue, overall it was a much more satisfactory experience than my impression of previous years. I definitely learned a lot from this class.",
    "This class is interesting, well-taught, and generally very good. The connection between the two halves was slightly jarring\/confusing but I would nevertheless recommend taking the chemical engineering track as you do learn a good bit of chemistry. There was a lot of focus on understanding in both halves of the class and, even though I took it after physical chemistry (also thermodynamics), I felt like I learned a lot. Perhaps even more since it was easier to understand the second time around (especially when approached from a slightly different angle).",
    "I think you're taking this if you have to for your major. I liked PVT better than Gomez, but you have the option to decide after the transition. weekly psets (varies by prof), conceptual quizzes (approx 4), 1 midterm (very late), 1 final."
