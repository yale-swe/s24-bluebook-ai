    "I would recommand this course strongly.This course provides good training for research beginners.",
    "Yes, I would, you'll learn about recent advances in RNA biology, which is a hot field. Not too much work involved. No papers or exams.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in doing RNA research, or if you just want to better understand the literature. The workload is consistent and reasonable.",
    "I would say that this is a great seminar class for students who want to learn more about different topics in RNA, or just to learn about how to read and discuss scientific papers in a group setting. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in RNA.",
    "This is a seminar course which discusses primary literature primarily centered around RNA and its diverse functions in cells. It is a discussion based class that is entirely based on student participation, which will enable students to really understand primary literature.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone interested in gaining a better grasp of the intricacies of transcriptional regulation.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it to all students.",
    "It's a good course to learn some general topices about RNA researches. I will recommend to another student. It's very useful.",
    "Yes. You can learn a lot in this course without feeling it's dragging you. It's a great course to take when you are taking 3 or more courses during the semester.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if the student is interested in RNA and wants to broaden their knowledge. However, the class is more about reading and analyzing the paper on your own and not so much discussing relevant topics with your class.",
    "Yes. Great if you're interested in RNA or just want more practice at reading papers. (this really is useful)"

   "comments": [
    "I plan to do my research on RNA biology, so this was helpful. Discussion was also helpful in helping me mold ideas\/critique papers.",
    "This course provided me with a lot of important tools for reading papers, analyzing and discussing papers, and thinking critically. This will be crucial throughout my graduate career. A number of the papers were also directly applicable to my future research field.",
    "I learned a lot about the RNA field. I don't know if this knowledge will be useful in my dissertation or future research but I really enjoyed learning about this new field.",
    "I think this class certainly deepened my knowledge and I can't help but imagine that it will prove very useful in the years to come.",
    "It makes me more intrigued by RNA molecules.",
    "After the course I established some general idea what's going on in the RNA researches field. It's very useful.",
    "Hmm...maybe I'll pick Frank Slack as one of my Qualifying Committee Members.",
    "We read a wide range of papers related to RNA. I am interested in RNA but some of the topics we covered I had not really read on before, so it was nice to get an idea of what RNA could do.",
