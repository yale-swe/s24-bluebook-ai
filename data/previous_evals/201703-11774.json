    "This class is perfect. Nothing to improve.",
    "Very fun and a good introduction level course to conducting. Instructions were very clear and it was a judgment-free zone where people could explore with different ways of conducting and didn't feel scared to make mistakes.",
    "I appreciate that this class is low stress and everyone is supportive of each other in class. That way students can focus on improving rather than worrying about what others think.",
    "Professor Shimada was very engaging and was incredibly eager to help us develop our skills.",
    "Professor Shimada is a great instructor. He was always very clear and gave very helpful feedback. Class was always very enjoyable and not only gave students insights into conducting but also allows students to realize aspects of ensemble playing through this different lens.",
    "Not very often do you have the opportunity to learn conducting, a great course",
    "The class is run like a masterclass. This was very effective structure, and despite there being little work I got a lot from the course."

    "Yes, Toshi is a great instructor and really helps you through the initial problems you may run into. Conducting is super fun, and as long as you practice outside of class and show that you are improving, you'll be very satisfied with the course.",
    "Yes! It's a wonderful stress free class for those who want an introduction to conducting!",
    "I really enjoyed this class and would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other musicians, especially those who do a lot of ensemble playing and want to see the ensemble through another lens and viewpoint. Professor Shimada is wonderful and always gave insightful feedback - it was clear that everyone in the class improved a lot over the semester and got more comfortable on the podium. Class was always very enjoyable and I always looked forward to it each week."
