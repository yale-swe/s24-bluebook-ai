   "comments": [
    "Going into this class with an open-mind will allow you to learn the most because even if the discussion isn't on what we expected it to be, Professor Greenwood is excellent in guiding us to think about important aspects of the work beyond just the content of it.",
    "If you are lucky enough to be assigned Professor Greenwood for H&P, DO NOT SWITCH.",
    "DS History and Politics provides an excellent introduction to the writings of Greco-Roman and early Christian historians, theologians, and political philosophers. Although making your way through some of the texts may be somewhat tedious and boring, the works become more interesting as the semester goes on, and the quality of the lectures increased significantly as the semester continued as well. Professor Greenwood was a fantastic section leader, simultaneously brilliant and also very interested in what all of her studentshave to say. I would definitely recommend taking DS History and Politics with her if you have the chance.",
    "Directed Studies: weigh the pros and cons, shop other classes, not for everybody, not even necessarily for people who think it would be, yadda yadda yadda. Now on to the section in particular. You'll like Professor Greenwood, but you might not like her section. She's very meta, very interested in the construction of texts over their content, very predictable as far as what she'll discuss, and generally she doesn't go very deep into the ideas we can take from the texts. However, she is knowledgeable about ancient Greece and she's good at guiding ideas in section so that they don't go astray. In all, not a bad section, but doesn't live up to the potential of the texts. One good thing: her paper prompts are consistently very intriguing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course and Directed Studies in general, so long as the student knows what he's getting into. History and Politics was was one of my favorite courses this semester.",
    "There was so much information to cover and absorb in this class that it was hard to take away a deep understanding of the works. Lectures were often dry, and didn't necessarily help students understand the importance or the main themes of the works. Class discussions depend a lot on the style of the professor. They can range from in depth discussions about single events or a particular passage, which is not usually very helpful for understanding the whole work, to analyzing the major themes and ideas, which is helpful.",
    "A lot of reading, which at times can be very dry, but you'll be glad you've taken it when you're done.",
    "I would recommend DS H&P. Although the course requires a great deal of reading, the subject matter is very interesting. Professor Greenwood made classes rewarding by providing scholarly insight and analysis.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It provided me with fundamental knowledge of historical texts and allowed me to lay groundwork for my future studies.",
    "Well, yes, I would recommend this course. History and Political Thought, given its vague name, is sort of a mixed bag in terms of the reading. At first you read mostly historians, but eventually the line between history, politics, and hardcore philosophy blurs. Whatever H&P professor you have, you will have a different experience, none necessarily better than the other, as far as I can glean from my own experience compared with the experiences of others."
