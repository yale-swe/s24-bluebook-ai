    "If you're interested in DS, do everything you can to switch into Duval's Literature section. I was lucky enough to get placed in his section originally and I didn't realize how lucky I was until I started getting feedback on papers and realized just how much time and effort Duval was investing in his students. Absolutely worth the late nights and the long readings.",
    "DS Lit involves a lot of reading; reading widely, but closely. It takes up a lot of time, but it was a wonderful experience.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. The reading list is designed well, with each work complementing its predecessor.",
    "This course requires a lot of reading, but the selections are by far the most interesting of the DS. I always looked forward to literature readings and it rarely felt like a chore. These are works every college student should read and I really enjoyed learning them in this setting.",
    "It is a great introducotry class that not only provides a foundation in classical works that will be important for future literature reading, but also teaches a way to read literature itself. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course if you have an interest in studying the classics in Western literature.",
    "This course is an intensive survey of ancient works of literature. I would fully recommend this course to another student because it teaches skills that are necessary for any field of study--reading, writing, and analysis.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student.",
    "Challenging and interesting course"
