    "Do it if you're interested in archaeology! You don't have to be a major to do it, and it's so different from other classes. It's definitely a commitment, but it was really refreshing to have such a hands-on project--digging artifacts out of the ground, and then coming up with your my own project to analyze them is liberating and pretty cool.",
    "If you want to spend some time learning about archaeology and working in the field, then the class is a good idea. Don't be intimidated by the archaeology majors- as long as you are interested in archaeology and willing to devote some time to the class then you will enjoy it. Digging on the weekends does take up time, but there was no lecture during the week when we were actually in the field, so it was very manageable. Think of it as a bonding experience. However, do keep in mind that you will be locked in to taking the second semester of the course as well.",
    "I would only recommend this class to other archaeology majors or to those in similar fields since combined with the lab this class requires a large time commitment.",
    "Yes! The lab is really fun and missing those weekends is not at all bad. Just don't take it freshman year, because you should be taking advantage of everything at Yale.Take it as a non major, it's fun and interesting. Not much work. At all. In fact. Was there work?"
