    "I learned an amazing amount of German in three months. I went from not knowing a word of German to being able to converse on a basic level with a degree of comfort. I also learned a lot about German culture by attending German film screenings and by being involved in a German play with the German department.",
    "This was a great course. I can't believe how much German we learned in only 4 months. We learned to use the perfect tense and the present tense, and the accusative, nominative and dative cases. We learned basic spoken, written, and aural German.",
    "I developed a strong base for the german language.",
    "From this one semester, I gained a surprising amount of German knowledge. I took Spanish for 7 years in elementary, middle, and high school, and I'm better at German now than I ever was in Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very fast paced and will leave you behind if you don't make the effort to keep up. However, you really learn a lot of vocab and grammar in this class and it brings you up to pace with German very quickly.",
    "The only drawback is we learned so much grammar but not a lot of nouns, so I feel like the range of topics I can discuss confidently is quite limited. I would also like to have learned to express an opinion on different things, e.g. by learning more adjectives, rather than simply stating their state, but I know that both of these things presumably come with time.",
    "Strengths- a lot of involvement and participation that strengthens your vocal skills weakness- need to discuss grammar a little more often",
    "Strengths: small-sized classroom, variety of engaging activities to introduce us to German culture (emails, movies, music videos, advertisements, etc.), the homework system that allows us to continuously do the assignment again until we understand it, the flexible oral tests that we can do over the weekend and without nerves impeding our thought process, the pacing is manageable, the creative video final project weaknesses: the homework system is confusing to access to check what we got marked off on, no requirement to memorize which vocabulary ahead of time (to memorize all of it would be overwhelming but new words get introduced into the work in increments that would be useful if we knew which words to know)",
    "This course was really great. The only improvement I would recommend would be focusing on teaching a little bit more vocabulary.",
    "I don't know how helpful it was to be completely immersed in German so early in my learning of the language. Frankly, I found it extremely difficult to understand the mechanics of German grammar because of this system. I was often demoralized and frustrated by this method of learning."

   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student looking to get a well-paced introduction to German. The simulated immersion environment is an effective way to structure a language course, and Schenker is an excellent instructor. The workload is quite manageable and the tests fair.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning German. It is a very good intro to the language and you will learn a ton.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially with Theresa. She does a great job of making it interesting and engaging everyday.",
    "Yes. It was empowering to learn so much German in such little time.",
    "I absolutely loved this classit was the best part of my day. Theresa Schenker is a wonderful professor and one of the happiest people I have ever met. I highly recommend taking German if you have any interest in learning it, and this class was just an amazing introduction.",
    "Yes i would recommend it, its not that hard if you pay attention",
    "Absolutely. The content is engaging and exciting because of how useful it is in everyday life. The progress in reading and writing and listening German is satisfying and impressive. The workload is not overwhelming, so you can take your studying at your own pace without being pressured by grades.",
    "Languages are always difficult, but if you are interested in learning German, this is a great introductory course. Be prepared for a significant workload though."
