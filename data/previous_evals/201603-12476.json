    "My knowledge was nothing more than basic. This course dramatically improved my knowledge and my way of thinking about the topic. It was of primary importance for improving my background in prevision of my PhD.",

    "I think there is nothing to add in terms of quality and requests. Maybe I would add a couple of hours of practice in the lab to show even the practical part regarding this topic.",
    "This course does a great job tapping into the current literature on important topics in cell type evolution and single-cell sequencing. It's really helpful to learn about the current state of the literature. In some cases, it would have been good to have more background literature on certain topics, such as sequencing technology. More group discussion of papers would be great, though that's partly contingent on the students in the class. The student presentations are a good way to engage the class and start a discussion."
