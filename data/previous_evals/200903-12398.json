   "comments": [
    "Very interesting, and worth it just to have Prof. Bushkovitch in a seminar.",
    "Wonderful seminar! Readings are deeply interesting but not too taxing in length. Class discussions are lively and questions raised in class are always worth listening to. What makes the class is the Professor. He really has command over the material and the goal toward which he gears each session. Not only is he entertaining but deeply erudite not just in Russian, but in all European history, which provides a truly enriching comparative perspective. This class was great and I looked forward to it each week. Start preparing for the paper early, though. 20 pages is not small. But it is the only written assignment...",
    "I would recommend the class- even if you're not particularly interested in Russia or pre-Industrial history, you will be by the end of the semester. And, if you already are, then it's a dream class.",
    "This class talks about all of Russia's history from 1500-1800 (thus the title...). It really helps understand greater things about russia and russian culture. Still, because it is a fairly obscure (or at least under-studied) topic, it tends to happen that professor buschkovitch lectures a bit throughout seminar. but there is always a lot of interaction and input from the students! it is a great class, and i feel like a really learned a lot.",
    "if you are interested in Russian history, absolutely take this course. and\/or if you like intense, grandfatherly professors, absolutely take this course.",
    "This is a great class for someone genuinely interested in the material, but will require a lot of self-motivation to get the most out of it (it could be too easy to not engage in class, but that would be a waste of time). The time period is fascinating, and holds many crucial revelations for the current identity of Russia and why the 20th century history unfolded as it did (for those interested in the implications of this history). I would greatly encourage people to embrace the research paper early on and give the topic the justice it deserves, to avoid stress and sloppiness in one's only official piece of work for the semester.",
    "Great look at Russia from right before Ivan IV, until Catherine the Great basically. Understanding how Russia came into somewhat of modernity, is very nice for other Russian classes. Bushkovitch is a great professor as well.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The material is a bit obscure (Russian Monarchy?) but Bushkovitch is very entertaining. I looked forward to class ever week. Great way to fulfill your predindustrial and European requirements.",
    "If you are interested in the time period, take it. You will not be disappointed, but you will be bored if you are not interested in the info."
