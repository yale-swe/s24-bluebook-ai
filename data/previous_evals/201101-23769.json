   "comments": [
    "An awesome class that lets you find your own way creatively. If you are looking to be directed (by prompts, etc.), this class may not be best for you because it relies on your ability to bring in a new poem each week without a prompt. However, the class provides you a great chance to experiment with your work and a guaranteed audience. The readings are cool too.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "If you can take it and are interested in a rather intensive writing workshop, do it. There won't be prompts or things to help you decide what to write about, though you will be encouraged to think of everything as fair game.",
    "This class was AMAZING. It's actually quite a bit of work if you do all of the reading and actually produce a poem a week (and don't use old ones, although using poems you've already written is completely acceptable and a lot of people do it). However, it's completely worth it. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the course to any aspiring poet who wanted to write every week, was prepared to be critiqued and to critique others work and was interested in dedicating more of their writing skill development to poetry.",
    "I would highly highly recommend this to the novice writer\/poet looking for a low-pressure way to learn and write poetry. My poems improved by leaps and bounds; more importantly, I learned exactly how to think like a poet, which I'll take with me for the rest of my life.",
    "It is a poetry workshop. I would recommend it.",
    "You write. You read. You workshop. Take it.",
    "A rigorous and friendly workshop where you will write and revise twelve poems. I would highly recommend this class to any student who has never written poetry before, but I would add a cautionary note that there are not any kinds of prompts and it is up to you to come up with something to write about each week."
