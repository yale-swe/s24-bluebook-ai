   "comments": [
    "An overview of key works from a range of time periods and cultures and how the political context of each work informs its interpretation and influence",
    "I developed the ability to look at a work of art and not only appreciate it for its visual and aesthetic properties, but learned how to consider the work in relationship to the events of the past and present and think through how it relates to larger narratives.",
    "I gained a lot of insight into the greater picture of art history and its place in politics. There were so many angles that were approached, and moments when Professor Bass would mention contemporary events that relate to these historical topics. I always ended with goosebumps.",
    "Brilliant intro to HSAR in general. Learned broadly about artistic movements and how they relate to representation. Focused on how art is displayed and accessed, as well as points of cultural contact both colonial and otherwise",
    "We covered art trends that directly reflected political trends throughout the entire globe. Not only did we learn some technical terms of art, but we mostly learned about overarching themes that seem to run through all different parts of the world starting from 5th century BC to the 1980s.",
    "In addition to the typical art history visual analysis and writing skills, I learned extensively about the intersections of politics and art. As someone in the policy and economics space, this course enabled me to apply those skills to a completely new setting and to challenge my assumption. I learned how to consider the historical context and other political or economic motives behind artistic representations. I also learned more about modern and contemporary art, to which I had not had extensive exposure.",
    "This class was amazing! I had never considered taking an art history class and I took this one on a whim. Professor Bass really teaches the students how to appreciate art. Before I would go into a museum and have no idea what I was looking at, but now I know what to look for in order to truly appreciate art. I really like how we learn about art from around the world and not just the west.",
    "In this course, I developed some skills in visual analysis and how to look at and write about pieces of art. The material was an interesting survey introduction to a current and engaging topic in the history of art.",
    "This was the first art history course I ever took and it was a really nice overview of artistic movements, types of art (painting, sculpture, engraving, architecture, etc.) and the role art and artists have played in social and political revolutions throughout history.",
    "Visual analysis concepts, general knowledge of different artistic periods, a lot of random fun facts\/knowledge",
    "i learned to think in a refreshingly critical way about art i have grown up looking at and the art museums i used to passively visit",
    "This isn't a survey course but you learn so much about history and art AND the history of art. You learn about different cultures, artistic styles, movements, and you get a great foundation in visual analysis.",
    "Not only did a learn a lot about art history, I also learned to look at the world more closely and critically. I learned to consider objects, monuments and institutions from multiple perspectives. I learned to discuss and write about art.",
    "Analysis of art in social and political contexts.",
    "I learned how to do close, critical analysis of art and write about art more effectively. I also learned about the history of art in a set of varied geographic regions.",
    "I got an introduction to art history, especially the art of looking and how to write about art. I learned how politics influences art, and how art itself is political. This course covers a wide expanse of time and places, so I learned about art from all around the globe as well as the way political climates shaped art.",
    "We looked at art history through a critical political lens. Lessons were taught by theme - my favourites being \"bricks in the wall\", \"pictures of revolution\", and \"race against the machine\"",
    "The course provides a very good overview of art history but with a critical political and cultural lens.",
    "I learned a lot more about the themes of art throughout history!",
    "I developed a comprehensive understanding of historical and modern representations of power in art. I learned artistic visual analysis, how to look really closely at pieces of art, notice details, and think about their intentions and effects. I also learned how to write about art, using vivid language that evokes each piece.",
    "Background to a variety of critical issues, mediums, and moments of encounter in a broad range of eras; visual analysis skills; introduction to writing about art with immaculate prose.",
    "Survey from antiquity to 80s, wide range of regions and media",
    "This class was really incredible. We learned about artworks from so many different places and times (not just the traditional Western survey course), and discovered how they all connected thematically through the politics of representations. I left each class with new interesting thoughts and ideas, having been introduced to a new artist, style, or artwork. This class will inspire your to think about art in new ways, from new perspectives, and both engage deeply with specific artworks and more broadly with themes that connect different art movements across space and time.",
    "This course is a great introduction to art history and works well as a survey because it covers art from a number of different countries and cultures throughout time. This course also helps you develop your ability to write visual analysis, as well as effective close-looking of art objects in situ.",
    "I developed a new perspective into viewing the world through. I also learned to always question what we see and to look deeper.",
    "I learned how to view the world and more specifically my surroundings differently and I improved my ability to analyze works of art and connect them to the historical context.",
    "One of my favorite aspects of this course was the discussions in section where we would be able to apply what we learned in lecture to the real objects in the collections at Yale. This was the first class where every section took place in the museums and collections around campus which was really valuable.",
    "I learned how to think about art from a critical perspective. The sculptures, paintings, objects, and architecture that we looked at were not typical inclusions in the Western canon - rather, they challenged traditional understandings of art.",
    "Great introduction to art history from a multinational and transnational perspective. This course helped me think about not just what individual pieces of art mean but also the context in which they're placed, what they're in conversation with, and how to look at the world around me in general.",
    "I developed great writing and visual analysis skills.",
    "I learned how to look at, analyze, and appreciate art in a whole new way. After this course, I'm much more open to seeing how art manifests in all aspects of society, and how art is so much more powerful than simple pictures hung on a wall.",
    "This course taught me how to look at art and how to examine what's really being shown and what that means-- this course changed the way I see the world.",
    "how to write a visual analysis how to think about the intersection of politics & representation in art",
    "the political implications of art of many different cultures and movements, a stronger ability to contextualise certain works in the modern context.",
    "This introductory course taught me the basic building blocks of art history, from ancient Roman and Greek art\/architecture to art produced during the Vietnam War to contemporary feminist art. Notably, this course was structured differently from traditional art history courses, it introduced ideas of colonization and empire and sexual violence and contrasted topics such as the Great Wall(s) in China to the US-Mexico border wall. This course taught me how artistic production is all interconnected to politics and is never neutral.",
    "I learned how to look at art with more specificity and intention. I learned to take notes well, and overall, the methodology most important in the field of art history more broadly",
    "I learned about art history throughout different time periods, but this difference, rather than separating from the overarching idea of representation, actually revealed the many facets to representation and how these aspects intertwined throughout history and never really cease to exist.",
    "Taking good lecture notes. Knowing when to listen and when to write.",
    "I re-engaged my interest in art history having taken its associated AP course in high school and explored a variety of new pieces and eras",
    "This is a survey course on art history through the lens of politics. \"Politics\" here generally concerns how power is represented and\/or how power is communicated and perpetuated through visual representation. We considered many different mediums--from painting to architecture to printed works. The lectures are thematic by week but span time periods and geographies. You will certainly come away with a broad base of understanding of a lot of different artistic movements and trends, though not necessarily a deep wealth of knowledge on any given subject.",
    "I gained the ability to analyze art more deeply for its political meaning and aims. I also developed my ability to write visual analysis and an Art History research paper.",
    "I developed my visual analysis skills, and overall, learned about the myriad of ways that all forms of art are constructed representations of events, thoughts, beliefs, etc. and thus, are inherently political.",
    "Appreciation for art Understanding of the complications behind a museum display",
    "We learned how to look really closely at art and use these skills of visual analysis to make coherent arguments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Bass is an engaging lecturer and the course material is highly stimulating. However, the pace of the lecturers and the speed at which the information is given is difficult to follow especially given we are supposed to handwrite lecture notes. The papers are also graded rather harshly for what is essentially an introductory survey class not necessarily targeted at art history majors - whether this is to give a sense of improvement through the semester I am not sure, but it is quite daunting",
    "The readings were wonderful, I loved the mix of primary sources and the variety throughout the reading. The breadth of topics followed was fantastic. I appreciated the span of different geographical regions and cultures that were included.",
    "There was a distinct thread about the birth of the modern museum that was kinda retroactively fitted into the narratives that we'd already learned. Would've been nice to introduce this theme earlier on",
    "There weren't many weaknesses to this course! The workload was super manageable, the information was very interesting, the assignments were spaced out evenly, and the TFs were very helpful and accessible. Perhaps one thing that can be improved was the timing of the midterm-- our first exam covered 7 weeks and our last exam covered 5 weeks of information.",
    "Strengths: Professor Bass makes this course work. It is her brainchild and she is clearly very passionate about this class. The material is fascinating and she presents it in a unique way. This is not an easy perspective, and I hence highly appreciate her efforts to challenge us to think creatively and critically. Weaknesses: This course aims to cover too much ground. Every lecture was either a different time period or different continent. While I appreciate the diversity of time and geography, I think it would be better to focus on a few places or times, such as Europe and Asia or exclusively modern art. Perhaps most interesting would be a focus on the meetings of empires and regions. This thematic selection would make the material easier to learn and would allow students to really gain a comprehensive understanding of a specific region or time. Moreover, I found the timing of the assignments to be too concentrated toward the end. The second paper, final exam, and final paper felt like one after the other. Perhaps eliminating one of the assignments or readjusting the dates would be helpful.",
    "The strengths are the lectures and the sections. Lecture is always engaging as we are moving from one art piece to the next. The sections are taught in the YUAG often and we get to engage with art that we learned about in class which is always really exciting. The weaknesses are the readings and the exams. The readings are often stretched to be relevant to the material in lecture, and the exams are total memory dumps.",
    "This course was great in theory but needs a lot of work. The material was very interesting but for an introductory level course that presupposes no background knowledge in art history there was very little support for students, either in section or outside, to develop skills to manage the workload. All the lectures should have been made available on canvas such that students could see all images that were discussed in lecture and not just the ones that would appear on the exam. Clearer presentation (whether in slides or in the lecture) of the themes and relevant points for each topic would have been helpful. By the end of the course, the material seemed a bit scattered, especially when we began discussing street art or just walls\/roads. It seemed like an attempt to cover too many kinds of art and might have been more helpful to hone in deeper on, for example, architecture of public buildings. The course assignments were also fairly poorly spaced out and constructed. The first visual analysis assignment was unclear in what it demanded in terms of structure and there was little support for this. It would be better to just have two papers and get rid of this first assignment altogether. The research paper was interesting but was assigned much too close to the second exam and final project - having these last two assignments so close together, which such little introduction to the final project until the very end of classes, was quite unfair. It might be better to have the two exams, the research paper nearer to midterm and then the final project more distanced from the second exam. For students with no previous art history knowledge, writing papers that were graded beside senior art history majors, these papers were very daunting and there was little guidance as to how to tackle these that was actively offered by the section leaders. Furthermore, there was very high variation between the teaching fellows, in terms of how much feedback they offered students, how much actual guidance they gave regarding the assignments, how available they made themselves and how they graded their students. The teaching fellows should be willing to read outlines or a rough draft, if a student hopes to learn as much as possible. This course became extremely stressful when it could have been so fun.",
    "Strengths: every lecture is engaging, all of the material connects, all of the sections are interactive Weaknesses: none",
    "Loved this course so much. Prof Bass gave amazing lectures and organized the course really well. No ideas on improvement",
    "Exams aren't too hard. they grade pretty hard on the papers but so do many HSAR classes. REally comprehensive course. Bass lectures SO well. I was so engaged!",
    "A strength of this course was definitely the subject matter in general -- every class was engaging and exciting. We didn't just talk about paintings in museums, we discussed natural landmarks, monuments, architecture, sculpture and simple everyday objects. Additionally, the visits to the YUAG, YCBA and Beinecke were incredibly interesting; it was great to see the objects that we learned about in class, in person. It is clear that everything we discussed and debated is still relevant and applicable to our world today. One weakness of this course was the fast pacing, but it would be difficult to change that without cutting out essential material that makes this course so memorable.",
    "It was organized into themes rather than chronologically which I found very helpful and allowed me to see how pieces connected to one another from different time periods\/areas.",
    "I thought overall the course was excellent. The lectures were engaging and the sections were typically held in an art museum which I enjoyed. The one weakness is that it didn't feel like it made sense to have 3 weeks to do a 7 page research paper and then less than 2 weeks (which were reading week and finals) to do our final 8-9 page paper.",
    "One of the strengths is that this class is extremely accessible. It was a great intro to thinking about art in a political lens and writing art history papers. This may be an intro course, but you are expected to produce interesting, compelling work. I never felt like I had busy work because the assignments were thoughtful and engaging, and the expectations were clear. For example, the final project was unique and creative (creating a focus exhibition, among other options), but not overly daunting. If you put in the work, this class is absolutely worthwhile. The subject material is fascinating, and I learned so much. It covers so much time and many different regions which I appreciated. One weakness is that this course covers very much. Of course, breadth is sacrificed for depth. For the most part, this was not a huge concern, but for example the Russian avant-garde movement felt very rushed. One way to improve the class would be to give the rubric for essays ahead of time, so I could have a better sense of the expectations. But honestly, this class is already excellent as it is.",
    "This call was well organised, super engaging and very fair testing. Great class!!!",
    "The course was honestly perfect.",
    "I think the lectures could be more structured to cover concrete vocabulary and definitions, since it technically is an intro course.",
    "A big strength of the class were the sections, which I found really engaging, where we analyzed works of art up close and could take a more participatory role to studying art as a supplement to the lecture. I also thought that the lectures were interesting, and Professor Bass took a captivating and thoughtful approach to discussing each piece. One weakness were the readings, which mostly did not help my understanding of the art we discussed, and often seemed superfluous and dull. The amount of readings could probably be cut down significantly and not affect the richness of the course.",
    "One of the major strengths of this course is that sees art history through a critical lens--not as an established narrative, but one that should be questioned. Professor Bass did a great job situating the class within current scholarship while also challenging us to look beyond it. I am also grateful that this class was taught as an intro class should: we actually learned what makes a good visual analysis paper, and how to conduct historical research on a piece. 10\/10 would take another course with Professor Bass.",
    "Professor Bass is a great lecturer and chose the objects in the course carefully to cover a large number of cultures",
    "This is an incredible course. Professor Bass is a very engaging lecturer, her lectures are fun to listen to, interesting, and you leave every class wanting to share what you've learned with a friend and learn more about the topic of the lecture. The sections are also really fun because you get to explore artworks in different Yale museums every week. The exams are relatively easy to study for and the TAs provide helpful guidance on how to do well not he papers.",
    "At times, the course can feel disjointed because of the way it jumps from country to country and theme\/idea to idea between each lecture. This can feel a little disorienting but keep in mind that it's a survey course and the exams and papers don't actually call for significant connection between each week of lectures beyond a cursory sentence in an exam answer. This course's strength is its breadth, its weaknesses are its depth and cohesiveness. However because this is meant to be an intro survey course, that's just part and parcel of the class and probably something you have to deal with. That being said this is still a fantastic course and it helps to untangle it by thinking about \"cross-cultural influences\/encounters in art\" rather than \"the politics of representation\".",
    "It was an all around good course",
    "The lectures were extremely strong and engaging and addressed contemporary issues and pieces of art in the Yale collection. I thought in the attempt in incorporating art from as many cultures and time periods as possible, spread the content a little thin and made the topics slightly surface level.",
    "I found the course incredibly engaging, but it sometimes seems unclear how the topics of each relate to each other within the framework of representation. Perhaps a consistent emphasis on the framework would serve to alleviate this confusion.",
    "The lectures were fantastic. They were engaging, easy to follow, and interesting. The assignments also corresponded nicely with lecture themes and course materials. There was nothing glaring that I would change.",
    "I think this was a great alternative to a \"traditional\" survey course - I loved how there were overarching political themes over the course of the semester, because it seriously deemphasized the part of art history courses that involves memorizing pieces. I think it was also great to cover art from so many different countries and regions, although there was probably still an (unavoidable?) emphasis on the western classical tradition. Section was always helpful and complemented lecture nicely. The expectations for assignments were really clear and the assignments themselves were fun. I think the class was a little overwhelming at first so some more guidance on how to process all the information would have been helpful but I think everyone adapted as the class went on anyways.",
    "Strengths Everything. This course was amazing and definitely was my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Weaknesses Honestly nothing substantial. I guess the one small thing I'd say is that I wish the slides were posted on Canvas, but this is the only remote criticism I have of this class.",
    "The content is absolutely a strength of this course, I think it's a brilliant method of teaching both cannon and diverse works and looking at the way they interact. No negatives at all!",
    "lectures were very good more structure\/advice on the writing assignments could be added",
    "I think the course is the perfect introduction course into HSAR",
    "This course covered a wide breadth of material, from 2000 BC to the 21st century. I learned about major themes, artists, and concepts that even I, as an advanced art history major, did not know about. This course proceeds very quickly so I would encourage students to do all the readings and come to every class to be prepared for the exams!",
    "the course covers and immense amount of material in a comparably short amount of time, in a way that doesnt seem to glaze over anything. however, it is a survey course, so for students looking to learn about one kind of art in detail, this course does not do that",
    "Everything about this course was great - except for the fact that there was a final project and an exam. I think either one would have sufficed, but maybe that is something about grading and having enough grades.",
    "Gave a brief overview but did not go into depth. Exam and assignments were explained well. Lots of prep. Harsh grading.",
    "I appreciated the way in which the course tests knowledge and retention - both through exams and papers submitted throughout the semester. Section was unfailingly engaging and allowed me to explore cervices of the university I likely wouldn't have otherwise. The readings were manageable and responsibly tested. Not much to improve upon!",
    "The lectures were thoroughly engaging. Professor Bass did an excellent job weaving together the themes of the course and drawing parallels between different movements and geographies. It was interesting to look at artists like Picasso through a new lens and consider how power and politics played into these works. I also enjoyed section a lot--getting to engage with works at the YUAG, YCBA, and Beinecke was really cool and my TA did a great job guiding conversation. I thought the paper prompts were interesting for the most part, though I didn't really like any of the options for the last paper. The first (about Yale) was boring because I don't want to think about Yale anymore, the second (Instagram) seemed sort of silly, and the third (curate an exhibit) seemed much more difficult than the other two.",
    "The lectures are extremely engaging. Almost every lecture I've taken, I feel super uncommitted but Professor Bass has a way of delivering the content that keeps you clued-in until the end of class. The topics are diverse and you get to see the pieces you talk about in class later in section which is incredible. It's not a super stressful class in terms of workload which is an added bonus.",
    "This course was amazing, Professor Bass' lectures are so interesting and engaging. The only downside is, I didn't find memorizing identifying information about art pieces for exams particularly useful. I understand that this may be an unavoidable fact of art history courses, but this memorization is very time-consuming and is forgotten days after the exam.",
    "Strengths: great professor (though talks a bit fast tbh), wonderful survey syllabus that covers a lot but is not overly ambitious, AMAZING TAs -- i.e. if you can get into Sophia's section, you will not regret it. She was so kind and generous and never made me feel like my ideas were unwelcome as someone who has never taken an art history course before. Also really appreciated being in the YUAG\/YCBA for most of the class; such a wonderful change of pace and made me really appreciate section. Instead of rehashing lectures, we were applying concepts to art and being mini-art-historians ourselves. It was a lot of fun. Weaknesses: so. many. assignments. My goodness. Idk if this is how all art history courses are, but there were three laborious papers (especially if you've never taken an art history course before) plus a midterm and final. I really enjoyed writing the papers, but wish that I had more time to devote to them to really dig into a piece\/era of art. My future recommendation is to scrap the final exam and just add more papers. Or stop exams altogether and just have more writing assignments. I was WAY more engaged when I wrote about and researched the pieces\/art movements than when I was trying to memorize 100+ images & information.",
    "The syllabus itself was extremely well-constructed, I never would have imagined that such diverse art objects could speak to each other across times and places. The many mediums and forms of art that we covered was also impressive. I also truly appreciated the weekly posts on the Canvas discussion page, as they really helped me focus in on the main themes for each lecture. Finally, I especially enjoyed the way in which each weeks two lectures were paired under the same theme, and yet were from distant regions or time periods. This truly emphasized the continuity of the weeks theme.",
    "strengths: amazing lecture, great TAs, got to look at really cool stuff in section, interesting readings, not too much work weaknesses: lecture moved very fast",
    "Great professor, engaging lectures, really interesting topics, no real weaknesses"

    "I definitely recommend this to anyone, even if you are not an art history major. This is a great course that everyone should take no matter their background. It makes you look at the world differently.",
    "I'm literally considering dropping everything and becoming an Art History major. It's also the first year that this course has been taught and it's so well run that you can't even tell.",
    "Yes! Professor Bass is an amazing lecturer and super engaging! She is so knowledgeable about so many different topics, and it really made for a super interesting class.",
    "Yes! This course is fascinating and has an average workload. This is a great credit to take to learn something new and outside ones typical area. As a senior in this course, I developed so many new insights and thoroughly enjoyed writing the papers and studying for exams. Please use your credits outside your major to take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course to everyone. I think everyone should take at least one Art History class to be able to appreciate more of the beauty in the world around them.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student if you are considering Art History as a major!",
    "In its current form, I would not recommend this course to another student. The lectures need to be streamlined and the course assignments reassessed. See answer to 3.",
    "Absolutely. This was my favorite course of the semester, and the material is very accessible. I think this course gives you the option to look at the material from the art perspective and\/or the history perspective which is what makes it so accessible to all people\/majors. This course taught me a lot about art, but also about world history, and other cultures. I love that this course wasn't completely \"Westernized\" and also that it was a true \"intro\" course because it gave an overview of a wide range of artists and artistic styles. This class is great for someone considering art history as a major and doesn't know where to start or someone looking for an engaging way to fulfill a humanities requirement.",
    "Yes! Amazing professor, great art hist survey course. Would recommend regardless of your major. Probably one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. I had never taken an art hist class before and thought it was super engaging and interesting.",
    "this class is awesome, a great introduction, and professor bass and the TAs are great",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for its content but also its instructoryou have to take it with Bass.",
    "Really recommend as an Intro Art History class. Bass is great, material is cool, focus is interesting, you have more flexibility with the papers.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! It changed not only the way I look at art, but the way I see the world in general.",
    "Yes, it is an amazing class. Professor Bass is amazing, you get to see the COOLEST stuff at the museums (not just the art on display but the things they pull from the print rooms is so cool).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you're looking for an intro art history course that doesn't focus on the classic canon. Show up to lecture - it's totally worth it.",
    "I loved this course! Definitely one of the best during my four years here. The subject material is extremely interesting and Professor Bass is so enthusiastic about teaching. This course is absolutely accessible to any major and recognizes improvement. I felt like I learned every lecture, and there was never a dry class. It forced me to think in different ways. That being said, this class is not a gut. There is work, but if you invest time and start early, you will do well. The exams are very straightforward and Professor Bass tells you what to study. The work was not too difficult, and honestly, an assignment where I get to sit in the YUAG for a couple hours was one of the best assignments I've ever gotten at Yale. The expectations were made clear and I actually enjoyed doing the assignments. This is not a class where you can skip lectures and still ace the class. Lecture is an integral component of the course, way more so than the readings.",
    "Yes!!! The class looked at the cross over between art and politics. Professor Bass is amazing. I really enjoyed going to class each week.",
    "Absolutely. Just take this course if you can, Prof. Bass and the teaching assistants are fantastic and the lens through which the class analyzes the traditional art history course content is super interesting.",
    "I would, I do think that even if I didnt gain a lot of information about art history, I acquired a better-rounded mindset with which to approach art.",
    "Yes, especially for someone who has never taken an art history class before! It's a very interesting look at art that has a very broad historical span but balances that by focusing really specifically on different works of art. It's not too hard and a very manageable workload.",
    "YES! This class is at once intellectually stimulating; you feel like you've improved after taking it; and it's just FUN!",
    "Yes, a fresh perspective on the often stale intro survey!",
    "A really amazing class, highly recommend! The lectures are always fascinating and engaging and the sections are really fun as well. You will learn a lot, not just from a narrow Western-focused or single-era only POV, but rather will learn about art from different places, by different artists and across time, and discover the fascinating thematic connections between them through the politics of recommendations. Highly recommend!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in trying an art history course who is scared of a Euro-heavy, stuffy, imperialistic focused art history class. This class looks at a wide variety of art objects while incorporating primary source documentation into the readings. It also doesn't have a required textbook, which is a fantastic choice by Professor Bass both for financial constraints as well as encouraging the use of up-to-date sources, contemporary readings, and varied narratives.",
    "Absolutely, because I learned so much in just one semester about history and the way we need to view. Students develop a very critical point of view that is essential.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone seeing if they want to major in art history.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student who doesnt already have a strong background in art history, and who would also like to engage with art politically, meaningfully, and in a greater global context.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, and not just to another art history major. It was a great survey course that was unique in its approach to global art. It encouraged me to think critically about traditional understandings of art and architecture. Of course, it is difficult to cover the whole world's art in just a semester, and it often felt like we were only given very cursory introductions to a whole region's history. But Professor Bass readily acknowledged shortcomings and encouraged students to take away from the lecture overarching, important themes.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Bass is an incredible lecturer and the topics are engaging - I felt like I was getting a second look at history, notably at imperialism and colonialism, but through the lens of art, which was new and enlightening.",
    "Yes, 100%! if you're looking to get into art history, this course is great as it not only covers a large time frame but a wide geographical scope, making it a great survey course not just focused on the most popular pieces in the canon!",
    "Yes! Please take this class! Even if you've never taken an art history class before, you should still take this class! It was so engaging and so incredible and I can't say enough positive things about it! Wow!",
    "Absolutely! I recommend this course to everyone I know; I think every Yalie needs to learn how to look at our spaces and think about what's truly being represented the way Professor Bass demonstrates.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes, 100%. It really helped me see more than one side of HSAR as a discipline and understand the way HSAR courses function. I think on top of being a great intro course, it would also be a great class for students interested in taking a single art history course at Yale.",
    "Yes!! I would highly recommend this course to another student, whether they have never taken an art history course before or are an art history major! I learned so much and it was so much fun!",
    "absolutely, especially for students looking to take an introductory course\/students looking to try something new. the lectures are really interesting, the work is manageable, and it teaches you foundational skills that are applicable to both further work in art history courses and the act of looking at art itself.",
    "Yes I would. I know that this class was not only enlightening, but it was also interesting, and open to engagement and discussion. For example, the professor always made sure to explain any background knowledge if it was needed, and also took student suggestions seriously regarding the discussion of social issues, making sure to address any concerns and implement them immediately.",
    "Yes.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Professor Bass is amazing and the course welcomes students with all levels of experience in the discipline.",
    "Yes! If you're looking for an intro-level art history course that approaches works and artists through a political lens, this is a fantastic course. You should know that you won't get a particularly deep understanding of any one subject because of the nature of a survey course, but I appreciated the breadth of the course because that's primarily what I wanted to get out of it. You do need to go to lecture (which I liked because the lectures were always very engaging) because Prof. Bass does not post any notes online.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! It's one of those courses that you'll find yourself thinking about outside of the classroom. The class is not super hard, but not so easy that it's boring. If you have the chance to take this class, do it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, both to people with a strong background in Art History and to people who are looking for a good introduction to the subject that's more focused than the survey course. This class is very easy to take with no previous experience in art history.",
    "The Politics of Representation provides a gateway for students with no background in art history to get a feel for how to interpret art and think about the construction of a space, historical trends and influence on art, and how art constitutes a wide range of categories. As a non-art history major and senior, I absolutely recommend this course. Professor Bass is a fantastic lecturer, and although she speaks a little bit fast, each lecture was full of important and thought-provoking information. I honestly recommend any course that Professor Bass is teaching; this is one of the best introductory courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "YES! Take the course. It's really exciting stuff and pretty easy to follow if you've never taken an art history course before like me. Professor Bass, as the art history DUS is obviously an expert in her field and she's a very engaging lecturer, if not a little fast. Strengths: great professor, wonderful survey syllabus that covers a lot but is not overly ambitious, AMAZING TAs -- i.e. if you can get into Sophia's section, you will not regret it. She was so kind and generous and never made me feel like my ideas were unwelcome as someone who has never taken an art history course before. Also really appreciated being in the YUAG\/YCBA for most of the class; such a wonderful change of pace and made me really appreciate section. Instead of rehashing lectures, we were applying concepts to art and being mini-art-historians ourselves. It was a lot of fun. Weaknesses: so. many. assignments. My goodness. Idk if this is how all art history courses are, but there were three laborious papers (especially if you've never taken an art history course before) plus a midterm and final. I really enjoyed writing the papers, but wish that I had more time to devote to them to really dig into a piece\/era of art. My future recommendation is to scrap the final exam and just add more papers. Or stop exams altogether and just have more writing assignments. I was WAY more engaged when I wrote about and researched the pieces\/art movements than when I was trying to memorize 100+ images & information. Also, the exams included a lot of the readings, but we barely talked about the readings in section or lecture.",
    "Im writing this as a senior and I can honestly say that this is one of the most informative and enjoyable courses that I have taken. Not only do you get to learn about artworks from a variety of time periods and regions, but you also get to learn about them from Professor Bass. She makes the entire class worthwhile and makes you passionate about History of Art. Her lectures are the best that Ive heard, and I found myself so excited to hear each one. Please do yourself the favor and take this class, or any class with Professor Bass!!",
    "Yes for sure - one of the best classes i've taken at Yale! No prior art history knowledge needed but professor Bass is amazing, lectures were so engaging, and I really love art and museums now.",
    "This course was a wonderful introduction to art history."
