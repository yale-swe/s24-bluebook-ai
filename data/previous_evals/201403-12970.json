   "comments": [
    "Observation and Analysis is a technical art history class that deals with the physical making and connoisseurship of works of art. For a non art\/history of art major, it was a wonderful hands-on introduction to the techniques and materials that are essential for understanding how works of art are made. It was at times, difficult for me to follow along with lectures, but I found amount of readings assigned was sufficient, for those like me who needed more background could turn to the readings to fill in knowledge gaps. The work load is completely doable--Professor Fairbanks-Harris is more concerned that students enjoy the experience and internalize the knowledge, rather than regurgitate sentence after sentence about imaging techniques and mineral compounds in paint samples. Wonderful class, please take if you can get in.",
    "I'd take this class again in a heartbeat! One of the hidden gems of Yale.",
    "Take it if you get in! Prof. Fairbanks-Harris is very knowledgable, passionate, and generous. You'll learn about different conservation techniques and get your hands dirty!",
    "THIS CLASS IS ONE OF YALE'S HIDDEN TREASURES. I suspect that its name, \"Observation and Analysis\", leads to it being overlooked because people mistakenly assume it's boring. THAT IS NOT TRUE. TAKE IT IF YOU CAN. Take it if you're an art history major. Take it if you're an econ major. Just take it. Every class felt like a mini field trip. I learned so much and thoroughly enjoyed it the whole way through. Lots of guest lecturers, lots of hands-on looking at \/ playing with stuff. Just super super super cool. Theresa also had the habit of giving us little presents\/goodies every week.",
    "Great course - you learn about a variety of artist materials, means of technical examination, and conservation issues in a fun setting! It is very hands on and varies from class to class. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who has an interest in art.",
    "Yes most definitely!",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to both History of Art majors and those who are not in the major. It's a great way to learn about the techniques and processes of conservation and preservation.",
    "Very fun, laid-back class. Theresa is great and showed us a lot of old objects from Yale's art and rare book collections that I otherwise would have never gotten a chance to see. Highlight was a class led by the guy in charge of conserving and installing Sol LeWitt's wall drawings."
