    "This si a great course with the potential to be thought provoking if you choose to engage with the material. I would recommend the class to students who are willing to think and move outside of their usual pattern. Use the open space that is this course as a means to explore why you do what you do and what your body means to you.",
    "the best",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! You will not regret it! The most thought provoking and fun class I have taken at Yale thus far (aka in 3 years)!",
    "I would say the class itself is great but it is greatly effected by where they students are themselves and how much effort they put in, on a day when some students were dragging behind the whole class was effected. I would definitely recommend taking it but would reiterate that you've got to give it your all (which I consider to be a strength of the class)"
