    "Yes! Great lab. It requires work to prepare for the weekly quizzes, but it is not difficult at all. If you keep up with the material and read the lab manual, you will do fine. The lab reports (there are two) are pretty intense but doable. I very much enjoyed this class. Also, get to know your TA. That was helpful.",
    "I've gone through quite a few labs (gen chem, orgo, upper level bio) and I hated this lab - I thought it was very disorganized, sometimes the experiments didn't work and it was incredibly stressful to figure out what to do after. The weekly quizzes were hard and required a lot of studying although this seemed to be based on which section you were in. Pawashe and Konigsberg were well meaning, and in hindsight the experiments were very interesting, the execution was horrible. Their lectures were snooze worthy and for the most incomprehensible. Pawashe under stressful conditions was very aggressive and gave very convoluted directions. Konigsberg was mostly absent. If you don't like weekly worth there was only two lab reports but they take a long time. I mistakenly thought i had to take this class bc I only took one semester of gen chem as pre-med, but apparently you don't have to.",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to. The amount that I got out of the class was not worth the time you had to put in. The lab reports take FOREVER, but aren't actually that valuable - mostly busywork. The weekly quizzes weren't easy, but that might depend on the TA that writes them. The lab lectures were horribly boring and extraneous. It wasn't a very difficult class, just time consuming and frankly, not worth it.",
    "You're not taking this course for fun, you're taking it because it's a prereq. It's tricky, but pretty fair. When you're writing the reports, don't try and be original, just trace the samples pretty exactly, ride the edge of plagiarism, and you'll do alright. Make sure you start the lab reports early, or you'll get screwed towards the due date.",
    "It's a very interesting lab, but it is also very difficult.",
    "If you need the lab, take it. Overall pretty decent",
    "A better lab is out there. And it's not a premed or bio requirement. Aruna is crazy and shouts at everyone. The class actually starts at 1:15 and is an incredible waste of time. The lab reports are incredibly long and not much guidance is given. During class there are long inclinations during which there are even longer lab lectures. The quizzes ask questions that don't actually test to see if you've read the manual. Overall this wads disappointing class, as the experiments seemed interesting on principle.",
    "An ok course. There is one almost semester-long research project followed by a shorter one, which was a nice change from classes with weekly short labs. Class itself was not all that pleasant with the professors of the course, and often ran long with lectures. Not too too much work overall - weekly quizzes, 2 lab reports, and a problem set.",
    "It's better than most lab courses. The main nuisance is that the instructors cannot explain concepts whatsoever. Rather than having a little bit of work every week, there are two large lab reports that are due near the end of the semester, along with a problem set, all of which take an exorbitant amount of time. Labs usually get out a little early, but not always.",
    "It's hard if you've never worked in a protein\/biochem lab beforeZ, but if you have it should be fine. It's VERY useful to learn all of the techniques presented anyways. The lab reports are long and count for a ton of your grade but there's only 2 so they're very doable.",
    "Take this only if you NEED to (either for MCDB labs, or for MB&B if you can't waive it); a LOT of work for the 0.5 credit. Not the best lab, but certainly not the worst.If you do end up taking it, START THE LAB REPORT EARLY. I goofed off for most of the semester and then basically didn't sleep for a week while doing the first report (you really can't do it the night\/3 days before). Also, the pre-lab quizzes are KILLERS :("
