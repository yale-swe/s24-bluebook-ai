    "If you get in, just do it. If you're choosing between multiple 400-level English seminars, you might be justified in doing, say, Journalism (if you want to be a journalist) or Poetry (if you want to be a poet), but if you're not yet sure what sorts of things you'd like to write, THIS IS YOUR CLASS. DO IT.",
    "Yes. If you get in, take it, over anything else, no matter what.",
    "YES. YES YES YES. Believe the hype. If you can get into this class, come to it with an open mind, respect for your colleagues, ready to work hard and pour yourself into your writing, and you will be changed. Anne is amazing. During our first one-on-one edits, I felt uncomfortable with the things we changed -- if you ever feel that way, let her know. She will never force you to change things you don't want. She's so kind and open and helpful; she'll make your writing better if you let her. Every batch of students is different; my class this year was incredibly supportive. I'm so grateful to have been given this opportunity. If you have the chance, don't pass it up. Sometimes there is a ton of reading, but we read many things that I absolutely loved and want to read more of. Reading good writing really made my own writing improve. Just... just take this class. It's a lot of work but so worth it.",
    "An amazing class. My writing improved over the course of the semester in big and small ways--even the task of writing every week (alternating between 1000-word essays and similar-length critiques of peers' essays) would have gone a long way in making me a better writer. On top of that, there was the one-on-one editing conferences with Anne, the in-class workshop, the assigned revision of an earlier work, and the mandated planning process for your final piece. The readings, too, were thoughtfully selected, and the discussions of them contained useful takeaways for my own writing. This was the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Writing about Oneself is not so much a class as it is a project: a collaborative attempt to plumb what it means to communicate---and thus to *know*---ourselves as human beings. That's a rhetorical undertaking, sure, but it's first and foremost an ethical one. The two groups into which Anne divides the class (by name, not by disposition) signal the rocks on which this endeavor must not run aground: narcissism and solipsism. The stakes are high---as they should be.One caveat. Writing about Oneself is not a seminar; it is rather the most intimate and interactive of lectures. But don't think for a second that there's anyplace to hide. In addition to three hours of class time every week, you get an hour one-on-one with Anne every other week. Over the course of the semester those six hours by themselves are more worth the price of admission."
