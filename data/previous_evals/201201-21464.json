    "This is a year-long independent senior project in American Studies. This can't be taken lightly. Sure, you can get credit in the first semester with a short annotated bibliography and a few half-assedly researched pages but then the second semester will be hell--trying to make yourself work when you are a second semester senior on a project that doesn't meet for class but requires self-motivation to research and write independently can be a real struggle. Take this is you have an amazing special project you want to attempt (a play, a musical, a photography exhibit, sculpture, video, etc.), because american studies is the greatest platform to do so and if you're in this course, getting yale funding is a snap. DO NOT take this course unless you have a topic that interests you to the nth degree--you will get tired of working on this, and something has to keep you going. If you're one of those who just wants to get things out of the way, don't bother. This class is amazingly rewarding for those who can muster the drive and ambition for it.",
    "An opportunity to investigate whatever your research interest may be.",
    "I think its great to do the year long essay! It really lets you go above and beyond what one has learned and created in other courses.",
    "This is just the place holder for the year long senior essay. We did not meet as a full class this semester, instead we met with Tisha one-on-one to discuss our progress.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "Great class, you learn a lot. If you do a special project though, prepare to be on your own for a lot of it because the class does not provide a lot of structure.",
    "Doesn't meet often but just a way to have some checkpoints to keep you making progress."
