    "The strength of this class is that it really enables us to pick up our language skills. The downside is that it is a lot of work, which I guess is just necessary in order to improve language skills.",
    "It was great. I didn't take Spanish 110 but I imagine it is similar. A lot of homework but it is necessary and good practice. I recommend taking it because although there is a heavy workload the class isn't that hard.",
    "It was at 9:25, but I looked forward to it everyday",
    "Take the class. Spanish is the way to go! It is at a very comfortable pace- not too fast and not too slow.",
    "Not easy like many people believe it is. Choose your professor wisely. Some are very easy, some are very hard. It's extremely hit or miss."
