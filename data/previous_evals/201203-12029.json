   "comments": [
    "If you can take a class with Harold Bloom, take it.",
    "Take this class if you can get it, it is certainly the most comprehensive Shakespeare class available and will definitely be relevant for other courses in the future. I can't praise it enough. A caveat: this course is discussion-based so might not be best for students who are nervous speaking up.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "An introduction to the complexities of Shakespeare with one of the most brilliant literary minds of our time. Because Bloom has spent so much time with the texts, discussion often goes beyond a simple close reading into more difficult questions like \"What happens before the play begins that motivates the characters' actions?\" or \"Why did Shakespeare stop writing?\" Fascinating to grapple with, but usually unanswerable.",
    "This is an excellent course for more advanced readers of Shakespeare. It requires self-motivation: in order for 5 weeks on Hamlet to deepen your understanding of the play, you actually needs to reread it, or significant portions of it, each week. If you have a good deal of experience reading Shakespeare and would like to be taken further in your understanding of him, this is an excellent course for you.",
    "If you can get into this course, and if you care about the material, it will be one of the most amazing experiences during your time at Yale. Professor Bloom has lived with and thought about these characters so long that they are old friends to him, and he talks about them as if they were people he knows intimately - which, in a sense, he does. His anecdotes (\"children, I cannot get my email to work, which is very annoying because if I don't send an email this afternoon, Gore Vidal will have no eulogy at his funeral tomorrow\") are almost as incredible. You also get to drop in to his house for office hours and tea whenever you so choose. But Prof. Bloom can tell if you do really care about the material, and that's ultimately what the course is about, so only take it if you're prepared to put the time in and to make the most of it - otherwise don't take the spot away from someone else who will."
