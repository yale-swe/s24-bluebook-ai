   "comments": [
    "It's very introductory and seems to ask for a lot of memorization, but doesn't really test you on most of it. Mostly focuses on understanding pathways and mechanisms but does require the ability to provide specific examples.",
    "A typical Yale course based significantly on rote learning.Unfortunately the Merck Module mentioned isn't a significant part of the course and only covers very basic publicly available information.If you have a good memory and spend enough time memorizing, you will probably do very well.",
    "I would say that Pharmacology 504 has a lot of potential to be a really great class. Some of the professors are excellent while others are lacking. Also, if the professors were a little more organized and communicated a little more, all of the issues that I had with the course would be resolved.",
    "I would recommend this course because it does cover all of the basics of pharmacology, but it covers a lot of extra nonsense that is pretty irrelevant too...",
    "A lot of memorization. Because of that I would not recommend it. I would recommend auditing it because the material is interesting.",
    "Yes, provided that they're very interested in the field. This course is excellent at what it aims to do--teach people who are interested in pharmacology all about it. If somebody wasn't completely interested in the field then I feel as though they might have a hard time piecing everything together, as a lot of the information is just assumed to be known by the student already (e.g., the first few lectures covered \"ED50\" and \"Kd\" and other terms that were never even defined!). I would argue that this course is not for beginners.",
    "I would not recommend it unless its required. Can't really summarize it because I'm not really sure what we learned.",
    "I would say that it's a very important class to take if you're going to join the pharmacology department because you learn a lot of really important information, but that there is a lot of memorization involved.",
    "Principles of Pharm feels like a biweekly lecture series on somewhat related topics. For this reason, the exams (memorize and mind dump) seems inappropriate. Considering this, I would have trouble recommending this class to other students. I think that revision to the examination process (as discussed above) could really help make this class great."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Since I'm not a pharmacy graduate student, besides learning about some random medicines, it does not contribute to my dissertation\/research. Course material was either extremely basic if I had studied the area of interest before or extremely alien if I had no prior knowledge of the subject.",
    "I learned a lot about chemotherapy drugs and too much about NSAIDs. I enjoyed the portion on combinatorial chemistry and library design, and the information I learned in those lectures I have already been able to apply to other courses.",
    "Will likely be helpful if I do join Pharm.",
    "It made me aware of other cellular process that occur in the body that needs to be kept in mind when doing basic research as well as drug discovery.",
    "It taught me a lot that I use every day in lab and I feel much more prepared to study pharmacology now that I've taken this class.",
    "The class was broad enough that something that we covered will definitely have relevance to my research. I liked the breadth of the class, being introduced to all corners of pharmacology. I think that this breadth (combined with the personalized depth of each faculty member) is one of the strengths of this class."
