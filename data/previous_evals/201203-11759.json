   "comments": [
    "Great class! Take it!",
    "Take it. You learn so much about early music and the performance of it. The writing assignments were manageable, and I always looked forward to going to the next class!",
    "Yes. It's a really fun class and the performance of the music is really rewarding. Low stress but truly a lot of fun and actually a neat chance to be exposed to this early music,",
    "Definitely a class worth taking. I took it as a 5.5th credit and it was not a struggle. Minimal workload if you are a competent musician\/singer. Even a very good singer will appreciate a noticeable improvement in sight-singing ability after the class because of the constant influx of new pieces to learn. The concert is held in the Beinecke, which is an amazing space, and it has a great reception afterwards. The Collegium and the viol consort are great fun, especially if you've never done early music before. Best part: you can take the class again for credit. Itis impossible not to do well in this class if you take it seriously (but still have fun and enjoy the relaxed sessions).",
    "Basically, you get to sing awesome early music. It's a great class, and I would recommend it.",
    "As the core of the Collegium Musicum, The Performance of Early Music is a joyous introduction to Yale's early-music department. I say the department, rather than just the music itself, because you'll have an easier time if you're at least passingly familiar with the early-music world and its eclectic mix of sacred and folk styles, although interest and enthusiasm are sufficient. The class itself focuses on choral and vocal performance, but you'll encounter other instruments according to historical performance practice: recorders, tabors, and the Yale Temperament Consort of Viols, oh my! It's a lot of fun.",
    "This class is basically a two hour rehearsal per week (plus another hour) where you sing awesome old music with a great professor. Seriously, just take it. It is zero work, you get practice sight singing, you learn a lot of beautiful music from a time and place far away, and its loads of fun."
