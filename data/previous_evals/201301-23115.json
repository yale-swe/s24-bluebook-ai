    "It's basically a class on the foreign body response to implanted biomaterials. You learn a lot about methods being used to try to reduce inflammation around biomaterials. Your grade is based on 2 tests, the midterm and the final (50-50). Good thing is that both are open note. Take it.",
    "The class is interesting but beware, it really isn't easy to wake up for a 9am class.",
    "Yeah, it's minimal work (0 work), but you have to go to all the lectures and take really good notes. Write down EVERYTHING (pay attention to the slides). Not sure how hard the grading will be, but the midterm and final are open note.",
    "Take this class! Super interesting - basically all about the foreign body response. Only work is a midterm and a final. One of my favorite BME classes so far.",
    "A course that summarizes Professor Kyriakides's research with biomaterials. Covers all of the different aspects of the foreign body response. Very interesting for those interested in materials development and implants, but 9 am classes make it difficult to pay consistent attention.",
    "Very good class. Really interesting material. Exams are very fair and the class as a whole isn't much work.",
    "This is the course where you learn about the things that people don't tell you when they're developing new technology to put into people's bodies, and these things are actually extremely basic and fundamental to all things involving implanted devices or materials. This information is extremely useful.",
    "Overall a strong course covering a very specific topic matter - I really think it could benefit from a more extensive look at applications of biomaterials and how they fit into future treatment (which we touched on a little bit in the end with glucose sensors and brain electrodes) but if you're looking into doingresearch in the field of implants and biomaterials, this course is a must",
    "This is a great course overall. The lecturer is clear, the main points emphasized and the content interesting. It is a benefit that much of the material is based off of TK's research, so he knows everything well. The format of the class is just 2 midterms, so it is a relaxed learning environment.",
    "Great class! Really interesting combination of engineering and biology, not too much work outside of class, great professor and teaching style. Just make sure you go to class and ask questions.",
    "I love this class! It was so much fun, it made me excited to wake up in the morning! Dr. Kyriakides is a great professor - well organized, a great lecturer, and clearly wants students to get a lot out of the class. It had a light amount of reading and open notes tests.",
    "435 is a 30 person lecture where you learn about the foreign body response and different biomaterial implants that are currently in development. The class is pretty interesting, but sometimes hard to stay awake in because it's at 9am. Kyriakides is great and keeps the class light, hands out candy for asking questions, etc. Midterm and final exams are open-note\/computer just no internet, so you have to show up to class and take great notes.Definitely take - chill BME elective + interesting subject. Just sucks that it's at 9am.",
    "I enjoyed the class but I would suggest that this isn't a class where you can skip lectures. Most of the information you need to know will be in the lectures and thus one needs to be there to understand what is being taught. It takes a bit to get used to the teaching style but I think that it helps develop useful skills that will come in handy later if one intends on entering research.",
    "Fantastic course! While only one midterm and one final become very stressful, the lectures are very engaging and the subject is really fascinating. Prof. Kyriakides loves to see through the BS on the research abstracts in the field but also does a great job highlighting the progress and clinical relevance of biomaterials.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Prof. Kyriakides is extremely knowledgeable in this field, and he presents the material in an engaging and effective way. There is no homework, so your grade is entirely based on the midterm and the final. But, they are open note exams, so they are not that bad. This class was fascinating \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of my favorite BME courses.",
    "It's an ok course that could have been a bit better."
