   "comments": [
    "A sort of pointless but fun romp through poetic form. Stern is a riot, and the workload is minimal (although the grading is by no means easy).",
    "A gut hidden behind a waterfall of poetry",
    "yes, if you are interested in the topic, it is good class.",
    "Do not take it. This is probably one of the most boring classes I've taken at Yale University. Stern is extremely BORING, he talks for the whole time and his voice is monotonous. Very hard to stay awake. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your precious Yale credits on this class.",
    "Lit 334 is a good class for those both with and without experience studying poetry. As someone without much knowledge of poetry, I found it accessible and enjoyable. The class had a good reading list. The workload is pretty light with only two papers. Because of this, though, it is sometimes hard for everyone to feel motivated to keep up with the reading and come to class fully prepared. Professor Stern is really entertaining and has great insights about the poems we discuss",
    "The readings and Professor Stern's lectures\/discussions on them really gave me the appreciation for poetry that I was hoping to get out of this class. That said, the class was simply too big. It should be capped at around 12 or so.",
    "I recommend the course strongly to anyone not too attached to structure and predictability. The content of Problems of Lyric bears almost no relation to its title. Prof. Stern does offer an in-depth introduction to formalist poetry analysis (meter, rhyme, and so on) which is useful and fascinating for anyone interested in poetry from almost any perspective. Most of the terms will be somewhat familiar to English and Lit majors, but studying them intentionally in one course adds a great deal. More importantly, though, he offers twice-weekly opportunities to listen to him free-associate with a selection of poems as prompts -- an opportunity of which I strongly recommend taking advantage. (I took more notes on his anecdotes than on the poems.) Don't expect to talk much in class, or to know what's going on most of the time; expect to enjoy listening and to enjoy the ride.NB: I had a good experience in the class with no knowledge of German, but many of the poems are German with English translations provided.",
    "If you like the idea of spending an hour analyzing a single poem, this is probably among the best places to do it.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anybody interested in poetry or wondering why others find poetry so interesting. Stern obviously loves language and does a good job at giving students a sense of what makes great poems great. Although taught in a seminar setting, Stern lectures most of the time. But, in my opinion, that's what you're paying 50K a year for when you go to Yale. The man's studied this stuff for the greater portion of his life and has a lot to say; not that I always agree with him. He does give students the chance to talk about the poems, and what discussions we had in the class were generally fruitful.If you have room for it in your schedule, I'd take this course, regardless of your major.",
    "This course is great. It is one of the few courses at Yale that really teaches one how to read a poem.",
    "The course is interesting, but Professor Stern has a very particular way of approaching poems. If you are not on his wavelength, it can be frustrating.",
    "Good, even for non-lit people. Not too much work.",
    "This was a great class. Really changed the way I view literature. I learned a lot, with minimal work. Every day is just a conversation about a few poems, and your classmates and professor always manage to say really interesting, eye-opening things. You look at poetry from an elemental approach, talking about different pieces and techniques (not in the sense of named literary devices, but actually elements of the poem that produce an effect on the reader). Only two papers. A very great deal.",
    "It's a pretty good class about poetry with only two papers on essentially any poem you want. The professor has some great, interesting insights, too. It focuses more on the technical aspects of poetry, which may be good for science majors (like me) looking for a humanities credit since you at least won't feel completely and utterly out of place if you haven't done poetry in a while.",
    "The poems we read were for the most part delightful. Professor Stern is also for the most part delightful. If he talks for too long, which he does often, there is an almost equal chance that he will say something very deep about life or bore you to death. The workload is very manageable, and Stern is a very real and reasonable person who cares about you if you care about what you're doing."
