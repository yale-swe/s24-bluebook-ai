   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "Not very well in the sense that I did not feel like I took away much from this class, even though I tried to stay engaged to the best of my ability. I think the biggest misalignment between this class and my expectations for it was the opportunity to apply skills learned in class with some guidance. The course syllabus canvas page says: \"During the semester, we'll ask you to regularly apply methods we discuss to your data as appropriate. Once or twice you'll be asked to present spatial statistical results on your dataset in class. We'll have 'loaner' datasets you can use if a particular topic isn't appropriate for your data.\" *This did not happen.* Homeworks were very simple exercises that used a toy dataset provided, with very specific right\/wrong answers. A few students talked about their data of interest or research questions, but not about any spatial statistics techniques they had used, so there wasn't an opportunity to learn from other students' real-world examples.",
    "They pretty much aligned with my expectations, but my knowledge is not as in-depth and theoretical as I expected.",
    "It was pretty well aligned. I thought we might do more worked examples or take more about specific types of data sets and how to look at them but it was just an intro class.",
    "The course emphasized theory a little more than I expected for an applied stats class. However, this changed a bit halfway through the semester due to feedback from students. By the end of the course, I felt confident using all of the techniques that we learned, except kriging, which I still find difficult to implement and interpret.",
    "They aligned well with my expectations"

  {
   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest weakness of this class is that the professor seemed to spend about as much time teaching the material as he spent telling the class he either was not terribly familiar with the material, did not think it was particularly useful, was not sure why the examples made specific decisions in their analysis, what the implications were for making small but important analysis decisions, or was not sure when one would apply this technique. The result was an entire semester of material presented as not useful, or at least no clear guidance regarding when a given technique could be useful or mastery of the seemingly small but important decisions one would have to make when conducting the analysis in real life.",
    "More homework or problem sets would be helpful to practice the techniques, and something other than programming homework might help to understand the material more conceptually. I kind of feel like the main thing I learned from this class was how to program this stuff in R, and I don't know a whole lot about the material itself. I know this is an applied class and FES likes to keep things that way, but a little more thorough investigation of the theory behind the concepts would help me understand better.",
    "More examples! More overview lectures and then separated lectures on different topics.",
    "I really think this course need to actively incorporate ArcGIS.",
    "Tim's lecture notes are very thorough and a great resource; I imagine I will continue to use them as a reference outside of class. The lectures themselves can be difficult to follow because the material is very complicated and dense. Going through examples in R was helpful, however I think this part of the course could be improved with more emphasis on reinforcing concepts from lectures and less emphasis on coding. For the most part, R has sufficient reference material for the functions we used. The notes in Tim's example scripts also help with coding. I liked all of the assignments and would have appreciated a few more since they didn't cover all the techniques.",
    "Strengths are the clarity of instruction and the patience of the professor and TA. Breadth of the material covered was outstanding. Understanding the concepts could probably be reinforced by doing some computations by hand, for example, calculating the covariance matrix for a small dataset."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you're looking for a light workload to balance out other heavier classes and don't mind a bit of boredom. Or take this class if spatial statistics specifically could really help your academic\/career goals, but be prepared to do most of the learning on your own outside of class, and try to use the class just to identify techniques that could be applicable to your needs. Otherwise, as a general interest course or a course that is only tangential to your academic\/career goals, I would not recommend taking this class.",
    "Be familiar with r before the course.",
    "Come in with a project and goal.",
    "Tim encouraged us (many times!) to find a dataset early on and practice the techniques using this data (in addition to assignments). I didn't do this until the end of the semester when I started working on my final project. I regret that decision. Finding a dataset early will help you learn the material and spread out the workload for the final project.",
    "You would get the most out of this class if you have prior knowledge of elementary statistics and matrix algebra."
