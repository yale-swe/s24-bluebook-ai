   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend Physics 200 01 as I think that there are other courses that are better taught and more interesting such as physics 260.",
    "The second midterm made me cry. Unless you are in love with physics and want to major in physics or like suffering, do not take.(Also, the OYC really helped me get through the course. USE IT!)",
    "I would not recommend this class if Golling was teaching",
    "Physics 200 is tough. There are no two ways around it. However, if you listen in class and revise it isn't impossible. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on some of the p-sets though.",
    "An overview of many physics' topics on the mechanics side. It is a good class that I would recommend anyone to take just to understand the world better.",
    "It's a requirement for the physics major - i'd recommend it over 260 which I hear is a higher workload and for an intro class it's not that important if you take the hardest possible class, what matters more is what you take later on.",
    "You have to really like Physics to take this course. Professor Golling is a good and funny teacher, but the workload is a little ridiculous. Some of the problem sets verge on impossible - and you can end up spending a LOT of time on them every week, but at least there are peer tutor sessions at night about 3 times a week. I took Physics C in high school (though not relativity) and found it to be fairly easy this first quarter - it was basically just review with a little more math. However, it has gotten more and more challenging. The concepts are very difficult to understand and involve a lot of math. The exams are crazy hard and it seems like they don't test what we know at all - the average on the midterm2 was a 50%...(though there is a curve of course). The lectures are good but don't prepare us for such hard problems in any way. So, this class is a lot of work and a very hard class to get an A in, so make sure you are willing to spend a lot of time on this class! I've heard both PHYS 180 and 260 aren't as difficult. Originally I was thinking about even majoring in Physics or at least continuing it, but this class has turned me off to physics.",
    "A good basic primer for physics. A lot of the explanations\/proofs for various theories seem to gloss over key points or lack some detail, but you don't need to know the derivations for the class so this is a minor complaint. Take it if you are interested in physics, just be aware that it is definitely more focused on applications and decidedly less general than 260 (if that's your kinda thing). Though lecture is way too long. Should be 50 minutes.",
    "If you love physics and have a solid foundation already, you'll be fine in this class. However, if you are relying solely on what's presented to you in this lectures, be prepared to understand nothing. My advice to those who have to take this class is to follow along with Shankar's lectures available through the open courses online and do not fall behind because it piles up quickly.",
    "Take this class if you have a good mathematical preparation and even if you have little Physics background. I came in not having taken Physics in high school but having completed through Multivariable Calculus and I did fine. It takes work and make sure you make friends to work on the PSets with. Definitely manageable.",
    "I would not recommend Physics 200. You learn a lot of concepts and useful things in class, but it always feels like the tests stray from the subject itself. The questions on exams are always the hardest of any we have done yet and are more about knowing a little math trick or being able to connect a lot of dots, rather than testing whether or not we understand the concepts and their uses.",
    "Probably not. This class is confusing and unless you are really determined you will start skipping lecture almost every time. I would often walk out of lecture MORE confused about physics.",
    "Very difficult and probably not worth it unless you are very sciency or need it as a prerequisite.",
    "It kind of sucks but that's how I feel about physics in general. I've heard 180 is worse so that's why I took 200.",
    "Take it, however, be warned that the difficulty comes not from math, but from ambiguity--not something one comes to expect from a quantitative science class.",
    "Well, it depends on if they really like physics. I can't say I would recommend it to anyone who's not a die-hard physics fan. It would be better for most people to take 180.",
    "yea take it!",
    "I would recommend Physics 200 as a good introductory level science course, especially for those going into engineering who are required to take it for their major. It is difficult, but not incredibly so, and with the proper amount of studying is a very manageable class.",
    "Take it if you must, especially if you don't want to be in a class of 90% premed. However, if you have prior physics background, take 260 - it is easier.",
    "Interesting material. Tests are sometimes a little difficult. 1 problem set a week, very manageable workload. Sometimes the professor isn't the clearest at explaining, and his lecture notes aren't the best. I recommend googling for the Phys 200 course on Yale Open Courseware for a good lecturer.",
    "It is a difficult class, but if you focus and learn the concepts, it is not impossible. You have to work very hard. Only take the class if you truly want to learn physics. You can't get by just learning how to do problems.",
    "I believe 180, 200, and 260 count for the same requirements toward a physics major, premed requirement, etc. I would recommend taking 180 and NOT 200. There are so many things you can spend your time at Yale doing, and it is not worth it to take 200. A lot of people from 260 drop to 200, since there is not enough room in 260, making the curve very harsh. In addition, the second exam had an average of a 40%. Also, there is too much emphasis on relativity and other topics you probably won't use. Unless you really, really want to spend an inordinate amount of time in order to learn very little material and probably still stress about getting a low grade, I would take 180 (which I hear is a much better experience). If you truly love physics and want to challenge yourself despite the grade, try 260 but 200 is probably a waste of time and effort for nothing.I admit that the professor, Tobias Golling, is a very nice guy, pretty funny, and an alright lecturer, but in terms of the material covered and unfair exams, it is not worth it.",
    "Check out the teaching. The math doesn't get hard until 201, so plan to take multi with 200 (I did multi with 201 before I took 200 NOT RECOMMENDED). If you just need a physics sequence, go for whoever seems best. Golling was pretty good although primarily because of his posted notes and attitude. I had Tipton for 201, he was ok. Both seemed better than 170\/180 profs. There were four in my suite who took physics this semester. The three of us in 200 made it through, the one in 180 dropped because the prof didn't teach. Side note, the textbook is expensive and not helpful, sorry.",
    "Take it if you have to for your major. Shop 260 at the same time during shopping period and do the pests for both just in case that might be better for you. The problem here is that 260's tests take problems straight out from the pset (or so I heard) while this doesn't. You walk in to the test room and get bombarded with problems you've never solved before, trying to guess and learn and solve them at the same time within a time limit. Every exam is a brand new hurricane.",
    "Take it! I really enjoyed this course, am looking forward to Physics 201, and have been inspired to truly consider the physics major as a result of taking this class (I did not come in with that idea at all). We learned about special relativity along with mechanics, thermodynamics, etc, which is pretty good for first-semester intro physics. Prof. Golling is great, in my opinion, and that is one of main the reasons I liked the class. That being said, some people disliked this class and the professor, so shop it and the other classes to see which prof you like. This was Prof. Golling's first time teaching this class (or I think any such lecture) here, and I think next year will be even better when he has the text he wants and has been able to reflect on this year.The class lists Math 120 as a co-requisite, but I found it very helpful to have previously taken Math 120.",
    "I found PHYS 200 fascinating. It was definitely a step up from high school Physics, but I've learned more material more quickly than I ever imagined going in. Kinematics whizzes by, but then you dive into really interesting topics (e.g. special relativity, thermodynamics, oscillations). The tests and problem sets can be very challenging.I would recommend PHYS 200 for another student, but if that student has the prerequisites for PHYS 260, I would recommend that class over this one.",
    "Physics 200 is a solid class. It's more math intensive and involves fewer demonstrations than I've heard Physics 180 does, but I appreciated seeing the math behind all of the physics concepts. I appreciated that we covered topics including relativity in this class; introductory physics classes at other schools wait until much later in a student's physics career to cover those topics.",
    "Extremely difficult class if you've never really studied physics before. You will analyze it in depth sometimes to the point of agonizing confusion. You usually can't do the problem sets by yourself so make friends and go to the study halls. I am not sure how to do well in this class but just going to class and doing the problem sets isn't anywhere near enough. I would recommend this class only if you really love physics or have studied it intensely in the past. Otherwise, stay far away from this class; it was absolute hell at times.",
    "I personally think that physics itself is a great subject, and that everyone should take it. Physics 200 is a very good review tool if you haven't taken physics for a few years but are interested in continuing your physics studies. I definitely recommend that you have taken AP Physics C if you want to take this course, otherwise the material may move a little too quickly (and Professor Golling was not always the most effective teacher). However, if you are confident that you will put in the effort to learn, then Physics 200 is a great introductory course.",
    "NO NO NO NO NO (if Golling is teaching it). I am usually a decent physics student, and I had to withdraw from the course on the last day of classes. There were gaping holes in my understanding from essentially the third week, and as the material got harder, I didn't have a foundation to build from. I am certain that this was not my fault. The class consensus was that Golling was very bad. Roughly half the class didn't go to lecture because it was so bad, instead watching the videos on OpenYale and the MIT videos.",
    "The class is hard, but it is rewarding if you try hard.",
    "Either take Physics 260 or 180. Physics 200 is extremely time consuming, and the OYC lectures are better than the class itself.",
    "You should be very clear whether this is the class for you before you take it. As far as I can tell, PHYS 200 is for students that basically already know physics pretty well (they have taken AP Physics and are confident in the material), but that perhaps don't want as intense or mathy a class as they would get in PHYS 260 (for those that ate AP Physics and Multivariable calculus and differential equations for breakfast, as far as I can tell).If you are not already very confidant in your physics abilities, then 180 is the class for you. (As I believe it would have been for me). As it was, I could hardly ever follow the lectures or even learn anything from them.",
    "Take it if you must. Physics is not fun, but Prof. Golling is cool. He tries to add humor to the class. Go to the study halls.",
    "I did not enjoy PHYS 200. First, I felt that Prof. Golling was not a good lecturer. While I am sure he is a brilliant physicist, his lectures lacked flow. Also, I feel that I would have learned more had he spent more time explaining general concepts rather than writing lengthy derivations on the board. Second, the TAs were subpar. I don't even know what my TA looked like, I never saw him. I learned more from the student tutors at the help sessions in JE than from any TA. If you like math and have a very strong math\/physics background, then this class is for you.Otherwise, it will not be fun.",
    "If I had to do this semester over again I would not take this course. The material is too fast-paced, and the instructor does not give the material enough attention in class for the problem sets to be doable. On top of that, the midterms and final were grossly misrepresented by the practice tests posted on classes v2, and students were consequentially not aptly prepared for those tests.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, and be wary of who's teaching it. It sucks.",
    "Physics 200 is fairly good class. In terms of choosing between 180\/200\/260 if you have taken an ap physics course in HS, but not any special preparation (like physics Olympiad) then 200 is a good place to be. The professor is not the best, but the physics study hall is great and the TAs providea lot of help. Plus, open courseware can be used as a supplement if you are having particular difficulty. Overall, the class is a good amount of work, the psets are generally fairly difficult and anything containing relativity is particularly difficult. I would recommend this class to anyone looking for an intro physics course, but not enthusiastically.",
    "For anyone considering a science major, physics 200 is a solid introduction to general physics.",
    "Do not take this course as a freshman if you have any doubts about your physics level! Physics 180 would most likely be the better course for you. This course is extremely fast paced, and falling behind even a little bit is really bad. I took AP Physics C in 11th grade and did decently well, but was not at all prepared for this course. Special Relativity was the biggest killer. If you do decide this course, be ready to work really, really hard.",
    "I would not recommend Physics 200 unless you have a very STRONG physics and mathematical background. If this is not your case, you will suffer a lot in this class so you should consider taking Physics 180.",
    "The class was much more difficult than it should have been. In fact, from what I've heard from many friends, Physics 260 was actually easier then 200 this semester; even though they went over more material. I would not recommend this class with this instructor to other students.",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "If you are VERY good at physics and math, go ahead and take it.",
    "I would recommend this course for auditory learners. Otherwise, it would honestly be much more beneficial to just buy the textbook and read it, or to watch the lectures\/do the problems on Yale Open Course. I loved the material covered in this course, ranging for typical mechanics to relatively to an introduction of fluid mechanics. However, I was not impressed by the teaching or how the class was structured.",
    "The lecture consists of proofs and derivations of many relationships between physical quantities. The problem sets and tests require no knowledge of proofs and derivations.The lecture doesn't teach any applications of these quantitative relationships. The problem sets and tests are completely based on applications of these quantitative relationships.It's hands-down the worst class I've taken at Yale because of this inane structure, but if you took physics in high school, you can go take the tests without ever going to lecture and do just fine. Have at it.Otherwise, try to get into 260 if you've taken Math 120! I didn't try nearly hard enough, and physics administration seems to be confused about what background you need for 260. Push against them to get into 260 if you have to. I wish I had.",
    "Awful course. Awful, awful, awful. I would NEVER recommend this course. In fact, it is more like a non-course, as I had to depend entirely on online lectures, as they were better than Golling's.The professor told us at the beginning that he would swap a Monday or Wednesday class for Friday \"every two or three weeks.\" What he meant to say is that he would hold a Friday class in lieu of a Monday or Wednesday class just about every week, with no Friday class about every two or three weeks. The sporadic and poorly communicated last-minute schedule changes meant that I often missed a lecture because I didn't know we were scheduling it that day.The professor breezes through the material. When questions were asked, the answers were largely unhelpful. The professor is not a strong lecturer, particularly with respect to teaching sometimes complex subjects in physics.Our textbook was of little comfort. I had to rely on other textbooks out of Bass to actually learn the material. Because the lectures were so overwhelmingly confusing, study halls were packed, overloading the TAs and making it impossible to work with a TA.If you have to take this course, watch the online Open Yale Courses videos, and find a better textbook, such as \"University Physics\" by Zemansky et. al.",
    "I would recommend Physics 200 for an extremely physics-oriented student. Otherwise, it is a very difficult course that I did not particularly enjoy.",
    "If you are a math\/science person and are thinking of pursuing physics, this is the course for you. Make sure you have some background multivariable knowledge or are willing to learn on the fly. Also, be prepared to be shocked with the difficulty of the midterms. Golling shoots for an average ofabout 60% and then curves from there. Don't worry. LECTURE NOTES are invaluable in this course. Utilize them.",
    "PHYS 200 provides you a very strong foundation in physics. Unless you have mastered multivariable calculus and think this course might bore you (in which case you'll take 260), or you have other very difficult course to take (in which case you'll take 180), you should take this course. The content is fascinating(especially the relativity chapter). The course can be very frustrating at times -- seek all the help you can get! As long as you actively find help, you will do just fine.",
    "Good, intensive into physics class but not too difficult.",
    "This class was overall hard, even with my previous physics experience. The psets were easy (except for the special relativity pset) and the material was not too hard (except for the special relativity). However, if you are taking this class for an engineering requirement, TAKE 180 instead.",
    "The class can be a challenge at times, but you learn a really solid amount of physics. Some people had complaints about him, but I really like Golling a lot. I found his lectures interesting and he posts really solid lecture notes online. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with some background in physics. If you're starting fresh, it's probably easier to take 170 or 180 unless you plan to major in physics.",
    "Physics 200 is your basic entry-level college physics course. It covers the basics of Newtonian Mechanics, Special Relativity, Periodic Motion and Waves and Thermodynamics. Though supposedly calculus-based, we did very little calculus in the course, and very rarely was calculus required on the part of the student aside from the use of integration in a few problems in the problem sets. The class was taught during most of the course as if it were a review of principles already learned in a high school physics course, though by no means do I believe someone couldn't learn it first here if they had the time. Tobias Golling, though pretty new, is a great teacher, with much enthusiasm for physics in general. If you have to take physics for your major or pre-professional requirements, I would say this is a good route to take.",
    "I do not recommend this course. Unless a very good professor is instructing it do not take it.",
    "This is a strange course. It's fundamentals, and to get in you must have scored well on the AP, so for the first six weeks or so you learn absolutely nothing new, but are still put through incredibly challenging and convoluted problem sets. Professor Golling is a great guy, and very nice, but he is not the most clear lecturer. My biggest complaint is that I often didn't know why we were doing what we were doing until it was too late and I hadn't been able to follow the proof or derivation of a new formula. The tests were much harder than the practice tests available online. If you must take this course with Golling, I would absolutely recommend reading his online lecture notes and perhaps even watching the Open Yale Courses videos of Shankar.",
    "Take it if you already like and know physics and math, but other than dont bother if you dont have to.",
    "Not an enjoyable class just because the lecture format is so terrible for learning physics. Some students can do it with no effort and learn nothing but spoil the curve for everyone else, and some people can't do it no matter what. The professor teaches somewhere in the middle, but doesn't really know how to do so effectively. There was a huge disparity between the lectures, psets, and exams. Lectures basically didn't touch on problem-solving skills necessary for psets, and Golling's exams were twice as hard as past year exams. Golling cared about his students and honestly wanted to make the class better, but the lecture format was fighting him the whole way. If you take the class, go to the \"study halls\" and ask for help. Making sure you understand the pset concepts is just the first step, but it's a crucial foundation.",
    "Phys200 is an okay course. The tests, in my experience, are quite different from the problem sets, which are quite different from the in-class examples. I transferred into this course because 260 scared me, but I definitely shouldn't have let it. I hadn't taken multivariable so the math was a little intimidating, but I think 260 overall would have been a better course.",
    "Recommendation: find Shankar on open courseware, and listen to his lectures (instead). They're quite helpful.",
    "Yes, but only if you really like physics.",
    "I took math 120 2 years previous and had forgotten too much to do well. I was not prepared for the class and didn't learn much because of it- I'll be taking 181 next semester (if I don't have to repeat first semester).Tobias is pretty cool though, I liked his teaching style (blackboard but asked the students a lot of questions, started discussions, and used clickers to check in on everyone\/expand things). I think it was his first semester teaching and he often moved around class (we often had class on Friday- he works at CERN and would make himself long weekends by having mw one week and wf the next).I enjoyed the class, I just didn't learn anything and probably failed.",
    "Physics 200 is overall a challenging course, but what you learn can make up for it if you are interested in physics.",
    "Physics 200 is a great course for anyone interested even vaguely in the sciences. The beginning topics are not complicated, but the course teaches them and the more complicated topics very well. I would recommend the course for any student planning to major in any science or engineering discipline.",
    "Take this only if you already have a strong background in physics. Otherwise, take 180.",
    "If you took some physics in high school but don't feel like you've mastered introductory physics, PHYS 200 is probably a good fit. There is a fair amount of material you've seen already, especially in the first part of the semester (Newtonian mechanics), but there is also a lot of interesting new stuff (relativity, oscillations and waves, thermodynamics) and more advanced applications. The major work burden is that the p-sets are challenging, but they are always very useful and if you understand them thoroughly you are well prepared for the tests.",
    "First half is easy until you hit relativity. Then, prepare to have your mind blown. I thought Golling was a great professor until we hit relativity, and I realized that I already knew all the other stuff from AP anyways. Then, when I actually had to learn everything from Golling, I realized he was actually really confusing. I actually went on Open Yale and looked up Physics 200 back when Shankar was teaching it. It was very helpful (although even that couldn't save my grade on the second midterm; the median was 31\/60). Be forewarned that the tests can have ridiculously tricky questions and the hints are maddeningly cryptic.",
    "If you are coming to Yale and plan to major in an engineering field, I would not recommend this course. Taking 180 (if you took Physics B in high school) or 260 (if you took Physics C and have a strong background in multivariable calculus) would be more beneficial. The material in 200 is not very accessible to someone with a physics background without a multivariable background. Professor Golling's lectures were very hard to follow and often had little to do with the problem sets that were due that week. The problem sets were very time consuming, but were made more manageable by the problem sessions in the JE dining hall Sunday-Tuesday (those are crucial, if you are taking this class I would highly recommend you attend those). Overall the material in this course is difficult and not covered very well; Prof Golling gave little to no overview of what the class would be about each day before jumping straight into derivations and proofs, which made the lecture very hard to follow. The exams were difficult for many people, but of course doable if you have a strong background with physics. This class requires a lot of effort and dedication outside of lecture and is an overall difficult course.",
    "If you're pre-med and taking this course as a \"challenge\", you're probably better off taking a lower level course and directing your time and energies elsewhere. If you're not already a very good physics student who has seen this material before, you'll be putting in a lot of time in order to do well. I don't recommend this course unless you're very sure that physics is what you want.",
    "Physics 200 01 presents Physics concepts in their most basic form. The student is then left alone to establish for themselves a more complex understanding of these concepts.",
    "It is pretty difficult for someone who is not much involved in physics, but if you are all into it the course is amazing.",
    "It is pretty much what it advertises- an in-depth introduction to Physics. I'd take it if you're really interested in Physics! Professor Golling isa great guy and so engaging. I think that he needs a bit more practice teaching, but he is very, very open to suggestions. My suggestion for him was to use more written explanations on the board because sometimes he got carried away with derivations and examples.",
    "I would recommend it only if you took AP physics C in high school. This is not an easy course, and a very large portion of students dropped out. That being said, you will be fine if you actually go to lecture (which can be very difficult) and keep up with the material. The topics covered are very interesting for anyone that loves physics.",
    "Only take if really interested in physics.",
    "I think this would be a great class if you're really interested in physics. If you don't love physics, this class is going to be pretty tough. Professor Golling is great, but the material is hard, so I'd only recommend the class to people who know they really enjoy physics.",
    "Definitely take this class, especially if you've had physics before and feel fairly comfortable with most concepts. The lectures are interesting (most of the time) and the professor is great, but the midterms are pretty hard, although they're curved a lot.",
    "I would recommend Phys 200 for someone who has not had AP Physics and who has had calculus (and is currently taking or has taken multivariable), and for someone who doesn't mind learning by reading the textbook. For someone who has had AP Physics and thinks they have mastered the material, definitely take 260.",
    "Not exactly introductory physics, fast faced, too much relativity for an intro course, our exams were harder than 260's as I heard",
    "Good class but not worth it if you don't need to take it. Heard its better than 180 though. Consider 260 as well.",
    "The material was okay (not easy, but doable); however, the organization was really poor. Professor Golling would move classes around and the material on problems sets would be so far behind the lectures. This is a class where some of the best advice is to make some friends and teach yourself.",
    "You will have to study on your own from the textbook and do problems on your own to study for the test and really grasp the concepts. Doable for those who have a comfortable grasp on physics from high school. If you are not \"good at physics\/math\" probably take 170 or 180.",
    "A very comprehensive course. A lot was high school physics knowledge (like mechanics) but much more complex and difficult. Don't take it if you feel you have little or inadequate physics background. It demands time and work and also an inclination in physics and mastery of math calculus.",
    "Regular Physics course, I'd say equal to or maybe even easier than Physics C in high school.",
    "Physics 200, in sum, is \"fascinating.\" I wanted to take 260, but was prevented from doing so by an international conspiracy and a lack of AP Physics: Electricity and Magnetism. Though, from what I've heard, 260 does not have a tremendous emphasis on rigourous problem solving, which makes me feel better about my placement, but still bitter. The lectures for 200 are based on a set recorded by Shankar, so if you really wanted to, you could skip class. I didn't, because Tobias Golling is the kind of guy you root for. He's young, he's brilliant, he has awesome hair, a great accent, and a sweet leather jacket. He could have been the next European techno sensation if he wanted to, but instead he chose to teach Physics 200 to an assorment of students undeserving of his greatness. Though, he may very well be actually touring the world, pumping out sick beats and taking names, while pretending to work at \"CERN.\" This class attracts all types, from the freshman whose recollection of \"that whole math thing\" is a little bit hazy to the sophomore who was kicked out of 260 for no reason and is now plotting to destroy humanity--and the curve. And you, lowly course evaluation-reader, may too destroy the curve, if you take time to do extra practice problems, because the problems sets do not always do the best job of reinforcing the material. Over all, as you can probably tell, I would recommend this course, and with a few tweaks to problem sets it could very well become the amazing class it yearns to be."
