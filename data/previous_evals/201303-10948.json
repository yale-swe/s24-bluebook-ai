   "comments": [
    "It's a course that will challenge you to not only look closely at the texts read in class and understand the academic discussion about those texts, but to have individual and unique thoughts about both the readings and the themes of the course. I would recommend it to a friend who is interested in English and literature, but it's too challenging for someone who just wants to take it to get a requirement out of the way and doesn't like english.",
    "VERY COOL TOPIC. You'll be fine as long as you keep up with the reading and give yourself enough time for the papers (there are only four of them, so they count!). Professor Williams is very funny and an interesting discussion leader. He brings a lot of background knowledge into the class. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I definitely recommend this course, mostly for Professor Williams. I also really enjoyed some of the more science-fiction aspects of the class.",
    "English 115 01 provides a good balance of reading and writing, and I would recommend this class if you want to write about literature. Personally, I did not enjoy the class as much as I would have liked to because much of the focus was on religious texts, which are not of interest to me. However, if you are particularly interested in transcendentalism, especially in the context of religion, I would recommend this class.",
    "It is a writing class but a little different from a typical high school writing class. There is more of a focus on academic writing among other things. The texts are also a little different than in a typical high school class. I would recommend this class as it is fun, engaging, and provides a new experience.",
    "This class is not what it seems. The readings for this course are very unconventional, as it includes material such as the Book of Mormon, Emmanuel Swedenborg, and Helena Blavatsky. However, the connections between the various readings are very interesting, and the professor is great at fostering discussion. If you are looking for an unconventional writing course, this is the one.",
    "Yes! Professor Williams is a very good teacher who makes class super interesting. You get to read amazing literature and improve your writing skills. There are only four writing assignments, so the workload is not too intense. Keep up with the reading every class, and you will definitely not regret taking this great writing seminar!",
    "English 115 really depends of the subject. If you like to read and discuss books about metaphysical themes, then Lit and the Transcendent text sis for you. Otherwise, the material may not be interesting.",
    "It has very little to specifically with science fiction, so unless they change the course title you should be weary of that. Overall the course is fun with interesting readings that aren't overly difficult, and the workload is moderate at its worst and light most of the time.",
    "English 115 is a literature seminar, with each section exploring a unique topic or theme throughout the semester. Classes are small, usually 12 to 18 students, so there's lots of discussion in class. It's important to keep up with the reading, as this is a reading intensive class. As someone who is not a strong writer, I feel that this was the perfect class for me. Even though there were only four assignments, I still learned a lot about writing and how ti form an academic paper. I would definitely recommend this class for someone who enjoys reading and is looking to improve their academic writing skills.",
    "You read a lot of religious-style and science fiction texts as a discussion on themes of \"transcendence\" in multiple facets. Great, fun course for anyone, especially people who like religious studies and science fiction,"
