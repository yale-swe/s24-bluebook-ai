   "comments": [
    "I was initially skeptical of this syllabus--I took the class to simultaneously fulfill the pre-1800 and junior seminar requirements and was not convinced I could enjoy an 18th Century British Novel if you paid me. These early novels are often repetitive, confusing, and 600 pages longer than they need to be. But Professor Lee absolutely made this class. She not only made it very clear why these novels were so important (by providing historical and literary contexts for each book), but she also led incredibly dynamic discussions. She is very down-to-earth and has a wonderful sense of humor--these traits combined with her evident academic brilliance made for a perfect seminar. There is a hefty reading load, but Professor Lee is very communicative with the class about how much reading is doable, and she is open to feedback. The assignments were fun--she often encouraged creative options that help you engage with the text in unique ways (e.g. re-writing the final chapter of Tom Jones, in the voice of Henry Fielding; translating a chapter from a novel into a modern genre like a play or graphic novel).",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. The novels themselves are crazy\/ridiculous, and it was great to learn about the origin of the modern novel. The readings are long but Professor Lee is lenient about getting everything done. Discussions are generally laid back, but everyone participates and Professor Lee usually makes an important point at the end.",
    "A very important course, more relevant to the development of later literature than I thought.",
    "Take this class!First of all, Wendy Lee is amazing! She's really funny, cool, personable, and understanding. She's young and often relates the work that we're reading to modern day, does great impersonations, and is often really understanding about workload, asking the class how many pages is reasonable and telling you when you should just skim when it's a lot of pages.That said, it is a LOT of pages!!! But, if you go in knowing when to skim and when to read, then it's manageable. The syllabus is great, with a lot of odd works leading up to the rise of the novel, including the steamy sex scenes from Love in Excess and the post-modernist-before-there-was-something-modern-to-be-post-about Tristram Shandy. You'll walk away with an understanding of how these early experiments lead to the development of the novel.Wendy Lee also assigns some great paper topics, like creative options! (ex: rewrite the last chapter of Tom Jones)Wendy Lee is a lot of fun and lets the class lead the discussion and talk about whatever you want... however, this might be frustrating for people who want more guided discussions or really intense, rigorous discussion (sometimes the class can feel a little too much like fun chit-chat).",
    "This was such an excellent class! I loved every moment of it. It may be hard to keep up as a non-English major, but you should not hesitate taking this course even if you aren't. Professor Lee is a great instructor, and her detailed knowledge of this sub-field of literature really shows.",
    "It's a great course--it's really fascinating to watch the novel develop, and it's a time period that you shouldn't overlook, especially if you're an English major. Plus there's really not that much work, which is nice. It's a great class to write a senior essay in. The reading is fun and scholars haven't analyzed these books to death yet (unlike, say, Joyce or Shakespeare).",
    "Yes!"
