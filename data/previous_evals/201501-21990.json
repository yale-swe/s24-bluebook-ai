   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who likes reading great books and for anyone regardless of writing skill.",
    "A great survey of the books you should read, but might not if you didn't take a class on them.",
    "Intense but enlightening discussions - really depends on the class dynamic and the professor, but you can't really go wrong in the English department.",
    "I would suggest this class to both humanities and non-humanities majors. For the former it is a great way to get all of these important texts quickly and concisely. For the latter it is a great intro to all of the works with very manageable writing. A great WR credit for those looking for one.",
    "If you like to read, or care about books, or care about the foundations of western canon, this is a must-take class! I recommend it with Professor Walsh but I'm sure other professors are great too. The readings and discussion are interesting and rewarding. At times the reading load can get intense, but you just need to choose which books to write essays on carefully. It was a great class, but on the other hand, not life-changing. I got a bit less out of it than I thought I would, though I still thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "Fantastic, take this class. Beware, it's a LOT of reading but take it with Walsh and you will have a fantastic experience.",
    "Each individual teacher chooses the sixth book for his\/her section to supplement the Odyssey, the Aeneid, Inferno, Don Quixote (we did just the first half, Part I), and Ulysses. We did Heart of Darkness as our sixth, right before Ulysses. There was a 4-5 page paper prompt for each book and we needed to write four papers, at least one of which on either the Odyssey or the Aeneid. I would recommend the class, but Id also recommend that folks try to read the works beforehand for pleasure \/ plot so that during the class you dont get bogged down \/ distracted by the plot specifics and can focus more on the craft and the genre and generally bigger, broader links.",
    "This is a fantastic class with a great, though ambitious, syllabus. Walsh is a wonderful professor. He's brilliant, and creates a very friendly classroom atmosphere, and is also very personable. It's fascinating to see the progression of narrative form. Yes, it is a pretty hefty reading load, but it's a very enjoyable one, and totally worth the work. I highly recommend this class.",
    "The course is a great immersion in the classical cannon ranging from Homer's Odyssey to the Aeneid all the way up to Joyce's Ulysses, in a seminar format. I would recommend this course to any student willing to study humanity on a grandiose scale and think about big-picture questions such as, what makes a hero, why we are so fascinated with heroes, and what do different societies' and authors' heroes reveal about humanity. You should also be willing to pace yourself with a lot of reading!"
