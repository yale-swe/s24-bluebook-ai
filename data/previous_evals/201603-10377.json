    "How to think critically about architecture as a whole and how individual works of architecture fit into both their historical context and future works.",
    "I received an excellent overview of architectural history, particularly in the Renaissance period, as well as training in analysis of architecture. This course expanded my notion of architecture and sensitized me to its symbolic and ideological undertones.",
    "I have never taken a History of Architecture class before, so this was definitely an eye opener and new.",
    "how to see the history of architecture as a non-linear progression",
    "I feel I have a much better understandin of historical architecture and how to analyze architecture in general.",
    "I learned lots of classical Vincent Scully thought and also some \"new\" ways of thinking about architecture and origins",
    "I learned how to read architectural history competently. I gained a better understanding of how to tackle future concepts in architectural history and how to do adequate research for academic papers.",
    "I developed general knowledge about certain important architectural monuments.",
    "I learned to put a name to the type of architecture I see and appreciate the amount of work that goes into each. I also learned about the evolution of architecture through time and the importance of knowing the historical context of a building, which renders it even more astounding.",
    "Learned a lot about classical architectural style, which proved to be very helpful in studio."

   "comments": [
    "Key Strength: Sherer is great Key Weakness: limited scope",
    "I felt that this course did an excellent job of exploring architectural history through specific examples and of delineating the architectural continuities and ruptures from one period to the next. Though I understand that the breadth of the course does not allow for the incorporation of every region, I do think it would have been interesting to see more iterations of Renaissance\/Baroque architecture outside of Italy, such as Latin America, Spain, England, etc.",
    "Most of the students in the class are architecture majors or perspective architecture majors. So if you happen to be a non-ARCH major, you might find yourself horribly left out in conversations, simply because you have nothing relevant to add and you don't understand many of the terms\/famous architects that the other students already do.",
    "Professor Sherer is great at in-depth analysis of a single building. However, I don't feel like I learned a history of architecture; I learned about 1 building each class. It also focused way too much on renaissance. We spent only one day on all of ancient Egypt, for example, only looking at the pyramids, and yet we spent multiple weeks going through the major architects of the renaissance. It was not a balanced course and I don't feel like I came away with any comprehensive knowledge. Also, sections were not helpful in any way and Professor Sherer tends to just talk the whole time.",
    "good lecturer",
    "My one wish is that this course could either broaden its scope to deal with all of architectural history, or else admit to and embrace its focus on the Western architectural tradition.",
    "Interesting lectures I found no real basis on how papers and reading responses were graded",
    "Strengths -- prof. sherer is an incredible lecturer, architectural works we visited were relevant and interesting, and course workload was reasonable given studio that we all have to take Weaknesses -- prof. sherer is pretty abrasive and unwilling to hear opposition. a bit stubborn in his structure of the class (requiring the final paper to be turned in *in person* on the last day of finals even though he wouldn't even be on campus at that point). Section could be better structured to deepen the understanding of the works -- maybe more discussion between TFs and Professor Sherer so that both sections get the same thing out of the time. Also, I received about 3-5 words of comments on my midterm paper. Although I was given a good grade, I would have appreciated a more thoughtful response considering the amount of time I put into the paper. Additionally, when the purpose of the midterm paper is to create a starting point from which to improve for the final paper, even an A-quality paper should have suggestions or comments for improvement.",
    "The course was effective in that it never became confusing because the syllabus was well though-out and lectures flowed. Lecture was always interesting and highlighted how there is always more to a building than meets the eye.",
    "Really engaging and interesting lectures that I always looked forward to attending. The assignments were very enjoyable, as we were given the freedom to apply what we learned to the architectural topic of our choice."

   "comments": [
    "Take it - and if you're a sophomore or freshman thinking about architecture, take it early.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in the history of architecture and the history of ideas.",
    "Take this class only if you are going to be an architecture major, or are ready to converse about architecture. Otherwise you might the class way above your head and you may also find yourself struggling to understand anything at all.",
    "I would not recommend this course because it is very imbalanced. We spent only one day on all of ancient Egypt, for example, only looking at the pyramids, and yet we spent multiple weeks going through the major architects of the renaissance. I don't feel like I came away with any cohesive knowledge or skills. Professor Sherer is exceedingly verbose.",
    "This class was the worst class I have taken so far. Please avoid this class if you are not an architecture major.",
    "If you're an architecture\/architecture-related major, you have to take this course. While it is potentially interesting material, the professor's attitude completely destroyed any interest I had in the material. Beyond being condescending to students, he seemed particularly uninterested in opening up the history of architecture beyond the typical western canon - students who wanted to write their paper on non-western architecture were told to relate their papers back to the western canon, which was frustrating to hear. In conversations, the professor would cut you off in the middle of your explanations and would be condescending.",
    "yep!",
    "Anyone mildly interested in history or architecture or just learning in general should take this course. The content is surprisingly incredibly interesting and has a true impact on how you view modern day architecture.",
    "Recommend!",
    "I would recommend this course only to those planning on pursuing the major. I don't think it would have much value to others.",
    "Yes. Although architecture majors are required to take it, I might have taken it even without majoring. Prof. Sherer is a great lecturer (sometimes offensive, sometimes hilarious, sometimes rude, sometimes inspiring) who is clearly passionate about the subject. Going to class is very enjoyable and entertaining. Workload is light -- a short midterm paper which is then expanded upon to become your 10-15pg. final paper, along with weekly reading responses. Although it's a very small lecture, Prof. Sherer doesn't engage particularly well with the students, but is fairly receptive to set up meetings to discuss your work further.",
    "I would recommend this course to architecture majors or those with an interest in the subject. It is a nice introduction that teaches students to appreciate buildings they have seen before. There is focus on the buildings themselves and the architects in context. Professor Sherer is a great lecturer and the workload is fair. Try to get into Sherer's section if possible. You get more out of the class and he is a great storyteller.",
    "Professor Sherer is an incredibly talented and articulate lecturer, and this is a wonderful class. The assignments are not too difficult, and you are given the freedom to apply what you learn to the architectural topic of your choice, which makes for a uniquely personalized educational experience. Always looked forward to attending this class, and never felt compelled to check the time or wonder when it would be over."
