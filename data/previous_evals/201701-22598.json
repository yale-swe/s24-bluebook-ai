   "comments": [
    "Centrally, this course taught me the practice of individual research. I had never worked on a single project for such a long time in such an intensive way, and found Bill's guidance and support essential to this endeavor.",
    "I developed a host of insights and skills taking this course. I became more efficient in using GIS and understanding the role of maps in my work and geography in general.",
    "- good introduction to mapping techniques and their uses in historiography - theoretical debates and discussion to the spatial turn - different methods by which scholars have applied theory and used maps in their projects.",
    "The course provided an exhaustive introduction to geographic and spatial theory, most of which I was previously unaware. Seminar discussions were always engaging, and I left each class meeting with a list of further questions to explore. Bill was always ready to volunteer a new perspective or insight that enriched the discussion. I read more carefully and feel prepared to conduct more effective research after this course. I'm also interested in incorporating GIS into my research, and look forward to that possibility. Altogether the most challenging and rewarding experience I've had so far at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated that we had the course divided into theory, maps, and student projects. It's an innovative course structure. It would be interesting to include recommended readings on the syllabus for students that might want to do more of a deep dive on one subject or another since the reading is contained to the first two-thirds of the course. Great class!",
    "The strengths were the professors ability to teach practical mapping skills and spending a considerable amount of time teaching us how to use and analyze maps and GIS tools. We we also able to workshop our research projects with the rest of our classmates. no weaknesses.",
    "- The course is very exciting and it does give a good opportunity to learn about and discuss what the 'spatial turn' was and what its relevance is today. It is also a great introduction to the problems and opportunities of incorporating cartography in research. - The class size (including the auditors) meant that discussions on very rich, dense texts were minimal and often unsatisfactory. Similarly, the discussion on individual maps brought by each student was often hurried. A smaller class size could be one solution. The other thing could be an introduction to the theoretical text and its author by Bill.",
    "The course doesn't need to be improved."

    "Without question. Geography and History is, in many ways, a working seminar, an opportunity for students to spend the first half the semester grounding themselves in the theory and practice of geography and the second half of the semester working on an article-length piece of work. Bill is an incredibly empathetic and present professor, a real mentor and a really kind learner.",
    "Yes, there were many valuable things you get out of a course like this that you don't or won't typically get in other courses. Students would enjoy the hands on learning from the professor.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Absolutely. As long as they were familiar with the reading, the course is a tremendous opportunity to explore the intersection of spatial theory and history. I recommended it to several friends."
