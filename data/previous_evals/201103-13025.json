    "Yes",
    "Cool studio. Turner and Adam are encouraging and approachable. Semester consists of three projects that build on the idea of the \"body in space.\" By the end of the semester, you will have gained a better understanding of how to set up sequences of space and to work with more precision in form and intent. Creativity in both process and product are not explicitly encouraged... you just have to surprise them and be convincing about it.",
    "Yes. You probably have to take it, though.",
    "Adam and Turner are fantastic. This studio can be a little easy at times, make sure to schedule yourself time to complete everything a bit before the deadline, it can all cram up. After Junior Studio, this is VERY different (and less intense) so make yourself work hard on the projects and not fall behind. The night sections are SPECTACULAR and really interesting. Talk. Read. Work. Yay architecture major! It's the best!"
