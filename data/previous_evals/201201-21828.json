   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the course as it is a very unique take on an aspect of French culture that is vastly different from American culture, but at times it is difficult to find what exactly is funny about certain images. We lack a certain cultural background that makes the jokes seem relevant, but it's interesting to see how \"french\" you are in your perception of humor.",
    "French 366 is a course about nineteenth-century French culture. The focus is on caricatures and how they relate to the political and social issues of the time. Professor Girard is the main star: she is one of the kindest professors I have met in all of my years at Yale. She is always - ALWAYS - willing to help you improve your French and do better in the course. The only problem with the course is that it feels like a lecture at times; class discussion is limited. Despite this minor problem, I enthusiastically recommend French 366 to students interested in expanding their knowledge of French culture and history.",
    "This was a wonderful class. Readings are manageable and Madame Girard is knowledgeable and approachable. For me, this class presented a great opportunity to practice the French language while learning more about an interesting topic. Visits to the Yale University Art Gallery and the trip to the Met were great supplements.",
    "A class on the history of French caricature. Very interesting at times though also a bit slow at times. Recommended, as Prof. Girard is a great professor and French through and through.",
    "If you like french, history, art, or politics this class would definitely suit you well. Even as an engineer, I found this class exciting and very informative."
