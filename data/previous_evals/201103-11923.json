    "I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless you really can't afford to just buy the Kittel textbook and read it on your own because that is most of what you will be doing when you aren't scratching your head trying to figure out how this class continues to exist.",
    "If you are an applied physics major, you have to take it. If you're not- I know you'll take it if you want to do this stuff in graduate school, and I would hate to see one course change the course of your scientific career, so do take it. IN ANY OTHER CASE: do not take it. I have taken many undergraduate and graduate physical science courses at Yale, and this is the single worst one. You will struggle to learn from a variety of textbooks, attend muddled lectures and pore over more-muddled notes, and come out with a decent introduction to the subject - but it's not worth the stress and work unless you need it for your future studies. Beware that you run the risk of losing your enthusiasm for a great area of research.",
