    "This was less of a class and more of just an open space to brainstorm and attempt to start to fix the STEM environment at Yale. Personally, as a white male, I came to this class to learn more about the struggles others were facing, and I'm happy I took it!",
    "This class was wonderful. We spent the class discussing what issues there were with STEM, how we could introduce \"interventions\" to these problems, and learned how to write important op-Eds.",
    "This was a great class for getting data behind my everyday experiences as a woman of color in STEM. we learned more about the actual higher educational interventions happening to make STEM fields more inclusive and got to actually hear from students about their experiences.",
    "I was able to study students' experiences of STEM at Yale.",
    "I learned a lot about what action can be taken to improve the climate in STEM for underrepresented students; even though I came into the class thinking I knew most of the interventions and options, I found myself learning a lot from my peers."

   "comments": [
    "The professors did not know what they were doing, but the concept was good.",
    "All the instructors are super kind. I would love to see this course offered again! One thing I would suggest is that Simon and the others try to get someone to help from the WGSS or Sociology departments.",
    "As this was a new class, there wasn't much structure quite yet. I think one of the weaknesses of this class was we didn't have an end result at the end of the semester. If there had been a more set timeline, more policy could have been passed - but that's the limits of a class that meets once a week for only one semester. With that said, the strength of this class is we have the freedom to discuss issues that we deem important to the Yale community and to figure out how we want to approach them.",
    "Strengths was the subject matter of the course and the amount the students got to control out of the class! You got out what you put in and in a very personable way. Weaknesses were that it was a bit disorganized because it was it's first time being taught.",
    "The class was a great way to study the many weakness of STEM education at Yale. I, however, felt like we as students and instructors weren't really qualified\/trained to conduct social science research. I wish there were social scientists who have experience conducting quantitative and qualitative social science research. I think the lack of a social scientist impeded the progress and quality of our research\/analysis.",
    "I really loved that it was an open space where the students could feel comfortable talking about their personal experiences and opinions within STEM. However, I think if the course had been a bit more structured from the beginning, we would have been more successful at achieving our goals. And in retrospect, I also would have appreciated if we had had more weekly assignments to keep us on task."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Not as it currently is set up. It needs a sociology professor on board.",
    "Yes -- it is important to have a space to discuss STEM climate without the pressure of a grade. I felt like everyone was in this class because they cared about the issues at hand.",
    "If you are a student that's passionate about STEM at Yale and wants to see change, I would say this is a class that you should take.",
    "Yes every student and professor at Yale should be required to study this material.",
    "It was extremely enriching to research and develop interventions to improve the STEM experience at Yale, especially for those underrepresented in these fields. I would definitely recommend taking this course if it's offered again, especially if a social scientist is helping facilitate the course.",
    "Take it if you are passionate about learning about and improving the environment of STEM life at Yale for underrepresented minorities. The class took the form of an open discussion with the professors, and resulted in numerous action items to evaluate and ultimately ameliorate the climate in STEM classes, labs, and departments for undergraduates, especially those who are sexual, racial, or gender minorities (though of course, when any subgroup is marginalized, the whole group suffers, so this class has stakes for every student at Yale). I hope it is held again in coming years, and I am excited to see what future classes may think up."
