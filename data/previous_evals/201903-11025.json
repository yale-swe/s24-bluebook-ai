    "I learned a lot of French grammar, culture and language specifics. This class really pushed me to think, not just speak and write, in French and reframe my learning to define new concepts with words I already know instead of always having to translate into English.",
    "I learned quite a bit of French grammar and vocabulary and cultural understanding and feel much more comfortable speaking in the language!",
    "I developed a better ability to speak and understand the French language.",
    "I definitely improved my french reading and listening comprehension, and I feel much more confident in speaking.",
    "More knowledge of French geography, culture, and grammar. More conversational language skills and knowledge of literary figures and diverse French traditions and French-speaking countries.",
    "I learned to communicate more fluently in french.",
    "I developed a fantastic vocabulary, strong writing skills, and strong skills in literary analysis in French."

   "comments": [
    "In terms of strengths, I think this class was very engaging. The texts are super interesting and reveal different aspects of international French cultures, not just white France. I also appreciate how we learn different aspects of the language, not just verbs or just grammar. In terms of weaknesses, this course is very intense. While I appreciate needing to work to learn a language, sometimes it feels like the class does not recognize that we have other classes to work on. The workload was sometimes unmanageable and the assignments were not always clear far enough in advance. I also think that the expected level was far above where most of the class were at. I felt like I spent a lot of time studying and preparing and didn't see a lot of improvement reflected in my exam performance.",
    "Diverse collection of readings. It would be good to also read things like the news or other things at a non-literary register.",
    "I struggled speaking French because I came from a written-based French education background.",
    "It is quite demanding because it meets every day, but depending on the professor, you can still get a lot out of the course without feeling overwhelmed. As the semester progresses, the reading gets significantly longer, but this helps you become acquainted with older styles of French to the point where you don't even think about it.",
    "Strengths: commitment of faculty and students to the material Weakness: its too by the book, memorizing obscure characters and quotes from text do not help in learning a language. The class would benefit from more in-class conversation about topics that transcend the novels.",
    "Maelle was a very instructive professor and helpful with my writing.",
    "The course throws so much material at you that you have no choice but to improve your French. However, the workload is ridiculous to the point of absurdity. On top of the long, uninteresting audio tapes\/worksheets within your Course Pack, please expect biweekly tests, biweekly essays, pop quizzes that are unfair\/insanely difficult, absurd amounts of reading (for whatever text you're assigned), and a grading system that is harsh to the point where you do not learn how to improve your performance."

    "I really loved this class most days and the context and professor were amazing. On the other hand, it is a huge time commitment and very hard to do well in.",
    "Yes I would!",
    "Yes I would because it helps you learn French well and you get as much out of it as you put into it.",
    "If you are willing to put in the time and effort, this course is worth the daily work.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to improve your French this is the course for you, but be prepared to put more work into this class than you average Yale class.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you are looking to take your comfort with French to the next level, take this course. If you are merely trying to complete the language requirement, avoid this course at all costs. If you are making an honest effort to do well, you'll have to do almost everything you are assigned despite the insignificance of most of the homework. To make matters worse, the grading for this is abysmal. Aside from the redactions (biweekly essays) and your participation score, the tests and quizzes make students feel as if they would've struggled the same amount if they hadn't studied at all."
