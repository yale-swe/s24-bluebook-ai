    "Don't take it unless you have to--big time commitment, low reward. Not actually a difficult class, especially if you've worked in a lab before. Make sure you sit next to someone you know\/like\/has lab experience, since a lot is done in groups.",
    "This class is probably one of the least enjoyable ones I've taken at Yale. ONLY TAKE IT IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. The lab lectues are terribly boring and tedious, and there's a lot of work with quizzes for every lab. Also the lab reports SUCK and are graded really harshly. STAY ON YOUR TOES and be glad it's only half a credit for your grade. Although it's completely unfair that so much time in this course only allots for half a credit.",
    "If you have to take it, it is a fine lab. Quizzes are detailed, but not horrible and are dependent on your TAs, as they write them. Reports are beastly. If you want more individualized attention, take it second half of the semester. The professors are really good about paper extensions so you can finish them when you have time. Not that fun, but not bad either.",
    "It is what it is. You're probably an MCDB major looking to knock out a chemistry lab for premed requirements. If you've worked on any laboratory techniques in molecular biology before (PCR, Gel extraction, Western blot, etc.) the lab portion is not hard at all, and even with no experience is very doable. The big lab report is time-consuming and difficult - start it early! But being done with the course halfway through the semester (take section 1!) was amazing.",
    "DON'T TAKE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. It will eat up your schedule. Quizzes take forever to study for; you'll also be in the lab 8 hours per week. Lectures are the most boring thing of all time and are often (literally) incomprehensible; one lecturer has a very strong accent and the other is 90 years old and speaks too quietly. Both lab reports take forever (start early). Try to do it the first half, as you can get extensions that way. Due to this class, I was miserable for half a semester. It was probably the low point of my Yale education. However, if you do take it, try to get Katie (Katrina Meeth) as a TA; she is incredibly patient and kind and will help you succeed",
    "Unfortunately, take it only if you have to... the TAs were great and the professors were nice, but it's a lot of work and time that is better spent working in an actual lab.",
    "It actually is pretty cool to actually do the techniques you learn about in class. I enjoyed the class, and I liked the format of working on two long term projects over the semester. The daily quizzes aren't too bad, albeit the lectures beforehand are quite dry. The lab reports take a LONG time so do not procrastinate. Well, this is likely inevitable, but taking it in the first half helps a bit.",
    "Yes, take the first section so that you have more flexibility with the deadlines",
    "Not unless you have to. Grading seems arbitrary, impossible to predict what they want since the sample papers they give you are not good. Lab twice a week also sucks.",
    "You probably have to take this anyway. A few people dropped this class after they realized you don't need it for premed but it really depends on what chemistry classes you took. Nothing is really \"necessary\" for premed since things generally overlap but this class is good for functioning in a lab and would be worthwhile taking for that reason. Lab varies in length, sometimes you get out early. Sometimes you get out at 6 and it sucks (happens twice). Lectures are a drag but quizzes are very easy and straight from the course packet (or the emails Aruna sends out). Do your report beforehand blah blah blah (do what a reasonable student would do for the reports and you'll do fine).",
    "Good luck. While I learned a lot in this class about lab technique, the reports were just awful, and some times in lab NO ONE knew what was happening. It is also much more work than it seems...Above all else take this the first section!!!",
    "This was a great first experience in a biochemistry lab. We covered techniques such as cloning, isolation\/purification of DNA and proteins, and SDS PAGE. For those of us who had no previous experience with these, it wasn't a problem as the professors and TFs were really patient and good about answering all of our questions. We would usually have a lecture component of the lab, which also helped clarify any questions you might have. I will say that it is a lot of work since it meets twice a week for half a semester instead of all semester once a week. So that half the semester you essentially feel like you've taken on another class. You have a quiz every time you meet and other than that, you have two big lab reports since the whole class is basically just working on two long-term projects that you continue every time you go to lab.Overall, good class and I'd recommend.",
    "If you are not premed or an MBB major (which most people in this class are), then don't take it. There's so much work, especially with the two large lab reports\/problem sets - start on those early. Also, definitely do the first session - I can't imagine what it must be like doing the second session with finals going on.",
    "Avoid if possible. The techniques are basic, but the lectures take up a lot of time, and are incredibly boring. Lab twice a week for one class is a chore, and the reports take forever. Stay away.",
    "Be aware that this lab is a lot of work, but you do end up learning many techniques that are useful in later lab work. The lab reports take a lot of time, but aren't ridiculously complex if you've been paying attention.",
    "The course really does a nice job in introducing the concepts behind some fundamental lab techniques and is actually not too much work for the majority of the term; however, the lab reports at the end are huge so really try to budget your time wisely. Otherwise, enjoyable course; the TAs really made it fun for our section! The professors are also both really nice and endearing in their own ways.",
    "This class is alright, until all the lab reports are due. I'm pretty sure I started failing all my other classes because of these reports. START THEM EARLY!!",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "pretty stressful when writing the reports. what is expected from the lab report is not always clear. you learn some techniques and rationale behind techniques, which is interesting. if you don't have to, i wouldn't take it, but it's half a semester so it's doable.",
    "This is a pretty fast-paced lab, particularly if you do not have a lot of background experience with the lab techniques being used. Be aware that if you take it in the second half of the semester, it will definitely make your reading week\/finals period more stressful as you work on the lab reports in addition to what you have to do for your other classes.",
    "Take it if you need a lab I guess, but it's a lot of work.",
    "Only take this if you absolutely have to. It's the hardest lab I've taken here. MAKE SURE you have a good partner. And consider this a full-credit during the time you're taking it (the first half has the reports due around midterms, the last half around finals). You have quizzes at the beginning of each lab. You can't really start the first lab report until the end of the last lab, so make sure you get assignments in other classes done ahead of time, so you can potentially send in a draft of the report early to your TA. You will have LOTS OF QUESTIONS FOR YOUR TA SO READ THROUGH THE REPORT AND DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BEFOREHAND. I say this knowing it's always so hard to do. The second report requires a lot of repetitive calculation, but do at least one early so you understand what to do.Benefit: You learn a lot, and it helps those of you who work in wet labs to understand what you're doing.",
    "Be prepared for long tedious labs, and unreasonable length lab reports. There's really no way to get started ahead on the reports, so make sure you do your other work in advance to prepare for these monster two labs. It is really a whirlwind of a course. I don't know if I would recommend it, but I guess if you are considering, it is prob a pre-med req.",
    "This isn't the most fun lab and it can be pretty demanding, though luckily it ends halfway through the semester. But don't be fearful if you do end up having to take the course. Aruna and the TAs were all incredibly helpful and supportive. The lab quizzes were tedious but notexcessively challenging. The lab reports took up lots of time and energy, so plan ahead. Another warning- for those with zero previous lab experience, this could be impossibly difficult- no one will hold your hand and teach you exactly how to pipet or pour a gel or define \"aliquot\" and \"supernatant\" for you if you don't already know, it is kind of assumed that you already know all of that from previous lab experiences.",
    "Its a great course but is a lot of busy work really.",
    "Really hard and annoying class-- not worth all the work we had to put in by far. Professors were impossible to understand b\/c of accents. 0\/10 would not take again. Only took for med school, wish I could've avoided it.",
    "Only if you have to",
    "The strength of the course is the fact that the labs build on each other and that you end up completing two \"projects\" rather that 12 different unrelated labs. It's great that the class takes only half of the semester, so if you get the first half, that's one less course you have to worry about come finals period.",
    "I probably would not recommend this class, but you probably have to take it anyway. That being said the class was not that bad. The lectures were pretty long and boring the the lab work was not too bad and I did learn a lot of laboratory techniques. The lab reports are pretty long and so I'd advice you to start pretty far in advance. The quizes before each lab were not too difficult, but they did require you to read through the lab manual before each lab class.",
    "This is an ok lab. I thought it was disorganized at times and the lab lectures got pretty boring sometimes as well. But it is only half a semester and if you can rough it out for whichever half (I was glad I took first half), then you have the other free.Standard advice from everyone is to start the reports early. I would add that if you can't, just make sure you work on them diligently for 2 days. It's not that impossible of a task, but can be very stressful.",
    "251L is very organized and the professors are very good. Given that, the lab periods are long and so are the lab reports. Also, having a quiz for every lab means consistently working a lot throughout the semester.",
    "The lab experiments are pretty basic biology lab techniques, which was enjoyable. However, the lab report writing process was extremely time-consuming and confusing because we did not really know what was expected in the reports despite the samples given.",
    "The course is pretty intense: depending on your TA, you may have to study a lot to get good grades on the daily quizzes.Also, writing the lab reports is truly daunting.Advice: take it during the first half of the semester, if possible--otherwise you'll be writing these reports during reading\/final week.",
    "A good lab course if you want to learn techniques in biochem lab.",
    "Yes! It is only half a semester and the work load is not bad. Aside from the time spent physically in the lab, you just have weekly quizzes and two long lab reports which are pretty intensive, but because they're not due until after the session it is pretty easy to manage.",
    "This course has so much potential to be a truly fabulous intellectual experience. The concepts are pretty interesting, and the course takes you through the development, execution, and writeup of two different mini-projects.Unfortunately, poor execution turned it into one of the most painful classes I've taken to date (as a junior). There were too many people in the lab at once, resulting in crazed professors and TA's, which converted to a stressful classroom experience for everyone involved.The lectures were incomprehensible due to how softly the professors spoke, in a room with a mysterious incessant beeping and terrible acoustics. A common complaint toward the beginning was that no one could understand what was said in lecture... and then people stopped trying. The lab manual was also error-ridden in many sections and did not clearly spell out what we were doing much of the time.Beyond the painful classroom experience, the lab reports were hands-down the most painful assignments I have had at Yale (and that's a from a science major who has faced 15+ page term papers and some really tough finals.) The lab report rubrics had conflicting directions in different sections, and very unclear guidelines for what should go into each section. Much of what each lab told us to record was irrelevant, and then a few details that are not flagged in the labs became incredibly important in the reports, necessitating all sorts of searching and reconstruction when it came time to do the lab report.Usually I am the student who champions difficult classes for the learning that results. I loved cell biology, genuinely enjoyed both semesters of organic chemistry, and thought biochemistry lecture was amazing. I get frustrated with students who whine about the difficulty of classes and how much work they give. Even given this love-learning attitude, this class was simply not worth it."
