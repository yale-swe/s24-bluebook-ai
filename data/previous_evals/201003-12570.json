    "YES, if Prof. Niesz is teaching it. I don't know the other faculty to comment on them, but Prof. Niesz is the nicest Prefessor you'll ever meet. Great sense of humor and you learn a lot. Put in the effort to learn the language - you won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a good continuation of study German grammar, and the informal conversations and exercises make it easy to get practice with speech.",
    "It is a fantastic German course if you love the language.",
    "Not a very demanding course with little homework that had to be turned in. Herr Niesz is very engaging and accessible if you don't understand something and he keeps the classes interesting. This course provided a good base for basic German and is a must take if you're interested in the language."
