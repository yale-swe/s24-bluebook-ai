    "I made progress on my thesis this semester! This course was a good way to discuss my thesis with fellow majors and get feedback and ideas. I think I also developed my ability to give a good academic talk.",
    "Writing, public speaking",
    "This class was a really good step in between theory and method and actually writing the senior essay. It was helpful to make a plan and it kind of set a template for how to carry on writing the essay next year without taking a class that will set requirements and deadlines for you. Also helpful in prepping you to speak in public.",
    "This course was pretty useless. It was supposed to prepare for senior thesis writing but it just made me feel terrible about my progress without actually holding me accountable for making any.",
    "I learned a lot about how to craft a good presentation, but not much else. I definitely learned a lot about how I wanted to organize my thesis and how I wanted it structured, but honestly most of that came from meeting with my (brilliant) advisor rather than from this course.",
    "I was able to develop a better structure and plan for my senior thesis.",
    "Gained skills at creating presentations, distilling thoughts and work"

    "Write on sites were very helpful in making progress on my thesis! The feedback we got on our in-class presentations has also been very useful in shaping my final presentation and plans for the essay. I think it would have been good to also get grades on each presentation, simply to have a concrete sense of how I was doing.",
    "This course prepares you well to present at the end of the semester and to write the senior essay.",
    "More structure around writing, not just presentation planning, could have been helpful!",
    "I think the strength and the weakness was how laid back the course was. It would have been too stressful to constantly be having writing deadlines, but I think a few would have been nice. Like for example if throughout the course it was required that we turn in like a couple pages of drafts to our advisor that I think would've helped to stay on track with actually writing early.",
    "Strengths: I'm very glad that the WGSS major has this class. It's amazing to hear about other people's senior projects and really bond as a WGSS class together. Weaknesses: While I'm glad the course exists, it really needs to be rethought. We spent weeks doing \"practice presentations\" that didn't really help me work on my thesis. They were supposed to prepare me for the final presentation, but I don't think it warranted the amount of class time we spent preparing. Also, this class needs to make us do more! It wasn't rigorous at all, and the lack of deadlines and actual progress check-ins meant that I spent 4 months pretending to work on my thesis, while actually just getting better at faking it when people asked about it. It was a huge waste of time. Please consider doing something more like the AFAM department, where you have to turn in actual pages of thesis writing. Now it's December and I've written zero pages! While this is obviously partially on me, Joe made it was too easy to just skate by.",
    "The strength of this course lies in the second half, when we prepare and deliver our oral presentations. However, the rest of the course seemed merely nominal. Since most of the work of the course is self-directed, I found I didnt keep to the schedule I set out for myself. Honestly, it would be much better to have hard deadlines for turning in certain amounts of pages, and more strenuous written check-ins, like what Af-Am does for its majors. This class has such potential to whip these theses into shape, and I just think its wasting that potential at the moment.",

    "If you're a senior major in WGSS, you will take this course in the fall to work on your thesis! The thesis is daunting but the colloquium will help you break it down into manageable chunks and prepare you for your final presentation. You can do it!",
    "Become a WGSS major and take this class :)",
    "Yes, although if you're a major you have to take it lol.",
    "Yes, well it's required for the WGSS major, but it's a good thing to have because a lot of majors don't offer guidance when writing the essay so this is really helpful.",
    "If you're a WGSS major you have to take this. It's a great opportunity to work out the details of your own project while hearing other students' projects develop alongside.",
    "If you are a WGSS senior, you are required to take this course. But you know you want to major in WGSS, so it's a moot point :)"
