   "comments": [
    "Astro 343 was a great class. You learn about three main areas in astronomy (exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology), all of which are very interesting. It is also nice to take a class in which the material is the subject of current research, rather than just stuff that was discovered a hundred years ago. Many of the concepts will stretch your sense of the world and physics in the universe. Professor Padmanabhan is great. Always very friendly and happy to meet with students outside of class to discuss the material or just to talk. The workload is not particularly intense. The problem sets are difficult and almost all required me to go to office hours, but after doing them I really felt like I understood the material better and it made the tests not bad at all. Problem sets also weren't every week, which was nice. Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in astronomy!",
    "Fantastic course. Great look at 3 very interesting astronomy topics. Great introduction to metrics in GR. The class is amazingly organized into 3 separate units. No complaints whatsoever.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in astronomy and the exotic features of our universe. I loved learning about extra-solar planets, general relativity, black holes, and cosmology. This class also gives a sense of what exciting research is currently being done, and there is so much science in this class that is still controversial, and theories that are not yet finished. It is an excellent exploration of topics in astrophysics and current research.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in physics and looking to explore astrophysics\/cosmology in a rigorous but manageable way. Prof. Padmanabhan was remarkably devoted to his class and was a clear lecturer.",
    "Disorganized course that require some very arbitrary problem solving, which can be frustrating at times. But that is to be expected since this is very new physics. But slightly lower stress since there are more tests and no final.",
    "Take this class! I always walked away from lecture with my mind blown. Space is cool, and you'll learn a lot about it. The problem sets were difficult, but the grading was not unreasonable. A very approachable introduction to three incredibly fulfilling topics.",
    "Great class. If you take it you will thank yourself. If you don't you'll never know what you missed out on.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 343. It is a fascinating introduction to cosmology and astrophysics and shows a lot of the diversity of modern physics. Be prepared to put in some work on the problem sets, but it is otherwise very doable and the exams are manageable.",
    "Good crash course on exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. Given the length of the term and the amount of material, you don't really get to explore the meanings of the equations you're given. It's kind of just like \"sup, use these equations.\" Exoplanets was the most grounded of the three, and we played around with observational data and fitting a lot. Black holes was more theoretical, with some observational aspects. Cosmology was almost entirely theoretical, and difficult to grasp conceptually. I could do the problem sets and get good scores on them with the equations we were provided, but at the end of the day I still can't claim to know what the equations exactly mean or why they work the way they do.The course is kind of pitched as a \"whats hot in astronomy\" class, almost to lure in potential astro majors. I wish they wouldn't do this though and just take more time to more fully explore fewer topics.",
    "Physics 343 is a wonderful class. Prof. Padmanabhan is an excellent lecturer. He's also very accessible, which is amazing for a teacher as capable as he. If you're interested in the material, it's a must-take.",
    "Fascinating course material, particularly in the cosmology section of the course. Not all that much work, definitely worth taking even for non-physics\/astro majors.",
    "Great class to learn about what's going on with astrophysics today and things that you can get involved in via research. Not too tough, either",
    "Absolutely take this class! It's the most fun I've had in physics so far. Black holes, habitable exoplanets, and the cosmic microwave background -- what more could you ask for in a course? Prof. Padmanabhan is a fantastic lecturer and very reasonable in his expectations. He is very committed and went way beyond the call of duty in terms of office hours, review sessions, etc. This course was a great intro to the technical aspects of astrophysics and cosmology because it went over the mathematical concepts involved without being overwhelming. Awesome course!",
    "Physics 343 is a fun course and you learn really interesting things. If you're an intensive physics major the physics\/math won't be too difficult but the later units are entirely different from what you've done before.",
    "Awesome class! Great introduction to the topics covered, appropriate pace, and really fantastic prof. If there was a textbook involved, it might be easier to study, but prof. Padmanabhan did his best given that restraint. I had a great time in this class -- best physics class taken to date!Prof. Padmanabhan is great! He did a wonderful job of structuring the class and keeping us on pace. He really encouraged questions, seemed to enjoy getting to know the students, and offered a lot of outside help (even offered research opportunities to the entire class). He sometimes got bogged down in other work and had to push back deadlines or needed to leave and have another prof guest lecture, but this almost never detracted from thequality of the class. I really enjoyed it!",
    "The course is an examination of three topics in astrophysics: exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. I would definitely recommend the course to other students. Speaking as a physics major, the course is not as technical as those on the main physics track, but the content is stuff that you generally won't encounter in other courses. As a result, I feel I learned a lot more here than in, say, Physics 260.",
    "Great class that covers a nice variety of interesting topics. Padmanabhan's got a good teaching style and his problem sets are very reasonable and quite interesting as well. If you work together with others, you'll find that you've learn a lot from the p-sets. Overall, take it if you're a physics major or if you've got an interest in the sciences."
