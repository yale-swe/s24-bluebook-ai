   "comments": [
    "How to write a philosophy paper, depth of analysis on philosophical topics, thematic breakdown of the history of WEstern thought.",
    "I learned how to analyze philosophical texts based on their arguments and how to converse about philosophy with my fellow classmates.",
    "In taking this course, I have developed a new way of thinking that was once foreign to me. It has encouraged me to be more inquisitive and critical of arguments presented in novels and in seminar settings, which in turn has made me further develop my own ideas in my writing assignments and class discussion.",
    "I learned to read a philosophical text and break down the authors arguments. I also learned to deconstruct philosophical arguments and propose counter arguments in paper format.",
    "I learned how to write a better Philosophy paper",
    "Formal analysis of philosophical texts, my last DS teacher wanted us to write with a lot more frills and less technicality. Also developed a very useful vocabulary for dealing with philosophical texts.",
    "I learned about what kind of questions more modern philosophers ask and try to answer compared with ancient philosophers. I also learned to write more nuanced, ambitious papers.",
    "Philosophy taught me to be analytical and logical about reading, which I had never done before. It also helped me in my other sections-- I started to think a lot about the way writers organized their works and their arguments. Writing my philosophy papers, where I had to be hyper-organized and clear, also helped my clarity in my other classes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Learning about philosophy is new for many students going into DS, which is why it's great that philosophy provides that foundation. That being said, there still needs to be a little more support in this area for students who are still very unfamiliar with the topic matter in second semester. It's a great class that's very informative, just maybe a little hard for students who haven't been exposed to the topic.",
    "This is a great class, but as philosophy isn't my best subject, I felt that at times the material was a bit difficult to grasp. My professors lectures helped me understand the material, but it was still difficult to keep up sometimes. I feel that we could have more inclusive class discussions that weren't just my professor lecturing but also involved discussion between students.",
    "I believe that the greatest flaw of this course lies within the rapid rate at which we study novels throughout the semester. However, this is also one of the defining strengths of the course, forcing students to direct their attention toward the most important details of each text we study. I believe that this could be improved by an evaluation of the number of texts the course covers, but at the same time, it is this challenge that forges greater critical thinking skills",
    "the amount of reading in the class an inability for the class to go into greater depth with each work is a weakness. I would prefer to have slightly more time on each author and gain better, more specific insight.",
    "Moves fast, which is both its strength and weakness.",
    "Sooner or later, a philosopher will pop up who people will take to because the DS course covers so much ground; Prof. Franks' amazingly genial attitude helps facilitate that connection.",
    "I think overall the syllabus is very strong and make a lot of sense. However, I think it would've made more sense to read some of DuBois in philosophy in addition to the DuBois we read in H&P during our Hegel week. There was only really one paragraph in Douglass that seemed to apply to our Hegel reading, whereas DuBois' double consciousness would've added much more to our understanding of how Hegel's Lordship and Bondage discussion of self-consciousness can be interpreted and applied.",
    "I am so happy with the inclusion of Anne Conway and Frederick Douglass, and I also enjoyed the Hegel. I think that Philosophy is hard to teach and hard to get the knack of, but the lectures were very helpful, and I had a great, clear, professor."

   "comments": [
    "While I have learned from this course and from the first semester of DS Philosophy that I am never going to take philosophy again, it was nonetheless a rewarding and challenging experience. Be prepared to be taken off guard with how intense the philosophic disciple is, especially if you are like me and have no other philosophy experience.",
    "Yes, this is a challenging course but I would recommend it to other students. I now feel like I have a grasp on philosophy and the major philosophers and I can see how the themes they discuss intersect and build upon one another.",
    "I would recommend this course, alongside the other two Directed Studies courses, only to students who have an interest in the western canon and who wish to vastly improve their critical thinking and writing skills. Though I ultimately intended to pursue a major in STEM, I saw these classes as a chance to see whether or not I would be interested in pursuing any majors related to Humanities. Though it has not changed my mind about what I want to pursue, I see them as worthwhile distributional requirements, ones in which students are given the opportunity to cover some of the most well-known texts in history. I have enjoyed challenging myself in these three courses, and I encourage all students, whether they are interested in Humanities or in Engineering, to consider taking Directed Studies.",
    "I would only recommend DS to a student who is fully committed to spending hours each day doing reading. The more time you put into the reading the more you will get out of it, so if you are unable to complete all reading to a certain level of detail, the class will not be as good as it could be.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Directed Studies to any student who enjoys writing.",
    "Definitely! These courses have left me feeling very confidant for sophomore year, even if I don't plan on taking any more philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this seminar because it is extremely helpful for understanding and analyzing the philosophical texts we read.",
    "Absolutely. I had no exposure whatsoever to philosophy before coming to Yale and probably never would have discovered my interest in it if it hadn't been for DS Philosophy. I didn't take DS for this track, but coming out of DS, Philosophy is the primary reason why I'm glad I did the program for both semesters. DS Philosophy offers an intro-level philosophy education that is not paralleled by the equivalent intro lectures in the department that non-DS freshmen interested in philosophy take. The professors are also very invested in teaching and eager to talk one on one.",
    "Yes, especially because it might be the only time you take philosophy, but it teaches you so much about history, culture, literature, religion, and politics. I think about these writers all the time, even though I don't want to pursue philosophy."
