   "comments": [
    "Be careful about taking this course..you might end up dropping it if you don't find the intellectual motivation to continue with it despite it's abstractness.",
    "It's a great class. The material is pretty dry if this isn't the type of thing you're interested in. I definitely wouldn't recommend this class as your first philosophy course or a way to knock off a distributional requirement, but if the topic is something you're interested in I couldn't recommend it more.",
    "A survey of some of the important philosophical texts in the philosophy of language, covering a broad range of different issuesThis class was amazing. I went in to the class not really sure how one could dedicate an entire philosophy class to language, thinking that language was simple enough. However, essay after essay pointed to ways in which common conceptions of the mechanics of language are completely inadequate and lead to contradictions. My conception of how language works has completely changed, and the insights I have gained into language I feel are very relevant to other areas of philosophy. Philosophy of language is especially important to understand if one wants to understand how philosophy has been done in the last one hundred years.Professor Whittle is a great lecturer. He provides handouts which cover all of the basic points, and explains everything in great detail (although I don't think just these could give someone a sufficient understanding of the material much of the time). In addition, he seems to take a great interest in his students, and always seems willing to go out of his way to help us individually.However, this class is very difficult. We cover a lof of diverse material, much of it very complex. If you don't keep up with readings, it can often feel like you are only getting a surface idea of what the philosophies are.That being said, grading wasn't that harsh. I often did better than I was expecting on assignments. Although I have a good amount of experience with philosophy, and perhaps someone who has taken less philosophy courses would have a different experience.",
    "This is a fun, engaging course; if you like logic and thinking about logical puzzles, I recommend the course. Prof. Whittle is a very clear lecturer and is great at responding to student questions. If Jonathan is the TF again in the future, that's good news too. The nice thing about Philosophy of Language (or at least the impression you get from this course) is that the authors are all actually in conversation with each other, so the course has real thematic consistency and you feel like you're really getting a sense for how philosophy is done.All the readings are summarized in the lectures, so you really don't have to do the readings unless the topic interests you. (Of course if you want to write a paper about one of them, you should read it.) I usually went to the lecture, and then decided whether I was interested enough in the topic to read the paper. I think it would be very boring to have done the reading before class, because Prof. Whittle doesn't really go as in depth as the paper does and you'll already have read everything he's about to say.",
    "I really liked the course. I took an interest in the material prior to taking the class and some might find the material dry. Definitely shop the course before taking it and maybe read one of the first readings (reading a single reading from the course will probably be representative in the relevant way of what it will be like). In general, small amount of reading, but readings can be tough, lectures are incredibly helpful and clear, and the assignments are: small paper small exam medium paper and final exam.",
    "Philosophy of Language is a deceptively challenging course. Since there are not many assignments, and the professor leads the lectures, there is no real incentive to keep up with the readings. Yet the midterm and final expose any lack of preparation, reading and engaging with the material, which often requires deep thought and a full commitment, is required to preform on the in-class exams. All in all, the class is very interesting and the material is compelling if you are interested in accounts of how the human language faculty functions in the domain of philosophical theory. I would recommend this class to Linguistics and Philosophy majors; prior experience reading philosophical texts was useful.",
    "I would advise caution in approaching this course. Language is really central to a lot of analytic philosophy, and the concepts in this class are very good to know, and central to the major. With that said, I certainly would not recommend it to someone not studying philosophy or linguistics. It's taught at quite a high level, and I felt as if even with a philosophy background, there were times when the readings were particularly dense and difficult. Professor Whittle was not the best lecturer, and it seemed like much of the class was confused a fair degree of the time. He could be fairly disorganized. With that said, taking the class may still be a good idea, particularly if taught by someone else. Certainly, the things taught in it are useful to know. However, the course requires a lot of patience, and should certainly not be taken as a first course in philosophy.",
    "I had enjoyed logic courses but did not enjoy the high flying overview that wasDS, and was disenchanted with philosophy but this course brought me back. The course is comprehensive, very clear and well structured. Definitely take it.",
    "A good introduction to analytic philosophy, if that's your thing. Whittle probably won't be teaching this again, but he's crisp and clear when explaining difficult logical concepts, so be aware that he'll be a good teacher for whatever sort of analytic\/logical classes he offers.As a note, I REALLY dislike analytic philosophy as a subject, and this course did not abate my disdain for its focus on seemingly-inane questions of no real-world import. Regardless, I still recognize that by objective standards this class was very well-taught and made complicated material accessible. If you want to get *excited* about analytic philosophy (perhaps because you have to do it to fulfill the philosophy major's M&E requirement), I might look elsewhere. But if you have to do analytic philosophy (perhaps for the M&E requirement) and there aren't any other good offerings this semester, you can take this class and learn a a lot of the greatest hits of 20th century analytic thought in an extremely clear and readily-followable way.",
    "this class is good only for those who are already interested in the subject (or at least think they might be interested). if you're not interested from the first few lectures, chances are, you won't be super interested throughout the semester.",
    "It is interesting. It is pretty refreshing for a philosophy class, as it is abstract, but still somewhat structured at the same time.",
    "Philosophy of Language gives you a good overview of the major topics in contemporary philosophy of language. It's fairly easy as the lectures are primarily just explanations of the arguments of the essays, so if you do the readings then there is not much extra information you have to absorb in the lectures (you could also just go to lectures and not do the readings and still sort of scrape by, though you wouldn't have the fullest understanding). Bruno is a great lecturer. He's not exactly exciting and entertaining, but he communicates very clearly and if you pay attention you will understand the material. He cares about students and answers questions well. And if Jonathan Vertanen is TF'ing the course again, he's great--very nice, knowledgeable, helpful."
