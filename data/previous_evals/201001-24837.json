    "Definitely. Unfortunately, Professor Hill will never teach this course again at Yale.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in modern Japanese fiction and film.",
    "Good survey course of modern Japan since the Meiji era. The approach of the class, which is to explore Japanese society through its changing space - both physical and social - should be interesting to even those already familiar with Japan. The readings can be a little long, but I never had a problem finishing them because they were so interesting. There are only two term papers, so work ahead if you're not comfortable with papers that are worth a good proportion of the grade."
