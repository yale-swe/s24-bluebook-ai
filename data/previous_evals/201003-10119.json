   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if you are interested in magazine writing or food in general. The reading list is FABULOUS and if you're into food writing, you will GO GAGA for the speakers Mei brings in. The people definitely make the class, though, so you'd be taking a chance. But really, if you get in the course of get put on the waitlist, its 100% NECESSARY that you at least shop the course. I've had great fun this semester, and it's a great college seminar because you definitely don't get something like this in any other regular yale department.",
    "Contemporary Food Writing is a great way to practice writing and learn what it takes to be a food writer in the real world. Mei is very helpful with edits and guidance in the writing assignments. There was a lot of reading, some of which was helpful in learning to write better and some of which wasn't, but it was all very enjoyable toread. The grading system of the class was strange, with some assignments worth a lot and others worth nothing at all. Overall, the class was very good and I recommend it.",
    "Yes! I would recommend it wholeheartedly.",
    "A good class, but it had a lot of reading, so be prepared for that. It also didn't to seem to be much of a writing course as opposed to a critical reading course about food writing.",
    "I had a really fun time doing the readings for this course. It gave me an opportunity to read the cookbooks and magazines I love for a class. But I don't think the class improved my writing that much. We wrote stand alone pieces that we didn't have time to edit, so it was hard to see progress. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I don't know how much I learned.",
    "This is a course in which you read a lot of food writing and learn to write pieces that involve food - everything from restaurant reviews to personal pieces, etc. The reading you do is fantastic - really good food writing - and Mei Chin's comments on your writing are useful and insightful. I do feel like I got a better sense of how to write about food from taking this class. My biggest problem with the class was the lack of clarity about expectations for the written assignments. I would recommend it, ultimately, to anyone interested not only in food, but also in learning more about how to write well. Though, definitely be interested in food - food knowledge is a huge plus in this class and you have to love food to write about it this much.",
    "A good course, make sure Mei spends time on the workshops, they're fun and really informative.",
    "Take this class if you have any kind of interest in food. You get to experience the food world from a number of different perspectives (you read about chefs, wannabe-chefs, food writers, and a number of guest speakers come in to talk about their various roles in the food world, too), and then you get to write about the food world too. The assignments can be what you make of them -- creative, journalistic, whatever, although most were memoir-bent. The reading load is pretty heavy, but good, and the writing assignments are fun. Also, Mei's great, and gives really good feedback."
