   "comments": [
    "This class helped me reinforce my calculus skills and also introduced me to some topics in multi-variable calculus and linear algebra. I also learned the different ways biological circumstance can be modeled by calculus.",
    "I learned how to evaluate challenging differential equations that model biological processes.",
    "I developed knowledge about differential equations and using calculus techniques in biology.",
    "My reading skills of scientific\/mathematic articles improved significantly, my understanding of mathematics deepened significantly, as I was truly learning math and the concepts behind it, rather than memorizing facts.",
    "Learned how mathematical models can apply to real-life situations, also learned differential equations",
    "instead of typical high school calculus, i learned the biological applications to models and series and how to apply calculus to assessing biological occurences",
    "I learned how to read research papers with differential equations. We also examined many mathematical models presented in the research papers read for class and examined how they worked. I learned many topics similar to those in math 115 but from a biological perspective with a focus on differential equations. At the end of the semester, we started the very beginning of multivariable calculus.",
    "I developed an understanding of how math could be applied to biology through the extensive work we did with differential equations and analyzing readings that were connected to the mathematics skills we were practicing in class.",
    "This class showed me why mathematical methods I never understood before make sense and how they can be applied to the real world. My critical thinking skills improved in this course more than any other I took this semester.",
    "I started thinking about mathematics in a different way. This class developed my abstract understanding of the math we did as well as the real-life interpretations and reasoning skills necessary to apply them to different contexts. I feel like I finished this class with a new appreciation for both math and the biological sciences.",
    "A nice review of Calc II topics (which are extremely important in all kinds of applied math fields), and an extremely useful grounding in diff eqs (including some linear algebra and multivariable calculus).",
    "I learned how to model biological systems using calculus, and interpret these models from various scientific papers.",
    "I learned all of BC calculus, linear algebra, and some multivariable calculus while fighting my way through my last math course at Yale. I learned how to problem solve somewhat on my own, as there was a lot of help from our TA along the way, but I made it through and enjoyed the material.",
    "I developed skills in critical thinking and solving complex math problems. I especially developed skills in analyzing new types of problems and applying the skills that we learned in class to new questions. I also learned how to work with other students and be persistent in solving challenging problems!",
    "I learned a lot about applications of complex math principles that made them seem relevant and useful in the context of biological modeling. I thought this was incredibly valuable because even though most concepts were familiar, this class was able to ground math in reality.",
    "I learned how to think across multiple subjects by understanding scientific concepts through mathematical equations. It taught me how to approach math conceptually rather than simply analytically.",
    "I learned how to problem solve. This course was very different (as expected) from my high school math courses, where all of the homework assignments were cookie cutter problems. This class forced me to think harder and deeper.",
    "Applied math for biology.",
    "Everything Math 115 covers, but with some 120 concepts added on like eigenvalues.",
    "I learned how to read, understand, and evaluate the math that goes into scientific research and the writing of a scientific paper, which I think will be extremely valuable in the future, especially if I choose to pursue research.",
    "Calc 2 knowledge and in depth understanding of differential equations. Felt like much deeper than a regular calc 2 class which is focused on mostly integration and series.",
    "Reading scientific papers, translating complicated ideas into mathematics, solving differential equations with very little information",
    "I developed the ability to understand and learn how to apply biological mathematical models through this course.",
    "Learned how to read scientific papers clearly while learning mathematical modeling concepts at the same time.",
    "Series, Taylor Polynomials, Integration and Linear Algebra were taught in this course but through a biological lens i.e. analyzing a population. You also read a paper almost every week that uses these concepts.",
    "This class focused heavily on the different methods to solve autonomous differential equations. The course definitely improved my ability and stamina to look at and manipulate math problems, as the solutions to many of the questions (especially those on p-sets) were nowhere close to being obvious upon first glance.",
    "I learned how to effectively employ calculus in biological terms. This allowed me to understand calculus in greater depth than ever before.",
    "I am definitely more comfortable reading academic papers and the math they use.",
    "Both familiarity with the calculus skills, including but not limited to, series, approximation, differential equations, linear algebra, and phase planes, and experience with the numerous ways these are incorporated into real biological research.",
    "I learned to solve differential equations.",
    "I learned how to apply calculus 2 and more advanced skills to the study of biological mechanisms",
    "The course provides a good overview of math 115 with a biological lens. The course also looks at a number of differential equations and their application to population models, viral infection, etc.",
    "I learned more applicable ways of thinking about math. Although the material was really difficult I felt more motivated to learn it because, unlike in other math classes Ive taken, I saw how the things I learned could be used in real life.",
    "I was exposed to various scholarly articles, and I gained an understanding of common mathematical models used in biology (such as the SIR model). I learned how to go through a previously daunting scholarly article piece by piece in order to connect it with the concepts discussed during lecture. I also, in a sense, gained perseverance. For example, I had to take the integration gateway multiple times to pass it. Every time I did not pass provided me with an opportunity to reflect on my study habits and consider ways in which I could better prepare. More specifically, some topics covered in Math 116 included autonomous differential equations, error bounds, logistic models, geometric and power series, and an introduction to linear algebra.",
    "Should return midterm before withdrawal deadline... not a few hours after the deadline",
    "I developed skills in solving differential equations, with series, and with multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned how to manage my time and how to schedule in office hours. I also began to learn how math is taught at Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was able to effectively combine and analyze the intersection between biology and mathematics and provided a very interesting take on calculus. One difficult aspect was that the topics taught are often taught in a different way than a traditional math class since it does explore how math can model life so without a concrete \"textbook,\" it was difficult at times to follow and fully understand the concepts.",
    "Strengths: John Hall (awesome math teacher who truly cares about his students), much better alternative to Math 115 because it's not just a boring review of BC calc, great TA with great awesome office hours to help tackle the psets, getting a whole new perspective on math that's unlike any other math class you've probably taken, the class notes posted after every class help you grasp the new topics Weaknesses: 9am class",
    "Strengths are the online notes that are posted for each lecture, but weaknesses are that certain topics are covered very fast assuming prior experience.",
    "This course truly only has strengths. You will learn so much about math and the ways that math can truly be applied to the real world for likely the first time. The only downside is that Professor Hall makes the problem sets really difficult, but that is only because he wants students to reach out and he is so accessible to that.",
    "Strengths: forces students to think about how math applies to the real world, class is well-taught Weaknesses: I thought the class was great, but I do think it should be made clear that the class is VERY different from 115, not just because of biological applications, but also because of the difficulty of the material, the emphasis on differential equations, and the incorporation of topics from multivariable calc and linear algebra",
    "strength- course notes were uploaded, lots of office hours, offered extra credit weakness- not everything was explained thoroughly, psets were long and got complicated",
    "I wished the lectures were recorded.",
    "The class is extremely interesting and shows you how math can be applicable to the real world and various phenomena like population dynamics and epidemic diseases. This class is also well-taught by Prof. Hall and has an amazing peer tutor (Nasser) that both go out of their way to make sure you succeed. The only weakness I feel was that sometimes the readings were somewhat difficult to understand to the point of where I stopped reading them and just got the main ideas from professor Hall's course notes and lecture.",
    "There were no weaknesses. The strengths were that the professor was always available for office hours, even on the weekends, and the peer tutor was super accessible and the most helpful peer tutor I can imagine.",
    "As I said above, this is an extremely engaging course that allows students to approach math in a different and useful way. However, this is not a course for people that are not yet comfortable with integrals. I don't think that Prof. Hall should spend more time on this topic (as it would detract from the most important parts of the course), but he should be more transparent about the fact that approximately 20 minutes of class time were devoted to teaching the basics of integration, which is not enough for someone that has never seen that before. If you do have that background, however, the course is amazing.",
    "There are no weaknesses. Everything about this course is fantastic.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and the topics covered. Even though I've taken calculus before, I enjoyed how I could use these concepts and apply them to modeling situations. I thought that perhaps the psets were not very representative of the level of material covered in class, however, thanks to Nasser's peer tutor hours, they were manageable.",
    "This course is fun and enjoyable, but there are some major flaws. First, there is no textbook, so each student is reliant on their notes only for the course. Online assistance is not an option, and office hours seem like they are for too specific questions from students who understand the material rather than extra help overall. Secondly, I was a student who took AB calculus in high school who received a 3 on the AP examination. I placed into Math 116 after taking the placement test. Unfortunately, it was already 2 months into the class when I realized nearly everyone in the course has taken BC calculus in high school or higher before Math 116, and they were reviewing material while I was learning it for the first time. I even talked to one student who said she took BC calc in her junior year of high school and proceeded to take multivariable and linear algebra senior year. It makes no sense to me how we would be placed in the same math class, which made the extensive problem sets and hard lectures discouraging from engaging with.",
    "I wish that the course utilized a textbook so that there were other situations in which we could see the same material being explained, and I wish that the Psets were either shorter or there were less of them. As a result of them being very time-consuming, I felt like my engagement with the types of problems on the Pset were less than they might have been if there were fewer problems or more time to work on the Psets after we learned the relevant material in class.",
    "I liked this class a lot overall and the only weakness is that more feedback on homework should be given.",
    "No formula in this course went unexplained. I felt that I understood everything building off of core concepts. One weakness of this course was that I often felt like things showed up on problem sets that had not been explained in lecture making it difficult to complete homework on my own.",
    "The professor makes a genuine effort to connect with his students and cares about them. However, this course is not at the level of math 115. I have friends in linear algebra or differential equations who said they were going over some of the same topics as I was.",
    "Strong lectures, very helpful office hours. Personally I felt student engagement with each other was low.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely John Hall. I think the major weakness with he course is the lack of practice problems\/resources since there's no textbook or guide to really refer to. However, John Hall makes himself very available for help.",
    "The readings are great, but the knowledge there isnt always applied to our overall understanding of calc 2 materials and differential equations. They are complicated readings, so come finals time, it seemed like we had to try a lot more to understand them than the actual material in the class to be prepared for the final. strengths are the professor and how great of a teacher and instructor he is. makes the class and information much easier to dissolve.",
    "Strengths: Very fluid, well structured in my opinion Weaknesses:",
    "The strengths of this course were the resources of ample office hours and course notes. A smaller class size would have helped me engage a little more.",
    "Great course to teach students the immediate applications of the math that they are learning. Hard to find any weaknesses with the course.",
    "Strengths: the material is definitely more interesting in an applied lens and the peer tutoring + office hours are very helpful Weaknesses: sometimes the feedback for what you got wrong on the homework wasn't really explained",
    "Strengths: Prof. John Hall is a great professor and definitely someone who you can come to if you need help. His class instruction is generally very clear, and if you ever have any questions he has no problem stopping to answer them or go over a step in a problem that may be confusing. Even though this was a medium-sized lecture class of about 60 people, Prof. Hall knew everyone by name. Office hour opportunities were extremely generous, with offerings every day of the week and even some by video call! Peer tutor office hours were a must! Nasser was absolutely amazing and going to his office hours helped me realize things I didn't know that I didn't know. Weakness: I think that when learning some of the new concepts, it would have been beneficial to have more practice problems utilizing the basic underlying concepts before moving on to explore advanced applications and anomalies within the same concept. This format was followed in the last few p-sets and I think most people found it beneficial to have this extra practice to ensure that the basic concepts were understood. I wouldn't have minded a slightly longer p-set, with 2-3 simpler problems at the beginning in addition to the ones already included.",
    "More time should be spent in class teaching the mathematic concepts rather than the biological concepts.",
    "The course was very good at leading from how a given model works to how it can be incorporated to describe a real world subject, but there's not much background provided on how the math was developed and what it was intended to describe. I feel like that's an important component so a student knows \"what they're doing\" with the mathematical representation before applying it elsewhere.",
    "The course content was very interesting and it was interesting how it was applicable to many aspects of biology.",
    "The models were explained quickly with little review until exam time. This could be improved for better understanding. Strengths were the explanation of the value of the math skills we were learning. Everything felt applicable.",
    "The course is well taught by Dr. Hall and the range of office hours makes succeeding in the course more accessible. The only weakness of the course was that the psets sometimes contained problems that couldn't really be solved by anyone except the teaching assistant.",
    "One strength of this course is its organization. Professor Hall provides students with ample practice exams and challenges students to complete warm-up problems. However, the problem sets are perhaps overly extensive. They are designed to challenge students beyond what is taught in class, but most students rely heavily on the peer tutor in order to understand the concepts that Professor Hall is trying to get across. Though I believe it is necessary to have challenging problem sets, these problem sets often extend far past what is expected in exams. That being said, Professor Hall understands how time-consuming his problem sets are, and he gives them more weight to a students overall grade (rather than having exams dominate the grade) in order to account for this. He also offers some bonus opportunities. In addition, I found that a lot of the material on the final was review from the midterm. I felt that the concepts of the course could have been spaced out a little bit better so that not as much material was rushed in the first half of the course.",
    "I really wish the course was taught better. I believe the material, while hard, needed to be better explained because I found it difficult to follow in class. I do not think we were given enough understandable information as a background to the material we were taught in class. Professor Hall is very smart, but he is a very fast talker and talks way over our heads."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "While this is a difficult course, it is also highly rewarding in how the topics offer a different take on conventional calculus. If you are a student who has already taken a BC calculus course in high school, but would like more review, this is a highly recommended option since not only do you review calculus techniques, but you also get to learn completely new material.",
    "You're probably choosing between 115 and 116 and I would 100% recommend this class because of the amazing professor (it's very hit or miss for 115), learning about new topics in math that aren't just boring derivatives, and the psets are 100% manageable if you just go to office hours.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! John Hall is so kind and approachable, making math a much less daunting subject. In this class, the emphasis is NOT on memorization, but rather comprehension, understanding, and growth. I'm so grateful that this class exists and I can't wait for MATH121 in the spring because Hall is truly a wonderful teacher. MATH116 is a great course that covers broad ranging material and utilizes it to understand biological systems. It incorporates differential equations and multivariable calculus to expand knowledge in terms of biology. I would recommend. John Hall wants his students to succeed and it is evident through this class.",
    "Yes, definitely! I think it really helped me gain a better understanding and appreciation of math\/calculus.",
    "it was alright",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for other students. I believe this class is intellectually more challenging than Math 115 because students learn many new topics including differential equations not covered in normal classes. Because it is a self-designed class by my professor John Hall, it is not possible to look answers up or find other ways for help individually. This class truly forces students to seek help from the professor or TF if so needed.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting look at how math is used in biology and I think is more enjoyable than the alternative\/traditional Math 115.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if they are interested in healthcare or medicine. The class provided me with new ways of thinking about the math that I had never been exposed to before.",
    "If you are comfortable with integrals and interested on thinking about applied math, yes!",
    "Absolutely. John Hall is the best math teacher you'll ever have; he's brilliant, clear, dedicated, kind, patient, etc. etc. He'll do anything to make sure you understand what he's teaching. If I could have him teach my entire Yale education, I would. In fact, if he was teaching more advanced classes, I'd definitely take more advanced classes. For some people with not-so-great math backgrounds, it's possible that the material in this class could be tough; go talk to Prof Hall. His specialty is students with not-so-great backgrounds in math, and he'll sort things out. For people like me who were already comfortable with Calc. II, but who either want a review or want to take things slowly for other reasons, you'll still get an enormous amount out of this class that you didn't\/won't get in other Calc. II courses. I truly cannot recommend John Hall enough.",
    "If you're interested in only learning calculus, this class is definitely not for you. However, if you think you have an understanding of calculus, and want to learn how to apply these concepts to real-life biological situations, then you should think about taking this class. It isn't easy, but if you put in a little extra time outside of class to really understand the material, then it isn't bad. Professor Hall is an extremely fair professor, and he is probably one of the few professors at Yale that will truly try his best to help you understand the material. One note is that sometimes his lectures are fast-paced, and the readings can be complicated, so if you do take this class, I would recommend not trying to just simply memorize the concepts; make sure that you actually sit down and internalize the material. That will help you a LOT on the psets and tests.",
    "Unfortunately, while I did enjoy this course as a whole, I would probably recommend this course to only pre-med students or biology majors. The readings for these regions of study were interesting but at the same time, someone should probably not take this course while also taking multiple other stem classes, as it is a high workload.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to develop their mathematical thinking skills as they relate to biology; however, I would recommend that students make sure they have enough time in their schedule, as the workload for this course is heavy.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in biology and math. It gave me a new perspective on how math relates to science and it was cool!",
    "Yes! It makes math much more interesting than bare numbers. It makes math seem meaningful and helps you to see its real life applications.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in math. It is NOT an easier course than math 115 if that is why you are taking it.",
    "Yes! But it is a challenging class.",
    "Some of the biology applications and the papers are interesting, but Math 115 will get you the same material but with less work.",
    "I would recommend this course only if the student is willing to make it their priority and is certain they will pursue research and\/or medicine in the future. It is not a class that you will do well in if you do not dedicate a lot of time to learning the material outside of the classroom.",
    "Definitely. I wish i had studied more for the exams, but Dr. Hall is great and you will learn a lot. It helps you with a strong base in calculus and you learn a lot. Take this is you want a challenge - it not as simple as Math 115. PSETS are hard but rewarding.",
    "Yes, especially if theyre considering any sort of applied math background",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that truly is interested in applying math to biosciences.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, absolutely fantastic professor and very fun if you like science.",
    "Yes. definitely take this course over 115. It's more interesting and probably easier. But I think you're better off if you've already taken Calc BC in high school before take this course because the pure mathematics will be easier to pick up",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially someone who is pre-med, interested in MCDB, or just wants to learn more about using calculus for biological modeling. This class will no doubt be a challenge, but it is definitely possible. Coming from someone who did not take BC Calculus or specialized courses in advanced math in high school, this class is doableespecially if you take advantage of the office hour opportunities.",
    "Yes. It allows students to understand why calculus is important rather than just mindlessly solving equations that arent relevant in real life.",
    "Yes, for those intending to major in biology this is a great course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, even to students who aren't biology-focused. I greatly appreciated what seemed like a \"real-world\" use of calculus, which deepened the retention of the skills.",
    "yes. better than most math classes, but harder",
    "Yes! I enjoyed it very much and even though I knew some of the math already, I learned so much more!",
    "Yes I would recommend this to any pre-med student looking to fulfill a math requirement. Dr. Hall is very nice and willing to help you learn, doing well in the course is just a matter of staying on top of the psets and using the resources provided.",
    "I would. Its not easy but the professor is so willing to help you learn and its a really good chance to take a difficult class without feeling like youre on your own.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I personally did not have any experience working with scholarly articles that included differential equations before taking this course, and I found Professor Halls discussion of such articles throughout this course to be really enlightening. This course does seem to be more challenging than a Math 115 course given its uniqueness, but I feel as though its connection with real-life mathematics (for example, the mathematics behind HIV rates of infection) succeeds in better preparing pre-med students for concepts that they will encounter in future courses. That being said, if a student has no interest in biology, it would most likely be less time-consuming to take a Math 115 course instead.",
    "I would recommend this course because the readings were very interesting and well explained by Prof. Hall, and my knowledge of single and multivariable calculus improved greatly over the course of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this a student with a strong Calc 2 background or as a serious challenge to anyone to whom calc comes easily."
