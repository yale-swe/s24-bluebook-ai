   "comments": [
    "Take 160 if you are comfortable with your knowledge of French grammar, as this will not change much throughout the year. Your speaking skills, on the other hand, will pick up just a few weeks into the semester. The course covers a lot of important and very interesting current issues in France (ex: immigration, education), and some that are just fun (film, my section did French political rap). There are lots of grades to feed into the final, so not too much pressure on any one assignment. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think I learned a lot, and would have learned more if I had been able to put more work into it.",
    "French 160 is a great class in which you learn a huge amount about culture, politics and current issues in France.It is, however, a lot of work for a \"culture&conversation\" class. Be prepared to write about two 400-word essays about difficult topics every week and to do a lot of memorizing for the written tests. The test format is really horrible: you'll have to memorize a good amount of really specific vocabulary about some specific topic and then you'll have to write two essays using at least 40 words of the vocabulary you memorized before.Take it if you really want to be able to talk about important stuff in French and you'll get a lot out of it. Just please don't take it as a 5th class as I did...",
    "In French 160 you learn all about various (and sometimes unrelated) aspects of French culture. Some of them I enjoyed more than others-- i.e. French rap vs. the extremely complicated French political system. You definitely get to practice your French a lot, through class discussions and small presentations. There is a lot of busywork in this class though, and a lot of it seems trivial and unrelated to the course overall. That being said, none of it is too difficult, and the class in general is not too hard. The tests are a pain-- you have to memorize 40 vocab terms and come up withthem on the spot, in responding to essay prompts. But again, very doable, just not that stimulating. Some things I particularly liked about the class were the occasional visits to the Art Gallery, and the fact that we got to watch 6 movies for homework. It was also nice not to have a written final exam, but only a final oral.",
    "This is an interesting course, which addresses many aspects of French culture, politics, and society. For example, issues of immigration, gender politics, religion, the workplace, heath care, and education. It also lends significant focus to other Francophone countries and their identity. Assignments include short writing responses, written exams for which you have to memorize vocabulary, and oral exams. I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in gaining a more complete understanding of modern France and Francophone countries while also improving your spoken and written French.",
    "Take it if you are really interested in French culture. But if you are looking for an easy French course, don't.",
    "I would recommend it to improve conservationist French skills"
