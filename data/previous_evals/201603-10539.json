   "comments": [
    "I learned how to break down, reconstruct, and grapple with difficult classical philosophical concepts. It was an excellent foundational course in Philosophy.",
    "I came into this course not knowing what to expect. Philosophy seemed like a difficult, daunting subject to me. Through the course, though, I actually learned so much about philosophy, and ended up really liking the subject. I learned so much about Plato, Aristotle, and countless other philosophers' work, and I'm coming out of this course feeling powerful and like I can take on any philosopher's work (whether or not this is true!). This class taught me how to read a lot and reconstruct a philosophical argument.",
    "Given that I had never taken a philosophy course before, I learned about the arguments set forth by different groups of philosophers. Skills-wise, I think this course was a good exercise in creative thinking, argument formation, and argument rebuttal. Besides the amount of effort put in to understand different philosophers' arguments, often written in difficult to comprehend text, reconstructing that argument charitably and poking holes in it allowed me to exercise critical thinking outside of simply learning the content.",
    "I learned a new style of writing, and a logical way to construct arguments in a very bare-bones fashion, which was different from the writing I was used to doing.",
    "DS Philosophy taught me to ask the big questions. It also taught me that there really aren't answers to these big questions.",
    "This is an in-depth introduction to ancient and medieval philosophy. I learned of the trends and topics of philosophical ideas. I also learned to reconstruct philosophical arguments and to critique them. Most importantly, I learned to argue amicably with peers about really fundamental topics.",
    "I think I improved in my ability to dissect and understand the works we were reading. Although this was easier to do in class, I think I also improved at doing this on my own. I also learned what is expected of a philosophy essay.",
    "I developed the ability to critically dissect arguments and evaluate their validity and soundness.",
    "During this course, I learned how a variety of philosophers and their accounts of life, soul, happiness, God, etc. More importantly, however, I developed skills in how to write critically, clearly, and succinctly.",
    "Being able to read a text that at first seems incomprehensible, but focusing in on some key segments to understand the bigger picture of the work. I also learned how to construct a philosophical argument and begin to consider my own views on some philosophical arguments.",
    "This course was the first philosophy class I had ever taken, and this course gave me a good foundation in philosophy writing and discussion, and what to look for in the texts.",
    "I learned rigorous analysis of philosophical arguments and logic. having never taken a course directly in philosophy, this course was excellent because it introduced me to the philosophy class, the style of philosophical argument, and the approaches one must take to analyzing such arguments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was all strength, mostly because of Professor Miller (who requested we call him Tom), but the philosophy track in general felt particularly strong.",
    "I think because the subject is a bit foreign to most students who don't come to class knowing how to reconstruct a philosophical argument, this is an initially difficult course. I think that sometimes it was difficult to incorporate all students' voices into class discussions everyday because of the varied educational backgrounds of students. Still, overall, this course is wonderful. Despite initial challenges, it's really an enriching intellectual experience. Being able to talk with classmates about things that seem so far away--the nature of death, or our souls--is a simultaneously strange and transcendent experience.",
    "DS Philosophy is a good introduction to philosophy for anyone who has never had exposure to it. It is a good way to cover many texts and know the differences and positions of different philosophers. Again, the strengths and weaknesses of any DS course really depend upon the section professor and participants. Some of the lectures were not as engaging and became drowned out in technicalities rather than understanding the scope of the larger argument and its relationships to earlier and later philosophers. Overall, I also believe that DS Philosophy could be more tied in to the real world. What are applications of these kinds of thought beyond the realm of philosophy? Why are they important? What did they become the basis for? Why does philosophy even matter? I feel like DS Philosophy assumes that you are interested in and have already assigned a high value to philosophy without explaining it.",
    "Practicality of this course could be reinforced throughout the semester.",
    "I think this course does a good job of introducing students to a large amount of western philosophy in a short amount of time. I also think it is a good introduction into how to understand philosophical thought. I do think it moved too quickly through the material though.",
    "Too much regurgitation instead of analysis of evaluation of philosophers works.",
    "The strength of this course was the layout of the classroom - a seminar completely open to discussion, not requiring any hand-raising or forced artificial conversations. The only weakness I can think of is the difficulty of the material, which is completely subjective.",
    "I really enjoyed section seminars as a time to discuss each work closely and focus on the main ideas for each author. It would be nice to have spent a little more time on the last third of the class (Epicureans, stoics, and Arabic philosophers) because I feel like I could have benefitted from another class discussing those authors since a lot of their works are very hard to understand.",
    "This course gives a good foundation in philosophy and how to write and talk about philosophy. Sometimes that reading assignments were longer than we had time to discuss in class, but the lectures were always very helpful in covering the texts.",
    "The course has a wonderful syllabus and benefits greatly from its range of authors and schools of philosophical thought."

    "Yes. It was excellent.",
    "If you are up for the challenge, definitely take this course! You'll learn so much and feel so powerful at the end.",
    "DS philosophy with Tom Miller was a good class, although not the best. Miller is clearly a very intelligent person, and he will amaze you with his knowledge of what the greek\/latin\/original version of each philosopher's work is. It is not a bad section to be in, although not the most amazing. If you are considering whether or not to do Directed Studies as a whole, that's a different story. If you are a fan of the classics and humanities, then this program is definitely for you. If not...it's a little more difficult to say. The structure of the program (you have to take all 3 classes at once) meant that while I loved my literature section, I grew to dislike DS as a whole. As a first-gen student, I found this a difficult program to get a grasp of in comparison with classmates from boarding schools who had a) learned the material already, b) also knew a range of classics languages, and c) learned in this format throughout high school. The classes often feel divorced from reality and have a definite \"ivory tower\" feeling, especially if your section is filled with other students who have little real-life worries. There is little guide about what an exemplary DS essay should address\/look like, and each professor has their own grading leniency\/standards, so that the same essay would probably receive a variance of grades amongst DS professors who have no similar standards. The balance of the program prefers breadth (reading lots of works) over depth (going into some works more deeply). There is a culture around celebrating DS as a prestigious program, and pressure to do it if accepted because there's simply \"nothing like it.\" That is not exactly true, and I would encourage a freshman with interests in other places to explore them. There's also this pull towards DS because you have 3\/4 of your freshman credits pre-determined for you and don't have to enter the hectic blue-booking fray. You only have 36 credits at Yale! Spending 6 of them on DS is a huge investment. Decide wisely.",
    "I felt that we spent too much of the semester focusing on only Plato and Aristotle, and had to breeze through whole philosophical movements that came later. I got bored of Aristotle, and wished we could've learned more equally about other philosophers.",
    "Professor Miller is good. I think his comments on writing could be a bit more helpful.",
    "Taking DS is one of the best decisions of my life. It's such a pleasure and privilege to get to appreciate Plato and Aristotle with similarly minded peers my first semester at Yale. Professor Miller is just the right balance of high seriousness and humor. He is so passionate and knowledgable about these philosophers. Take DS phil with him!",
    "Although this course was challenging, it was very interesting and really rewarding to be able to see my own progress at understanding the texts we were reading.",
    "Yes, although the grading can be rough.",
    "I definitely would (I mean one would have to if doing DS).",
    "DS is a great program if you really want to read these classic texts. I would recommend DS if you are interested in getting a solid background in the classics, even if you do not plan on continuing with humanities in the future. It is ALOT of reading, but it is manageable, and the consistent paper schedule with no midterms is a nice way to have a balanced schedule with a workload that for the most part is evenly spread throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the background it provides through the texts we read and the assignments and discussions we had will help me when reading other things.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all DS students. The range of philosophical arguments is vast and wonderful. Tracking the trends in philosophical arguments over time felt very rewarding, and learning the style of philosophical reconstruction and argumentation was invaluable."
