    "This course is really what you make of it. If you put in the work ahead of time to find a practicum site that matches well with your interests, it can be a great experience.",

    "INcredibly useful course- Elaine is very helpful and I had a great practicum site. It's a lot of work though - around 8-10 hours per week - for just one credit.",
    "Very independent course to work on your own.",
    "Over all the practicum experience was an eye opener and certainly an enriching learning experience. The learning curve was huge and I truly felt enlightened by the experience. A very well organized course with a lot of flexibility with timings. Getting an opportunity to travel, visit other health care centers in the state and meeting other caregivers and seeing their systems was exciting and truly educational. It also helped me implement that knowledge to NHHD.",

    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0Elaine is always quick to provide helpful feedback. You can tell she wants her students to get a lot out of this experience, and she encourages us to think deeply about how the work we do at our site applies to other situations.",
    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0Goood!",
    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0very supportive",
    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0Very helpful - course has very practical requirements. Nothing we needed to do for the practicum was a waste of time. Great to only have a few in class sessions so that we can spend our time at the sites. Great willingness to help place us.",
    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0Quick and sensitive to student's questions or request. It was great to work with her.",
    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0Elaine has been an outstanding instructor: extremely organized, very systematic, very knowledgeable, able to answer questions so effectively, always makes the student feel important, always responding to emails, always guiding and helping. Very involved, and helpful. She has the ability to steer the students to the right direction. Very flexible with work load and hours. And a great personality. Truly appreciate her input, efforts and pleasure taking this course.",

    "Great course for anyone looking to get more experience in public health practice. YSPH tends to be very research-focused, so it's nice to have a course that encourages us to be \"in the field\" and see first-hand how the public health concepts we learn about in class are applied in \"real life.\"",
    "Goooooooooooood!",
    "A lot of work, but great opportunity for practical experience. Can establish great connections. It would be nice if it were 2 credits.",
    "I would recommend the course to all who are interested in public health projects and you'll get almost an internship experience.",
    "This is a course that gives you the opportunity to learn in whatever field YOU want to work in. Gives you a chance to work in the community and have the practical experience of what we read in theory. The application and working in the field is certainly different than just reading about it. Plus there is constant guidance, help, and assistance from the instructor. Very well organized. A great learning experience as you get to learn about so many other projects by the other students who are all working on various subjects. Certainly recommended."
