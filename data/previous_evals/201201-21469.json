    "A solid course on health in conflict settings. I love Professor Panter-Brick, but the class felt a little random at times. It definitely isn't a course where each week builds off the last. I did learn a good amount in the class, but I don't know if it was the best choice in classes for me.",
    "This course introduces students to the emerging concept of resilience. Resilience tries to explain how people bounce back from adversity. The course looks at how violence and conflict facilitate or hinder resilience in postconflict societies. Much of her work has been conducted in Afghanistan, but Professor Panter-Brick is fairly knowledgeable on a range of world regions. If not, she knows the people who are. Phenomenal course. If you can get in, take it take it take it. I'd take it again if I could just to be in class with her again.",
    "I would recommend it, as you study a particular subject (rather than just \"Global Health\") and are exposed to many case studies.",
    "A great survey of conflicts and their mental health repercussions. From political violence to interpersonal violence and beyond this seminar covers a variety of topics while providing insights into the programming of interventions.",
    "This is one of the few seminars I have taken at Yale and the experience was just wonderful. A lot of classes are anonymous with hundreds of people and sections which are discursive but not satisfying. I love the topic of resilience and global health in the context of poverty and violence, and there is no better format to discuss it than in a small seminar like this. I feel like I got so much from this class, and being able to take it with a teacher like Professor Panter-Brick was incredibly rewarding. Not only for global affairs majors - this class was an excellent supplement for people in a huge variety of fields. The knowledge will absolutely stick with me for the rest of my educational career and beyond.",
    "Yes, take it! It was great!",
    "Certainly one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It has completely reorganized the way I think about public health and medical anthropology. Prof Panter Brick is extremely dedicated and great at leading the seminar so that it is most educational for all students.",
    "This course has helped me think about public health issues in a framework of resilience and multi-level interventions. I enjoyed every discussion; it was a pleasure to be surrounded by students that were thinking critically about these issues.Strengths: Open, laid-back environment, encouraging participation and engagement in the seminar; the students in her class meet with her frequently to discuss the public health issues we learn about in the classWeaknesses: It might be too student-driven at times. The readings are fantastic, but I wish I had heard more from Panter-Brick during class. There are sometimes lulls in the conversation; I would have preferred more in-class interactive activities, debates, etcThe very subject is very wishy washy. You learn about how to make public health interventions more culturally-compelling, but do not learn how to pitch this or how to practically make these things possible."
