   "comments": [
    "This class was good due to its low workload and straightforward material. However, I would not take it if I did not have to.",
    "205L is the introductory physics lab. It is a good introduction to many topics in physics and statistical analyses.",
    "Take it only if you need it.",
    "You kind of need to take this for a physics or engineering major. Basically, read the handouts thoroughly before the lab, but also find someone who's taken the class before and have them explain briefly how to do the labs, because the handouts are in general poorly written.",
    "PHYS 205L is pretty manageable! There aren't any lab write-ups to do during the rest of the week because the labs submitted are in-class only. Prepare yourself by knowing the manual well in and out, and you will be fine.",
    "As I said in my evaluation: 205 is a class that took me a lot more time than 0.5 credit is supposed to take. However, the reports are done in class, even though you have short p-sets for the first 4 classes, quizzes and hand-outs to read. As a suggestion, prepare spreadsheets on excel before the classes, because it might help saving a lot of time. Doing the reports in class is annoying because of the pressure. I was lucky that my TA and my professor (Salvatore and Prof. Zeller) were really helpful whenever I had a doubt and the environment with them and my classmates was really enjoyable. So even with the lab being so annoying, it wasn't that of a painful experience because of the environment the Professor, the TA and the rest of the students created. The theoretical final is kind of annoying, but just go over the p-sets that you'll be fine. As for the experimental part, it's super easy! So don't worry.",
    "It's a lab course that covers a bunch of different subjects including error analysis and some statistics.",
    "Take 165 if it's an option. 205 is pretty dreadful. Although there's not much outside work it's not worth it. I don't really feel that I got much out of the course.",
    "Somewhat of a pain, but not too much of a time commitment. If you have to take it, it's bearable but not fun.",
    "Basic introductory physics lab. The most important thing you learn all semester is how to use the oscilloscope. If you've had previous lab experience stuff can get very tedious. If you need to take the course take it. Otherwise you'll probably be better off without taking a lab. The work is easy but boring. If you get a good TA, like I did, the class can be more enjoyable, otherwise it will be a drag.",
    "Pretty easy (but varies depending on your TA). It's nice that you don't have any lab reports outside of class, but it also means that you have to finish everything in the 3 hours allotted.",
    "pretty easy and standard intro phys lab. go for it.",
    "PHYS 205L is a series of labs done once a week. While there is not a lot of homework for this class, the 3 hour lab itself can be intensive. This is not a course you will be taken for fun, it will most likely be counting towards the prerequisites for your major.",
    "PHYS 205L is a great physics lab. You need a reasonable grounding in physics (really the more you have the easier it will be), but each topic is reviewed at the beginning of each lab packet, so you don't need to go in knowing everything. Apart from some brief homework on data analysis and error during the first few weeks, all the work is done in lab, which is wonderful. Labs tend to go late, so don't schedule anything important immediately afterwards.",
    "A whole bunch of very dry labs that do not deepen your understanding of physics but do give you a good idea how to use instruments important to physics. I would not recommend this in any universe to someone who was looking to take it for fun.",
    "Don't take it unless you need to take a lab credit. In that case, it's a fine class with a light workload, although the grading is opaque and unhelpful. I probably wouldn't take it over 165 just because there's zero value to most all the intro lab courses- might as well choose the least work and the easiest grade.",
    "There is almost no work outside the lab, you just have to read each lab handout and answer a 5-question-multiple-choice reading comprehension quiz before arriving each week. No write ups outside of lab time. Work fast though, there is NEVER enough time to finish before the scheduled ending time, usually had to stay and extra 10 to 20 minutes to finish.",
    "You have to take it... I really disliked lab, but it was not especially painful to go to. I've heard in previous years it was much, much, much worse, so I'm glad that this year was not especially bad. It's just that none of the topics (oscilloscope, circuits, etc) are interesting to me.",
    "No, this is a terrible class. The lab reports are long, poorly written, and don't adequately explain what is expected for the report. The only good thing about this class is that reports are done during the lab, and there is not too much outside work. Now, the bad. The TA was obsessed with error analysis and graded extremely difficultly. Many of the lab experiments themselves were boring and unimaginative, such as measuring the acceleration of gravity. Even when the experiments themselves were interesting and used new and cool equipment, there was always more concern about getting the report done than actually learning how to use the equipment. Classmates cared far too much about grades. I don't want to learn error analysis in a physics lab, I can take a statistics class for that. I want to learn how to use neat and expensive equipment, not measure the acceleration of gravity or worry about writing some report with neat graphs and figures that no one other than the TA will ever see. This course made me like physics less and hate every tuesday of my week.",
    "You're probably taking this because you're required to, so not much to say here. Don't if you're not, though.",
    "Labs cover lots and lots of topics. They're generally very educational but can be graded harshly.",
    "This is an ok lab. The experiments are not very fun, but you don't have to do a whole lot of work outside of class. Experiments often ran over the scheduled time, so don't schedule anything immediately after it.",
    "This is a fairly standard intro physics lab course. There are no lab reports, but all of the work has to be completed in the lab. The homework and exams are easy.",
    "This was a pretty good introduction to proper lab techniques and statistics. None of the work takes place outside of the lab, but it's a bit boring, and the labs can take a while even if you're prepared and work fast.",
    "Do it for the lab requirement. Not too hard. Fairly straightforward.",
    "I would never suggest this class unless it is a requirement. That being said, it's an okay class. I ended up really liking to work with my hands on the theory I've been studying for years. It strengthens your theoretical intuition. The class is really long, once a week, but with minimal homework (no lab reports). Both your professor and lab assistant is in the classroom during labs, so make sure you get a good section by talking to people who already took the class. The homework and quizzes are really easy, so spend enough time to get all these easy points.",
    "This course took us through some basic physics labs. It was very interesting I would recommend this course to anyone to wanted to take a lab.",
    "This lab was a drag but it wasn't too hard! You don't have to do write-ups outside of class, and we only had homework for the first few weeks. Just be prepared to have to stay late sometimes - a few of the labs are very long. The practical exam was scary but it ended up being really easy. Apart from that, most of your grade comes from your lab notebook, so that depends on your TF. Salvatore was great!",
    "Not the most exciting but still interesting course where you mostly learn lab techniques. The 3-hour long labs are pretty intensive but there is very little work outside of those. Think twice about what day of the week you will have enough energy for the lab."
