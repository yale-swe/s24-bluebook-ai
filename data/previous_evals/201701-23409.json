    "This course was perfunctory and did not really shed new light on any issues of ethics or social responsibility in the context of academic work for me. There was a sense that the students were required to be there, and so showed up but did not participate. Maybe other years are more engaged, but certainly this class was fairly checked out throughout the semester. Unfortunately, this tends to be a self-reinforcing pattern... a few people check out, more people check out, everyone checks out...",

    "Good, the time is a little bit embarrassing though.",
    "The course workload was not much. But it is very helpful!",
    "This course provides important knowledge in research ethics and many other aspects, containing necessary information for almost every graduate student. The lectures are interesting, and would be better if more students can get involved and be motivated to participate in the activities\/discussions.",
    "This was a good overview of ethics, applied specifically to public health.",
    "This course is extremely helpful for junior PhD students, it honestly show us the incoming difficulties we may encounter later and provides us practical suggestions"
