   "comments": [
    "Greek 110 is an engaging and fast-paced course. Don't let the existence of \"Intensive Greek\" fool you -- this course is certainly intensive. (Be prepared to be asked if you're a Classics major whenever you mention you're taking Ancient Greek.) However, it does an excellent job of getting you reading and translating quickly and building a strong grammatical foundation for moving forward. It's definitely a lot of memorization (especially compared to a contemporary language) but the instruction is always clear and straightforward. Having a foundation in Latin will be helpful -- most students in the class did, and it's good for just conceptually understanding noun cases and different moods, etc.",
    "This class was really hard, but really rewarding. Expect to devote (unless you are extraordinary when it comes to memorizing things) quite a bit of time to rote memorization for the duration of this course. If you don't have that time, it might be wisest to not take the course. I think some familiarity with inflected languages is a great thing to go into this course with. As a freshman taking this course, I think I grew just as much as a person as I grew as a scholar. This course really helped to correct some poor study habits of mine, and taught me time management. I thought I possessed good study habits and time management skills going into Greek 110, but I was wrong! Now, I feel confident that I can handle any course at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning Ancient Greek.",
    "Greek 110 is great if you are dedicated to learning ancient greek as a foreign language. Although it is not an easy way to fulfill a foreign language requirement, the course is rewarding and doable. Greek 110 is demanding, and requires a lot of additional review, to learn the new alphabet, prepare for weekly grammar quizzes, weekly vocab quizzes, two midterms, and one final. The focus is memorizing, reading and translating; not pronunciation, or dialogue. Do not let anyone convince you that this class is impossible; with work outside of class, one day, the words will cease to just \"look like Greek\" to you, and become understandable. Do not get scared away the first week by the new alphabet, but make sure you are dedicated to the idea of learning an ancient, complicated language. Take Jessica Blum if you can, she will greatly help you get through the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Greek is a really fascinating language. While there is a lot of challenging, difficult grammar to manage, it is very rewarding and worthwhile.",
    "This is a course if you want to learn Greek. Beware it is challenging and an A will be very difficult to attain. But if you want to learn the language, this is the way."
