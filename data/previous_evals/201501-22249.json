   "comments": [
    "Yes even if you're not a history major. The professor is among the best I've had, and the subject is incredibly important within American history since it defines the middle half of the 19th century.",
    "Blight is astonishing. Skipping his lectures feels like a mortal sin. At times he appears - and looks like, for that matter - the physical reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln. He has a brilliant way of making historical figures into living beings, back from the dead and saying just as much as our contemporary politics as they did about our nation's great trial. This is one of the few courses which every undergraduate should take, if only to know how freedom came to be and to explore the deepest recesses of our historical memory.",
    "good lecture. not too much expected. an okay credit\/d because most TF's require reading responses. That said blight is known to go off on tangents so sometimes the discussion in section are the best way to wrap your head around what's going on",
    "Take Civil War! You'll love the lectures, and you'll learn so so much. One of the most entertaining and important classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Civil War is an incredible lecture that anyone interested in history should take. It's a pretty relaxed and fascinating course, and it's also incredibly relevant to be thinking about today.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Excellent professor with intelligent TA's and extremely interesting topic.",
    "Definitely take this if you want to learn about the Civil War, or if you want to have the experience of listening to Blight.",
    "Great easy lecture course. Fascinating, not too difficult. It can be as easy or intense as you want, depending on how much of the reading you do (tons of reading is assigned, but it would be easy to skate by with doing virtually no reading).",
    "Professor Blight is amazing. Fascinating material, not too much work, and a definite must-take in the History Department.",
    "Lots of cool, interesting stories from an engaging lecturer. Tons of reading and a better understanding of the US Civil War.",
    "This class is great. It's an in-depth study of the causes, course, and aftermath of the Civil War. Blight is a really good professor, the papers were fairly easy, and you get to learn about a super important part of American history. The reading some weeks was a bit much, but it parallels the lectures really well, so you can just sort of skim the reading if it's too much. I took this class Credit\/D\/F and planned to not put much work into it, but I ended up getting good grades on the papers and thought the final was easy, so it's not too difficult a class.",
    "Civil War was one of my favorite classes this semester. You will get most of the information from the readings rather than the lectures, but that is ok--Blight is a lot of fun to listen to. There can be a lot of reading some weeks but most of it is really good. Be sure to read The March by E.L. Doctorow as well as McPherson's tome. The former is beautiful and the latter is informative. The rest of the assignments are not as critical, particularly Ken Burns' documentary (unless you have 15 hours to spare). I would recommend this course because it actually did enhance my understanding of the Civil War and especially Reconstruction beyond a solid high school level.",
    "Civil War is a pretty famous \"Yale Course.\" Professor Blight is fantastic and brilliant, and if you have the chance to take his class you definitely should. His lectures can sometimes get bogged down in quotes and tangents, but if your'e interested in the Civil War at all I would recommend this class. You get out what you put in in terms of readings and actually learning the material, but it's not too much work and is a chance to learn about an incredibly important and relevant part of American history.",
    "Definitely recommended. This class is more a poetic and thematic examination of the Civil War and 19th century than a review of \"This battle happened on this day etc.\" In that way I can tell it frustrated some people, but it's more lively, poetic, and ultimately relevant the way Prof Blight does it. Prof Blight is an ingenious storyteller. He exudes wisdom and passion. You can tell that he really cares about his topic and the effects of the Civil War. He is a phenomenal speaker - engaged, excited, and informative. This course is hugely useful for understanding the Civil War but even more so for understanding this great beast we call history. If you're looking to experiment in history, take Civil War.",
    "An amazing class with great lectures and readings. A must-take!",
    "I thought the class was a bit overrated, but nonetheless interesting material. It's nice to not have a sitdown midterm exam.",
    "A really engaging course about an important, complicated, and still super relevant period of US history. David Blight is as wise as anyone you'll ever study with, and he is among the greatest storytellers out there. Even when he (frequently) goes off script and starts throwing in Whitman and Frederick Douglass quotes, he's still super engaging. The reading is heavy and fairly necessary (especially McPherson on both counts), since he doesn't always cover all of the material in lecture. The TFs know this, though, and help make up for it. And the reading is quote good, though a lot. The time period is also just so interesting and multifaceted, and Blight does a great job of highlight all the different views on it, both now and then. The papers ask pretty big questions, but don't be intimidated and you should be fine. If you're looking for an engaging US history course and are prepared to work a bit, this is a no-brainer.",
    "Yeah, good as a fifth class, you don't have to do a ton of work and it's really interesting.",
    "Typical history course - 2 short papers and a final + section participation with weekly reading responses. There was about anywhere from 100 to 200 pages of reading and well taught. A must take history class, for both history and non-history majors",
    "Yes",
    "AMAZING",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "This is an amazing course. Blight is a superb lecturer, engaging and intense but with a lighthearted side to him. He really gets you invested in the importance of the Civil War. There's a fair bit of reading, but they're great documents, and overall the material is so important to know about, given the continual conflicts we see today that have some of their roots in the conflict behind the Civil War.",
    "It's a pretty decent history course. Not much coursework, although a wholly unrealistic amount of reading is assigned. It's just two papers and a final. Grading seemed at least a little tricky to me but I'm a science major and I think just not cut out for a college history course. A great Cr\/D\/F if you have interest in the material. Also note that the class doesn't actually focus on the Civil War beyond superficial detail, but rather the social and political processes leading up to and away from it. You won't necessarily learn a lot beyond your APUSH class in terms of concrete knowledge but the readings and discussion are definitely at a higher level than your typical high school history course.",
    "Maybe it was just because my expectations were sky-high for this course, but I left feeling somewhat disappointed. If you already know the basics of the Civil War and Reconstruction, the class fills in some of the details. But I really wanted to hear Professor Blights insight, and instead there was a lot of jokes and tangents to get through to find his arguments. Good readings and fairly easy, but definitely not a must-take course.",
    "I took the class credit\/D, and I could not have been happier with how the course went. Professor Blight is UNBELIEVABLE, and though there is a lot of reading for the course, I was able to pick and choose what I read, and I always enjoyed what I did end up reading. I took this class just because I was interested in the Civil War, and Professor Blight does an incredible job of bringing the history to life. The class is not too much work for anyone looking to take the class credit\/D (or not credit\/D), and I was very happy with my choice of a course to follow just for pure enjoyment.",
    "One of the best lecturers at yale. A decent amount of reading but there is no midterm so a lot of it you just need for your essays.",
    "It is a classic history course and you walk away with a great sense of civil war and antebellum history.",
    "This is a good history lecture. However, Professor Blight's lectures were often disorganized and hard to follow. He consistently kept students 10 minutes after class was over. This is still a good class but probably one to take credit d because the grading is kind of crazy.",
    "If you only take one history class at Yale, take this class. It's such a good lecture and the Civil War is incredibly powerful material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course",
    "This is a great lecture course and I recommend it highly. Blight is an excellent and engaging lecturer. The reading at times is very heavy, but overall there are only two essays and then the final exam, so the workload is very total.",
    "Fine class, lame assignments. Take if you're interested in the topic.",
    "I think this is a great history lecture and would recommend it highly.",
    "Civil War & Reconstruction is an excellent history course that will deepen your understanding not only of American history but also of human nature. I would recommend it to anyone!",
    "Yes.",
    "Fantastic, interesting class. Would definitely recommend it to another study but keep in mind it is not easy.",
    "Be prepared to do a LOT of reading if you want to get anything out of it. But it's interesting, and Blight is a gem.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Blight as a lecturer doesn't live up to his reputation. If you are a history major, or really into the American Civil War, you'll enjoy the class, and probably find it to be pretty easy. However, if you're in STEM looking for an Hu credit, definitely look elsewhere. The papers were graded harshly, especially for a class without a Wr credit.",
    "This course is absolutely essential, whether or not you're interested in history. David Blight is an incredible lecturer and are the crowning part of the course. Though there can be quite a bit of reading, it's manageable. Papers are pretty short and to the point, with enough room to be creative but enough specificity to help those not used to historical writing. Overall one of the best courses at Yale.",
    "This class is probably the best I've taken at Yale. Professor Blight is fantastic. You have to get over some of his quirks--he goes overtime by about 10 minutes each class, lectures are disorganized, etc.--but once you do you'll learn an incredible amount. There is a lot of reading, but the reading and lecture are both very interesting. Lectures were incredible. Prof. Blight made the material very accessible, and made many of us learn to love the history of this era.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "Great course.",
    "Interesting class with lots of readings!",
    "Good class if you are a history major",
    "A history of the Civil War and Reconstruction. However it ended up being more a class on Frederick Douglass and poets than material. I would not recommend this course (I was so excited to take this course and a history major who focuses on US history) The Reconstruction portion was much better than the a Civil War section. Essays were interesting but tricky, readings were intriguing and the final was fair, however the lecture was terrible. I loved my TA and section was made me feel like I got something from it. If you are looking for a history course--do not bother taking this one",
    "It really depends. The course and lectures are very freeform, and Blight rambles in a way that clarifies very little. That's because the course's main point is to demonstrate the seemingly endless number of conflicting interpretations of the Civil War. If you are willing to do all the readings and think critically about them, it can be really rewarding, but if you won't have time to do them then this course can be more of a wash. The workload is fine and there's no midterm, only 2 short-to-mid length papers and a cumulative final.",
    "Yes, but it might be not quite challenging enough if you're already obsessed with the Civil War. On the whole, a great time though.",
    "Highly recommend. Not too hard (for non-history majors), but can be hugely interesting and informative.",
    "This class is a wonderful overview of the causes, course, and effects of the Civil war taught by one of the most brilliant lecturers on the Yale campus. I would definitely recommend that all Yale students take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Take this class if you can. Professor Blight is a wonderful lecturer--his classes feel like storytime with David Blight. He expects you to have done the reading to get all the facts and intersperses poetry, images, individuals' stories, and letters into his lectures. Highly, highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend it only if you have some kind of connection to the Civil War. Otherwise, its too much reading and writing to do without having some kind of investment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for a fellow student. There are really two ways to approach it, depending on what level of work you would like to put in and what you are looking to get out of the class. Taking it for a grade: be prepared to do a good chunk of the readings, work really hard on the two paper assignments, and study a lot for the final. This class is unlike many other history lectures -- you need to do a lot of work and they expect it!! Taking it Credit\/D: Great way to enjoy the lectures, pick just the readings you find interesting, and not study too much for the final. Everyone should know about the Civil War, and so many people take this class out of general interest, Credit\/D. That being said if you can fit in the harder workload, I would recommend taking it for a grade.This is an opportunity to get to know the Civll War material really well, and it's worth not skimming over.",
    "Even if you think you know the Civil War, take this class because you don't!!!",
    "An engaging class in terms of providing an overview of the Civil War and Reconstruction eras.",
    "Take it.",
    "This is a classic Yale class for good reason- take it if you are excited about focusing intensely on 40 years of (important) American history.",
    "An exciting class, take it!",
    "Great, fun, interesting class.",
    "I would summarize this class by saying that it is a fun, interesting class that really helps you get a better sense of history. I would definitely recommend this class to any other student because of how much I enjoyed my time in the class.",
    "The best lecture I took at Yale! Wish I hadn't taken it credit d because I ended up putting a ton of work into it anyways. It's a lot of reading, but you don't have to do every page by any meansall the books and documents are very specific in their arguments and it's easy to get the main points through skimming and section. The sections are all really good for this class and the TAs know a lot about the subject. Blights lectures are so engaging, and the TAs do a good job of picking up where he left off because he inevitably strays from the lesson plan quite a bit. Definitely take it.",
    "Overrated class. The lectures could have been better organized, and the technology better integrated. I didn't find that my understanding on the Civil War's role in American history was really expanded.",
    "One of the most memorable classes I have taken at Yale. Take it if you want to understand American history, and if you just want to experience how profoundly fun the study of history can be. Blight really makes the Civil War come alive - he relives the events with you as he teaches them.",
    "This is perhaps one of my favorite courses, and definitely one of the best courses, that I have taken at Yale so far. There is a lot of reading, but it is all so interesting and so varied (a textbook, primary documents, a novel, etc.) that you are never bored, and in fact, I think I really wanted to do all my reading for this class. Professor Blight is also just a fantastic lecturer and you don't want to miss out on his lectures. He is funny, a great speaker, and extremely knowledgeable. If you keep up mostly with the readings, the course only has two 5-page papers and a final, and is not too difficult in terms of actual workload. I would definitely recommend this to any student.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. David Blight is a wonderful lecturer, totally enjoyable and incredibly knowledgable and interesting. Section was also quite enjoyable and helpful. There is a LOT of reading (13 books), but I thought it was doable and entirely worth it. The time period is incredibly interesting and getting an in-depth look at it with an expert like David Blight and with a relatively diverse collection of material is fantastic. There are also only two 5-page papers and one final, which was nice. All in all, great course, would recommend.",
    "I was disappointed in this class since I felt that the lectures and sections were interesting but did not give me a clear picture of what was going on when before, during, and after the civil war.",
    "This was a fantastic course. One of the best I've taken. It is my #1 MUST-TAKE AT YALE. David Blight is the best lecturer I've ever experienced. He is funny, immensely passionate, brilliant, fair, and his personality shines throughout his lectures. For the most part, he does a really good job of being fair to both the North and the South, which is especially key for America's most polarized historical era. My biggest problem with this course was the fact that the due dates of the two papers were not listed on the syllabus by the beginning of the term and in fact we got each one two to three weeks in advance. Michael Hattem was an incredible TF. One of the best I've had. Watch out for the two papers. The topics are both extremely broad and writing them proves a daunting task for a 5-6 page paper.",
    "Great class! Highly recommend it. If at all possible, find a way to get into Alice Baumgartner's section, even if it's at 9 AM on Friday morning. She's the best.",
    "good course if you are interested in the lectures, which are excellent. most of actual civil war learning will come from the (large) amount of reading. NOT an easy class"
