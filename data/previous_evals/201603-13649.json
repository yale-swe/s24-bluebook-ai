   "comments": [
    "I learned a bunch of different tools and techniques for both reporting and then writing a compelling narrative from that reporting. In this course you break down many wonderful nonfiction articles by articulating the tools the writers used, and then you use these tools for yourself in writing two articles.",
    "How to think about writing a narrative piece and what's important to consider and what's not... how to take a critical look at my own pieces and determine if decisions on persona and structure are intentional and effective. Also, a lot of very useful reporting tips and tricks",
    "In this course, I learned how to bridge the gap between journalism and creative nonfiction. I learned practical reporting and interviewing skills that allowed me to take my writing outside of my limited worldview and into various communities. I learned the valuable lesson that anything can make a great story as long as you identify the central drama through a compelling structure and authorial voice.",
    "I learned so much. Stillman is amazing.",
    "This course was incredibly influential in developing my skills as a nonfiction writer this past semester. On a technical level, the class helped me develop my understanding of how to effectively report long-form pieces (the nitty gritty details of interview conduct, pitching pieces to publications, etc). On a broader level, I learned a lot from being surrounded by other passionate, skilled writers and being able to engage in weekly discussions about the vast array of nonfiction works we read for class.",
    "I learned how to approach nonfiction writing in a more creative and structured manner and to think about ways I can incorporate my own persona. This class definitely taught me invaluable lessons and is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale!",
    "I learned a truly invaluable amount about how to conceive of and play with a story, as well as how to blend descriptive writing with hard reporting\/interviewing skills. We talked at great length about how to develop non-fiction persona as well as how to structure pieces (as indicated by the course description) -- basically, a huge amount about the art of creative non-fiction at large, both in terms of craft and practice (some great help with how to pitch pieces for publication, for instance)."

   "comments": [
    "The course was incredibly well-organized for the most part. All readings were great, and even if we didn't discuss them in class, served as great examples for the kinds of structures and voices we were pondering in the course. Sarah Stillman is an amazing teacher and clearly cares a lot about her students' success, which made the class energetic and communal. One thing that made the course particularly difficult to manage were the short deadlines that some students had to come up with a rough draftsomething determined by chance drawing at the beginning of the semester.",
    "The strengths of this course are Professor Stillman's amazing professional perspective and the depth of analysis and commitment that the two main pieces require--you definitely get as much out of your articles as you put in. I think this depth can be overwhelming, however, and at some points in the class I felt a bit lost in the process. I think introducing more deadlines along the way might be helpful for students to stay on track.",
    "I love that this course only involves two assignments. Having so much time to work on each piece really allowed the students to dive into their stories, completing thorough sourcing and coming up with innovative approaches to structure & voice. I also appreciated that everyone had the opportunity to have all of their pieces workshopped in class. One downside of this workshopping schedule is that some students had little time before their workshop and then a ton of time before the final draft due date, while other students had lots of time to complete their first draft but very little time to do follow-up reporting before the final due date. Still, although I admit this schedule is not ideal, I think it all worked out in our class -- the students were able to trade workshopping slots and found out what worked for them."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in becoming a better nonfiction writer, absolutely take this class! You learn a lot of useful tools for nonfiction writing, but mostly you write two polished pieces throughout the course. This class really allows you do to hands-on learning.",
    "Yes definitely - an amazing course that will improve your journalism exponentially and make you think more deeply about how you approach the craft.",
    "For any Yale student who is considering a career in writing, this class is an absolute must. I can't speak to the quality of the course when taught by Professor Strebeigh, but Professor Stillman is the most amazing and passionate and humble and caring teacher. She gives great advice and feedback, and I can't speak highly enough about the course. Take it take it take it.",
    "If you get in, absolutely take this course, especially if Stillman teaches it again. She was a pleasure to work with, and so approachable, which can't be said of all MacArthur-certified geniuses. The class is difficult, and choosing an idea to pitch can feel daunting, but the reward of writing pieces of this depth and length is immeasurable. The course's bent on publishing is also extremely helpful and encouraging--every writer should take this course.",
    "Take this class. Not every class gives you the opportunity to workshop two big pieces over the course of the semester. The work is rewarding, and the instruction is so helpful. 10 outta 10 highly recommend.",
    "Yes! If Prof. Stillman ever teaches this class again ...",
    "I strongly recommend this course. If you are at all interested in pursuing journalism (or even just developing your reporting skills for nonfiction), this is a good class to take. It is definitely the kind of course where you get out of it what you put into it. If you do all of the readings, you will be able to engage in class discussions. If you spend a lot of time on your assignments, you will have more material to learn from in your workshops. Definitely take it though. You'll learn from the readings, assignments, professor, and your classmates.",
    "Definitely take this course if you get in, and take it with Professor Stillman! She is one of the most caring, competent, and patient professors I've had at Yale. Her feedback on your two pieces (the \"structure\" piece and the \"voice\" piece) is always long and detailed both my writing and my thinking have improved because of her guidance.",
    "Absolutely! Any student interested in creative non-fiction -- or writing in general -- has so much to learn from Professor Stillman & the course material.",
    "This was, by far, one of the most wonderful classes I've taken at Yale. If you're lucky enough to get in, absolutely take it. Professor Stillman is one of the best at what she does (and is such a great professor!), and the pieces you read (both off the syllabus and produced in the class) are some of the best in the form."
