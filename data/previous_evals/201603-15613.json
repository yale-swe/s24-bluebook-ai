   "comments": [
    "This class is fascinating for anyone who is interested in environmental issues, politics, global policy, religion, spirituality, philosophy, or who cares about being an engaged global citizen. It is more or less a spiritual approach to the environmental crisis of our time, and we learn both about faith communities' role in the climate crisis, and the deeply human way we engage with nature and the responsibility that rests on our shoulders to make widespread change quickly. I would recommend this to pretty much any student at Yale regardless of age, background or academic interest because it is an issue that deeply affects anyone who lives on this planet.",
    "If you have an interest in the link between spirituality (religious or otherwise) and the natural world, definitely consider taking it. Since this particular class is the introduction, I think it's of more value in expanding and examining your personal thoughts, whereas the other similar classes are for learning of religion-nature relationships through a more academic lens."
