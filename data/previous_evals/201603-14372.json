    "We only have met once this semester, but it was awesome. I really enjoyed the speaker. The only weakness I can think of is that I'd love to meet more often! And the time on Monday is not always the easiest to make because I had a class at 1pm.",
    "This was a lunch seminar that only met twice during the semester, so there's not much to say. Strengths: free lunch, interesting talks.",
    "The course would be improved by adding additional sessions.",
    "Good speakers, would have been good to know the second scheduled seminar had been cancelled.",
    "The speakers were great and the topics they covered were very interesting, but unfortunately they went over my head. I talked with quite a few classmates about it and we just felt lost and confused with many of the topics. Because we just need to sit and listen, it's not a big deal, but I would have much rather been able to apply what I had learned in Cost-Effectiveness to the real world rather than be inundated with very advanced techniques.",
    "Fantastic! The speakers were great!",
    "Interesting topics, but perhaps too infrequent."
