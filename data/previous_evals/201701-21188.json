    "I feel like in this class I didn't learn much hard (or even all that much soft) knowledge about the real world. For instance, we did very little about non-western conceptions of gender and sexuality, or how globalization affects gender and sexuality (in any particular place). Instead, a large portion of what we covered was about how feminist (and broader) discourse deals with gender and sexuality transnationally and ways in which this can be problematic. A lot of the reading were critiques of white and American feminism for instance. On the other hand, I got much better at reading and understanding theoretic and academic writings and I got a much better understanding of feminist literature."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting material, good cross-section of readings, class of one's fellow WGSS majors is always fun. I enjoyed the critical stance paper and other assignments. Weaknesses: Discussion was so slow and boring, no one would talk and the class always dragged on forever. I think the class could be made shorter and maybe more prompting and pushing back from Prof Dowe would've been nice because it's hard for students to push back on each other without feeling like the bad guy \/ like you're evil. Can't believe we ended up reading Men Explain Things To Me?? Weakness also: I would be a lil more specific on the first day about the fact that this is a required course for the major, it felt like a lot of folks in the class had the wrong impression and thus didn't participate. It was like there were two classes in one room... Also: I know some students will probably say there was too much theory, but I think that should be taken with a grain of salt -- feel like the students making those complaints aren't the ones who have to use this course as the foundation of a major that's really dependent on theory. Theory is interesting and rewarding if you're willing to read it.",
    "I would have preferred in this course were a bit less theory focussed and more focussed on real-world stuff. For instance, learning about how gender and sexuality are understood around the world and what has caused changes in this. I think the format though, which an online discussion is a very good one.",
    "This course needs to be shorter. We end up wasting an hour of class on discussion that is too dilute to be useful. It gets repetitive. On the bright side, a lot of material is covered",
    "The ambition of the course - to give transnational perspectives on WGSS stuff - is a good one, but I don't think that it was very well realized this spring. I think that was for a few reasons. For one, students were very unengaged. I'm not sure if this was because people didn't do the reading or because the discussions were just very stagnant. Andrew asked really long questions that were very confusing and that you didn't know were going to be questions until he got to the end, and then there would often be silence in the room for a long time. Often it was just a conversation between the same people. It was also frustrating to me that we seemed to have the same discussions over and over, week to week - what does this mean for the field of WGSS, we'd ask, basically every class. We also ended up talking about the U.S. a lot, which was ok but kind of ironic considering the fact that it was \"globalizing.\" I suppose that coming out of the first term Bodies and Pleasures, Globalizing just felt kind of the same but worse. It got a little better at the end when Andrew had people go around at the beginning of class so that everyone would speak. I think the classes definitely needed way more organization, perhaps they could be broken up in creative ways. Maybe have people put computers away, or only use them as one would a book to read the text.",
    "GREAT MATERIAL, however requires some familiarity with the field and dense academic writing. Overall, extremely enlightening course!"

    "Good class, interesting material, but sometimes it felt like we were hitting the same point over and over",
    "If you're a WGSS major: congrats you're in the best major at Yale wow! Anyway you have to take it so not much to say. Otherwise: Globalizing Gender & Sexuality is a required course for all sophomore WGSS majors, almost all of whom will be coming off of Bodies & Pleasure together the past semester. It's basically designed as a foundational course for the rest of the major, so it's essentially an overview of major theoretical thought regarding Third World studies and gender and sexuality studies. If you are up for a lot of dense writing about constructions of the postcolonial subject that's awesome, some of the readings are really cool, but it very much is a theoretical course as opposed to being about different constructions of gender worldwide.",
    "Overall this is a nice course. With Andrew, it's very theoretical - the course is largely about feminist theory and critiques of how it often treats gender and sexuality across cultures, as opposed to how conceptions of gender and sexuality vary between cultures. A lot of the course is about analyzing WGSS itself as an academic field. Because it's pretty theoretical and assumes students are familiar with a fair bit of theoretical stuff, if you haven't taken any more theoretical WGSS classes, you should be hesitant about this, but it still could be great class for you. Also, Andrew Dowe is really nice as a teacher.",
    "I would only recommend this to someone who needs it for their major.",
    "YES! Fantastic course that broadens many people's understanding of the feminism, wgss, etc."
