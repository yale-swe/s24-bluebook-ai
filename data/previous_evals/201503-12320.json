    "LING 117 is a great intro to linguistics course. Although Professor Pinango may be difficult to follow, it is evident that she has an immense amount of knowledge regarding linguistics. I would recommend this course. However, I would advise one to shop the class first before committing to it. It is definitely not for everyone."
