    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about the Aztecs. It's pretty much a history course with archeology thrown in. The course consists of 2 (4-5 page essays) that have topics like: pretend you are a merchant visiting an ancient Aztec city tell me what you see and pretend you are an archeologist that found a ______. They are easy fun essays to write and so long as you have a good bibliography and use of academic sources will will get a great grade. For the final you have the option of writing a 20 page research paper on any topic regarding the Aztecs or taking the final exam. For the final the professor was extremely nice and told us the chapters we were responsible for so no need to scramble through notes or read everything on classesv2, etc. There is also a participation grade all you really have to do is go to class and ask a few questions, some people however never went to class so I suppose they either don't care about their participation grade or are taking the class Credit D because in all honesty you do not need to hear the lectures to write any of the papers. It's a laid back course were you have the opportunity to learn a lot if you want to and get a great grade. Similar courses may be better taught (Hint: a particular class about the Andes) however you will most likely have to work a lot more and your GPA will suffer.",
    "This course is truly more of a history or culture class than it is an archaeology course. We spent a lot of time looking at historical documents rather than learning about important dig sites - although we did talk about the excavation of the Templo Mayor for a while. The first two short (5-7pg) papers for this class were very interesting and allowed us to get creative with the assignment. Things got weird with the final however: you get to choose between a final exam and a final paper. This alone is not odd, but what is odd is that we were not really given details about the paper assignment. This led to a lot of students choosing to do the paper without realizing that Professor Chinchilla expected it to be about 6,000 words. Yes, my friends, that is about 24 pages. Here's what was really odd though: that final exam I talked about covers approximately 8 chapters of our books. So... 8 chapters and a test vs. 24 pages of finals-period hell. Your choice.",
    "This is a general overview of Aztec Archaeology. You do not need any prior experience for this class. I would recommend this class if students are looking for an easy fourth or fifth class. It definitely did not a hard class, but it is pretty interesting!",
    "Just another archaeology class at Yale... most are pretty similar. Pretty dry content so it comes down to the professor's delivery. This class was pretty good.",
    "This course was an overview of Aztec culture and archaeology. Of the intermediate level archaeology courses I have taken as an ANTH major, this was probably the most interesting. I would recommend this to another student, especially since the course material\/syllabus will improve as this was the first semester it was offered with Professor Chinchilla.",
    "Pretty straightforward course.",
    "See first question",
    "This is a good class to take if you are interested in Mesoamerica, archaeology, or anthropology. I would recommend this class; it provides a satisfying semester for anyone interested in the subject.",
    "The material was interesting. The lectures were not cohesive sometimes but overall it was enjoyable.",
    "It can be a bit dull. Take it if you are really interested in the Aztecs."
