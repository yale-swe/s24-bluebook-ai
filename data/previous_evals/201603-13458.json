    "I gained a foundational knowledge of West African Islam and now have the resources to further explore the topic if I so choose.",

    "very interesting insight on islam in west africa. read and heard about a lot of perspectives I had never encountered before",
    "I will learn about the pacifist tradition of West African Sufism. This is the thesis of the course, and there's little deviation from this topic.",
    "I have a much better understanding of the foundations, political and theological, of Islam and the social and cultural features of West Africa that both affected, and were affected by, Islam there."

   "comments": [
    "The entire semesters readings, aside from the books, were put in one 594 page pdf. Most of the readings were in order as related to the syllabus but some were not. While I'm sure Dr. Sanneh did this with the intention to make the readings conveniently accessible for the students, for me it ended up being more of a hindrance. I know this seems like a minor gripe but having to scroll through hundreds of pages to maybe find an article was extremely annoying. I would have much preferred each reading to be separated in individual pdfs.",
    "Very interesting subject matter, Prof Sanneh is very helpful and willing to suggest additional reading and resources to help you perform your best. Readings weren't always especially interesting, and we did not always get round to discussing them in class. I think it would be better to more carefully select fewer and more engaging readings. I also think the readings on classesv2 could be much better organized. We had to scroll through a huge file with hundreds of pages to find our readings, and not only were the readings not posted in chronological order, the pages were photocopies so it was impossible to find the reading you needed without going through the whole document.",
    "The sections are very interesting and engaging. It would help if there were assignments that required students to complete readings, for there is little incentive to do so.",
    "The reading materials, provided in a single document on classesv2, were very difficult and time-consuming to locate and work with. I frequently spent over an hour of my preparation time weekly trying to find the reading assignment in that large, single, unsearchable document.",
    "Professor Sanneh is brilliant and interesting, but the course itself was at times disorganized."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course if they were interested in West Africa and\/or Islam but I would warn them of how the readings were structured.",
    "Yes! I strongly recommend this course, because Sanneh is a specialist for Islam and its history.",
    "Yes, not too much work and Prof Sanneh is really nice. The subject matter is super interesting too. Seminars feel a little long sometimes because students don't really debate each other much (most people only spoke to ask the prof a question, as opposed to talk with fellow students about the readings).",
    "The class depends heavily on presentations and questions by students to stimulate the professor's important thoughts and comments which, once triggered, are insightful and highly knowledgeable. The class is not a lecture class.",
    "Everyone should take this course. You learn so much about the history of Islam and so much of what's taught here is never focused on in other courses or the media. It's really important to understand the history of Islam in a comprehensive way, and you see just how much is missing in the way this religion is usually portrayed in the West. Sanneh also just drops nuggets of wisdom on you every week, it honestly changed my life.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in a fairly relaxed survey-course of Islamic and African history. There are two 12-15 page papers and one in-class presentation. It is, however, some times disorganized, so be prepared."
