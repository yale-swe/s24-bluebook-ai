    "I thought this course material was very useful. However, I really struggled to keep up with the professor's pace during the first six weeks. I spent an outrageous 15 hours a week between coursework, reading, and doing homework and sample problem sets from one of the books. Even given all of that, I was unable to keep pace with the work. After about six weeks, I just gave up trying to keep up with him in class--I was tired of feeling frustrated. Until that point, it felt as if he were speaking a foreign language each day--particularly given that it had been 15 years since my last math course.Unfortunately, week 6 is just about where the content got really interesting--with regression and such--and that's also much easier to understand, I think. I'd suggest JRS slow down in the first 6-8 weeks of the course and then speed up through regression and such, somewhat.",
    "Good choice to not require a specific textbook.",
    "Great course. I really found the documents that you made available to us to be very useful. Additionally, reading the Deveaux textbook was extremely helpful in understanding sections that I had trouble following in class.",
    "JDRS does a wonderful job presenting such an unpopular and daunting subject. It was a great foundations course that I would highly recommend to students lacking a statistics background.",
    "1. I bought the cartoon guide and the moore and mccabe.7b. I never even met Haisu. She was very hard to pin down and her office hours kept moving location.",
    "Solving problem set took me a lot of time but it was useful because I learneda lot doing homework.",
    "Jonathan was great. His lectures were clear and engaging. There was a sizable amount of work but I really felt as if I learned a lot this semester. The final project was also a great way to solidify and apply class concepts.",
    "Q1-2: The instructor provided a large amount of printed powerpoint slides as reading\/studying material. While helpful to some extent, outside of the class context I found them difficult to interpret in many cases, and wish we had an assigned textbook. The instructor did recommend several texts at the beginning of the course, and the one I chose and used was essential in some cases. I think it would more helpful to students if a single text was specified, and if the course followed the text exactly, such that students knew precisely where to turn when concepts were unclear.Q3: Out of class assignments were ok, but often students did not have sufficient grounding to complete them without assistance. For me, moderate success required study groups and regular TA help sessions.Q6: The pace of the class was good for the first third, but then became too fast. This is a product of sequential building of concepts without reinforcement. Regularly, peer groups would meet and discuss collective inability to follow what was happening in class. The professor's desire to cover what he envisioned, or was outline in his syllabus, proved detrimental to retention since too many concepts were addressed in insufficient depth.",
    "Q7b- The TA was not approachable. He seemed very grumpy in class and sat in the very front of the class and surfed the internet which was a bit distracting. It would have been better if he didn't come at all.Q1- I wish that the reading had been required and referenced in the class. I did not do the reading very often, but I think I would have understood the material much better had I - this is what I most regret in taking this course.",
    "Very organized material, and EXCELLENT lectures. Some of the best I've seen at Yale.",
    "Question 7: The professor was excellent. One of the TAs graded way to harshly and instead of making it motivating, made it resentful to do stats. The other TA kept weird office hours away from school and never came to class.",
    "At the end of this course, the things that stick in my mind are not statistical concepts, but rather, specific elements of the professor's theatrics.",
    "Prof. Reuning-Scherer is fabulous. I felt I couldn't comment on the TAs because I never made use of them, admittedly because I got the impression from friends that asking for help from colleagues in the class was more productive.",
    "Prof. Reuning-Sherer is an amazing stats teacher. This is the best teaching I've experienced at F&ES.",
    "I felt the class was fast and hard to understand. Because of this it was hard to do the problem sets. I wish class was more practically based in class and slower in pace.",
    "I had no formal training in statistics prior to enrolling at FES and this class was exactly what I needed.",
    "This is an excellent and I\u00b4m really grateful of Professor\u00b4s Reuning-Sherer energy and committment. I would probably only add that it would be nice if students could work more in their projects towards the end of the semester.Thanks a lot!",
    "The professor was very engaging. It would have been nice if we had a more patient TA, who at least acted like they were interested in helping students.",
    "Question 1: The course handouts were useful, especially once we started compiling all of the PDF versions in order. This enabled us to use the search and find utility, which allowed us to find information in the notes much more easily.",
    "It would be nice to go a bit slower and use all the class time allotted."

    "His slides--excellent. So much so that I could teach myself most of the material from the slides themselves, in particular for problem sets and the midterm.",
    "Class interaction during lectures; in particular, the mini-review sessions about big concepts were EXCELLENT. Would have liked to have a handout on some of the material, in particular, a summary of what test to use when, with the corresponding model equations (went over it in class several times, was very helpful but too quick to copy all down).",
    "I thought the structure of the course was great - 2 midterms and a final project. Additionally the way the midterms are given - open book and unlimited time is much appreciated and really helpful in having us understand the material in a way that is most relevant to how we will use it in real life.",
    "The discussion sections were incredibly valuable. The presentations and resulting feedback were indispensible to developing my final product.",

    "The best thing of the class was I learned to use MINITAB software. Though there is lot to be learned about, I am happy that I have started using it. The other good thing about the class was one of the software based class, which was very helpful as it gave us the ways and techniques to use to solve statistical problems.",

    "How useful the content and materials are and the great teaching skills that Prof. Reuning-Sherer has.",
    "The professor broke down the material and made it so much easier to understand, and he made it fun.",
    "Applicable to future work, very helpful for analyzing data. This was the first statistics course I took and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

    "The professor engagement \/ time he spent outside of class helping students understand material",
    "JDRS is a great lecturer, keeps things moving and makes stats as enjoyable as possible."

   "comments": [
    "Midterm 2 was set up as multiple choice I imagine to make grading easier. However, due to that it was quite simple, compared to the content we had covered. I'd encourage the creativity and challenge that comes through open-ended questions that don't mirror the exact language in the slides.",
    "TA office hours not helpful. Need to either have more hours available, or run office hours more organized; it was a zoo and I left stressed.",
    "Can't think of any way to improve it.",
    "The availability of the TA to answer questions at times that are more sensitive to the homework due-dates.",
    "Multiple choice midterms suck.",
    "Teaching pace was so quick. If the professor can explain things just little bit slower, it will be much better.",
    "The ta program could really be improved. Jeff was good - he returned assignments promptly but he seemed disconnected to the course material at times. Haisu really needed to improve. It was difficult to understandher and she rarely returned assignments on time.",
    "TA approachability and help.",
    "TA sections were not helpful at all- having more organized material to cover during section would be more helpful than just office hours",
    "The pace for certain topics was very fast--not enough time to absorb things deeply. I had to rely on the textbook for a greater conceptual understanding of the topics.",
    "The pace is in most need of improvement. Pedagogically, I did not feel the professor was responsive to the students' needs. When material was unclear, some time was often spent clarifying it. But, after a certain point, even if the material was still unclear, the course moved on. In that statistical concepts build upon one another, this made painted the course into a downward spiral. For me, the first third of the term was great, but after that, concepts became less and less clear, to the point where by the end of the term, I was simply executing the actions in Minitab, and had a poor grasp on",
    "I would have liked to understand more about the derivation of the equations. I think that I didn't really understand the way the calculations were actually done - as Minitab could do them for me. Really I think it would be better if for the first half of class or so, we were made to do the math by hand.",
    "maybe get one more TA so that the assignments and exams come back sooner.",
    "More integration with the project throughout the semester.",
    "However, whether it is because of the amount of material covered or just the pace he went, it was way too fast to understand for those who do not learn in that particular way. The \"optional\" textbook (the full one, not just the cartoon statistics one) should be recommended as \"required\" for students who know they are slower or visual learners. Most of my learning was from the textbook, as was most of my fellow students' who had no previous statistics experience.This class took up the most time of any of my classes, and is probably the least relevant to my course of study. I was told I should take it if I had not taken statistics before, however, I would have been fine auditing. Auditing was also discouraged, because the material takes initiative to learn, however in hindsight, it would have been sufficient to audit.",
    "The TA's.",
    "More supportive TAs.",
    "The formatting of the notes is not helpful. The different fonts\/meandering layout made them very difficult to move through. The stapling job also drove everyone crazy.",
    "There should be more of an opportunity to do practice problems as recommended by the professor, outside of just the problem sets.",
    "Hmm, all I can really think of is my response to #14. But I would also recommend that there be time to present the group projects in class: I was really interested in what my friends chose to study and how, but there was no time to hear what they'd learned.",
    "Maybe fewer pictures within the notes.",
    "The TA's (Jeff Chow) grading habits seemed at odds with Prof's standards. TA was inflexible and unforgiving in his grading to the point where it did not inspire me to work harder, it only made me frustrated and unmotivated. On the other hand, Jonathan is more concerned about the concepts and tools we learned, not how consistently we round the hundredth place digit. It would be helpful if Jonathan had made sure Jeff was on his same page.Also, more instruction on using categorical data would be helpful.",
    "The TAs couldn't always answer questions during their office hours, which sometimes made it difficult to finish the homework assignments.",
    "I feel the course should be more practically based and slower.",
    "I think its perfect",
    "The quality of one of the teaching assistants.",
    "The professor was very considerate in providing printed out lecture notes for the students at the beginning of EVERY class, but the stapling of the notes drove us nuts!! One of the most challenging part of this course was navigating through the lecture notes, flipping page by page to find the right sections. Maybe it would be better if there was a master lecture notes file, which has all of the lecture notes together that allows the students to open up the file and just type in what they need in the \"find\" box. That would make things so much more swift.",
    "The choice of TAs.",
    "Understanding that the pace of the course is necessary to get through the material, it would be useful for the class handouts\/notes to be more detailed. Often times the descriptive detail that connected concepts and equations or techniques would be said in class lectures, but would be absent in the notes. The pace was too quick to write down all of these, and when you would be going through the notes, it was sometimes hard to figure out how to get from \"A\" to \"C\" without having an explicit connection.",
    "Some summary \"cheat sheets\" would really help students navigate through all the material."

    "Hannah Bement was very helpful--a great discussion leader, and always available for discussion.",
    "Instructor was very available.The TA's office hours did not make sense, they were too far in advance from when the homework was due which proved to be very frustrating. Better coordination at the instructor TA level needs to happen.",

    "The professor's willingness to answer all questions, no matter how simple they were, and to do so with enthusiasm, was of the highest quality. He made himself easily available and is very approachable.",
    "The professor made himself very available for consultations on the final project.",
    "The professor went out of his way to make time for people.",
    "The instructor was often overly booked and had trouble responding to emails with basic questions. I often found that his office hours were full, making it challenging to meet in person. Clearly he is in high demand.I worked with the TAs regularly, and found their help to be of mixed quality and usefulness. At times it was very helpful, and allowed me to succeed in finishing my homework. They were regularly available for assistance, and their office hours were most useful. That said, at times I was misguided by their direction, and received revised guidance from the professor. In the future, I would request that the TAs be fluent with Minitab, since that is the software used in class.",

    "Instructor was always available and helpful.",
    "Instructor was great and kept more office hours than most other professors. I did not seek out the TAs.",
    "The review sessions with the professor were very helpful, but only if you already slightly understood the topic. If you did not know where to start, it was hard to know what to ask. The review sessions with the TA were less helpful. It may be better to have two or three full time TAs next time, so homeworks can be graded and returned before the midterm and the final, and so you have more than one personto go to for help if one is not helpful.",
    "Excellent!",
    "Office hours and locations of TAs were unpredictable, grading was very hard, feedback was delayed for problem sets, and often unhelpful.",
    "Great help from Professor Reuning Scherer, I had gone to the TA's help sessions earlier in the semester and been discouraged, they were frequent changes to where the TAs were holding office hours and sessions were not especially helpful. But Professor Reuning-Scherer was always available on email and in his office, I really appreciated that.",

The male TA seemed very unapproachable.And most of the class didn't even know we had a second TA. This also highlights how inaccessible this second TA, the female TA, was. She held office hours in places that were least conducive to studying. She held her office hours in cafes and places rather distant from Kroon Hall. Her office hours were held in the times of the week when students were least likely to seek help, Sunday nights at 8pm. And she constantly changed her office hours an hour or two before they started, or she would change locations in the middle of her hours.Sections would have been very helpful in the course. Students could not rely on the TAs for this course for help.",
    "I did not find Jeff to be patient. He appeared frustrated and bothered when responding to students' questions. There were times when I felt unwilling to seek help because of his attitude.Ms. Ma was not very helpful either. She was oftentimes engaged in activities or chatting online while students asked questions and spoke in a condescending fashion. Furthermore, sometimes rather than explain how to solve a problem, she would just show you how to get the answer. I never sought her help again after this experience.",

    "Exceeded expectations.",
    "No. This is my first term as a traditional college or university. As one of the top-ranked institutionsin the world, I was expecting a greater capacity for successful research AND pedagogical practice. As is often the trend in higher education, skilled practitioners are not always skilled educators. This is not to say that the instructor is not a skilled educator, but only that the course did not live up to my expectations in terms of how the material was delivered, and what I was able to retain as a result of the pedagogy. There is room for improvement in instructor-student feedback cycles, and adaptive education in response to that feedback.",

    "Yes. Would have also liked one lecture on skills for evaluating others' studies; the ideas are implied from learning the course material, but it would still have been interesting to discuss how to go about assessing a study you read in the literature.",

    "Yes!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes",
    "yes.",

    "I did receive further familiarization of statistics, as I had expected. But, I did not receive the depth of training that I was expecting. I question whether or not I am prepared to continue with further statistical training, and feel that I may need to re-take this course to grasp the material with enough certainty that I feel proficient with the methods. I feel that the instructor should significantly reduce expectations of what material will get covered. It is far more useful for student to understand and be able to use fewer methods appropriately, than to have only vague concepts of many methods. This is not to say that all the concepts should not be covered, but more that they should only be covered if people are sufficiently grasping the material.",

    "Helpful and a great way to utilize the strengths of your peers to turn in assignments and analyze data.I would highly recommend that students taking this class form a study group that consistently meets to complete assignments!",
    "We've learned from each other doing team projects together.",
    "Yes. Good to get someone else's perspective, but also heads can butt.",
    "Group work was great. More group work would have been helpful!",
    "It shared the burden of work but it was disorganized and frustrating because we had such different schedules for finals.",
    "My work group was not formal, but I often met with other students. The work group was essential, since individually we were unable to complete out-of-class assignments. Collectively, we were often able to struggle through, though not without difficultly and some level of uncertainty. I also met with the TAs one or more times each week. This was essential for clarify vague concepts and receiving more directed assistance.",
    "Definite advantages - I was struggling a bit with the material without my partner - together we were able to talk through the issues. No complaints about group work for this class.",
    "best way to learn",
    "Good for homework, but bad when it came to doing the midterms by yourself.",
    "Very helpful in figuring things out, and also moral support.",
    "Fine, useful to be able to do problem sets with classmates",
    "For me, there were really only advantages to group work, because working on the problem sets in teams was not only fun but an incredibly useful learning experience each week. There were really no disadvantages to group work, since tackling the problem sets alone would have taken me far longer. Of course, that made the midterms (completed solo) a little trickier, but Prof. R-D does a good job adjusting the tests for solo work after the teamwork of the semester's problem sets.",
    "It's nice to be able to talk with and work though problems with people.",
    "Being allowed to work in groups on homework and final project was GREAT.",
    "N\/A",
    "We got to play with statistics more intensively, it was a good exercise.",
    "I did final project in group. It was wonderful to work in group because it is here I learned a lot. I could clarify many concepts of statistics from my friends. It was a wonderful experience.",
    "Helped me to asses my abilities to work in a team Overall, was a good learning experience",
    "Team learning is helpful because you resolve problems together. Coordinating group work can be burdensome",
    "The option of doing homework together as groups (with individual submissions) was welcome.",
    "There was no way I could do the homework on my own. I did not understand the class material and there were no TA sections; the TAs were very inaccessible and unapproachable, and I didn't feel comfortable with taking my very basic questions individually to the professor during his office hours. Working with a group was the one thing that got me through the homework assignments.",
    "The advantages is that I was able to see how other students worked through questions. The disadvantage was that not everyone carried their own weight.",
    "It was helpful to learn from other students who understood the concepts better than I did",
    "To talk out concepts\/look for appropriate commands in Minitab"

    "Start early with the problem sets.",
    "Read Deveaux's textbook. It's very clear and helps solidify material.",
    "I would highly recommend that students taking this class form a study group that consistently meets to complete assignments and go over concepts. It was invaluable to my success in the class.",
    "Try to follow all assignments that professor gives.",
    "If you are confused, GO TO OFFICE HOURS and get help early.",
    "Sigh up for office hours with the professor!",
    "Seek help early and often.",
    "Buy the textbook and read it for conceptual understanding. It is helpful for putting together the pieces in the lecture notes.",
    "This course provides lots of tools that scientists will need to know, but if you want to learn each of these concepts well you need to do the reading in the textbook. The class simply moves too fast to get a good understanding of concepts and tools just through attending class and using course notes.",
    "Keep up",
    "1.) Be prepared for 15-20 hours a week for coursework.2 1.) Be prepared for 15-20 hours a week for coursework even if you have already had statistics before.2.) Press the instructor to follow some text closely, and to specify specific readings that address concepts presented in class.3.) Be prepared to do reading, since in-class presentations are not sufficient for grasping the material.4.) Don't forget that everyone is in the same boat... If you are not understanding, chances are many other people are not understanding.5.) Exams are open-book, which is excellent.6.) Be prepared for a mid-term, final exam (called a second \"mid-term\"), AND a final project.6.) General critique: I felt that the class was good, and covered interesting and relevant material. Unfortunately, the instructor moved far too quickly, leaving many students with only vague ideas of what methods to use or how to use them. Student confusion was common, and the instructor used his humor to gloss over this. I did not feel there was adequate student-teacher interaction in the course, such that there was not constant delivery of feedback to the instructor, against which he could adjust his methods. This is the fault of both the students and instructor.",
    "take it.",
    "Try to do as much as you can on your own before seeking out help of friends on homework. Work on the project throughout the semester if you can.",
    "Buy the big textbook. Be prepared for long homework sets. Audit if you feel at all comfortable not needing to know every little thing about stats. For example, if you are not doing research or if it is simple enough that you can just take your data to a statistician, auditing may be sufficient. You just need to learn the language.",
    "Pick one textbook and use it, sign up for office hours, do the homework with others, you will definitely get more out of it that way",
    "Have fun with the final project.",
    "Take notes on the class handouts.",
    "Go to office hours, and read a text book even if it is not required.",
    "If you are thinking of learning statistical analytical skill, you should take this course. It is a very good introductory class. The only problem with me was language.",
    "You've made a good choice!! Be consistent with the weekly assignments.",
    "Go to the office hour sessions. This is the most important way to learn about how to actually do the homework.",
    "Work through the problem sets carefully and ask for assistance early on if you are having trouble. Also, purchase one of the stats books as a reinforcement for the lectures.",
    "Look for help soon in the semester. Follow up with your classes no matter what. Make your notes on the copies that Jonathan provides. Enjoy it cause you\u00b4ll realize who useful it can be.",
    "Keep up with the assignments and seek help often if you need it.",
    "Go to office hours regularly. If the notes aren't given as a continuous PDF, make one and share with friends!Also, group study is a great way to get through the problem sets, but make sure that you personally understand how to work through the problems. Go to office hours with problem set questions.",
    "The class starts off conceptual and then delves into a level of statistical analysis that is interesting to learn, but might not be necessary for every professional pursuit. However, the professor is extremely engaging and it is an interesting topic. The time you put into the class is directly related to what you get out of it."
