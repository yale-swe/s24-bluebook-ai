    "I would summarize the course to a fellow student as a required class or EEB first years, the aim of which is to introduce students to the breadth of research carried out in the department. I would not recommend the course to anyone outside of the department.",

    "I'm not sure that it did. From the sound of it, the second semester will be more useful. I think that a required course which actually teaches advanced topics in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology exclusively to first year graduate students would be incredibly helpful. Not only would it ensure that everyone is on the same page, but it would give an invaluable introduction to this department's unique perspective.",
    "It was great to hear from professors who I wouldn't normally get to interact with. I liked hearing about what they are interested in and what they work on. It was also great in terms of understanding the resources available in the department."
