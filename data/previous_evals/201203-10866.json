   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend it for people who want to learn not only about Wagner, but especially about opera production in general.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other graduate students (including those outside the music department) as an excellent introduction not only to Wagner's thought and stage practice, but also recent trends and problems in opera performance.",
    "This is a focussed, engaging seminar, which covers Wagner from a very specific and in-depth, production-related angle. I would recommend this to any music student, because regardless of one's interest in Wagner, the class delves into many facets of his work, making it interesting from many perspectives.",
    "I would describe the course as an approach to Wagner from a theater based angle - I could imagine recommending it to students with diverse interests since it addresses different disciplines (such as musicology, music history, dramaturgy, performance studies, literature, ...)."

   "comments": [
    "This course, with its variety of readings and source studies, has provided me with new tools that will help me in various theatrical, philosophical, and musical studies.",
    "It did not contribute directly to my dissertation project, but certainly broadened my scope. I found it very interesting to get to know different ways of approaching the controversial topic 'Wagner'."
