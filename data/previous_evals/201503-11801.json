   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have to, but you'll get so much more out of taking different classes. You skip all the interesting materials and the PSET problems are without examples and barely ideas of how to start them.",
    "EE202 covers a huge breadth of topics, ranging from codes to security to recommender systems. If you're interested in covering a lot of interesting topics and have some linear algebra background, I would recommend it, although it is quite a bit of work and can feel overwhelming at times.",
    "I took this as a fifth course because I thought it would be fun. Not sure why I did that in retrospect. While it's not a very hard course, it's definitely not easy. Take it if you're truly interested in the material though.",
    "A lot of work, don't leave everything to the last minute",
    "The course is a cool intro to an interesting side of electrical engineering. It is well-taught and engaging. I'd highly recommend it.",
    "Favorite EENG course so far, with a great lecturer (Prof. Sekhar)! Covers a lot of topics without feeling like too much (data compression, networking, PageRank, automated classification, signal processing, just to name a few), but still in enough depth that one gets to appreciate the cleverness of the engineering solutions involved (you get to learn the algorithm that WinZip uses!). A course I'd recommend to even non-majors, because of how applicable and practical the concepts are (to anyone doing STEM research, or going into industry, or who just want to know something about the wonders of modern technology like the Internet or machine learning and how they boil down to fairly simple mathematical problems). (Overlaps to some degree with the first half of CPSC 323, but that makes it easier if you're taking them in the same semester!)",
    "EENG 202 supplies a wide scope of knowledge that will help you to understand a variety of different subjects within electrical engineering in order to determine if you find them interesting. The subject matter is hard, but Sekhar is a really great, very understanding teacher--if you end up unhappy with the class, you will know that you probably just don't like electrical engineering, since the class is so well taught. I would suggest this course to anyone potentially interested in engineering.",
    "Take this course! If you are an EE or even a ME then you should definitely take this course. Sekhar is one of the best if not the best engineering professor I have had (I am a senior). The information is very useful and helps you understand the most basic level of computing and communication. I cannot say enough good things about this course.",
    "The material was pretty interesting. None of it was too difficult; over all, this was a good, true survey course. It was a bit of math, but that seems unavoidable, so 202 seems to be better for those who have taken more math. It's worth it to wait, will make your life a lot easier. It certainly feels better than 200 and 201. The labs are far less time consuming, the tests are fair, and the homework is not super tedious. Prof. Tatikonda does a really good job teaching this course.",
    "Lots of varied and interesting practical topics related to network science (information encoding, transmission, error-correction, compression, encryption). Lots of very abstract algorithms and formulas. You do get to bring a note sheet into the exam. Sekhar talks and writes very quickly without stopping to explain the formulas so lectures can be tough, but Sekhar and Daniel will help outside of class. Group homework sessions are critical. At-home labs are fun and not too much work.",
    "Overall good course. I felt that Sekhar babied us a little too much and the course went too slow, I was really interested in getting to control, but we went too slow for that. Don't expect to gain a deep understanding of any of the topics.",
    "Expect a lot of interesting theoretical content, which you won't be required to go that in depth on. The class moves quickly, make sure to pay attention in class and briefly look at his course notes before lecture, or else it moves too quickly for you to understand. Tests are relatively OK, problem sets take a bit of time.",
    "202 is a great class. Pretty theoretical and math-heavy, but definitely worth it in terms of being exposed to a broad overview of many different topics.",
    "Great survey course. The math can get hard but the midterm and finals are far easier than the problem sets.",
    "Great survey of topics, interesting even if you're not an electrical engineer. The signal processing \/machine learning \/ data science area was pretty cool. There's a decent amount of math though, make sure to go to office hours to not get crushed by the psets.",
    "Good course, lot of material covered, great professor and TF. Take this class if you like signals. Also, one of the questions I was asked during an internship interview was on the material covered in this class, so I am really thankful for that.",
    "Absolutely take it. Sekhar is amazing and every lecture is extremely interesting. I took this class Cr\/D because I'm not EE, but totally regret doing this because I'm sure I would have aced the tests if I had studied a bit. Exams are perfect - they genuinely test your understanding of the material, and Sekhar even gives you the midterm after he grades it to take home, work on your answers, and resubmit for re grading. He really cares about his students, and you will learn something cool in every class."
