    "In L2, one learns a significant amount of French grammar (the remaining tenses and moods, for example), expands one's cultural understanding, and acquires a variety of expanded vocabulary.",
    "Learned some French.",

    "I felt like my French significantly improved from last semester and I learned a lot of new French grammar concepts quite well",
    "My ability to speak French increased a lot during L2. The instructor (Mme. Vysosias) was great and I feel I learned how to manage a large amount of homework during the course."

   "comments": [
    "The class's use of the Capretz method makes for an interesting, dynamic class where learning vocabulary rarely feels forced. It also allows for a natural progression of tenses and moods. However, the workbook exercises get longer and longer, requiring more and more time. By the end of the semester, they're ridiculously long, and doing the homework can take anywhere from a few hours to most of the afternoon.",
    "Good curriculum.",
    "The method is overall effective as it gives students a lot of practice and review without imposing an unrealistic amount of freeform studying. This makes grammar and vocab learning happen with fluidity and staying power. The main problem is the absence of conversational learning. And it can be quite boring.",
    "The French in Action curriculum is amazing and very effective in immersing the student in French. However, I sometimes felt that the workbook exercises were too long or repetitive.",
    "A strength is the French in Action methodology that facilitates a lot the way we absorb vocabulary and grammar. However, I believe the workload is greater than other Yale courses. It used to take me almost 1-1:30 hour every day to finish homework and we had a test and compositions every week."

    "I greatly recommend taking French at Yale. The department is phenomenal. Be aware, though, that your particular class assignment can greatly affect your experience.",
    "Yes, but not with the professor I had.",

    "Yes I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in French as Yale has a great programme",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student that really wants to learn French and is ready to the amount of work the course demands."
