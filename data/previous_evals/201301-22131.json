    "Russian language is a gem of a class. I will say it again, take Russian here at Yale. You will not be disappointed.",
    "Yes great class. Definitely take if you did l1 and 2",
    "If you have interest in learning Russian, take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, but just be aware that it is a very demanding course.",
    "This is an extremely demanding course, that can be both frustrating and rewarding. It's fun to see how much you've learned over the course of the semester. The course itself demands alot of study time, particularly since there is sometimes a disparity between what is covered in class and on exams."
