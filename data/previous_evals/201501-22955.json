   "comments": [
    "A pretty relaxed class where you work towards a final project at the end of the semester, and do readings throughout. Take it if Martin is teaching, as he will lead a class that is at once fun and thought provoking.",
    "This class provoked thoughtful discussion. Helped me develop into a more thoughtful artist. I wish there had been more required projects than just one. In class activities were interesting. Some days were a little haphazard. Very supportive cooperative environment.",
    "i would absolutely recommend this course! it was a refreshing course that i looked forward to every week and will miss so much now that it's over. it is very self-directed and we have ample time to develop an idea and work through it. this self-directed project is supplemented with excellent readings and exercises that really improved the way i think and talk about art and making.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to students who want to do their own sculpture project based on their own interests. It's a good chance for a student to carefully think about his ideas, and after distilling his ideas, he can produce a more thoroughly thought work."
