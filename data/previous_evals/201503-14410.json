To make in class group exercises work more smoothly they need to be very focused and with a lot of assumptions already made so that we can go deeper into a single topic instead of superficially through a spectrum of topics. I got more from doing the group projects as an entire class. IT kept us more focused on the topic."

Start earlier, and you wont have to drive yourself crazy at the end of the deadline. It seems so simple.",
