   "comments": [
    "Strengths: open discussion, variability in topics, engaging Weaknesses: daily quizzes, sometimes felt very unstructured and main point was not clear especially during the second module",
    "I was very disappointed with this course. While I am still very interested in the material, the way it was presented in class was not useful and often a waste of time. Debbie attempted to cover too much material in nearly all modules, and the quality of learning significantly suffered. In addition, assignments often did not relate directly to readings and topics covered in class, therefore, they felt like extra busy work, and the goals of the assignment were unclear. The final project was an interesting idea, but was poorly introduced to students. Extra parts to the assignment were tacked on during the last few weeks of class, which added unnecessary work without allowing students the opportunity to delve much further into the content of the actual research. In addition, the handouts in class provide unique and worthy examples, but they should be paired down to allow for more discussion. As a graduate student with important job and family obligations after class, I was also very frustrated that nearly every class ran over. Students are willing to respect the instructor's time, however, instructors must respect students' time as well.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Very interesting style of teaching and a great combination of biological versus abstract concepts. I found myself doing MUCH more work for this class than for my other courses.",
    "Fine course, not really up my alley with regards to teaching style. I appreciate the interactive nature of the course and the variety of assignments, but it frequently felt like the activities would be better fitted for a much younger audience than grad students. Prof. Humphries is very knowledgeable and I wish we got to know more of the science behind the food\/nutrition. I didn't feel like I learned much in class (though I did with the readings) and frequently was very bored in class.",
    "This course if wonder in understanding the general trends\/concepts in global food and nutrition as well as global food policies.",
    "A difficult course, but doable. Definitely not for individuals who may be committed to other time consuming courses since it will require some extra effort. However, you will learn a significant amount and develop incredible critical thinking skills.",
    "I really like this class. It could actually have another title like the nutrition and the global food system.... or something like that. Feel like I learned a lot. Would just like to encourage Debbie to provide some more instruction on any new programs or techniques she wants us to learn. Overall, I really enjoyed the course.",
    "Great course! Thoughtful lesson plans and course materials. Logical order of presentation. Interactive. Only recommendation would be to beef up the first unit a little bit to ensure students have a strong foundation for the later discussions. I had trouble remembering the different micronutrient details by the end of the semester and had to refer back to the materials from the beginning of the class.",
    "This course was amazing. It well balanced student interest and professor expertise without clearly answering our questions but leading us into the skills and thought process that could potentially guide us in our work in this field. The three modules offered us information about the food systems as well as conflicts in the study of it and current needs. We briefly looked at future realities, like waste and climate change, which threaten the systems, and hypothesized about a few solutions which may change the format.",
    "Really interesting."

    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries is great and very approachable. She encourages open discussion and questions and challenges her students to push their boundaries and think outside of the box. Dr. Humphries does a nice a job conveying the information through discussion, readings, and worksheets.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries is wonderful! She is always willing to discuss a large number of topics and her enthusiasm for almost all subjects really shows, both in class and outside of it.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Very nice and knowledgeable, didn't love the teaching style always.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is a great teacher! She organizes the class in a way that students could actively participate in the class through case studies and in-class discussions. I really enjoyed it!",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is an absolutely amazing and devoted professor. She really cares about shaping the next generation of public health professionals and tries her best to encourage curiosity in the field of nutrition. She's also wonderfully versed in the area which helped when we asked complex questions. However, her way of teaching is a little different as it is completely guided by students. It was a little difficult to switch from typical classrooms to hers, but once you get the hang of it the class can be very rewarding.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is awesome. I love the way she challenges us to piece together context clues to create our own understandings of different issues in nutrition.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries is wonderful! Really great teaching style that encourages critical thinking and analysis. Best discussion facilitator that I've had this semester.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries was excellent at teaching this course. She was very attuned to the needs and desires to learn of the students and put significant effort into both learning who we are as students and why we were interested in the course. She also gave us options, which was paramount in actually feeling involved in the course. Perhaps best about this course was that she was open to feedback at all times. She was careful to heed our wishes and be clear on aspects of the course which were solid and those that could be changed for the better.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Really great! Makes the class interesting with a lot of discussion"

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to another student because you gain so much knowledge through the open discussion. Hearing from others' experiences rather than reading in a book really drives the discussion and Dr. Humphries helps you deepen your knowledge.",
    "Relates heavily to infectious disease in developing countries, so not as useful if you are interested in chronic conditions.",
    "Definitely take this course! It covers much more than just nutrition and will challenge the way you think about global food and power chains.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this course. It's fine, but I didn't really like the teaching style. I appreciate the interactive nature of the course and the variety of assignments, but it frequently felt like the activities would be better fitted for a much younger audience than grad students. Prof. Humphries is very knowledgeable and I wish we got to know more of the science behind the food\/nutrition. I didn't feel like I learned much in class (though I did with the readings) and frequently was very bored in class. Many smaller assignments which often felt like busywork.",
    "Great course! I will recommend it if someone wants to learn general concepts of nutrition, global food trade and policy.",
    "I would recommend this course to individuals who are willing to put some extra time and effort into the projects happening throughout the semester. You will learn a great deal in a short amount of time, but need to contribute a good amount in order to get a lot of projects done.",
    "This is a worthwhile course for anyone interested in learning about nutrition and the global food system.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course. Workload is moderate, but each class is a lively discussion, and the course materials are very interesting. The class is planned out in such a way so as to bake in a lot of variety and perspectives. Will definitely keep you engaged throughout the semester, but beware that the reading and assignments ramp up towards the end of the class.",
    "This course gives a great look into the global aspects of food and nutrition (appropriately titled). It helped us to learn key aspects of the discussion as well as conflicts which exist among medical, public health, nutritionists, humanitarian workers, governments, and NGOs which support nutrition worldwide. Though complicated, it was entirely well-organized and deeply comprehensive to the extent that a semester long course is able to be. I loved the course, and am sure anyone else interested in nutrition and food, especially at a global scale would greatly appreciate the course.",
    "Really interesting. Would recommend"
