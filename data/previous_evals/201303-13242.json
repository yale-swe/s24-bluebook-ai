   "comments": [
    "The typical format of a class:One student passes out a handout with questions (and sometimes a brief summary) from the readings. Then, we would go through them and discuss. We followed the one-finger\/two-finger protocol, which was particularly useful.As the course went on, I think that our discussions calcified and became more professional (on the students' part\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093that is, the tenor changed and became higher-level and more well-informed). That was a really key dynamic that I appreciated throughout the semester. I'd definitely recommend the course to other students for that reason, as well as for the fact that it provided such a great springboard for studying for the comps and for doing further reading.",
    "yes, absolutely - very interesting and well taught",
    "I would recommend this class, but only if a student had plenty of free time (perhaps only two other classes). It is such a huge time commitment, that it is hard to do much else alongside it. But as far as how interesting and fun it was as a class, I would recommend it.",
    "Required for gaining IR foundations, a lot of reading, ideal learning experience if you put the work inAbsolutely would recommend, esp for first semester students",
    "Very thorough and good advanced intro to IR poli sci PhD students. It was of fundamental importance as someone in the field of IR."
