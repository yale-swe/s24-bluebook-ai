   "comments": [
    "I basically got an overview of all the math I have taken, and all the math I am about to take in the future. We went through Calc 1, 2, and 3, complex analysis and complex functions, vector analysis, vector spaces, linear algebra, and differential equations.",
    "This course was a good refresher on a lot of math topics ranging from the very basic \"what is a function\" all the way up through differential equations.",
    "Good review of Calc 3 and linear algebra, and good intro to differential equations.",
    "I learned basics of linear Algebra and gained familiarity with a few mathematical formulations common to the treatment of physical systems such as eigen value equations and differential equations (SHO, wave equation). The rest was review.",
    "Unfortunately, I had covered practically everything in this course until the last few weeks, which felt so rushed that I couldn't even absorb most of the information.",
    "Strengthened my calculus skills Gained a basic understanding of complex functions, diffeq, and lin alg",
    "Learned the basics of linear algebra and differential equations, most of the rest was review.",
    "Not that many. The first half of the course was material from Math 120, and the professor rushed through the second part of the course, which consisted of entirely novel techniques, that gaining an understanding of the material was very difficult. Only take this course if it is required.",
    "This course was a great review of most of the math I have learned so far. I felt like it really filled in a lot of gaps and solidified my foundation.",
    "I learned almost nothing new in the class. It was a waste of time but a nice GPA boost.",
    "This is a very good course for someone who has a background in pure mathematics that are useful to physics, or who wants to quickly work their way through some math useful for higher level physics courses. You learn fairly direct applications of everything from single variable calculus (which most participants already know) to basic differential equations and complex analysis among other things."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We spent SO long going over the stuff we already knew, so the first part of the class was super easy and the last 1.5 months were awful. I really think we could have reviewed calculus in about 4 lectures and just moved on, because I am finding myself rather confused due to the speed with which everything was thrown at me.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it goes over a lot of material already known prior to it- making it a good refresher\/reminder of important concepts and skills. The main weakness of this class is the pacing, and at times the content. The class seemed to be moving very slowly at first, but by the end of the course, the more important topics were merely glanced over (ie trying to cover all of ordinary and partial differential equations in two lectures). The lecture style of this course was also at times not very engaging nor interesting; this was made worse by the slow pace at times.",
    "The main weakness is that there is so much to cover that over a semester, there isn't a lot of room to develop a true understanding of the topics. If anything, I would maybe cut out the first half of the class. Most people who are taking this are most likely going to end up in a STEM major and already know the basics. I would suggest trimming the fat of this class and leaving a review of series, complex analysis, linear algebra, and differential equations.",
    "It was a freshman level course. It's a great review of the major mathematical concepts that we use in physics, but 85% of class was stuff I knew very well already.",
    "This course has the potential to introduce students to the tools of linear algebra and differential equations that they will need to understand physical systems. Unfortunately the class this semester fell short by focusing far too heavily on differential and integral calculus, topics that most students in the class had taken in high school and\/or freshman year. This meant that I learned very little while being bogged down by weekly psets. While it is important to review these topics, it should take a week max. Instead we spent practically the whole course on it and only spent one lecture on differential equations.",
    "I think the material covered in this course is generally pretty helpful, although the entire first month of material seemed to be more of an overview for EVERYONE rather than covering new topics. Professor Shankar's textbook is really bad, and it would be much better if the faculty chose a different mathematical methods text to use instead.",
    "This class spends way too much time covering calculus I-III. Seeing as though this course is a coreq for PHYS401\/PHYS410, the more advanced mathematics should be covered much sooner in the course. The vast majority (if not all) students were very familiar with calculus, and it would have been more beneficial to focus on linear algebra and differential equations. Also, for a math methods class for physics, there should be more problems that actually apply to physics.",
    "Covers many different subjects, but could spend more time on the math that physics sophomores and juniors likely have not yet seen (dif eq and linear)",
    "This course covers a large amount of material. Changing the professor to a math professor, or a professor that can manage time better and focus more on the second half of the book would help. Also, the textbook is a bad textbook that should be changed.",
    "I think that this course is a great survey course of a wide range of mathematical topics but could be improved by focusing more on the later more difficult topics. I think we could have gone through the earlier topics faster so we would have more time to focus on the later topics.",
    "This class was disorganized and remedial. It assumed zero background in math. The easiest way to improve this class would be to have a different professor teach it. Professor Baker was just bad all around. The one saving grace was that it was really easy.",
    "I think that the course could go much faster through the single variable calculus sections of the course among other things in order to give more time to go into depth in the linear algebra and complex analysis section of the course. I also think that the textbook was a bit of a weakness and a different course text could have helped significantly with understanding the work in depth. On the other hand though I think that the class came away with a thorough understanding of everything except the last days material."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, however take the math courses first. It may make things seem redundant, but it's a really helpful view for any physicist, especially due to the focus on applying concepts as opposed to learning about mathematical theory. But the only parts of the class I enjoyed and got things out of were the things with which I was already at least a little familiar.",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a fairly chill math class that reviews a lot of prior topics. Also Professor Baker is a genuinely really nice person.",
    "I would recommend this, especially if you need to complete a course in diffeqs and this counts for that (astro majors!)",
    "If you actually want to truly learn math, especially linear or differential equations, then avoid this course like the plague. It is great for strengthening your understanding of basic math, but as far as learning, nah bro. Run away. Just do the classes individually.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who would like an overview of mathematical topics useful to physics. While some of the class will be review if you have taken other math courses, it does cover a lot of new topics and helpful tricks.",
    "Take it freshman or sophomore year. It would be hard for someone new to calculus, but a good review otherwise",
    "NO! If you are a physics major don't bother with this class and go find one that's useful in the math department. I hear there is a good graduate course on abstract vector spaces and linear algebra or something that will actually teach you the concepts that you need. As it was taught this year, there was only one lecture on differential equations so now I have to go take diffeq anyway. Ask Professor Baker if he has changed the course to significantly reduce the review of differential and linear calculus. If not, that is really all you will do.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student if they were actually interested in learning mathematical methods. I would instead recommend a Diff-Eq course or something else, which despite its more specific topics would at least provide a learning experience.",
    "This class was enjoyable, and gave a pretty broad and shallow overview of basic mathematical tools. However, if you are a physics major who has no experience with linear algebra and\/or differential equations, this class moves way too slowly to be useful in PHYS401\/PHYS410, and you are better off taking a true math class.",
    "It conveniently covers the major requirements but if you want an in depth understanding of the methods you may want to supplement with another course.",
    "No. I would not recommend this course to other Yale students. It is poorly taught, has a bad textbook, and does not allow you to get a deeper understanding of mathematical methods, nor does it provide you with a chance to review previously learned material. Moreover, when a common answer to questions from the professor is \"you don't really need to know this. Just look it up online\" is an answer, something is wrong.",
    "I would it is a solid foundation.",
    "I recommend it only if you need it for your major or if you are willing to trade a semester of wanting to rip your hair out for an easy A. Don't go to lecture. It's remedial math and was generally miserable. The syllabus says that the final is cumulative, but that's a lie (which was sucky because all the stuff at the beginning of the semester would have been a slam dunk). The expectations in this class are so painfully low.",
    "If you already have a lot of math and are looking to go into physics, I would recommend this course unless you have a rock solid understanding of how some of the math simplifies and how you can use it in classes like Classical and Quantum mechanics. I would also recommend the course to anyone without a strong math background looking to do advanced physics quickly."
