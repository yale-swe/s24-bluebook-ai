    "It is a survey of Major English poets with historical insight that I did not know existed. This was my first Yale course in literary analysis, and it blew my mind. It's wonderful. I absolutely want to continue on the English track.",
    "Challenging, Rigorous, Fascinating, Inspiring, and Worthwhile. Professor Patterson is amazing, though she will be tough on you. I can't describe how much I've grown, though, in my writing and understanding of literature. A great exposure to works you otherwise might never read.",
    "As an English major, I had to take this course as a prereq. Honestly, I wasn't looking forward to it, I've never really liked poetry and intend on focusing on classes concentrating on novels, essays, and short stories. The class was manageable, but I really don't suggest taking it unless you like poetry or you have to for the English major. Learning to read Middle English was incredibly difficult, and I wish we had spent more time discussing how to properly interpret different words.",
    "A good class - lots of reading which can be slow going (particularly Chaucer) but if you get a good prof. it is totally worth it. I sort of wish we spent more time on Spenser and Donne (not that Chaucer and Shakespeare aren't interesting, but...). Prof. Patterson is amazing. She knows so much and is great at leading discussion. She asks for longer papers (7-9 pages) which seem slightly intimidating at first, but they give you a chance to analyze more deeply.",
    "English 125 is a challenging but rewarding course. In one sense, the title really gives it all away -- you'll cover the Major English Poets from Chaucer to Donne -- but the course is also a great introduction to writing academic works on literature. Though some of the material can be dry, I found that the course made me realize that one need not love the books they're discussing to love the discussion. Some of much of what makes this course great also comes from the people in it -- most are future English majors or are already declared, so they take it quite seriously -- and the connections they make to the world of literature beyond the course. I will say that though this is an introductory course and can be a great intro to English\/essay-writing at Yale, a majority of the students were sophomores (and many former DS students) with a lot of essay experience under their belts, so the course doesn't go out of its way to literally instruct on essay-writing strategies. However, if you enjoy learning through practice (and building a strong literary foundation) you'll enjoy this course.",
    "I took ENGL 125 thinking I might major in English. Now that I've finished it I know that I'm not going to be an English major, because I enjoyed the history classes I took this semester far more than I enjoyed this class. That being said, I enjoyed this class more than I expected to, especially Chaucer and Donne. Class discussion is good if you can work around the kids who just finished DS and are really thirsty to talk every five minutes. Annabel is really funny and did a great job teaching the class. There was not a lot of reading and the papers were manageable.",
    "English 125 is a decent class on The Canterbury Tales, Shakespeare's Sonnets, The Faerie Queene, and Donne's poetry. If you have interests in these four works, then go for it. But they don't really speak to each other, and it feels like a lot is left out between them. ENGL 124 doesn't focus on the dialogue between these works, or give an overview of literature happening from these times, but you learn a lot about these specific works.",
    "Great course to take, but can be a bit of a gut check",
    "I recommend it. It definitely depends on the professor though I think. I lucked out and had an awesome professor who clearly loved the subject.",
    "This is a GREAT syllabus, but in general subject to the whims of whatever professor you happen to get. Annabel Patterson is a badass and if you can take it with her, absolutely do. She is fiercely intelligent and makes class an adventure. The quality of the discussions that she lead were generally high (although she ends up talking for a lot of classtime mind you, this is not necessarily a bad thing, because she knows so much and has such interesting things to say about a particular text)."
