    "YES. Take it for sure if you want to improve your Japanese.",
    "The first level of L5 Japanese focuses on written material, pulling from Japanese short stories and television programs. Class is mainly focused on going through these original sources and pulling grammar and vocabulary from these encounters. The vocab& grammar are a little random, but obviously pertinent to the subjects immediately at hand!",
    "As a non-native Japanese freshman taking this course, I found it to be manageable with 4 years of high school Japanese under my belt. Stever and Maruyama sensei are AWESOME and super nice about everything! There is a good amount of homework everyday, but that's to be expected.",
    "This is a great continuation of Japanese language study. The material is really cool because it's based on actual essays, poems, anime, etc. that puts the vocab and grammar in context. It scared me at the beginning because I hadn't spoken Japanese all summer, all of my classmates had gone to Japan over the summer, and the class itself is fairly challenging, but after a few weeks I was back up to speed. A super interesting class with great teachers, I recommend it!",
    "Personally I found L5 to be much less organized than the beginning classes, as the class mainly revolves around reading random drama episodes and essays, etc. Handing in many loose pages for homework can quickly become a hassle. However, fourth year Japanese (156) is SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult. So if you're placed into this class, shop it before you decide. Also, 9 am language class is a huge pain."
