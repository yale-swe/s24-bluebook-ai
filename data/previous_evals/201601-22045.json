    "I would recommend the class with the understanding that lectures can be a bit dry but section really brings everything together and the workload is manageable.",
    "It's an average history course, probably well below many other classes offered by an otherwise very good department. The material is super interesting, but Professor Kiernan's teaching style is very boring and unattractive. Most people in the class ended up not paying attention to class which is a shame since the material is interesting and relevant to understanding this fascinating part of the world. Also a good class if you want to get a basic understanding of European colonialism and anti-colonialist movements.",
    "An extremely brief overview of Southeast Asian history-- important but kind of rushed and disorganized."
