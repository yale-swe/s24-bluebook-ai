    "It is a relatively time-consuming classes. You would need to read and study a lot on your own to really know those spectroscopies if you are not familiar with it before.There are 2 mid-terms and 1 final paper\/presentation.",
    "I would recommend it for those interested in either spectroscopy or those who have any interest in biochemistry. It was a good class that delves into spectroscopic methods that may be new and covers how they can be used to study metalloproteins.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone in inorganic or chem bio as it has relevant techniques and information for both topics.",
    "A good class for students interested in the subject. Final paper and presentation prepares for the future task of a researcher."
