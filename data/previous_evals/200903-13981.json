    "I would recommend it, with the caveat that the workload is absurd. There is no justification for the amount of work required in this course.",
    "I would recommend CS433, but only if you really really like energy drinks and sleep deprivation. This course is the exact opposite of a gut, if there's such a thing: expect a heavier course load than CS323 and most other undergrad courses, except maybe some D.S. courses.The course material is very interesting, and you'll appreciate the course after taking it, and you'll recognize that you'll appreciate it later while you're taking it, and it'll make you a better programmer and possibly a better person in general, but it'll also completely suck in the process.",
    "This class will teach you how the Internet works.",
    "This is a very well taught class about very interesting and important subject material. The total workload is not too bad, but it is concentrated into a small number of assignment. One assignment involved programming a TCP-clone with a subset of TCP's features. This was probablty the hardest assignment I've had here other than 323's LZW.",
    "This course is really hard, though you learn a lot. The material is really interesting, and the class and textbook are good, but the assignments are an enormous amount of work."
