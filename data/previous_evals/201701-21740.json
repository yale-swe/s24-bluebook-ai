   "comments": [
    "I hate demonstrations.",
    "I was scared to take this course but after taking it I realized I really enjoy biology. Not only did I learn that I like biology, but I also learned not to be afraid to take courses that you've heard are difficult. Props to the professors for taking feedback from past courses and changing it for the better.",
    "I developed a better understanding of cell biology and more biological process that built off what I learned in biology 101.",
    "Learned a lot about cell functions and how the cell works. Learned a lot about the different ways that scientists have determined how cells function, like the different tests that they run. I think that was very beneficial in understanding how we know all these little details about the cell.",
    "I learned a lot about specific biological processes and interactions between cells and within cells.",
    "Learned a lot about cell biology and some about lab techniques",
    "More about the cell",
    "I gained some knowledge about biology.",
    "A greater ability to analyze data and form conclusions, a greater ability to call upon prior knowledge and apply it to new situations.",
    "I learned a lot of the body on a cellular level.",
    "I learned about many of the major topics in cell biology. This course also taught me many of the experimental techniques used to study these topics.",
    "I learned to adopt new study habits that would help me perform better in the course and I also learned to analyze data and form conclusions based on my knowledge and the data presented.",
    "I learned a lot about creating experiments that applied knowledge from the lecture.",
    "Basic cell\/structural biology knowledge.",
    "Focused heavily on signaling.",
    "I memorized many specific pathways. It wasn't worth it.",
    "I learned the introductory concepts needed for cell biology.",
    "Lots of info about cell bio, lots of application practice that I enjoyed and good thematic learning.",
    "I learnt to thin critically and memorize its of stuff.",
    "A lot of experimental techniques and learned about a few cellular processes in depth.",
    "Continued to develop my understanding of basic biology concepts.",
    "I learned a lot about cells and their functions!",
    "Experimental methods regarding cell biology.",
    "I learned about cell systems and about the techniques used to study them. I learned the importance of working with others, and that scientific papers are very difficult to read if they are not annotated.",
    "I learned how to think about questions experimentally instead of just memorizing facts.",
    "Refreshed knowledge from BIOL 101, learned a lot about cells",
    "I learned the basics of cell and membrane biology, as well as how to study for memorization-heavy courses and apply my knowledge in experimental settings.",
    "great class! learned a lot about what biology actually looks like in the lab; learned a lot about the scientific approach and experimental design, and about the continuous evolution in knowledge of the field.",
    "I learned a lot about biology. Good course.",
    "I learned many concepts and facts about biology, and found myself learning to study more effectively within groups.",
    "I learned specific functions of eukaryotic cells and how they interact with one another.",
    "This course really was fantastic with getting students to apply their knowledge in a practical way. The problem sets were short, fair, and made students think about the material in an applied way. The quizzes served as a way to keep students up to speed with the material and to be prepared for each lecture, although it was easy to skim the readings or use the find option to find the answers to the quiz questions (or to get them from other students) because they were open note. Still, I think the quizzes were important to keeping students on track. The lectures were interactive and well put together, although sometimes it could be hard to keep everyone in such a big class engaged. I learned a foundation of knowledge vital for any lab research position or for any future scientist, so although a lot of people only took this class as a prerequisite, it serves its purpose.",
    "In addition to learning about cell biology, we also learned about the different lab techniques used to study cell biology and membrane physiology.",
    "A lot about cells and cancer.",
    "Lab techniques and how to design experiments and protein assays without every having seen or used the equipment necessary for such tasks",
    "In depth biological processes of a cell.",
    "continuation of bio 101",
    "I learned a lot of processes related to cell biology.",
    "I learned a lot of material related to the biology of the cell. I also learned a lot about experimental methodology and how to approach formulating experiments.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about cells, reviewing what I learned in high school and going much more in depth too. I also gained better time management skills through this course because of the structure of the course.",
    "I learned about various cell processes in greater depth than high school biology provided.",
    "I learned a lot about the processes involved in very specific parts of cell biology (ex: nuclear import), but most importantly I learned about the ambiguities left in science and methods by which we can approach those ambiguities. I think even more than the specifics we had to memorize, Professor Horsley greatly cultivated our abilities to create methods by which we can test for specific functions (and this is really cool and I'm glad I learned it!)",
    "You learn very specific details and facts about cells! Horsley does a great job of lecturing and she makes it interesting--she has some dry humor and honestly it's hilarious. I really appreciate her ongoing joke about her love for skin as well. If you take this course you'll learn to read the textbook for things you need to know and things you don't need to know. Honestly, one of the best learning tools is learning how to use Piazza. Don't get too worked up if the questions seem WAY too in depth and irrelevant--use Piazza for the lingering questions you have and also to help answer any questions your peers might have.",
    "This class was great for developing techniques in experimental biology. High school biology is very big on covering an immense amount of detail and a lot of memorization. Biology here is much different. There is hardly any detail or memorization. Instead you learn critical thinking and problem solving with experimental techniques.",
    "This course introduced cell biology through focusing on a few important processes (e.g. nuclear import, cotranslational translocation). I learned central concepts in cell biology through learning these processes.",
    "I learned about a variety of complex biological processes in a manner that was not too difficult to understand. This class gave a great introduction to many of the processes that occur at the cellular level. The complexity of the concepts in this course also made me learn how to effectively master complex ideas. I learned how to use themes to better organize and view such ideas, allowing me to better grasp and appreciate them. This skill should serve me well in future classes.",
    "I learned how to apply many experimental techniques that we learned about in lecture, which I think will definitely serve me well when I start working in a lab. I also appreciate how the experimental techniques were integrated into the material. Almost every major topic had experimental techniques associated with it, which allowed for there to be consistent reinforcement.",
    "This class is a great introduction to different different techniques used in labs as well as some mechanisms used in cells.",
    "I feel like I gained a lot of knowledge about cell biology, much of which is applicable to future labs\/research projects. I am much more confident in this field and it made me look forward to future biology courses!",
    "I learned how to understand the processes that go on in cells much more deeply than I ever have before. Unrelated to the course material, I also learned that going to enrichment\/tutoring is always helpful and never something to be ashamed of because it helped me a lot.",
    "I learned a lot of the basic bio that I can use later throughout my time at Yale, but also as I walk around and live life. Cool course!",
    "The basics of cell biology; an overview of how cells exercise control including an introduction to signal transduction.",
    "Developed a strong understanding of biomolecular pathways and cell biology",
    "The course provided a comprehensive understanding of the basics of membrane and cell biology, the experimental techniques used to study them, and scientific problem solving skills.",
    "I learned about how to think as an actual scientist, and how to use information that I'm given to solve some of the problems that real biologists think about in the real world.",
    "Helped me become knowledgable about many of the different physiological mechanisms involved in this course. Helped me out in other classes.",
    "I learned about some aspects of cell biology.",
    "My knowledge in the biological sciences were very strongly reinforced in this class. I feel that i learned a lot of things that i did not know before. I learned how to synthesize knowledge and create experimental procedures, amongst other things.",
    "Very much so how to look at data and make interpretations of it.",
    "I learned a lot about cell bio and membrane physiology.",
    "I learned about membrane structure and function as well as a diverse range of analytical laboratory techniques and experimental methods.",
    "How to conduct basic scientific experiments with hypothesis, control, and expected results",
    "Learned a ton more about cell processes that were generally outline in high school, so the fact that I had basic knowledge about the subject made its intricacies much easier to comprehend. Developed an ability to create and detail laboratory procedures and understand the proper applications of lab equipment and tests.",
    "I learned about how to apply factual knowledge to experiment and method based scenario questions.",
    "This course focuses on the specifics of cell biology and I thought it enhanced the concepts gone over in biology 101.",
    "This course was a great introduction to cell biology. The course content was clearly presented in an organized and engaging way. Was overall a very challenging but enjoyable class!",
    "I now know that my style of studying is horrible and needs to be changed.",
    "I learned about methods of experimentation in cell biology.",
    "I developed a lot of knowledge about the cell and how it functions which was very interesting.",
    "I learnt how to memorize large amounts of texts.",
    "I learned all about the functions of cells and some fundamental cell processes.",
    "I learned a lot of cell biology! Definitely stuff that was not covered in AP bio, as well as some stuff that was which I needed a refresher on. Good bang for your buck, this class",
    "More in depth knowledge about specific systems in cell and membrane physiology (as opposed to general knowledge taught in AP biology). No new skills really",
    "I learned about cells and the mechanisms of cell organelles.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundations of cell biology.",
    "I learned that simply memorizing a pathway is not enough, you must understand how it works and the concepts behind it.",
    "I developed knowledge about the biology of cells as well as modern techniques used to study it.",
    "I developed the skill of how to create experiments to figure out what I wanted to find, how to manipulate experiments to cater to different purposes. I learned a lot about different experimental techniques, such as fluorescence microscopy.",
    "A preliminary understanding of cellular biology. This included organelle structure and function, signaling pathways (g-protein and kinase dependent), how proteins or molecules are targeted to specific membranes, and nuclear as well as membrane transport.",
    "I learned that I don;t like science, but my favorite science class is biology.",
    "I learned more about Cell Development and Signalling. I honed my basic biology skills in this course.",
    "As part of the introductory biology sequence, this course continued to help me establish a foundation for the biological sciences, with this time being a focus on membrane and cellular processes.",
    "We learned about topics in cell biology, including a detailed study of cell organelles, cell adhesions, cell movement, and cell replication. We also learned experimental design and tools used in cell biology labs to study cells.",
    "Some basic cell bio knowledge and simple experiment design."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I very much appreciated all the activities that Professor Horsley did during class with volunteers to help us understand certain cell processes. Although they were a little weird sometimes, they undoubtedly kept the class engaged. The meme contest was also a great idea, especially for our very meme-inclined class.",
    "I did nit receive my midterm until the last week of classes, the course switches between either extremely generic and simple concepts and rote memorization of insignificant facts.",
    "I thought a strength was the section review and class organization in general. Something that could be improved would be more practice problems\/practice tests before the midterm and final.",
    "I think that the material in this course is very interesting, but it is quite complex and I wish it was taught in a better way. I often found myself very bored or confused in lectures because of the way it was taught, thus requiring me to go relearn much of the material on my own time. I think if perhaps the course material was more concretely outlined, it would be better.",
    "The readings were too long and went over far too much material, much of which was not emphasized in class if it was gone over at all. During lecture, Professor Horsely would get too caught up in answering questions that were beyond the scope of the course so that she would not be able to finish the chapter material. It would have been much better if these questions had been answered on Piazza instead, or perhaps after all of the lecture material had been covered. This emphasis on questions made lectures very boring. And finally, it would be better if there was a practice exam or more practice problems in order to practice applying knowledge more before the midterm\/final.",
    "Sometimes lectures got a little boring and slow. Discussion sections were unnecessarily dumbed down to the point where I felt like I was back in kindergarten. Also discussion sections didn't really help. Some of the material I felt got too in depth and too detailed for an intro course. I enjoyed learning about the different tests that scientists run and I thought it really added some validity to what we were learning.",
    "Well-organized; wish the PPT slides had info like they did in BIOL 101",
    "Not super engaging. Discussion sections were boring. Never got comments on HW or what you did wrong.",
    "I don't think that the course had enough of an emphasis on the scientific papers.",
    "Strengths: The subject matter is interesting, and the class moves fast and efficiently. Weaknesses: Lectures aren't engaging. When the professor tries to \"relate\" to the students with reenactments on stage, etc., it comes off as forced and cringeworthy.",
    "This course offers enrichment which aids with understanding of the material. However, the lectures are often vague in which material is necessary to focus upon.",
    "The strength of this course is its many options for student involvement (discussion sections, Piazza, etc.). For me, these helped to facilitate student learning. However, I found lecture to be somewhat disorganized. Also, the topics focused on in this course didn't always seem to be the most prominent (Why did we study migratory cells in such detail when they make up a very small portion of cells?).",
    "Samantha Lin and the enrichment sessions are definitely a high of this course. The enrichment sessions helped me survive through Biology 102. The lectures were interesting, but I felt as though everyone else had a much better grasp of the material than I did because of the high ended questions asked in lecture.",
    "Overall not a bad course, but the lecture slides started getting a little convoluted and unclear towards the end of the semester.",
    "The readings were always exponentially more detailed than the lectures themselves. Had the two been more on par, I feel I would have taken more away from the course rather than often struggling to consume facts.",
    "Professor sometimes didn't know what she was saying and seemed confused. Class material was interesting though.",
    "This course is a requirement for every premed and other Biology major. It's fairly difficult and not that compelling. It's more difficult than it should be, probably because it is so fixated on minutiae. The professor, Horsley, was tactless and boring. A strength may be that you learn a lot, but I don't think it's much in the way of building actual scientific literacy.",
    "I thought this course was a solid introductory course.",
    "Sometimes the lectures were dumbed down to the point where we were just told incorrect information. Also there were more than several mistakes in the overall lecture slides. Often times Professor H. got confused about the concepts herself, but I think biology is just a difficult area for anyone to perfect since it is a lot of pure memorization. However, we learned a lot of interesting things and the entire teaching staff was committed to answering our many questions.",
    "We spend too much time talking about extraneous info and not actually learning basic cell biology. All of the activities are pointless and a waste of time in lecture.",
    "Strengths: - Professors took student feedback seriously - Much time in lecture was directed towards answering questions - Interactive portions of lectures were nice, even if some of the reenactments were silly at times. The Cellvivor activity in which we defended the importance of different organelles was funny and helpful. -Study guides created for each lecture were very helpful Weaknesses: - Generally, the preclass quizzes did not actually push students to read the text. From what I saw, most students would simply search out the key terms for the answers - The lecture slide were often quite unclear. In several cases there were typos. Oftentimes, the slides would only use brief phrases that were unclear unless you were very diligent to ask questions and annotate during lecture. Going back to the slides while studying was sometimes difficult for this reason - When discussing cellular processes, we would often discuss both a general sequence\/pathway for that process as well as specific examples of pathways with specific proteins involved. While it is important to do this, it was sometimes unclear when the professor was speaking about a process generally (e.g. ligand--> receptor -->effector--> second messenger) or if she was speaking in reference to a specific example of that process (e.g. epinephrin--> B-adrenergic receptor--> adenylyl cyclase--> cAMP). It would have been helpful if the professor was more explicit when transitioning from generalization to specific examples. To the professor the distinction may be clear, but as a student hearing this for the first time, I often assumed that specific proteins named as an example were in fact more general.",
    "I liked the organization and format of the class in comparison to 101; the midterm\/quizzes were preferable to the weekly quizzes and final exam of the last module. The discussion sections were well run and I liked the fact that we discussed a question on the p-set during section (this was very helpful.",
    "The class is very well organized and expectations are clear. The homework isn't too much, and tests are very fair.",
    "The online quizzes did nothing to prepare students for the exam. Also did nothing to encourage reading course material. One could literally just \"command search\" the terms and find them in the textbook within minutes. Overall, the online quizzes for each lecture were completely useless and a waste of time. The professor exclaims in class that the quizzes are helping people understand the lecture, but that mindset is just not true. There were not enough practice problems available for the exam. The homework were very short and did not serve as sufficient material for exam studying. In BIOL 101, at least the in class quizzes helped a lot with exam studying, but this time around, the quizzes were utterly useless. The textbook also did not help much with doing well in the course either. The textbook was very detailed and often way to in depth for course material. If one wanted to read the book to study, they would have to disregard half of the material.",
    "First few intro lectures about microscopy, fluorescence, and basic cell biology could be streamlined and condensed to provide more time for other additional topics. Otherwise, the rest of the lectures were all very well planned out and informative.",
    "One of the strengths of this class was its focus on experimental design and cell biology study techniques\/equipment. Previous biology classes have taught aspects of cell biology without paying any attention to how these things came to be known about cells, so it was helpful to have that background. I also have a better idea now of how I would study cells if I had to do that for research. The main weakness of this course was its patchiness. We went into excruciating detail on some aspects of cell biology (for example, signaling pathwayswhy on earth is it necessary for us to memorize the names and abbreviations of all the enzymes involved in very long and complex pathways? What purpose does that serve?) and completely skipped others (no mention was made of photosynthesis and cell respiration, which are critical cell processes. I felt like I was doing a lot of memorizing of names and processes without having a good understanding of why I was memorizing them or in what order we were learning about cell processes and systems. This course would have benefited from a better outline and flow, and a focus more on the big picture instead of the nitty-gritty details. I also did not find the readings useful. They were very long and detailed, and I did not want to do long readings only to be told in lecture that most of the details I had just read were not even relevant to the course material. I much preferred the textbook used in BIOL 101 because I think the readings were more concise and less detail-heavy. I didn't think that it was a good use of time to go over homework questions in discussion section. Sure, I appreciated only having to think through half the homework by myself, but there were many complicated concepts discussed in class that we didn't touch on in discussion section because we spent time on the homework. I thought the homework assignments were relatively easy compared to the test questions and a lot of the lecture concepts, so it felt silly to spend so much time discussing the homework when we could have spent time going over the more challenging ideas in the class.",
    "Strength: discussion sections were very helpful weakness: it was hard to study for exams because we weren't supposed to memorize and we also got no practice exams",
    "Strengths: learned a lot of new things Weaknesses: - Very unorganized - Information presented in slides was often inaccurate - Quizzes contained a lot of errors (meant to be low-stress but the fact that there was so many errors often meant even more stress because students become even more confused)",
    "The lectures were very fast-paced, and I felt that it was difficult to process all the new information before moving on to the next topic. I really appreciated the Enrichment sections, as these cleared up a lot of confusions for me, and I was able to ask all my questions during these sections. It required a lot of work outside of class, as the concepts introduced during lecture were still confusing until I worked everything out multiple times outside of class.",
    "course was great; very supportive teaching staff, great professor, not many weaknesses",
    "The homework is fair. However, if you make a mistake a lot of points get taken off, the grading could be better.",
    "The strength of this course was the interesting material. Cells are fascinating. It could be improved with a more directed outline, though. We dove into certain topics in great depth, like signaling, but skimmed over many other important ideas, like plant cells. This inconsistency in an introductory course, which to me means a broad introduction to many different topics, confused me.",
    "Strengths of the course included the enrichment sessions. Weaknesses includes many of the readings, which did not often cover the same material as was covered in lecture.",
    "This course covers a lot of material. I thought that it was most interesting to learn about experimental techniques. Apart from that, it is quite a bit of memorization. I found the class lectures to be extremely boring and useless. I basically learned all of the material on my own using the posted lecture study guides.",
    "The strength of this course was that we efficiently covered a lot of information in a short time that will be an important base of knowledge for any student looking into careers in science. The workload for this course was easy, but it was hard to prepare for the tests because all the questions applied the factual knowledge that you had learned to experiment type questions. Students frequently asked questions in class but I thought this was not helpful to all the other students. A lot of specifics of cell biology are not known so it was hard for the professor to give reliable answers. This course was very fair in its workload, but sometimes it was difficult to judge how in depth we should study the textbook and the assigned papers.",
    "This course was definitely more difficult than 101 because it goes more in depth than 101. The course content is interesting and the professors and TFs are very available to answer questions, but sometimes the study guide and lecture notes do no agree with each other, which was confusing at times.",
    "The lectures were a little dry, but the discussion sections were very helpful.",
    "Strength: material Weakness: material must be learned on your own",
    "They really tried to make it a good course, and it was. I wish prof Horsley would take fewer questions, and summarize the mechanisms we learn about as we go. It was a good course though.",
    "I liked the TA sections and the peer tutors were very helpful.",
    "need more resources before exams",
    "The course covered a lot of important material in an organized way.",
    "I enjoyed the material covered in this class and felt that it proceeded at a good pace. The homework was manageable and didn't feel overwhelming, and I liked that in section, we would go over a problem together to give us a boost on the next homework. I appreciated that Dr. Horsley made an effort to engage students in lecture, even though sometimes her methods were not well received by students. I also felt that Piazza was a great resource and that the opportunity to get lunch with the professor was a really nice way to make a big class feel more personable.",
    "Large lecture class, but that can't be helped. Pretty good overall. Better than 101.",
    "The teacher was very bad at lecturing. The content was straightforward, but the lectures and slides were very disorganized which made it difficult.",
    "One huge weakness of this course was the frequent discrepancies between the notes and the textbook. Often, there were many details that seemed to be obscured by what the professor was saying and what the textbook was saying.",
    "Strengths are in the lecture materials and the stuff we learned. I think the lecture study guides could definitely be updated, and the readings were often way too complicated for the lecture material and could've been shortened and focused. The review sessions were SUPER helpful so definitely keep doing those and attending them.",
    "Strength: Handsdown the professor and the TA's. Loved the cohesiveness of the course and how much effort Prof Lin goes to keep things running smoothly. Piazza is incredible for this course!! Very fast and detailed responses and great student responses. I don't often see that so it's very insightful as to how helpful everyone is! Weakness: The quizzes were different this year in that they were pre class quizzes done on Canvas and were open notes. Easy points, but not a great learning tool. I wish there was another midterm so that if you didn't do so well on the first midterm you had another shot at it. Also the homework made it easy to lost points over little things.",
    "Professor Horsley taught this course very well. She was very kind and made the material a lot easier than it needed to be. The sections were extremely helpful and the way the quizzes were run this semester was also great. I just wish that the course had a bit more structure to it, and that the readings were somehow made relevant.",
    "Strengths: - Teaches many new concepts in a way that is not too difficult to understand - Encourages questions and participation, despite being a large lecture - Very interactive - Enthusiastic demonstrations - Practice questions during lecture are very useful - Fair assignments Weaknesses: - Demonstrations would be better if utilized for truly complex ideas - Assignments could afford to be a bit more difficult - Practice questions during lecture could also afford to be more difficult",
    "I liked that we had a midterm and a final rather than weekly quizzes and a final this semester. I found that having homework assignments, discussion questions, lecture slides, and piazza provided adequate preparation for both and allowed me to study at my own pace. I mainly used piazza for questions I had about the material, which I found extremely helpful because of how quickly the TAs\/Professor Lin responded and how thorough their responses were.",
    "The connection between the techniques we learn in class to the application of these techniques on questions in the exams is unclear.",
    "I absolutely loved this course! The lectures were interesting, section was engaging, and the homework assignments were challenging but fun. The only weakness I saw was that I preferred the weekly quizzes in Bio 101 as opposed to the short, open-note online quizzes in this class. I felt more accountable and impelled to study constantly when I had weekly quizzes, and I always did the reading assignments. With online quizzes I found myself more likely to skim. I doubt many students agree with me but I thought the in-class quizzes were beneficial, even if they were stressful.",
    "I think the course is great, although I don't feel like I benefit much from the discussion sections.",
    "The biology sequence is a difficult one. I don't mind the half-semester portions, but I do think that there should be another introductory biology option for non-premedical or undecided students. For students with limited background in biology, this sequence is very challenging. Even as a pre-medical student myself, I found it difficult. I did not take AP biology, but my research background really helped my understanding. Various research techniques were part of the curriculum, but not too well explained. I think that I would be very confused if not for my research background, so I think this is an area that should be better explained.",
    "Strengths: good section and other resources Weaknesses: lecture pace sometimes felt too slow or fast",
    "The weekly section reinforced and strengthened understanding of the material, and the professors and teaching assistants were all very approachable and hard-working. Additionally, I attended the Enrichment sections throughout the semester and consider this a huge strength of the course. Professor Lin is a very talented teacher and worked very hard to ensure that all students who sought help left with a thorough understanding of the material, and these sections were extremely helpful.",
    "This course is good because it allows you to really learn innovative and current techniques used in biology. However, this is an extremely difficult concept to grasp, and a bit more help in allowing students to be able to answer these questions is necessary.",
    "Interesting and challenging material. Boring lectures and useless section made officially being in the class a struggle though.",
    "I liked the emphasis on collaborative learning but I thought it could have been fleshed out more. Sections were helpful and felt like a good use of time. The lectures themselves were a little disorganized but all right.",
    "I liked that the course had a midterm and final as opposed to weekly quizzes and a final. I enjoyed the TA led discussion sections and the accessibility of all the professors.",
    "I liked the weekly quizzes in biology 101 a lot better. Being forced to learn material as we went worked well.",
    "I loved how in depth the course went into the material. I feel that it covered the \"harder\" material (ex. specific cell-cell adhesions, SRP, NLS) as fast as it covered \"easier\" material (ex. what's the cell cycle). I would have liked to spend more time on the harder material.",
    "Some strengths of the course are its building from foundational knowledge provided in BIOL 101, the vast variety of techniques and methods introduced, and the reinforcement of lectures with weekly discussion sections. One weakness of the course is that pre-class quizzes (unlike weekly quizzes given in BIOL 101) are easy to complete without doing the textbook reading and do not incentivize students to periodically look at new Piazza questions as the weekly quizzes in BIOL 101 did.",
    "Organized class, based entirely on lecture material, easy to understand if you pay attention, accessible material and resources",
    "Strengths: pre-class quizzes, mandatory sections, homeworks, review sessions Weaknesses: since a lot of the material is very in-depth, the lecture gets quite difficult to understand the first time around",
    "Strengths are that you can have a decent idea of what kind of things you are expected to know for the test. Weaknesses are that pre class quizzes are really easy so there is little incentive to keep up with the readings in a timely manner.",
    "I thought it was a great course overall! I really appreciated the online quizzes as opposed to in class quizzes and loved the enrichment sessions.",
    "BIOL Enrichment is a life saver! Amazing way to review\/discuss\/clarify main ideas presented in lecture. Also great way to meet some study buddies!",
    "Strengths: The TA's are amazing and really makes an effort to make sure everyone understands everything in the curriculum. Weaknesses: I felt like there was a huge gap between learning the material and applying it to practice scenarios.",
    "Covers the material thoroughly and in an organized manner.",
    "I feel as though this course was more about memorization from a slide about specific examples rather than core concepts. Although the concepts were emphasized as well.",
    "It has very interesting material but it is hard to stay engaged as the lectures are very long and intense with a lot of new information being taught.",
    "I enjoyed the structure of this course. The pre-class quizzes were much better than the in-class quizzes of Bio 101.",
    "I enjoyed Biology 102 far more than Biology 101. This was due to the organization, structure, and lecture style that was employed by Professor Horsley. Having the online quizzes before every lecture was a huge strength of the course that prepared me for every lecture. I also enjoyed having a midterm and a final to split up the material, rather than just having a final.",
    "I honestly don't think this course could have been improved. It was great. Valerie and Sam are fantastic. They're both very receptive to student feedback, which is really refreshing and really nice. When there were questions on the reading quizzes that lots of people thought were a bit too vague, they took the questions off and gave everyone points! How amazing is that? The teaching quality was also pretty great. The concepts were all explained very clearly and simply.",
    "The material was fine, I liked 101's structure of weekly quizzes better. The exams were not very well written, unlike in 101, So more time could be spent on that. It also seemed pointless to have a cumulative final",
    "A strength is that learning was cemented through discussion section, pre-class quizzes, and lecture. A way it could be improved would be to have more engaging lectures.",
    "Strengths are that the course material is very understandable. It could be improved with more textbook reading assigned.",
    "Sections are very useless in my opinion for this class.",
    "This course packs a lot of information into a very short amount of time; if there was any way to slow it down that would be helpful. Getting rid of the reading quizzes was very nice.",
    "i believe that the course is well-structured, but could be made a bit more engaging. While students are given tons of information in the lecture, they do not have the opportunity to think about the material more critically.",
    "strengths - material tested was mostly what was covered in lecture, sections were extremely helpful weaknesses - readings",
    "Strengths were that I feel like it did give me a good idea about what research was about, how to design experiments and such forth. I felt like I wasn't as prepared for the tests as I was for the quizzes in BIOL101. I would appreciate more opportunities to practice test-like questions throughout the half semester.",
    "I thought the lectures were well organized and delivered. However, sometimes tangents got in the way of learning the concepts. I think it would be easier to just go over concepts\/material in lecture and experiments\/examples in discussion section or vice versa. I also think that there could have been more practice through out the year (perhaps in discussion sections) designing experiments, as this was heavily emphasized on exams.",
    "The mini quizzes are just a joke. They didnt help me prepare and were simply a nuisance. Maybe just make the in class quizzes worth less but keep them for BIOL 102 too. This way we really learn in a ladder fashion.",
    "The weaknesses of this course are that Professor Horsley is not the best lecturer. She does not do a very good job of making the class interesting so sometimes I dreaded going to class. The grading is not always fair since each TA grades the assignments differently. This allows for some students to get more points on each assignment. Also, exam questions sometimes require too much inferring from the information that you have learned. The questions do not always make sense and sometimes the TAs and professors are looking for some obscure answer. This could be improved by making the questions more straightforward. Some strengths were that there is an Enrichment class and that Professor Horsley would demonstrate some of the processes in class.",
    "I think the introductory biology course is very well thought out, with this term's pre-class quizzes being the major deviation from 101. The pre-class quizzes helped me interact with the material multiple times and view lecture more as a learning time and not a testing time.",
    "Having the lecture slides beforehand proved to be helpful. It would have been more helpful to have practice exams for the midterm and final.",
    "One strength of this course is it's ability to cover such wide ground in a short period of time. I truly learned a great deal, and the material delved much deeper than what we had learned in AP. One weakness is that it's hard to get questions answered and confusions cleared up due to the large size of the class. Prof. Horsley did her best to address this by encouraging questions during class. Another weakness, in my opinion, was the way the Piazza forum was handled this semester. I sometimes waited days for a response to my question, or was referred to another question on the forum that didn't answer my original question.",
    "Unclear expectations for the final exam, which basically tested memorization of the last few lectures instead of critical thinking.",
    "The class was not very interesting or engaging. It focused very heavily on technology and not enough on the concepts."

   "comments": [
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "If you want to study anything in STEM then chances are you have to take this course anyway. Don't be afraid of the course going in. If you pay attention in lecture and section then you will be fine.",
    "Yes, I would recommend anyone who has an interest in biology or life sciences in general to take this course.",
    "This is just a course in the intro bio sequence that you have to complete. Do not take this course if you are trying to get excited about biology. It is not a particularly bad course, but it is not a very good course either. You can probably find a better biology course. Thinking back on it, all I can say is that BIOL 102 consisted of a lot of unnecessary assigned readings, boring lectures, and a hard midterm and final (lots of application of knowledge).",
    "Has to be taken for major requirements. Not too bad a class. 101 I enjoyed more, however.",
    "Yes, if you enjoy Bio and are willing to memorize facts",
    "If you like bio yes, but its not a class to take for fun b\/c its not super engaging.",
    "I would recommend it to a student only if they need to take it. If they don't need to, they really shouldn't bother.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who might need it as a requirement for their major. I would not recommend it to fill a distribution requirement or as an elective.",
    "Yes, this course helped sustain my interest in biology and it could do the same for you.",
    "I would only recommend taking this course if you need it for requirements (Bio major, pre-med, etc.). Taking this course for a science credit is probably not the best idea. You'll learn at lot about cell biology, and Dr. Horsley is a good professor, but it's not a particularly wonderful course.",
    "I believe that this course encourages higher thinking and analysis so I would recommend it to other students because it definitely causes you to question biology and the findings.",
    "An adequate class. There's nothing fantastic about it, but it's a pretty painless introduction to cell biology and if you need it for a bio major or premed, you can't really go wrong. Everything you need to know to do well on homework\/tests is in the slides, and there weren't weekly quizzes when it was taught this semester, so going to class isn't really necessary (but doing so at least some of the time will make studying easier). Homeworks are a joke and they give you half the answers in section.",
    "Well you're taking it because it's a prereq what do I say",
    "Take it if you have to. Otherwise it's kind of a dull course.",
    "It's a prereq for most life science courses, so I don't see you having much choice.",
    "No.",
    "If you are interested in biology at yale, I would recommend this course",
    "Sure! Not as difficult as Bio101 and more interesting.",
    "Take this class only if you have to.",
    "This is an okay class for being a large lecture. Professor Horsley spends more time answering questions or conducting group activities during lecture rather than lecturing, and often ended up running out of time to get to the actual difficult content at the end of each lecture. Also, please do not buy the newest edition of Karp, and especially not the absurdly expensive abridged version sold at the bookstore. I had the 5th edition (three editions down) in print as well as the pdf of the 8th edition (the newest edition) and found virtually no differences in diagrams or text.",
    "Not really, but you can't get around not taking this course, so people are going to take it no matter what.",
    "I would recommend. Even if you're not a bio major or premed, I think Biol102 (along with 101) serve very well to provide a basis of realizing the mind blowing complexities of life as well as how much research still needs to be done to better understand those complexities. Be warned: The course isn't insanely difficult, but it isn't necessarily easy either. If you do not have a biology background you will probably have to put in much more time and effort to get a good grade.",
    "Only if you need it for your major.",
    "Very fun course to learn about cell biology. However, this is a little difficult if you're not the best at memorizing a lot of terms.",
    "No. Unless you have to take the BIOL sequences for your major or premed, don't do it. It's not worth it. There are many other science credits available that are much more interesting and well taught than this sequence they are trying to put together.",
    "Would recommend to any student who needs to take intro BIOL to do it off-cycle. BIOL 101 and 102 are very well taught by the off-cycle professors. Specifically, for this course (BIOL 102), Horsley does a good job of breaking down cell biology into interesting chunks. First few lectures may seem a little too introductory and full of basic information. However, the course definitely picks up and dives into more difficult content after the 2nd week or so. Sometimes, contradictions made in class during Q&A can be confusing at first, but Horsley & Lin always do an amazing job of following up afterward and sending more extensive answers to difficult questions that were brought up in class. Fairly happy with how BIOL 102 went this semester, especially since it is usually a fairly rough module into the intro Bio sequence for the on-cycle students.",
    "Sure, I would recommend this course. As bio classes go, it isn't bad, and it's really not too much work or too challenging. There's a lot of memorization, but it's doable, and the homework assignments are very easy. The TA's even go over parts of the homework in the discussion sections, so you basically only have to do half of the homework by yourself. The structure of this course is different from that of BIOL 101: don't forget to turn in the homework (it's due at a different time than in BIOL 101) and do the online pre-class quizzes (before every lecture, ugh). But if you get on top of the schedule of this course, the work isn't bad and the material is mostly very interesting. You learn a lot. There's a pretty heavy experimental focus, which is helpful if you're looking to do research in the future.",
    "I would recommend it only because it's a prereq for many majors.",
    "Yes, not a great course but necessary for science majors",
    "I would recommend this course as a basic cell and membrane biology course, usually taken as a pre-requisite for a major or pre-med requirement.",
    "if you're on the fence about anything bio-related, a term of 101\/102 is definitely worth it! the spring semester version of 102 is better than the one in the fall; so if you're deciding on when to take it spring might be the better option.",
    "Better than 101. However only take the intro Bio sequence if you need to.",
    "This is not the most gripping biology class you will take, but it serves its function.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "If you are not thinking about majoring in a field related to biology, there is absolutely no reason to take this course at all. Take a different science elective that is a lot more engaging and interesting.",
    "I would only recommend this course if it is a prerequisite because it is such a large course that I think most students would get more value out of smaller courses. This course serves its purpose as laying a foundation for students, so for this reason I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. Most students take this class because they have to, but I do know a few who take it because they really like biology.",
    "Only if you need it. This is not a normal BIO sequence as in other colleges, contents and workload are much greater.",
    "It's a prereq for lots of stuff, and it isn't so bad if you are willing to memorize a million things.",
    "A must for the intro bio sequence",
    "Yeah",
    "yes",
    "yes",
    "Yes, this course gives a strong introduction to processes relevant to cell biology.",
    "I think that students interested in biology should definitely take this course. It's not an easy introduction, but it does go over foundational information and methods, and I found the material interesting.",
    "Most students are probably taking the BIOL sequence as part of a requirement, but I'd recommend BIOL 102 to any student remotely interested in biology.",
    "Yes. It's a good class and is necessary for upper level biology courses.",
    "The content is straightforward and fairly easily to learn, but the way it is taught is disorganized and makes it more difficult.",
    "Only really take this class if you need it, but Professor Horsley's cool",
    "YES take this course if you love biology or are looking for a Sci credit. Obviously not the easiest science credit, but it is so wholesome and you'll get so much out of it! If you have to take it for your major, make the right choice and take it off sequence (i.e. take 102 in the spring! Much better than the fall.)",
    "I would recommend this course but only if you are going to take in the spring\/off cycle semester. The fall professor was tragic, but professor Horsely was great! This course was great for learning about experimental techniques in biology, but I think a lot of people who enjoyed the content of AP will be disappointed in a way. 101+102 probably cover like 10% of the detail covered in AP. Instead you learn about techniques and problem solving in biology, which is interesting but in a different way. Overall this course taught me a new way to learn about biology which was relevant for labwork and research, which was interesting.",
    "Yes; it helps introduce students to cell biology in a thorough manner. It serves as a great introduction to this field, making it very useful to those interested in biology at the cellular level (or in biology in general). I've heard many awful things about the biology sequence, but that must have been a prior version; BIOL 101 and 102 have been quite pleasing.",
    "This was generally much more enjoyable than BIOL 101. There's less focus on discussion papers, and the homework assignments, discussion sections, and lectures actually prepare you for the midterm and final.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class! It is challenging but I think any student is capable of doing well, even non-STEM students who may be interested in taking a biology course. While the reading assignments were long, they could be skimmed if need be and the psets were always reasonable. Also, the knowledge learned was related to applications in lab, which made the class feel relevant. I loved the course overall!",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to, but it honestly wasn't even that bad and was a lot more bearable than 101, maybe just because I found the material to be considerably more interesting.",
    "Yes, it's an important and interesting class to take for anybody, even those outside of the STEM field.",
    "Yes, if doing anything in bio it's fairly necessary. I think the emphasis should be less on memorizing specific pathways and more on understanding the general concepts though.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to others. Even for students not interested in a science major, I would recommend it as an option to fulfill their science requirement. This is a class that, with a bit of effort, students with little science can get a lot out of and do well in.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're truly interested in biology, and want to be a researcher in the field. However, if not, don't consider taking this course because it is very different from a basic intro class.",
    "No, this course is only useful\/practical for a student that needs it. If you need to take this course for your major you will. Otherwise, avoid it.",
    "Take it if you have to...don't take it just to fulfill an Sc but I don't know why you would do that in the first place.",
    "Yes, this course is great for students how like or are interested in sciences. It is a great course, and well taught.",
    "Absolutely. The biology sequence thus far has been fair and informative.",
    "It's required for prereqs into a lot of science majors, but it's a great class nevertheless!",
    "Yes, this course makes necessary connections with and extensions of information provided in BIOL 101. It also provides an overview of modern techniques and methods that one would use regularly in the academic and industrial biological research setting.",
    "Absolutely",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they have any interest in biology and would like to validate the legitimacy and probability of this interest becoming the focal point of their future career Personally for me it gave me a better idea of whether I'd like to be a doctor and whether I'd even want to have a job centered around biology",
    "Most people are only taking this course if they need the sequence for prerequisites. That being said, it's not that bad, and Professor H makes it low stress for the most part.",
    "I would recommend if the students is really interested in biology and cell biology. The course does warrant quite a bit of work however, so most students take it if it is a pre-req.",
    "Yes. It was a good course. Just make sure to find people to study with and take the pre class quizzes with. After the midterm, make sure to get help if needed.",
    "Yes, you kinda have to take it if you're pre med or a bio major. But the course is really manageable and fair.",
    "If you have a strong interest in biology then take this course, do not just take it as a science credit as it is a hard class.",
    "Yes, if you're taking it it is most likely because you have to for your major but it is still a great course.",
    "Yes, I found this course very interesting, even aside from being a pre-med requirement.",
    "Definitely! Try your best to take it with these teachers too, they're really good. Valerie's into some interesting pedagogical techniques, like bringing students to the stage to physically demonstrate some biological processes, which you might think are weird\/funny while it's happening but actually do a lot to help everyone remember how stuff works. Sam is also super sweet and helpful. They both really care about their students both as people and as premeds; they want us to learn a lot but also don't want us to be unnecessarily stressed. The meme thing was cool too. 5\/7 would recommend",
    "Well biology students don't have much of a choice...I think their standards for placing out are too high though",
    "Yes, the class was interesting and the professors really wanted to help you learn.",
    "Yes. You learn a lot about cell biology which could help later in your career.",
    "I mean honestly you have to take this or place out of this.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the details of how our cells work and transport things throughout our bodies.",
    "Yes, the course provides the basics necessary to pursue more specific areas of biology and lab research projects.",
    "it's fine if they want an overview of bio or if it is required as an intro course, but if not than i woudl not recommend",
    "Yeah I would. You do learn a lot and develop helpful skills.",
    "Not unless they needed it for their major or pre-med.",
    "I would if you have to but nothing you learn will help change the world, and of all the notebooks I filled this year I recycled this one. Why spend your yale career learning about something that can be explained in a wikipedia page? Why not explore courses that challenge common dialogues, that cannot be found anywhere but here at the hallowed halls of yale.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because this class is not set-up very well to facilitate learning. It felt like this class was made to discourage students from being Pre-Med or becoming a biology major. The TAs and professors were not very helpful and the only reason I learned material in this class was through the Enrichment class and by asking other students to explain things to me.",
    "If another student is interested in the biological sciences, then I would recommend this course.",
    "Only if you need to.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in biology, or a pre-med (the course is a pre-req for pre-meds). If a student comes in with an interest in cell biology, the material will be very interesting and the material will be rewarding. However, this course shouldn't be taken as a first step into the sciences at Yale or as a way of filling the distributional requirement. It is quite a rigorous course, requiring time to be spent on weekly homework assignments, preparing for discussion sections, and preparing for exams.",
    "Only take if you need to for your major\/premed."
