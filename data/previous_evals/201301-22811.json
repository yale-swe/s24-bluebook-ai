    "This course is great. If you want to understand Cuban America and a group that has become widely influential in American politics than take this course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, I'm not Cuban and I still really enjoyed it, if you want to learn a little Cuban history and why the relations between Cuba and the US are the way they are, this is the class for you",
    "This class is absolutely perfect for anybody interested in Cuba and Cuban American culture. Professor Laguna examines Cuban America through a multitude of perspectives (art, film, music, historical accounts, etc.), making this class incredibly interesting and though-provoking. The readings were all interesting and entertaining and students have a lot of freedom when it came to our papers. Students basically wrote about whatever they wanted. This class is valuable for students of any major or background. Cuban America was fantastic and I really loved it.",
    "Absolutely. Take it. It's fun and informative. Can't ask for anything more.",
    "I would STRONGLY recommend Cuban America with Professor Laguna to other students. It is definitely one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale - I always enjoyed going to class. Professor Laguna is a wonderful professor - very helpful and engaging. Every classis dynamic, interesting, and insightful. Great course, awesome professor!"
