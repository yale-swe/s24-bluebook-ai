    "heavy reading, and a short response every week. main project is an extended, self-directed research paper.",
    "I would recommend this course. While it is a lot of work, Sabin truly seems to care about your progress as evidenced by the comments he makes on both weekly papers and the rough draft of the paper. The paper is spread out throughout the semester, which helps get feedback and avoids an unpleasant end of term crunch. The readings are also very interesting.",
    "The course explores the history of America's exploitation of the developing world. Writing intensive, response papers due every Thursday bar you from Wednesday Toads, and the research paper is no joke. However, it will be very beneficial to your writing, and leave you well prepared for higher level history courses. However the reading is a little broad, and class can get a little long.",
    "EVST 310 was a tough course, but it taught me a lot. The weekly readings were very interesting and the feedback on the reading responses really helped me improve my writing. I would recommend this course, but if you take it, realize that it will eat up a lot of time in both reading and in writing the final paper. I think it is worth the time you'll put in, but make sure you set aside a good chunk of time each week to tackle the reading responses and assignments leading to the final paper.",
    "If you're not a history student, the final paper is pretty hard, and class discussion isn't always interesting. But I did learn a lot, both about primary source research and about resource extraction, and many of the readings are quite interesting.",
    "A must-class for anybody interested in issues of political economy.",
    "Yes, especially if one is interested in the relation between how the acquisition of materials went towards the rise of USA in the twentieth century, how corporate and foreign policy intertwine etc.The final research paper gives scope for delving into any particular interest area in this broad topic.",
    "Romp through different aspects of US resource frontiers, looking at cultural, ecological, and political aspects of them. You have a draft due of your final paper a month before the actual thing is due, and the prof reads it and gives his comments on it which is really helpful. Your writing will improve after having taken this course.",
    "Great class. The material and readings are fascinating. Structure is outstanding. Professor open and dedicated. You will learn a lot about the U.S.'s behavior in securing resources abroad, a lot of the knowledge will shock those who still operate under the illusion of the \"benevolent hegemon\". I recommend this to any student interested in contemporary history of the Third World, post-colonial studies or American diplomatic history. Prof. Sabin really facilitates the writing of the research paper, and I must say that I learned a lot from this process. If Prof. Sabin hadn't imposed the structure that he did, I wouldn't have been able to construct the paper that I did. Also, Professor Sabin focuses a lot on your writing, which I think is great. Be sure to give this class the attention it deserves."
