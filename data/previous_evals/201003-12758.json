    "Basically a free Italian credit. I would not recommend it--you really won't learn much at all and sitting there for an hour and 15 minutes when nobody wants to volunteer to speak because they are all facebooking on their laptops is suffocating.",
    "Take this class if you want an easy L5 Italian, though know that it is one of those classes that you truly get out what you put in. So, come prepared to class and it will be much more enjoyable and you will improve your italian from speaking.",
    "I would not recommend it if you want to improve in Italian.",
    "your italian is made much better by reading and watching movies, you get more into colloquialisms (a necessity for getting around in italy). We learned a lot about the structure of the country, and writing our own papers was great for grammar and cultural understanding.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who has completed a level 4 italian class, especially if you're tired of grammar classes and want to do more discussing than learning rules of writing.",
    "Great class to take with many opportunities to practice writing and speaking."
