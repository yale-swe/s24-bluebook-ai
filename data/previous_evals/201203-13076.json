   "comments": [
    "All the reviews I read were basically right. It's quite a lot of work, especially at the beginning with the smaller projects that require a lot of cutting and pasting, but it's worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. The progression of assignments in terms of increasing complexity and the attention to specific design concepts make this a great basic design course. Be forewarned, all the work is done by hand, and is thus time consuming. Most classes are spent on critiques. Definitely take it with Henk Van Assen, he really made the course wonderful.",
    "I loved this course. Class was always a pleasure and I looked forward to doing the assignments. I think my work really improved over the semester. And Henk is the greatest, hilarious and helpful but tactful.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, whether you are an art major or not.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in graphic design. Professor Van Assen is wonderful and kind. It is my understanding (although we have not received a grade so I cannot say for sure) that he grades (generously) based largely on effort. I took the course for credit (not a grade) and I would only rexommend it if you know exactly why you are taking it for credit and it is a good reason. You will have to put effort into this course whether you take it for a grade or not. There is work due every class and then you critique others' work in class pretty much everyday. It's a lot to do just for a credit, especially because it appears that the grading may be rather generous. Just one opinion though...",
    "I would recommend it",
    "I think I would only recommend it to someone who is interested in art and design, not someone who is casually interested in or curious about learning design.",
    "Intro to Graphic Design will give you a great foundation to talk about and make design. It is not at all based on the computer, and all assignments were mandatorily done by hand (though towards the end of larger projects Henk was okay if you wanted to switch to the computer). I recommend this class strongly, and it's a great jumping off point to enter other design classes.",
    "Great introduction although no computer work will be done.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in art or graphic design. I had virtually no experience with graphic design going into it, and I really feel like I learned a lot. It was definitely worth it.",
    "Yes, definitely take it! Take it even if you're not an art major; I think there's a lot in this course that would benefit everyone. The workload isn't light, but the assignments are fun. I would definitely recommend taking it with Henk as well - he's great.",
    "Definitely recommended for anyone interested in majoring in art or not. Can apply to a wide variety of disciplines and is useful for not just the specific field.",
    "If you decide to take this class, be aware that it will take up a LOT of your time, especially when there is a project due."
