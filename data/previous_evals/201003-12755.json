   "comments": [
    "Abstract class on concepts and how we acquire information. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Cognitive Science because it is a light course load and interesting.",
    "Mark Phelan is a new professor, and it sort of shows--his style of presentation is a little uninspiring, and mostly consists of summarizing the readings.The course itself is a mixed bag--it alternates between empirical psychology and philosophy of mind quite freely. Some of the philosophy was quite technical, and it took me awhile to get myself oriented as to exactly what was being debated.Grading is quite easy--we have a few reading quizzes (for which he gives us the questions in advance) and a couple responses\/essays. The writing assignments are graded quite strictly, so definitely don't blow them off.",
    "As it was taught this semester, I would not recommend it to another student (unless they were REALLY interested in concepts, concepts, concepts). This was Prof. Phelan's first year teaching a lecture course, and it showed. He was ill-prepared for class many days and was sort of a push-over on quiz grades and essay extensions (mostly because he often phrased questions wrongly, or failed to set firm deadlines far enough in advance). Still, he's a smart guy, and sincerely interested in the students and subject matter. He's smart enough that it's safe to assume, I think, that the class will improve as he gains experience.",
    "I would recommended it if you do not mind doing quite a bit of writing and reading.",
    "I recommend this class if you're interested in cognitive science\/philosophy of mind. Really, the class will seem monotonous if you aren't naturally interested in the material. It's a great introduction to some modern, analytic philosophy.",
    "This class should really be called, \"Concepts: What are they?!?!??\" A little too much philosophy and not enough cog sci for my liking, although the material is occasionally interesting. Prof. Phelan is a funny lecturer (although he doesn't always intend to be), sometimes confuses himself, but he's really clear about what he wants.",
    "The general title of the course, the spartan description and the fact that it has no prereq's is kind of misleading. This is a course about theory of mind and specifically the nature of concepts and concept acquisition. Not a ton of work, but the material can be extremely dense and frustrating. Be prepared to spend hours trying to figure out what is going on in the readings. I would only recommend this course to people already familiar with and interested in the material.",
    "The course has potential to get better, so although I wouldn't recommend it as it is at all, check it out when it's offered again and see if it appeals to you. Unless there are some radical changes, though, I'd say pass up on this course.",
    "ThIs class is great if you're planning on majoring in cog sci. It is very good if you already have a background and understand the material. Otherwise do not take the course.",
    "Learn about various theories about the structure of concepts, with special emphasis on Fodor's view. (See Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on concepts.)Readings are good to pretty good, and not too heavy.Not much work either: two short papers, a final essay, and a final take-home exam which is two short essays that you have a week to complete.There are also \"pop\" quizzes, but they aren't difficult if you've done the readings. The professor usually warns you of pop quizzes and tells you exactly what you need to know also.",
    "PHIL 273 is pretty good. For those generally interested in the mind, though, beware - the focus is exclusively on concepts - mostly their nature, a bit on their acquisition, and a few lecture on cross-cultural differences. Prof. Phelan is well organized, smart, and approachable. Lecture wasn't bad, but I rarely looked forward to it much. Worth shopping, but not my favorite course.",
    "Great survey of some of the major topics in philosophy of mind. Good interdisciplinary tie-ins to work in psychology. I would recommend it to students who are interested in philosphy and psychology, but would emphasize that an interest in philosophy is required.",
    "Great class about types of thoughts, concepts, and more. Great cogsci class, and if you want to know about Intro CogSci things, I would recommend this over intro cogsci.",
    "Take this class if you need it for your major. Otherwise, steer clear. That is, unless you care deeply about what in fact the concept of a doorknob consists of (doorknob...or door and knob?), how you could come by the concept doorknob (through fun methods such as \"mind-locking\"), and whether you and your mailman have the same concept of doorknob.",
    "I'd recommend it to someone interested an learning about the philosophy of mind or language.",
    "Yes, very good intersection of cognitive science and philosophy.",
    "I recommend it if you are interested in cognitive science, philosophy, and where the two intersect. Mind and Thought is listed under philosophy, but it draws heavily on work done in the field of cognitive science to investigate philosophical theories about how our minds work.",
    "The subject is very interesting. The lectures are a bit lack luster, and the graders are very problematic. The professor is very nice, though, and very helpful if you push him to be so. He's very very nice and smart man with a somewhat soporific drawling voice. He seems to have a tendency toward absentmindedness and malapropism, which can make his assignments and lectures a little confusing sometimes. Nevertheless, he's a very reasonable person, and if you're confused as to what he's asking from you, just do what you think is reasonable and you'll be fine.",
    "Interesting course in philosophy of mind.",
    "Yes. Interesting class and the teacher is great at explaining.",
    "I think I'll actually remember a lot from this course, because the writing assignments really forced you to know and understand the material, but I'm not sure how much of what I'll know is really relevant to anything in real life. But I enjoyed the class."
