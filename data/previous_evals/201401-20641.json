   "comments": [
    "219 was my favorite class so far at Yale, and I would definitely recommend it for someone who wants to improve their ear-training. Also, take it with Sarita if you can because she is the best!",
    "I would definitely recommend music 219 to another student because it is extremely helpful and just a great overall course. It is a great extension of 218 and I learned so much.",
    "You must take this class with Sarita. It is so much fun, and you will learn alot.",
    "219 is a great continuation of 218 focusing on sight singing, ear training, melodic\/harmonic dictation including some harmonic material lining up with 211 (e.g., modulatory stuff, hearing augmented 6th chords, etc.). Recommended for those wishing to take higher level music classes or those hoping to major in music. Also just an excuse to work on musicianship skills in a relatively relaxed setting. Take it with Sarita if you can--she's fantastic. Keyboard lab is just a pretty minor addition--just makes you practice a little exercise or two each week.",
    "It's quite a challenge, but take it anyways! Especially with Sarita!",
    "If you're not a music major, I'd say Sarita is the main reason to take this class in addition to the incredibly light\/nonexistent work load. You definitely get a lot of practice and improve your dictation ability. The music you start listening to and dictating as the class progresses is so beautiful - therefore I always found musicianship to be a wonderful musical break in my day. Take it if you want a fairly chill music class with an extraordinarily fun teacher!",
    "This class was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale thus far. It is the second class in a two-semester sequence (218, 219) so you definitely need to know how to do melodic and harmonic dictations and how to sight-sing before coming into this class. Sarita is amazing and I highly recommend taking a class with her if you get the chance. I felt I really improved my analytical listening skills and figured-base realization skills in this class. A great experience overall."
