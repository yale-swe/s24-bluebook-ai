   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class because the course material is very interesting and the professor is great.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in this time period. I don't feel like I'm better able to go to a museum and understand exactly what is going on, but what Joselit says definitely applies to art and to our culture in unexpected and pervasive ways.",
    "This class is ok.",
    "it's just okay. i don't know if I would recommend this class to a fellow student. on one hand, it was generally a worry-free, chill class with pretty minimal work. on the other, I can't really recall what it was that I learned. in my opinion, western art in the second half of the 20th century just gets really strange and obscure, and joselit speaks in completely abstract terms about them. if you don't mind looking at some very odd art pieces, the class might help your general understanding of visual\/pop culture and certain art trends of the last few decades. i guess if you need a 5th class, this wouldn't be too bad of an option.",
    "Great class! My first Art History class, and it's gotten me wanting more. Yes, modern art can be a bit weird, but it's super varied and I'd imagine there's something that would appeal to everyone. Very enjoyable on the whole, and not stressful at all in terms of work!",
    "Great course because the material is interesting, the professor is engaging and the workload is manageable.",
    "Very interesting material. Joselit is a good lecturer. Workload not very heavy - great pass fail for non hsar majors.",
    "I had such low, low expectations for an art history class about art after 1950, but this class was completely enjoyable. I cannot imagine learning more in a more enjoyable manner. The only part that sucked was how friggin early it was. Joselit clearly knows exactly what he's talking about and is able to convey the information in a manner so effective that learning was easy, even about stuff that would have seemed waaay too weird before this class. I say, take it!",
    "Take it definitely if you are art or history of art student. I think anyone can learn a lot but earlier knowledge would make the learning even more intense and meaningful because some of the trends are carried out from the early modernism... I loved the class.",
    "Great course. Learned about abstract art, contemporary art, body art, performance art, feminist art. TAKE IT. You will not regret it.",
    "It's a course outlining postwar art into the 21st century, using guiding themes as a way to draw parallels across time and space. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're interested in contemporary art, as it really provides a nice grounding for much of the ideas being produced today.",
    "This really was a great class - although the material was sometimes difficult to understand, I am so glad to have taken a class about contemporary art. I feel like I can now approach such subjects with a solid foundation of knowledge, and also was given skills to look at such work in a deeper and more analytical light.",
    "I would recommend the class, though it might be good to take it credit d so that you don't have to go to section every week.",
    "The best contemporary art history course at yale. Prof. Joselit is not to be missed.",
    "TAKE IT!! VERY GOOD!! Felt more relevant and interesting since art discussed is relatively modern.",
    "I loved this class, but it can be very heavy on jargon sometimes. Sometimes I feel like we're being irresponsible with language, throwing around terms that don't seem to have a precise, pinned down meaning and expecting them to carry a lot of weight in discourse. The class is quasi-chronological in its organization, with various eras married to a general topics like \"enlivened objects\" and \"pop economies.\" It feels a little disconcerted sometimes",
    "The course is a great introduction to the study of modern art and provides students with an effective vocabulary for evaluating and thinking about postwar art. Professor Joselit is a good lecturer.",
    "100% recommend this course if you are interested in understanding contemporary art. I now feel like I can walk into most gallery spaces and have something to say about a work if it was made in the last 50 years.",
    "really interesting material - this was the first art history class i've taken and i want to take more now. the section was kind of weird\/lame but the class isn't super hard and it's a good topic to know about. also you do not have to do ANY of the reading to get an A",
    "I definitely recommend the class if you're interested in contemporary art!",
    "Western Art Since 1950 was a survey course of modern and contemporary art that was interesting to people who know a lot about the subject as well as people who were pretty new. The discussion sections met in the art gallery and were the highlight of my week. They felt more like talking to a bunch of smart friends about art than being in a classroom. I highly recommend the course, and be sure to go to lecture! It's early but totally worth it!",
    "really good follow-up art history course to nemerov's survey course. basically this class covers all the time of 'art that isn't really art' as some might refer to it, or art that is really weird, envelope pushing, intellectually challenging. i probably reference something that i learned in this class every day-- from the point of view of a liberal arts (i.e. non-major oriented) education, this is probably one of the most valuable classes i've taken at yale. joselit is just a really great lecturer, well-paced, smart, engaging. not much work at all (midterm, final and a non-research based final paper), especially if you credit\/d the course it makes a really good 5th (or 1st) course.",
    "Western Art Since 1950 is a great introduction to contemporary art. Professor Joselit does a good job of explaining how art developed from the canvas to performance, and he covers myriad artists and styles--as well as the heavy-hitters, Pollock and Warhol. Sections are in the art gallery, which is excellent. Work consists of a midterm, a final paper, and a final."
