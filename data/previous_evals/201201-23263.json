    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I adored it. Gothic cathedrals are among the most beautiful buildings in the world, and there's so much to be learned and discovered about them! Prof. Jung is a great lecturer who clearly is passionate about her subject, and even section was really good. It wasn't too much work, either: an easy midterm, a fun paper on a neo-gothic cathedral in the area (among the options were St. Mary's on Hillhouse and St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York), and a final that hopefully won't be any more onerous than the midterm was. I'm so glad this was offered during my last semester at Yale.",
    "I would fully recommend it, especially if you have any interest in the Middle Ages or church (and secular) architecture. It's a wonderful overview of not only the features of monuments from that time period buthow they were shaped by liturgical, economic, political, and social concerns of their environments that attempts to provide a holistic view of the times. The professor is fantastic, engaging, and a leader in her field; sections were interesting; and the paper was intriguing and not burdensome.",
    "This class involves a lot of looking at pretty pictures and hearing about them. I strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in art, architecture, or the Middle Ages. The class gives you good exposure to all three of these topics.",
    "You should take this course. The workload is not too bad, you get to look at so many pretty pictures, Professor Jung is wonderful, and I thoroughly enjoyed doing the final paper.",
    "Take this course- you won't regret it! Awesome material and an even better professor.",
    "You should definitely take this course. Gothic architecture is awesome and so is Professor Jung. You will learn about French and German cathedrals, as well as a fare amount about medieval society and Christian theology. The reading is very light.",
    "This is one of my favorite courses. Professor Jung is absolutely amazing. She's super nice and caring and one of the best lecturers. She really makes you take an interest in the cathedrals that she presents. After this class, all I wanted to do was travel around Europe and visit all the places that we talked about. The class does not limit itself strictly to cathedrals, but includes discussion of other materials. Not too much work - a lot of reading (but it's really interesting and well chosen) but otherwise only a midterm, a ten page paper and a final."
