   "comments": [
    "This is a very important course for any student with a serious interest in South Asia or history. The course is not just about historical trajectories in South Asia; it is chiefly a seminar that addresses historiography, the methodologies of writing history, and the challenges of writing history for different periods. If you want an in depth look at South Asian history and the chance to read exciting new works in the field, this is perhaps the only course at Yale with the opportunity to do so. It is a lot of work, and not easy, however you will get a lot out of it.",
    "Reading course for early modern and modern South Asia. Outstanding instructors and having both in the room works very well (always interesting and fun to see them disagree). Recent books, most of which are excellent.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in any aspect of South Asian culture\/religion\/history. The readings this class will introduce you to will help you understand the broad historiography to which most contemporary scholarship is responding to.",
    "I LOVED THIS COURSE. Great syllabus, great discussions with supportive peers and supportive faculty (Rohit De and Julie Stephens, whose chemistry as close friends and academic peers made this class fun every week). The reading is extensive and I always felt like I was not meeting the level of participation of my peers, but I learned and grew"

   "comments": [
    "I think this course was instrumental for shaping my understanding of South Asian historiography. Even with limited experience on South Asian history, I was able to draw a lot from each session. Sometimes, readings connected with my research in unexpected ways and I got a lot out of the seminars that were not related to my research interests as well. The seminar truly provided me with a better perspective on the writing of history and the challenges of doing historical research.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Many aspects will help with my dissertation, e.g. thinking comparatively and making connections across fields.",
    "This course gave me a very necessary understanding of the context of my research, including earlier time periods that I have not studied extensively and the questions that motivate other fields that can be applied to my research. Some of my favorite books on my research topic I read in this class as well!"
