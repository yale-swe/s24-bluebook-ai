   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this course! I wrote an IRB proposal for my project and then a 20 page final paper. I'm excited to continue my study in the spring and see what results I get!",
    "Great way to get credit for doing research in a lab that you're already interested in. Definitely recommend this!",
    "Great way to gain valuable research experience. Also super useful for the senior requirement (if applicable), but make sure you pick a good advisor who is invested in your project and who will respond to your emails, etc. If you're taking it for the senior requirement, remember that 20 pages is a LOT so don't leave the paper til the last minute.",
    "You get to run studies, analyze data, participate in lab meetings, and much more; tasks likely vary greatly from lab to lab and depending on the particular project you're working on.",
    "Doing research in a psychology lab is a fantastic experience. I definitely would recommend it to any psych major.",
    "Of course, you have to take it for the psych major, but its truly a great opportunity.",
    "Take directed research if you are truly passionate about a specific researchproject with a specific advisor. PSYC 492 is an excellent option that Yale offers students who want to go in-depth into their research, allowing them a structured way to do so. The course is what you make of it, so if you carefully choose and advisor who you work well with, and whose work actually reflects research questions that intellectually stimulate you, then this will be one of the best courses you will take at Yale.",
    "Great chance to have dedicated time to something you're really interested in. You gain a lot more than you would anticipate.",
    "This is an AMAZING WAY TO FULFILL THE SENIOR REQUIREMENT. Obviously, the experience varies greatly from lab to lab.I think that every psychology major should leave Yale with some experience in experimental psychology. Just hearing discussions about grants, experimental design, timelines, etc. is extremely informative and educational. What it takes to perform an experiment\/get published\/whatever really changes how you understand articles you read for other classes and on your own.Researching design\/background for an experiment was really fun, and I'm excited to actually get a chance to collect some data next semester.",
    "Yes, I would. Although the flexibility makes it a little unclear what you need to accomplish and that can make it stressful some students.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who know their PI beforehand and have a good sense of what their role will be in the research project.",
    "It's a good way to get research experience while completing your senior project.",
    "This is a great opportunity to conduct your own research under the guidance of fantastic advisors. I would definitely recommend this to another student interested in psychology research.",
    "Recommend--good hands on opportunity to do research!"
