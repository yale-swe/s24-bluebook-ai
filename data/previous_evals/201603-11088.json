   "comments": [
    "This course introduced me to a canon of thought that rebels against the dominant narrative supporting white hegemony. In doing so it helped to better contextualize much of the conversation happening around race in the world today. The weekly reading responses also made me a much more efficient writer.",
    "Learned so much about how black power has been articulated across the world at various points in time. really helped me to consider what the vision of true liberation looks like and how\/if possible we can get there.",
    "This class was a new opportunity to learn about a neglected topic, fraught with confrontation, misunderstanding and controversy. In that, I learned how to talk about blackness, how to read and start to understand race and racial conflict, and how to theorize about potentiality and possibility of future black power. This is not a beginner class, nor is it a class I approached with much confidence or background, but over the course of the semester I developed a library of black power literature, vocabulary and confidence in my ability to debate and discuss these movements.",
    "Course gives you an excellent intro to Black Power philosophy and debates - engaging with major Black philosophers and racial theorists. Definitely opens up you up to a school of thought often omitted from most course studies focus on the western canon, while still also offering an opportunity to engage in fascinating discussions about the interplay between such theories, their accompanying movements, and current events.",
    "This course was probably the most challenging course I've taken at Yale. It really forced me to think in ways that I never had before. In addition to using materials that were very intellectually challenging, the sheer amount of work really forces you to time manage. I gained a lot of valuable skills and knowledge throughout this course."

    "Overall an absolutely fantastic course",
    "This course offers students comprehensive opportunities and materials to think critically about global black power the other students in the class are incredibly smart and have unique perspectives to bring to the class (although 90% of the class was female), the texts cover extreme ranges of era and topic and perspective yet keep a narrow enough focus for students to make concrete connections and build knowledge each week, and the professor is tirelessly helpful and insightful. Magaziner runs his seminar at a great pace for student growth there is a great expectation for student participation, yet Magaziner poses probing questions that the class could spend a whole semester on for the flat parts of the conversation. He is an incredible, rare section leader in the sense that he strikes a balance of providing his input and his direction without dismissing student interpretations, etc. Magaziner's workload has been famously heavy, but I personally found the work to be meaningful and grounding to get the most out of the class. The weekly responses allow for constant critical synthesis, and they also propel greater class discussions\/participation, as students come to seminar with arguments they have already formulated beforehand. The final projects are facilitated extremely well, as Magaziner enforces deadlines for bibliographies and offers feedback for ideas well in advance. The only major drawback to the course perhaps would be the lack of perspective from female authors or feminist thinkers, but this shortcoming is fully disclosed at the beginning of the course and is recognized as part of the drive to continue improving our written\/oral histories in African studies. This again gives full promise for interesting final papers. While this class might not be taught again, any class offered by Magaziner would be amazing, and a student should surely work their schedule around the possibility of being in his class.",
    "We did a lot of writing for the course, a weekly response paper and a 15 page final essay. I thought the reading workload PLUS all the writing was very overbearing and we received little to no feedback on our writing or our performance throughout the class until the end of the term.",
    "This course is strong in its teaching, subject matter (prescience and relation to contemporary issues of importance) and variety of texts (both foundational texts such as \"Black Skins, White Masks\" and speculative texts such as \"Fire on the Mountain\"). The course is weak in its distribution of work: while each weekly reading response is expected and continuous, the reading varies from 500 page books to much shorter novels so it's difficult to anticipate the amount of work for that week. It is also a very reading heavy seminar, so be prepared to read, analyze and write before even coming to class. In addition, there wasn't a culminating definition of \"black power\" -- the learning from this class cannot be summed up succinctly, which is an asset in that we covered such a breadth of topics and conflicting ideas but makes post-semester reflection more difficult.",
    "Magaziner is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the topic and the readings, and was great at listening to students and adjusting accordingly. I felt that he was very invested in students' engagement with and ownership of the course and its material. The readings were interesting but I felt the class could have benefited from more historical context and framing, especially when shifting from one week to the next. Also the discussion of Black Feminism felt lacking (only 1 week and much of the class was spent discussing whether Beyonce was a feminist which felt reductive). I know this isn't Magaziner's style, but I wish there was more guidance in the classroom--while sometimes discussions were quite fruitful, it also sometimes felt like students were fumbling with the readings just to fill silences.",
    "The course was all around amazing - particularly the discussions had in class - but one thing that could be improved is the amount of feedback given to students. Weekly reading responses were expected but comments were only given upon request, and the comments given weren't as extensive as might have been appreciated. Also meant that one's standing in the course is highly ambiguous if known at all.",
    "The class discussions are amazing. The professor is excellent. The course was great. I think this highly depends on the other students who are taking the class with you.",
    "SO MUCH WORK!!!"

    "This was a frustrating class for me. I came in with really high expectations, and committed a lot of time and energy to the readings and responses for this course. Despite this, class itself was often unsatisfying. Global Black Power is a huge topic and there isn't a single unifying narrative, but each week seemed to focus solely on the book we'd read, and I struggled to connect dots between classes. Also, we didn't read a lot of traditional history books and didn't get a lot of historical context in class, so I think that contributed to the lack of continuity. I'd heard great things about Professor Magaziner and about this class in particular, but I think it really suffered from a lack of organization.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend this class and anything else taught by Magaziner to anyone looking for an interesting and dynamic course.",
    "Yes. Take any class with Magaziner. A seminar especially provides a rewarding semester, as Magaziner's presence and feedback on student participation and writing is incredibly helpful for each student to come away with. The other students in the class are also phenomenal, and the readings, while at times difficult to keep up with, give expansive yet focused ideas of what global black power looks like (or does the important probing of questions when we can't ever know 'what' GBP is).",
    "Yes definitely, but expect A LOT of work.",
    "This course has a heavy workload and requires a high level of engagement, but this was easily one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Magaziner is fantastic, the books are always interesting and discussions cover a broad variety of topics and often introduce many debates. Aside from fluctuations in reading, the workload is expected (weekly responses and one final paper) and grading is majority participation--so if you care about the topic and will come to class excited, this is not only a great learning experience but also good for the GPA.",
    "I definitely would. The course did an excellent job in prompting students' engagement with historical figures and movements that are often glazed over in other classes. Such an engagement then challenges the student to reconsider the way they view modern day racial interactions, particularly those within the Black Diaspora and between the diaspora and society at large. I would caution those interested in the course to take into consideration the workload of the course. While the readings and discussions were incredibly interesting, they did come with a book to read each week - ranging anywhere from 200 to 400 pages - and then a weekly reading reflection as well. Still, it was a great course to take.",
    "Take it. Magaziner is an excellent professor. You will learn a lot, your mind will be challenged in so many ways, your views will improve. Everything about this course is great. I loved it so much. Be warned though: the workload is higher than Mt. Kilimanjaro. And Professor Magaziner has very high standards of your work."
