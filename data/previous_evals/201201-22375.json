    "I'd take it with Cristina.",
    "Take it if you want to get really good at roman numeral analysis- that was the main focus in the first part of the semester. I found this to be pretty boring, but once we moved into larger formal analysis, it got more interesting. However, it covers alot of material, and so loses alot of depth in the material. Still, a great class that I would recommend.",
    "Decent course. It's definitely not easy, but it's a fine 5th course if you're looking for something different.",
    "TAKE. THIS. COURSE. Especially if you have any interest in music theory beyond MUSI 110 (and CERTAINLY if you're a performer or arranger\/composer looking for some valuable theory background). The material for this course is so engaging (and really clearly conveyed in class), the classroom environment in wonderful (at least with Cristina Cruz-Uribe), the assessments are entirely fair (and often fun!), and my instructor (Cristina) was stellar. I'm now following a track for a double major in music because I enjoyed this course so much! (Disclaimer- it's not for everyone, but if you think you'll enjoy it, and you put in the time, you will.) Just remember to DO THE READING (there's not much of it, and it makes the course infinitely easier). A 10 out of10 in my book. (Though I've heard that you should shop around for good instructors- they're not always as wonderful as Cristina. The faculty (as opposed to grad students) are usually a safe bet.)",
    "It's an interesting second course in music theory. Definitely take it if you're interested in music beyond just reading notes.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student, but make sure that I find out if you actually belong in 205 or 210. 205 was a little to slow for me."
