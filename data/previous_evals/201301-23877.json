    "I would recommend the class for anyone who wants to get some basics in neuroimaging studies; if they were actually planning to head down the path of neuroimaging, they would probably need to take much more in-depth classes.",

It also gave me a good overview of the state of the field at the moment; while that's probably going to change very quickly, I feel like I have a better grasp of the limitations and the current questions in neuroimaging that people are trying to get at."
