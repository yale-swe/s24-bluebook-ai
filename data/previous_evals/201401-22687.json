   "comments": [
    "I would recommend a student who in interested in the field of development to take this class because writing the paper helps you develop critical thinking abilities and gives you a chance to work on quantitative skills",
    "Not recommended",
    "No, I would not recommend the class. I don't see what a student can gain from it. The only thing that could be gained is exposure to literature, but that would be the literature of 20 years ago. No quantitative understanding is fostered because the technical aspects of the papers are mostly skipped. Furthermore, the classroom atmosphere isnot stimulating at all.",
    "No I would not.",
    "interesting but needs more structure",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants a theoretically solid, broad-based exposure to the economics of development. The course doesn't move along as fast as one might like, but the content is relevant and interesting.",
    "Economics 732 is a course that makes the major frameworks of development economics accessible to the non-expert. It goes through both micro- and macroeconomic principles that have been cited in the development literature. I would highly recommend it.",
    "It teaches you to construe obstacles or issues to economic development in econometric terms. If you are exploring whether you would ever want to understand academic economic study, this is perfect!",
    "Yes, I would recommend ECON732 to any other student who is seeking a deeper understanding of the economic concepts underlying common market failures in developing contexts, as well as the analysis underlying various competing theories of growth."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me learn quantitative and paper writing skills. Overall, very helpful",
    "It didn't deepen my knowledge because no complex models were covered. Simple literature reviews of papers from 20 to 30 years ago aren't stimulating.Further the coursework didn't help at all with writing the paper.",
    "somewhat useful",
    "I am in public health, and the course was really fruitful because I wanted to spend some time on the poverty literature (with or without any recourse to health in developing countries). The final project, which I intend to work on in the future, gave me the opportunity to spend time thinking on the private demand for innovative health products.",
    "Among other things, the course reinforced in my mind the importance for foreign policymakers of understanding the competing analysis on the sources of economic growth."
