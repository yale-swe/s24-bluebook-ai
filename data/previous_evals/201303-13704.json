    "I think this is a great course. Super useful for me.Professor Crawford can explain very complicated algorithms clearly. The homework is well designed.",
    "This course is pretty helpful. Prof. Crawford explains concepts and algorithms very clearly.Some part of the class is a little bit slow. (For example the review session.)",
    "The pace in class is a little bit slow.",
    "great",
    "It would be better if we have separate sessions reviewing the homework thoroughly.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I thought the material presented is very important and will be used in future research. I thought the lectures were a good introduction to the concepts. The homework was my main tool in ultimately understanding the material. I think the homework was challenging, but it really forced us to learn and implement the topics covered in class.",
    "Computer lab may be needed for better understanding of the algorithms that are taught.",
    "This course is extremely challenging for people without a strong stats and R programming background. I don't think I've ever spent more time on HW assignments for a class. And I still didn't understand several of the problems. I felt that assignments were designed so students would come to office hours, but I think this is an unrealistic expectation for PhD students - research is now our first priority, not classes, and it's difficult to drop all experiments\/other work to trek all the way to LEPH (not all students are located on the med school campus).I really wish we were assessed more on what we learned in class. I spent most of my time trying to determine what the problems were asking for or how to start of problem because functions were so complicated. I especially felt that this was the case on the final exam. I understood and knew how to use all the algorithms\/techniques we learned in class, however, I couldn't figure out how to apply them to the exam problems because the functions were complicated and unlike anything we had seen previously.In the end, I did learn a lot from this class, and I thought it was well organized and very interesting.",
    "We learned many useful algorithms in the course.",
    "Lectures are very clear, and homeworks back up the lectures, although they are difficult. This is an extremely important topic, and I could not find other courses at Yale that would teach all the topics covered in the space of one course, so I found that very valuable. Having taken the course, I feel like I know which areas of statistics I want to learn more about.",
    "The course assumed a high degree of familiarity with R that the first homework did not make apparent. It was possible to catch up and learn it on one's own, but it would've been nice if either there was a section in the computer lab for those who needed more help or slightly more information in the homework statements about the R code, even just some useful functions for writing the code.The homeworks were very time consuming, but this might have just been due to a lack of familiarity with R.Overall the class was well laid out and I learned a lot.I felt that the final was challenging, but not overly so and that it was a good assessment if you really had understood the class rather than just asking for us to regurgitate what we had already done in class and on homeworks.",
    "- The second half of the course moves very fast, especially for students who might not have taken something similar in the past. It would be helpful if the pace of the course was constant from the beginning.",
    "Quite informative.",
    "Interesting, useful and well-taught",
    "It is very good. I love Professor Crawford. Dear professor, Happy Holidays to you and your family!",
    "Strenth: cover a wide rage of computational biostatistics. The professor pepared a lot for this course(we can sense that)Weakness: maybe should tell the students the intuition and objectives of methods.",
    "Strength: Everything was made very clear. In homework we dealt with real problems thus strengthening understanding of class notes.Weakness: course pace was a little bit slow.",
    "Learned a lot",
    "Overall it was a fun course in which I learnt a tremendous amount. It would have been nice to have a TA who gave lab\/TA sessions, but I understand the circumstances and I thought the Professor did an extremely good job in providing time and energy for the students.",
    "Stengths: You will learn a lot in the classroom and through the homework.Weaknesses: Only once a week. I would suggest twice a week at an hour and half.",
    "I would highly recommend having a midterm to let students assess themselves how well we know the material and so that the final is weighted less.",
    "Wish there were a computer lab where a TA would go over examples.The final for the class was fair in terms of the content, but not in terms of the time given to complete it. The final was equivalent to 1.5 of a homework assignment. Even if you take away the programming, the conceptual part would still take 4 hrs to complete and do a good job."

    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0I thought Prof. Crawford was a good teacher. Lectures were well laid out. I wish that more time had been spent on the programming aspect of the course, but I feel that the best way to do that would have been through an additional, optional section. Officer hours were very helpful.",

    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0He's an amazing teacher. Yale is lucky to have him. Great in the classroom, great in office hours, great guy.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0The instructor selected great topics to cover. The lectures were clear and thorough. The homework assignments were applicable, practical and educational. Thank you for that.Perhaps a weakness is the assessment part. We were given great HW assignments and plenty of time to complete them. (That's where I learned the most.) Whereas the final should have been either a take home or cut to 3-4 problems. It is my understanding that the assignments were counted equally with the final exam. That does not quite make sense because the final was simply measuring whether a student can crank out answers to a longer HW assignment with shorter time to compete it. How can 6 HW assignments be equal to 1.5 HW assignment?Thank you for a great class though!"

She sometimes didn't show up to office hours, and she didn't look at the hw before her office hours, so she couldn't really answer most of our questions. Finally, office hours were held at a very inconvenient time - Fridays 1-2pm, when the hw assignments were due on Thursdays.",

At times she wouldn't be able to help me because she hadn't looked at it beforehand.",

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to those who might use algorithms such like EM, importance sampling, reject\/accept sampling, and MCMC. This course gives great introduction and practice for those algorithms.",
    "It's very useful for related researches, and the examples given in class is practical and easy understanding. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "It's a good course to start with if one wants to learn about optimization, Monte Carlo simulation stuff with very limited previous experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Although the course was challenging, the material is very relevant, especially to researchers in public health and other disciplines.",
    "Recommend.",
    "This is a very difficult and challenging course, but you do learn a lot. I'd recommend it only if you have a strong background in statistics, however. If you don't, you may be spending 20+ hours a week on hw assignments.",
    "It will be useful for us to accumulate some computational skills. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to computational statistics. It reviews some basic conceptsfor how to set up a statistical problem, and introduces computational methods to find solutions. A major emphasis of the course is identifying and solving problems that cannot be solved analytically, and on devising computational methods to address these problems. A second important emphasis of the course is on identifying forms of analytical problems that can be computed efficiently, especially when the familiar form would take a long time to compute.I took this course having had relatively little background in statistics, and it was very hard (I didn't do particularly well in the course), but valuable.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student who was very comfortable with both programming and statistics and who had the time to invest in the class. It was a worthwhile class, but in general I wouldn't recommend it to other engineers.",
    "It is challenging and you need to use sources outside the textbook and lectures to get the HW done. The HW definitely helps in learning the material. The instructor's lectures are clear. However, the final is very hard and counts for 50% of the grade.",
    "The course gives a good introduction to main topics in computational statstics. And my understanding of the methods and theories discussed were strengthened in doing homework.",
    "highly recommend this course to those new to algorithms but interested in some fancy algorithms",
    "Yes, of course. It is the best!",
    "Yes. Because it's very useful.",
    "Very important methods in computational stats is introduced in detail. Computational skills with R are also developed.",
    "Nice",
    "Overall a course that was easy for some but hard for the majority. I learned a lot and would recommend it to any one interested in computational statistics",
    "Tough course, you will a learn a lot, worth all the hard work.",
    "I highly recommend the course. I thought the course is the most useful for research and career.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.My summary: the class offers a 'to-the-point\" introduction to computer optimization approaches and procedures for estimating parameters in statistical models. Ever wondered how SAS or R compute a regression parameter, a bootstrapped estimator, or what in the world is MCMC? This class will give you a great jump start.(Of course, if you are a recent graduate of foreign program, you might find this class a bit slow.)"
