    "Take it! The material is interesting and everyone should be exposed to earth sciences! Professor Park is an enthusiastic professor you seems to brighten the day at such an early hour. The paper topics are yours to choose, thus researching them and writing them is a worthwhile experience. I made some good friends from this class. No one deemed it necessary to be competitive, and instead Professor Park paved out a relaxing path for us to grasp the basic concepts of earth science.",
    "Good, came out with a better grasp on reading scientific journal articles. Not too much work, but at the same time with the lack of exams I didn't learn the material as fully. Professor Park is very passionate about the material, and wrote the textbook, so he really knows it!",
    "I would call it a gut seminar, not in a bad way though.",
    "It's a great class, taught in a format I had never seen before in a science class. It's not taught in a lecture format; everyone is expected to read the chapter beforehand and answer specific questions about it in class discussion. Let me make this clear: there are no tests or quizzes. You are evaluated based on class participation and two papers, which are on a topic of your choice, so you can have a lot of fun with them if you want to. It's totally variable how much work there is per week, since most of it is reading; some people read the assigned chapters extensively and took notes, others just skimmed them so they were prepared to answer a specific question they volunteered for. For every class, two scientific articles are summarized by two pairs of students. This was an aspect of class that not too many people were crazy about, since during the presentations, everyone who is not presenting invariably zones out. Reading these articles to a depth where you can eventually give a presentation about it was occasionally a challenge. I took this class because I'm an EVST major, and it was certainly a relief after all the dry science classes I have taken. Professor Park, by the way, is AWESOME and hilarious, both in class and in the emails he sends to us.",
    "A pretty awful class. The only grades are two papers on whatever topic you want (no exams), so there is literally no incentive to actually learn the material. Each day, you just summarize the textbook chapter that was assigned, and that's it. The professor doesn't add anything else to the discussion, so I would have essentially learned the same amount just by reading the textbook once to myself. He also makes you do these little presentations (2 groups present each class) which are a ridiculous waste of time. Literally everyone in the class pulls their phone out or falls asleep when these start. All that said, it is REALLY easy and no work, so not bad for a 5th class.",
    "The class provides a list of questions prior to each class that the professor relies on class participation to answer. During each class, the professor goes through the assigned questions and then two pairs of students present on scientific articles. There is a five page midterm paper and a 15-20 page final paper, but no exams. The course is easily accessible to non-science majors and requires some work, but very little mastery of scientific concepts.",
    "A great survey class of topics in Geology. I thought I would only enjoy the latter part of the course (hydrology, climate), but it turns out rocks and plate tectonics are pretty cool! The final paper is enjoyable because you are free to choose a topic that interests you.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in the topic. I thought this class was really great. This is a seminar style of teaching and it is very unique because you don't see that often. Most of the class periods are spent on answering questions and talking about different topics of geology. The discussions are great and the material is very easy to understand. Professor Park is awesome and the workload is very manageable.",
    "This was a good low-key science credit, since I don't really enjoy taking tests. I feel that I learned a lot and enjoyed writing the papers.",
    "Good class, not a gut. 2 long papers and some technical terminology and concepts.",
    "Geology and Geophysics 115 is a broad survey course accessible to non-science majors, especially since it is in a seminar format without problem sets. The paper at the end is a bit challenging.",
    "Definitely. Professor Park is a wonderfully engaging teacher and does a great job getting non-geology kids excited about earth sciences.Surprisingly interesting subject since it covers so much - you get to delve into the most interesting topics within each major field of earth science."
