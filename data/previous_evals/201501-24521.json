    "A very interesting class if you have an interest in Latin America or human rights. Professor Hurtado is very knowledgable about the material and has been a major player in the defense of human rights in Latin America. I would recommend this class. The readings could be a little long but were doable (if you skimmed a bit). I feel much more informed on the main topic of the class and a little more prepared to decide what I want to do after graduation as a result of what we studied here.",
    "Take it",
    "Really nice seminar. Take it for Professor Hurtado."
