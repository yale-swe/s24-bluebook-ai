    "So if you are an astro student looking to take this class as an undergrad, there are a few things you need to look at. THIS IS A GRAD CLASS. It is certainly taught at a graduate level. So , if you do not have a solid understanding of astronomy, physics, or basic coding in some cases, I would be wary of this course. My best advice is to take it with friends to where you can work on the problem sets together. You'll only have 4 problem sets which sounds nice. Fair warning: they take a decent amount of time. The first two aren't bad but involves a lot of trial and error (it makes it feel like what people actually do for exoplanet research). The last two are incredibly difficult. The level of this class is a doozy, but with others it is doable as an undergrad. You can get a lot out of this class. You get to know some grad students. You get to have a feel of grad level classes (really helpful if you are planning on going to grad school). Finally, you also get to have a strong understanding of exoplanets. My final point is that Dr. Laughlin is incredible. He has the cool factor to him that isn't pronounced but it is there enough that you can 100% get a nice, chill vibe from him. He truly makes a 9 am class enjoyable, especially for someone who hates mornings as much as me. He is incredible at providing help in a manner that isn't straight up giving away answers but leads you enough to put you in a position to solve it."
