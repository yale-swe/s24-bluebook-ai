    "More seminars like Physical Seminar - Francesco Paesani, UC San Diego where he boils down his science for the nontheorist And less seminars like Physical Seminar - Henry Fritz Schaefer, University of Georgia where even theorists find it hard to understand. Don't want to attack professors, but more info could be given to them about the audience they are talking to. Other good seminar includes: Physical Seminar - Poul Petersen, Cornell University Other not-so-great seminars include: Physical Seminar - Matt Beard, National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Physical Seminar - Tom Allison, Stony Brook University ; Physical Seminar - Carlos Meriles, The City College of New York"
