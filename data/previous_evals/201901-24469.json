    "I learned a lot about Imperial Russia in all sense of the time period. It was not only political history, but also social and religious. It was very well rounded!",
    "Knowledge of imperial Russian history. Ability to interpret and understand translated sources from the period in context.",
    "You learn a lot about the period between Alexander I and the fall of the Russian autocracy. The syllabus is great it gives a wide range of literary and historical documents to supplement the lectures. A significant part of the course also concerns 'myths' in Russian history (dispelling famous urban myths regarding the serfs, Rasputin, etc)"

   "comments": [
    "It was super great overall! I learned a lot that I did not know before taking the class. The class was very small, but was nice to have a smaller class environment. If you don't like big lectures, this is for you.",
    "Strength: lectures are content-heavy, typically well-organised, and very comprehensive. Lecture notes are effectively a textbook in point form. Strength: syllabus assigns both mandatory and optional readings, which caters to students who may want to do more work on any particular topic. Weakness: Prof Antonov can afford to sign-post his lectures. Sometimes it is unclear where he leaves off from a topic and enters another.",
    "Strengths: Definitely the source material. The amount of reading you do is really up to you, but the papers definitely force you to become knowledgeable about the historical contentions regarding different parts of the course. The readings are all interesting, and reading Russian authors like Chekhov is amazing.",
    "The small class size made specialisation within the topic easy, however the 75 minute class slot meant that sometimes it was a challenge to focus for the whole period."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Professor Antonov was amazing and you will learn a great deal about Russia. I was not super interested in taking Russian history before the course, but it really opens you up to the culture!",
    "A great survey course of imperial Russia. Probably useful and even necessary if you plan on doing further work on imperial or modern Russia, whether in history or in political science. Prof Antonov also spends two or three lectures on culture so it may be useful for area studies and Russian literature or film students.",
    "This course is well taught and incredibly interesting. Professor Antonov displays great engagement and incredible knowledge of the subject matter."
