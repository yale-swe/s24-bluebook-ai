    "I learned to view history in a different way, more from the perspective of people and their views rather than facts and dates.",
    "The course helped me appreciate the diversity in historical and political thought and provided an important demonstration of some universal problems that humans come against when they pursue historical accuracy or make any kind of historical account.",
    "The political philosophy and major historical writings of \"western civilization\" pre-Renaissance. How human societies work, in the abstract or how they should work, and how they often fail.",
    "I gained a strong understanding of ancient politics and history via an intense reading load and writing. This course does a great job of connecting the different texts and authors.",
    "This class gave me a great insight on how politics and history relate. It also allowed me to see how many current ideas were based in ideas from ancient times.",
    "-reading\/thinking critically -talking in seminars -writing",
    "Intensive reading of classical historical texts. Analysis of texts and formulating cohesive thesis about the material read.",
    "In this course I improved my reading and writing skills. I now feel more confident reading large amounts of text more quickly and identifying the important passages. I also feel more confident writing argumentative essays, keeping mind to evaluate both sides of an argument as I construct it."

   "comments": [
    "Taking the works as isolated texts (and relating them only to other texts covered in the course) is a feature of DS, but I think that there were certainly areas (especially for the political philosophy) where greater knowledge of historical context or integration of some instruction about the history surrounding a text would have been helpful.",
    "DS H&P is great all around. I can't come up with anything bad about it. Professor Nakhimovsky was one of the greatest teachers I've ever had, and I genuinely feel lucky to have learned from him.",
    "This courses strengths are the amount of knowledge each student gains from taking the class. The class allows for a greater understanding of some fundamental ancient ideas.",
    "-interesting, all fits together really well, awesome instructor -a lot of reading, so sometimes hard\/impossible to do it all in a meaningful way",
    "The material itself received a lot of thoughtful dialogue, but it would have been interesting to see the importance H&P had on the western canon as a whole. That is, there was not much time dedicated to external material.",
    "This course has a lot of dry material which can be difficult, but there is sufficient more exciting material to balance out the necessary more difficult texts on the syllabus. I would like for there to be slightly less Herodotus reading as it was difficult to understand that kind of reading at the beginning of the semester while also adjusting to all the other aspects of Yale life. I think it would be cool to also read some of Julius Caesar's own writings because they are often referenced in the works we read."

    "Yes.",
    "Yes, very much so. Loved Professor Nakhimovsky, the material of the course, and the process of learning so much.",
    "My life would not be as good if I hadn't taken this class. Take it!",
    "H&P was my favorite of the DS courses, and I found the readings and lectures for this class to be consistently enjoyable and excellent. Writing papers for this class was also the most fun.",
    "Yes. This is an excellent course, probably even the beat in directed studies. The professors are extremely knowledgeable and each student will learn a great amount by taking this course.",
    "Yes! Challenging but very rewarding and well worth it!",
    "Yes. This is part of the DS experience. If you have the interest in the material. Its a fulfilling and challenging experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are sure that they are interested in the material covered in Directed Studies. If the student finds the kind of work done in DS engaging that I would strongly recommend it as it is a great comprehensive course that will help them to improve reading, writing, and critical thinking skills. However, if they are not sure they are interested in the course, I would recommend against Directed Studies as it is very intense and time consuming."
