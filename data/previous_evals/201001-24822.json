    "It seems like you're going at a much slower pace than Italian 125 (with Farina), but it's a different class. With Farina, you learn as much vocabulary as possible and focus on spoken Italian; with Prof. Georgeo, you work extensively on your written Italian. Be prepared for weekly compositions and a lot of scrutiny on them. In the end, though, it's worth it -I think I can see the difference even within a semester.",
    "Italian 145 is a great way to immerse yourself in learning the language. It is a lot of class time, but you definitely reap the benefits and your language skills improve a lot throughout the semester.",
    "IF you took the first semester of intensive Italian I'd recommend continuing with this class. It effectively fills in the gaps that L1-L2 can leave, and you'll come out a much more complete Italian speaker\/reader\/writer.",
    "Don't miss out on this class. It is one of the most intense language courses you can take but also one of the most interesting. Prof. Georgeo will make sure you get a lot out of it.",
    "Absolutely"
