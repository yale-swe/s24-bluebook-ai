    "How to work ethically as a scientist with regard to publication, research and presentation.",
    "I learned about some interesting ethical concerns in the sciences.",
    "How to think about research ethics in chemistry from a broader, more philosophical standpoint.",
    "Learned what ethical scientific research is like",
    "I learned about sexual misconduct in STEM, plagiarism, fabrication, and I really appreciated the topic on journals.",
    "Learning what's ethical or unethical conducts beside the obvious ones. Learning how to judge fellow colleagues and take action when necessary.",
    "I learnt to be able to recognize unethical issue in the field of science.",
    "A broad overview of the shortcomings of academia to follow up on and enforce ethical issues. I learned that we are far behind in terms of worker treatment than where I thought we were as a field.",
    "What is and what is not within the realm of ethical conduct as it relates to chemical research",
    "I have a better understanding of the types of ethical questions that can come up in professional and academic chemistry. I also learned about the many different faces that ethical issues can have and that there is not necessarily a universal right answer to solving ethical issues.",
    "I learned how to think about ethical issues and was exposed to perspectives different from my own.",
    "The ability to think about ethical issues from many angles.",
    "General ideas about what is considered ethical or not.",
    "The course helped me to appreciate the role of ethical issues such as plagiarism, fraud, falsification, fabrication in scientific research. It helped me to understand what might drive scientists to cross an unethical line, and discuss and analyze particular case studies.",
    "I learned about ethical issues and topics associated directly with my future field. I was able to learn about the rights and wrongs about many ethical subjects including those that are often not addressed or not thought of as wrong. I also enjoyed learning about why this course was being offered.",
    "Knowing about different aspects of ethics in the scientific community."

   "comments": [
    "It's kind of a hodge-podge of topics all loosely related to scientific ethics. I don't know how it could be improved, and given that there was little work involved other than showing up, it was fine.",
    "The strengths were the interesting content. The weakness was the way it was conveyed. There was too much lecture and not enough discussion. Often when there was discussion the ideas put forward by students was rejected and not allowed to be discussed further. As an ethics class i think this is a great opportunity for friendly and structured debate, yet it seemed that there was always a correct answer. This discouraged further participation. It also should be scheduled as an hour long class if it will always run an hour. It was difficult to sit in class and focus and absorb what was being taught when it was not clear when the class would be ending. It is was also hard to plan other meetings in the evening as we did not know how long the class would last. It is reasonable for the class to be more than 50 minutes, but if that is the case then that should be made clear to everyone taking the class. I felt that it was disrespectful to my time that the class would consistently run longer than the agreed upon time. Finally it was difficult to keep track of the readings for the class since we were often behind schedule. The readings themselves were interesting and pertinent and very reasonable in length, however they were often discussed two or more weeks after they were assigned and therefore it was often difficult to remember the detail of the readings and have a productive discussion about the readings. I think this was often taken as evidence that we did not do the readings, but I think, at least in my case, that the issue was more that they were no longer fresh in my mind.",
    "I very much appreciated the approach that this class took to discussion ethical conduct in research. Instead of simply saying that plagiarism is bad and against school policy (which is how many ethics classes could go), this course allowed the students to engage in why plagiarism is bad, what the consequences should or should not be, why it matters, and how the system is set up to favor certain cases of ethical violations. As far as weakness of the course, it was set up as a discussion-based class and stated that participation was required, but struggled to actively and effectively engage everyone or keep track of who was participating. In the future, a suggestion I have would be to employ other methods of class participation that do not rely on raising hands and being called on in a full-class discussion. These methods could include brief written responses (1 sentence to a paragraph), smaller group discussion, full class assessments such as clicker questions or polls. A mix of these various forms of participation can involve everyone, even those who may not feel comfortable or who might not get called on in a \"class discussion\" setting.",
    "Allows you to participate but class is too large for everyone to contribute",
    "The material in this class was excellent. I really appreciated all of our discussion times and I felt like as a class we were much more engaged than other classes of similar intent.",
    "The time of the course is unfortunate. Perhaps a better time would help with engagement.",
    "I felt the moral explorations were superficial at times, but overall it was a helpful class to \"open your eyes\"",
    "strengths: I think the topic of ethics is really important weaknesses: I think the instructor didn't really promote an environment of active discussion. There seemed to always be a right answer. No room for debate.",
    "I like the structure of the course: the reading load is great for graduate students taking many other classes and working in lab. Moreover, I like that the course has current content from ethical issues being figured out now. I would like to see more of Yale ethical issues and how they were dealt with at this institution.",
    "Reading assignments should be assigned before the class period during which they will be discussed. Some reading assignments were given weeks before the information was discussed and it was very difficult to remember what had been read.",
    "Very well taught-was expecting to be bored with this course but found it very interesting and exciting.",
    "Good examples. Hard to participate in class based on format.",
    "The course in general provided a lot of interesting insights both from the instructor, discussions and assigned readings. One suggestion might be a more structured syllabus where all assigned readings are clearly stated; another suggestion might be going a bit broader with different topics. Sometimes I felt that we spent way too much time on a particular subject.",
    "Strengths: Topics discussed and format of the class Weaknesses: Amount of time spent per class (classes should be longer\/ 1.5 hours)",
    "Strength: good to include real-life examples.",
    "There could be more detail provided on the appropriate way to report sexual harassment and how the department will help the student in continuing their education without repercussions from reporting."

    "It's required.",

    "As far as a required course is concerned, I appreciated this class. Since everyone has to take it, I don't think there is a question of recommending it to others.",

    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in chemistry research, even though it seems that both senior thesis students and first-year graduate students are already required to take this course. It is a good class, and it tries to make the sometimes \"bland\" topic of ethics more relevant to current researchers.",
    "It is a required course for many students. If it was not required for a particular student, I would not recommend it.",
    "Yes, I think it is very good to help students think about ethical issues.",
    "Yes. Necessary for anyone doing research.",
    "Yes, this is an important course for anyone who is interested in pursuing research or science work as their career.",
    "Yes. Although this course is mandatory, I would recommend it if it was not. It is extremely beneficial to all chemistry students.",
