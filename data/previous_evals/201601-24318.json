    "Great class. Hugh Flick is a legend. That said please only take it if you actually care about the material. He doesn't cap the class and it has a reputation of being a gut, so a ton of bro-ey canada goose econ types will take the class, sit in the back on their laptops, probably fill out their Goldman internship applications and leave early. Which just seems disrespectful to someone who is an amazing teacher and has a deep interest in helping you develop your personal worldview. Flick's voice is sonorous but his message is invigorating. The Gita is worth reading no matter your religious background and the essays give you a chance to think about the hard questions and write something you believe in. And yes, grading is pretty chill. But please don't take it as a gut. I'll give this class an A, which I think means it's the best class I've taken at Yale. Would recommend",
    "Relaxed class in which you learn about a great tradition with a great instructor.",
    "A great introduction to one of the foundations of hinduism",
    "The Bhagavad Gita was a great class. You can learn a lot from Professor Flick. He is an expert on the subject and the course load is not bad at all. It is a nice 5th class to take if you need a Humanities credit.",
    "Id say the only reasons to take this course are if you are extremely interested in the subject (enough so that you will make time to go to Prof Flicks office hours), or desperately searching for an easy class. If you have a passing interest in the subject, or have just always wanted to take a South Asian studies or Religious studies course, Id suggest you keep looking. This class is listed as a seminar, but is definitely a small lecture. I think Professor Flick posed a question to the class maybe 3 times all semester, and we never really had class discussions. While Professor Flick is very kind, and great 1-on-1, his lecturing style is very scattered, and I found it hard to follow his train of thought. If you do take this course, make sure you go to office hours to discuss the text further.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because I think it is a great experience to take a class that focuses on one text, allowing you to fully engage with an important and influential piece of literature.",
    "YES if you want to learn something different and not be in such a stressful class.",
    "A great class, whether you know everything or nothing about the Bhagavad Gita, provided that you are interested in learning about it. If you're not intrigued by it, then it probably won't be interesting to you. But in my opinion, a gem of a class.",
    "Gita is a wonderful class. You go through Prof Flick's translation. If you don't have any knowledge on this subject, I highly recommend taking it.",
    "This course is very enjoyable and will change your perspective on religion. Professor Flick is incredibly knowledgable and, at some points, very funny, and he made an effort to connect the Gita to its historical and religious roots. Because it was an intensive study of a single text, the workload was fairly light. Quite honestly, the most disheartening aspect of this class was the students. Out of the maybe 25 students in the seminar, only about 5 of us actually engaged in any sort of dialogue with Professor Flick.",
    "One of my favorites -- I definitely recommend taking this class! In terms of workload, it essentially involves weekly reading coupled with a reading response. It is *very* manageable so this could easily be a fifth class if need be. The essays are also not too difficult to manage, especially when Prof Flick and the TF are willing to help in any way they can. Speaking of which, Prof Flick is an incredible instructor and if you have the opportunity to take a class with him then you should definitely do so! He makes the 2 hour lectures bearable, and they are pretty interesting regardless. Obviously an easier class if you are familiar with the material but the focus is more on your individual reaction to The Gita so don't be afraid to take it if you've never ventured into this world before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The workload is very low (one 3-5 pg paper and a 10-12 final paper, and weekly responses that are about a paragraph). I really got a lot out of this class and thoroughly enjoyed analyzing the text.",
    "I entered this course wanting to be motivated to read the Gita. I am proud to say that I have read the whole Gita by myself and have developed my own personal view on many of the philosophies in it. Moreover, I have learned a lot about what the words mean and have encountered a brand new interpretation of the Gita, which is Prof Flick's interpretation. All in all, I am happy I took this course. I put a lot of work into it and was pushed to think further by both essays. But, I can't ignore the fact that many of the students treated the class like a joke. Many students were shopping online, reading sports magazines, etc. during class. I think they missed out on a great opportunity to learn from Prof Flick, and also about one of the greatest texts ever written. Make sure not to emulate them, but I also think that Prof Flick misses out engaging the students in a certain way. Sometimes he seemed like he was reciting the notes he took while reading the Gita and I'm not sure that was the best way to help me grapple with the ideas in the Gita though I think it gave me new ideas about the Gita. A lot of class time is listening to him meandering while speaking about the text, though that isn't inherently bad. I also think he does not focus on the personal growth that can be done with the readings.There are a lot of interesting concepts in the text that are at odd with the American ideals we grow up with and I think it's very valuable that they are pointed out, and I'm not sure they were. Actually that would've been a great final essay topic... That being said, I think a lot of Prof's meandering during class is extremely valuable and the way he takes the time to dive into some of the Sanskrit is really special. A last note, you do really have to motivate yourself to read the chapters on time and finish the forum posts on time. You can get away without doing any work very easily, but I'm sure your grade would be affected and you'd learn a lot less when you slack. Not worth the procrastination."
