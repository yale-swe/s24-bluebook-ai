   "comments": [
    "If you're at all interested in writing or theater I would absolutely recommend the course. It's a great way to improve your writing and your understanding of the art of playwriting in general.",
    "Absolutely! Even those with no background in theater or writing will find this class really interesting and fun",
    "This course was a great introduction to playwriting -- I'm so glad I took it, and I think I've learned a lot about the genre.",
    "Take this class if you want to have written a one act play about a family by the end of it. Most of the work for the first half of the semester involves reading plays. Most of the work for the second half involves writing your own. There are also a number of minor written assignments like workshop notes to other class members, and worksheets to fill out about plays you read.",
    "Karen Hartman is a great writing teacher. She knows what she wants and can be demanding and is certainly not free and easy with grading, but she's also VERY good at critiquing work and explaining her perspective, and really helping you to improve a scene\/play\/whatever you're working on. She's ready and willing to meet outside of class, which really makes all the difference. You read some great plays and get a chance to write and explore the nature of family interaction - which for me proved to be a really wonderful experience. I'd take this class if you're interested in any of the above things - it's not a tremendous amount of work, but you do leave feeling accomplished about the work you did!"
