    "-maybe for english majors but the course is not for everybody",
    "This is a good pre-1800 credit for english majors and still a good option for non-english majors. You read a play a week which seems daunting but is very manageable once you get the hang of Shakesperian language. Apart from that, two non-cumulative hour long tests and 3 papers. It is an enjoyable class.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 200 to another student. Professor Manley was wonderful and always prepared for lecture, with a high number of insightful revelations per class. The visual presentation was also a great complement to the course as well as the background information on some of Shakespeare's sources and contemporaries. Overall, ENGL 200 was a great survey course on Shakespeare's romances and comedies, especially on some of the more obscure problem plays and less popularized romances",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Only a play per week (about 100 pages of reading) and lectures are worth going to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are great and go at a very manageable pace (a play a week). I personally enjoyed discussion during section more than being in lecture, but Professor Manely is funny and kept things interesting.",
    "Fun and useful choice for both English majors and non-majors. After all, Shakespeare applies to everything!",
    "It's a Shakespeare comedy or romance each week--wonderful, if you like Shakespeare (though , admittedly, not sure if anyone really likes Pericles). Pretty easy workload, fun sections, interesting lectures.",
    "Manley is not as flashy as Kastan, but I personally think he delivers more content. You\u2019ll get a very good sense of the comedies and romances from this play, something I think every English student should know before they graduate. Not too tough of a class, and papers are fairly short and straightforward. I would definitely recommend it if only for the texts themselves.",
    "I'd recommend it if you want to read the plays. The lectures are interesting and well done (though quite fast-paced and not very clearly organized, so difficult to keep up with while taking notes). Having a midterm and a final in a class like this is annoying, but other than that the workload is not too bad for a literature class. Your overall experience will depend a lot on the TA you end up with -- some assign extra work during the week and are strict with deadlines; my TA assigned no extra work, was very flexible, and did cool things like bring us to the Beinecke.",
    "It's a good way to satisfy your 1800 requirement for the English major. And these plays are too canonical to miss, really. It's 3 papers, one with a revision, a few additional assignments depending on your TA, and two ID-based exams. Manageable, and useful.",
    "A fun crash course of Shakespeare",
    "ENGL 200 is a decent overview of the Shakespeare romances and comedies. It's a lot of reading- one play a week aka one scene a day- so don't take this if you have any other reading intensive classes. Lectures are very boring and confusing, and you won't miss much by skipping them. The midterm and final are just IDs, but can be tricky. The papers are only 5 pages and very manageable and section is interesting if you get a good TF. Essentially the reading list is great, but the class is not exactly life-changing.",
    "No.",
    "Take this if you'd like to encounter some of the greatest literature in the English language. There's a fair amount of work attached, but it's worth it. You're never going to get credit to do this sort of thing after college, so you might as well get the benefit now.",
    "ENGL 200 is a lecture course that does a play per week from Shakespeare's comedies and romances. There were three papers, and a midterm and final worth very little. I enjoyed most of the plays ... although I didn't get to all of them, which surprisingly was not at all a problem. I wasn't the biggest fan of Manley's lectures. The course was pleasant and not too much work, but not the best.",
    "Maybe; this course is alright. The best part about, and really the reason you should take it, is to get to read a lot of Shakespeare plays including some more obscure comedies. If you look at the syllabus and haven't read most of the plays, then thats a reason to actually take it. Other than that, though, both lecture and sections were alright but not that great either. Really try to do the reading. The exams are super straightforward if you've done the reading (use the powerpoints Prof. Manley puts up to study and quiz yourself on quotations). Also not a bad way to get a Wr credit for non-English majors.",
    "You read 13 great plays, some of which are incredible, and although you will probably get frustrated by Manley's endless references to things you probably haven't read (if you don't fall asleep or end up on facebook first), section will make it all worthwhile. If you are an English major, you've got to take this class. These plays are worth it all.",
    "Take it! It was a lot of fun to go through the plays (1 a week). The pace was manageable and wasn't too stressful. The essays were interesting to write and I feel like I learned a lot. Prof. Manley was really great. His lectures were really interesting and easy to follow. I feel like I learned a lot from him. And he was a very kind professor, always available to meet to discuss essays and offered helpful points of how to shape our essays.",
    "I love Shakespeare so I'm biased. Good class for English majors. If not, maybe not for you, but I think everyone can enjoy these plays.",
    "Definitely!!",
    "I would recommend it in conjunction with Histories & Tragedies, for a thorough basic grounding in Shakespeare",
    "AMAZING course!! I have always wanted to read these plays, and I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to do so here. Section was great, especially with Rebecca Rush. Lecture can be a bit boring, but listen and Prof Manley really knows what he's talking about. It is a very reasonable course load--1 play a week, 3 5 page papers, and 2 50 min tests on IDs. Very reasonable and rewarding. A GREAT WRITING CREDIT!!!",
    "A great introductory class to Shakespeare. Not too much work, but one learns a lot, and does not have to have background with the material to get a lot out of the class.",
    "A high quality lecture course! - a play a week - interesting lectures (not paradigm-shifting each lecture, as some people were expecting. I think that a lot of hype surrounded the class so then students throughout the semester were unfairly critical) I would recommend it! You get out of it what you put in. The weeks I didn't read the play the lectures were boring and section was painful. Skip lecture? The play won't stick with you as much.",
    "I would recommend this course, but encourage students to take it seriously. I didn't really - I didn't read many of the plays. Obviously, this meant that I got less out of the course.",
    "I'm not sure I'd recommend the class. You read great stuff (obviously), but the lectures are super dry and not engaging.",
    "I like reading Shakespeare, so I enjoyed this class. Professor Manley's lectures are sometimes excellent and sometimes not, but for the most part they are interesting and they always add a lot to the plays. I am emphatically not a humanities major, but with a little work I felt like my paper-writing skills improved to the point where I was writing acceptable papers by the end of the semester. Overall fun, as long as you get into the plays.",
    "I would not recommend this course at all. Do not take it! It takes these beautiful, crazy texts and reduces them to heteronormative, misogynistic, historical artifacts. If you're interested in how Shakespeare's plays are about \"marriage as civilizing force\" and \"the ultimate preservation of social order,\" take this class; if you want something queer and stimulating and subversive, stay away.",
    "This was my first lecture English class, and as an English Major, I was not satisfied. Lectures were occasionally interesting and Manley knows his stuff , but the course is not particularly useful. You read some good plays, but also some serious losers. Manley is good at finding the interesting parts of the bad plays, but some plays just feel useless. Section is painful and full of people who don't want to be there.",
    "Yes, yes, yes-- take this class! It's so much fun if you've some familiarity with the comedies and romances, and a wonderful introduction to Shakespeare for those with no prior knowledge.",
    "Yes. Study shakesepare. He is a genius. Exam is IDs I personally hate the format and think it is the stupidest way to test whether someone has read the play ever invented; however, it is not that bad and I am sure not everyone feels the way I do.",
    "English 200 offers a neat and straightforward run through most of Shakespeare's comedies and romances. Prof. Manley's lectures are insightful, the work is manageable, and several of the plays even had me laughing out loud in the library! In fact, while I enrolled in the course simply to fulfill one of the English major's pre-1800 requirements and did not particularly like Shakespeare previously, I now find that I enjoy the poet's plays much more than I thought I would. So yes, I would recommend this course to another student: go into with an open mind, and you'll have a grand time!",
    "This is a must-take course for anyone who enjoys English. Shakespeare is beautiful and Professor Manley handles the plays and the course perfectly!",
    "This course was an absolute pleasure to take: a wonderful professor and an absolutely fantastic syllabus, all for the price of a very light workload. I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in diving into Shakespeare, and to English majors (including juniors and seniors!) who are looking for a completely lovely and utterly painless way to fulfill at pre-1800 credit. SIGN UP! DON'T HESITATE!",
    "I really enjoyed this class when I attended lecture. Because the exams are non-cumulative and only ask for quote IDs, it isn't always necessary to go to lecture if you read the books. I wish I had gone to class more often, because Prof Manley's lectures are filled with interesting content and background. I would recommend the class for anyone who wants to read Shakespeare and will put in the time to read and enjoy the plays.",
    "While you may have to take this class for the English major pre-1800 requirements, try to find a different one. This class is geared towards auditory learners."
