    "I would definitely recommend this class with Michal! He goes very quickly through the material and examples. It might seem slightly overwhelming at first, but after a few weeks you get used to the pace. Because he works so quickly, class is really interesting and time flies. Also, because he gives tough examples in class and on the homework, you are well prepared for the exams. He is also very helpful in office hours. I did not like calculus at all before but Michal makes it much easier and more enjoyable!",
    "Yes I definitely would.",
    "TAKE WITH MICHAL TRYNIECKI!!!!!!!! He's wonderful. It's a tough class because the material is tough. Interesting if you like math.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 as it is a fairly standard course and not too challenging.",
    "This is a course that should be taken by those students who have taken calculus AB and wish to continue exploring the topic of calculus. The course content is comparable to that presented in calculus BC.",
    "I have never had a more dedicated and patient instructor. Tryniecki is attentive and creative, and he cares so much about his students. He works through the material very quickly but is happy to work with you if you are falling behind. He expects a lot out of his students, but, with his attitude, every student is glad to work a bit more than usual."
