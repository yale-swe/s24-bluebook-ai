    "A great way to expand one's visual literacy.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student interested in improving his or her close reading abilities of films.",
    "This is a class that looks at a specific and fascinating aspect of film, allowing combinations of films to be viewed that might not ordinarily be seen together, which I thought was quite productive. This is a good class for people outside of film studies, as it is accessible and open to input from a range of disciplines. Hearing comments from classmates outside one's own discipline can also be very stimulating. I would recommend this class."

   "comments": [
    "This course encouraged me to switch majors!",
    "I am always on the lookout for different ways to conceptualize film, especially ways that offer greater contact with the theatrical. This class pushed me to admit some theories based in the visual arts, too, which I had hitherto largely ignored but which are indeed quite important when considering film.",
    "I am not a comparative literature or film student, but this class was hugely helpful to me for thinking about the formal aspects of theatre--that is, in discussing what makes film \"film\" as opposed to theatre, it also helped me to really think about what makes theatre \"theatre.\" The engagement with intermediality was hugely illuminating for me."
