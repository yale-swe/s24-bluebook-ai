   "comments": [
    "OF COURSE I would reccommend this course to someone else. You will be slightly miserable while you are taking it, but that's what learning is all about. You will emerge into the sunlight of summer knowing how to think about quantum mechanics. Most people in the world have no idea what quantum mechanics is. Alot of pseudo intellectuals pretend like they do. You will have an inkling of what it is, a starting point for learning more! How amazing is that ? No, it won't be easy, but if you want easy be an American Studies major for crying out loud.",
    "CHEM 333 basically covers quantum mechanics in chemistry. It's an awesome class.",
    "So what to say about Pchem...It's rough, but you learn a lot. Prof. Vaccaro should really publish his notes. You can bypass the Atkins book by paying attention to class, learning from the Psets, and going over lecture slides\/handouts. The problem sets, like the tests, are usually long but doable. Overall, it's a great environment for learning about pchem. You probably wouldn't take this if you weren't a chemistry major, but it's not a good reason to drop the major. You learn a lot about chemistry, and all the knowledge from earlier classes makes a lot more sense.",
    "I would summarize Chemistry 333 01 as a very thorough introduction to quantum with some introduction to statistical thermodynamics. I would definitely recommend it to another student because it is an exciting course that introduces many of the underpinnings of chemistry and because the teacher is fantastic (thorough, clear, and always willing to help).",
    "This is basically a course on how quantum mechanics leads to spectroscopic phenomena. Take ENAS 194 before taking this if at all possible. Lectures sometimes have little to do with what you are expected to know for exams, so pay attention to the problem sets first, and then to the lectures.",
    "This is a course that is pretty difficult. I qwould recommend it only if you are interested in quantum mechanics or you need it for your major.",
    "I loved this class, and it made me love a new subject. It was well taught, I learned a lot, and professor Vaccaro was very helpful. The only weakness I think is that we barely cover statistical thermodynamics, which is such an interesting and important topic.Professor Vaccaro is amazing. He is a very clear lecturer, and even better in person. He is also very, very organized, and did a good job of tying the class together. I loved talking to him during office hours and he was very clear and helpful and friendly as well. I also love how available he is. Almost anytime I wanted to talk to him he made out time for me.His lecture notes are very clear, and it's very helpful to page through the lecture notes that he puts on reserve, since he actually writes down in words explaining things on his lecture notes.His problem sets were also really fun to work through, and supplemented the class material very well, thus increasing what we learned in the class.As for tests, they can be tricky, and actually involve a LOT of studying, more than your conventional science class just because of the volume of material that you need to learn. In particular, knowing the equations is NOT enough since you are also tested True\/False on the tests, thus testing if you understand all the details and nuances of the material. Though annoying and my bane in the class, even learning from my mistakes in these T\/F questions taught me a lot.I would completely recommend chem333 to another student. With Vaccaro, it is basically baby quantum dynamics. If you want to do more Stat Mech you should probably take the Chem or Physics class dedicated to the subject. If you are really mathy the class material is actually quite a cinch, but it was very hard for my less-mathematically inclined friends. If you are REALLY, REALLY good at math, maybe the physics quantum class will prove more challenging and fun. But as far as PChem goes, you actually learn a lot of science.",
    "You are obviously a chem major or chemical engineering class. You clearly have to take this class, so take it. enjoy it. It will continuously blow your mind in a good way; it's tough, so stay on top of things, and start psets the day after you get them! Seriously! But it's a great class; it will really deepen and show you the orgins of pretty much everything you know about chemistry right now. BTW, PCHEM IS BASICALLY DERIVING ALL OF CHEMISTRY IN TWO SEMESTERS; SO DON'T MISS OUT ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE. THEREFORE, go to lecture, don't miss this.",
    "Don't take it unless you're incredibly interested in chemistry (particularly the quantum mechanical aspects) and\/or need the class. (These two should probably co-occur...) It's tough material and requires time and effort, but it's interesting and goes way beyond a lot of other classes.",
    "Second semester pchem is definitely harder than the first semester. Problem sets can get pretty long, but if you have a good professor it remains pretty comprehensible. Professor Vaccaro is great--extremely organized and very available to meet with students.",
    "Take this course. If Patrick Vaccaro is teaching it, bend over backwards and sideways to take this course. If you're a physics major, take this course to get your introduction to quantum- the \"chemistry\" in the title doesn't make it less effective and beautiful. Vaccaro teaches at a perfect pace that is fairly quick but seems slow because his explanations are clear and methodical. The course incorporates a fair amount of math; you will get the most out of it if you combine it with some linear algebra and differential equations. You will be held accountable for EVERYTHING, and you will never regurgitate but always learn a little more while completing Vaccaro's artfully created tests and homework. Conclusion: please take this course. It's the best course I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you're a physical scientist, do it. You will solidify your math, if it is shaky. You will solidify your chemistry if it is shaky.",
    "The second semester of PChem goes through quantum mechanics, working up to atomic and molecular orbitals. There's also a little stat mech at the very end, but not all that much. It's a very rewarding class, because you learn so much, but it's also very much work, and difficult at times. I would recommend having a lot of math experience - having taken Math 120 and Math 250 really helped me be comfortable with all the integrals we were doing. Take it if you're willing to put in a lot of work - in that case, the class is great.",
    "This was a very well taught class. There was a lot of material, sometimes it felt like quantum mechanics through a fire hose, but over all it was a good class. Professor Vaccaro is an engaging lecturer and is very helpful and open for office hours. I can't say I would recommend this class for people who don't already need to take it for chem or chem e. as it was pretty exhausting and the tests were very difficult, but the subject is very interesting and I definitely think it was very worthwhile.",
    "If you're going to take PChem, take it with Vaccaro for sure. There is no better way to learn it. Keep up on work. MAKE SURE TO READ AND MAKE USE OF THE HANDOUTS. Ask lots of questions. Take advantage of how much Vaccaro cares about the class and his students. Take this class if you are a chem major and have to, or also if you aren't a chem major but need a good class on quantum mechanics. I wouldn't have wanted to learn this stuff from anyone else",
    "This class is extremely hard and demands a lot of your time to understand the material",
    "Yes. This class was very good, much better than first semester of p-chem, mainly due to the professor. Professor Vacarro makes the class engaging, and is very clear in his lectures.",
    "A ton of work spanning a ton of material with a great payoff",
    "A difficult course, but well taught by Professor Vaccaro, who presents quantum quite facilely. Weekly problem sets cover the material well, but do present new material which you are expected to know. Same with the provided handouts.",
    "Tough class. Professor Vaccaro is a good teacher but the class is pretty rigorous and he expects you to work hard to learn the material. Problem sets are time-consuming but not impossible, especially if you work with other people. This class was pretty exhausting b\/c Vaccaro used every minute of class time through reading week and often went over by a few minutes to cover more material. If you put in some effort to understand the material you will learn a lot though.",
    "If you had Vaccaro for P Chem lab first semester, don't worry - this class is 1000x better than lab was. I think it's the among best taught science courses I've taken at Yale. The second half of the semester is more complex and moves much quicker than the first half, so make sure you are always on top of your work - and stay organized! He doesn't use the textbook so you need to keep the million hand outs he gives you in order.Quantum is difficult, but I totally recommend this class to anyone who is willing to put in the work. I'm Chem E, and unlike a lot of my other super hard classes, this class isn't challenging in a way that makes you want to throw your textbook out to window. It isn't frustrating, it just requires patience and time. Good luck!",
    "Yeah sure, it is so much better than 328 and much more interesting....though it is quite tough.....and the workload is heavy",
    "CHEM 333 is a very challenging course; take it only if you have to (for the major) or if you're ridiculously good at math, or if you really really find p-chem interesting. I got through the class having not taken statistics, differential equations, linearalgebra, or any other high-level math classes (the highest I've had is multi-variable calculus), so it's doable without huge math background, but I bet it would've been easier had I taken more math. If you have Prof. Vaccaro, definitely take advantage of his great teaching style; it will help you through the nasty bits of the class. He's an excellent teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend it. It's hard, but you learn a lot. You are forced to really come to appreciate and love physical chemistry.",
    "Very difficult. The difficulty of the problem sets grew exponentially and the difficulty of the exams exponentially from that. You have to learn a lot of quantum mechanics in a little time, and Prof. Vaccaro's lecture style makes sure that you never miss a day of class.",
    "hard.",
    "PChem 2nd semester is a rigorous class (esp. with Vaccaro) with a lot of material but it is worth is to take it and you do end up learning a lot. The problem sets were pretty long (~ 4 hours minimum) but with good planning it is a pretty manageable class. There are two midterms and a final so there are plenty of opportunities to improve your grade. Definitely take it if you need it for your major.",
    "If you survived first semester, take this class. It is amazing, and you will learn so much both factually and intuitively. Professor Vaccaro is great, and while the tests are hard they really reflect what you have learned and allow you to synthesize your knowledge. It helped me realize how interesting chemistry is, so once again, thank Professor Vaccaro.",
    "The material is cool, and Vaccaro cares a lot about the students and puts a lot of time and energy into the class. Not an easy class, but certainly interesting. Required for chem majors."
