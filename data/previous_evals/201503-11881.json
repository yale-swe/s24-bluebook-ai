    "Honestly if you don't need it for the major, there are better courses that cover the same material in more depth.",
    "If you're going to take English 125, take it with Professor Cornelius! I don't even especially enjoy poetry from the years the course covers, but Professor Cornelius was such an enthusiastic, engaging professor that ENGL 125 ended up being my favorite course of the semester. He is both a great leader of class discussions and an incredibly helpful resource during his office hours. He made a course I was dreading a really positive experience. :)",
    "I would recommend it if they are interested in pursuing a major in English. I don't think I would have taken a course focusing on Chaucer, Spenser, etc. if it hadn't been for the requirement, but I'm glad I got to explore those texts in an encouraging environment.",
    "I would characterize English 125 as a very good introduction to English poetry. I would definitely recommend this course, and not just to students who plan to major in English. I think anyone can benefit from this course."
