    "I would recommend the class because it gives you a wide appreciation for the various types of \"Christianities\" in the formative years. It also allows one to get a good sense of how Christianity developed over time, the issues involved and the problems the early Church faced.",
    "Interesting material improved by an engaging professor. You want to work with Professor Davis.",
    "Great class.",
    "I would recommend RLST 649 to another student. I would say that it is a great introduction to the history and practices of the early church and many of the most important literary sources of this period."

   "comments": [
    "It contributed to my knowledge by giving me a broader understanding of all the different Christianities in the formative years of the Jesus movement. It was also very valuable in giving a timeline for what happened when, and in what order. A very important introductory level class that is accessible to anyone, even if you are not in religious studies.",
    "The class provided a great introduction to ancient Christianity, which is outside of my own discipline.",
    "This course was really helpful in terms of making me comfortable with using Christian writings in my research and gave me a much better sense of the religious environment of Late Antiquity in general. I actually wrote a paper for a different course this semester where I drew significantly on writings that I had read for the class. I am certainly not an expert on any of these writings after this class, but I think I could now begin to understand the important scholarly writings and debates about these documents."
