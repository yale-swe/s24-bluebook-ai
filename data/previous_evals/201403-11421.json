   "comments": [
    "The content in this course is more challenging than a typical graduate history seminar, with many of the texts fitting more with philosophy of science and science studies literature than traditional history texts. For the same reasons, it is also more rewarding. Students will likely gain a new perspective on familiar topics. Finally, the research paper option is a good one for graduate students because Professor Cowles encouraged students to write about whatever subject would be useful for them, not simply what was covered in the course.",
    "This course explores the history of the human sciences, drawing from both theory and history. I would recommend this to another student because the course is not only a useful reading seminar, but is also an opportunity to research a topic related to the human sciences, broadly defined, if the student wishes.",
    "This course is useful for any prospective historian seeking to learn how to embrace theory in a sensitive manner. It also served as a useful preparation for comprehensive exams, as the class discussions incorporated ways to sensitively analyze the books discussed."

    "This course helped deepen my knowledge of my discipline and gave me an opportunity to explore a potential dissertation topic.",
    "This course offered a great introduction to various topics relating to the human sciences, and provided a vast array of theoretical veins that I could later incorporate into my work."
