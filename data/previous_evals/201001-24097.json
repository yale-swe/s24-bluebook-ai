    "I'd say take it. It's a good junior seminar for an English major. Don't let the Gertrude Stein (if that's still on the syllabus) put you off the course as a whole, the rest of the material is amazing and moving. Also if you've taken Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald don't let that sway your decision, Dimock is MUCH better in a seminar.",
    "Yes, take it if you want an English seminar with interesting novels.",
    "A typical junior seminar \u0097\u00a0but in the best sense. You read a lot of books, and you go to class to discuss them. But the syllabus is well put together, and Prof. Dimock is great. Definitely worth taking.",
    "The readings are fantastic. Discussion tends to be student-driven and can meander, and I sometimes felt that we glossed over important parts of the text. Overall, though, a good class with a manageable workload.",
    "Yes if you like english classes, some reading, a bit of writing, nothing to much",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The books are fantastic, the workload is manageable and professor Dimock is really great at leading discussions and amazingly nice.",
    "This class is a presentation of American authors who write about experiences and topics that lie outside of the United States. The reading for the class was widespread but certainly quite enjoyable. The class lacked a strong unifying theme or direction, but this enabled students in the class to take a great deal of ownership and control over the material that is addressed and the questions that are asked. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in reading the syllabus and looking critically at related issues."
