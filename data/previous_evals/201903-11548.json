    "I learned about different parts of applying physics to biology like how PCR works.",
    "As my first introductory physics course, I definitely learned a lot of physics from taking this class. The nine modules of the course go over topics including kinematics, work\/energy, probability distributions, diffusion, and fluid mechanics that I feel I learned a lot about. Additionally, most, if not all, were connected to a biological\/chemical concept such as PCR and the movement of RNA polymerase on DNA, which I thought was very interesting being an MCDB major. This course was definitely challenging and demands a lot of time, but I really did learn so much about physics by the end of it. It showed me that despite being challenging, physics is actually interesting and can actually explain a lot about the mechanisms of biological processes.",

   "comments": [
    "This course is well organized. The study halls made the otherwise daunting problem sets almost like a social activity, the semi-weekly quizzes kept students on track with the material, and the tests were all perfectly fair. The textbook was also great, as it was straight to the point. The lectures were also entertaining at times with learning activities and the poll everywhere questions that kept my attention from straying for the most part. The test corrections were more valuable than I expected, as they led me to recognize problems in my own studying and learning techniques. My only suggestion for improvement would be for the teacher to not read the 'module overview' slides, since this is a somewhat useless and boring exercise.",
    "This course is set up for people to do well which is so refreshing. The entire staff wants you to do well and ask for help. It is also so easy to get help which is nice! The class goes pretty fast and is extremely math heavy which is kind of hard if you don't have a strong math background, but it is very easy to get help when you are struggling.",
    "Excellent supportive atmosphere, psets WAY too long",
    "The strength is that the class is very collaborative. Although the problem sets can be quite difficult, working with peers really helps me through the assignments, as well as builds a sense of community in the class. I also really appreciate TF and Peer Tutor availability throughout the course. That really came in handy for me to better understand physics concepts. I can't think of any weaknesses of the course.",
    "Most supportive STEM class at Yale - great peers, great TAs, and the most caring professor!",
    "It is a very interesting course with a lot of valuable physics for a biologist, yet it happens a little too fast. There is never enough time to fully synthesize information.",
    "The strengths of this course is Dr. Mochrie (Simon). He is so funny and understanding and creates a wonderful environment in the class. This is the only pre-med class where there is absolutely 0 competition. It makes it more collaborative and encouraging. The weakness of the course is probably that it moves a little too fast. I constantly found myself being confused and having to move on quickly.",
    "Wonderful course. Study hall was so helpful and you can ALWAYS find help from people.",
    "Strengths - Tons of opportunities to get help. Study hall and office hours (especially with Nazar) were a major help. Weaknesses - The lectures were very confusing and hard to follow.",
    "The strengths of this course is that there are so many resources to help students understand the material and succeed in the course. There are 3 study halls every week where peer tutors, TAs, and Professor Mochrie are available to help answer questions and assist students in completing the weekly PSET assignments. For every Monday quiz, Professor Mochrie released a practice quiz. For every midterm and for the final, Professor Mochrie released multiple practice exams. I think being able to have a large number of problems to practice with is very useful to understand the concept and how to apply it, especially for a course like physics, so I found these practice problems very helpful. Additionally, every peer tutor and TAs had their own office hours outside of study hall for students to attend. I think all of these resources were definitely useful, and I will be making use of them again next semester in PHYS 171. Although completing\/studying for the weekly PSETs and Monday quizzes were time-consuming, I think they were helpful in making me keep up with the material taught, which could have easily become very overwhelming if I only tried to study before the actual exams.",
    "The homeworks were usually hard, which forced you to go to study halls. I liked these because I got to know some new people, and by working with others (as well as the TA's) I often got exposed to a new way of looking at a problem that I otherwise never would have thought of. Also there were always people associated with the course at the study halls which was beyond helpful.",
    "It is a lot of material.",
    "strengths: good learning environment, lots of peer tutor help, feel rewarded for your work weaknesses: a loooot of work (probably not more than 180 though), weekly quizzes are kind of stressful, lectures are usually confusing",
    "I think its very interesting and helpful to apply the physics to real life examples, but I thought that the life science problems could often overcomplicate problems. Most of the problems tested the same principles, and you just had to dig through all the superfluous details to get to the math the problem was asking about. I thought the problem sets were extremely challenging, but they absolutely prepared me for the exams. The struggle was real, but by engaging and working through the struggles, I was much better prepared for the exams, and it felt very rewarding.",
    "The only strengths of this course are the generous grading system and the sense of camaraderie that students share from being overwhelmed by the chaos of this course. The content itself is also interesting: it was cool to see how real world biology examples could be modeled with physics (e.x. hemodialysis, HIV viral counts, protein folding). There are also a lot of study halls and TA\/peer tutor office hours (which you WILL need to attend to pass this course). The problem is that this course is poorly taught and confusing to follow. A lot of the course is based simplifying biological situations according to mathematical\/physical models, which is incredibly non-intuitive if you haven't done this kind of modeling before, which I had not.",
    "A strength is that there are a lot of opportunities to get a good grasp on the material through study hall, review sessions of specific concepts, and peer tutor, professor, and TF office hours. A weakness is that it was maybe too time consuming.",
    "Very work heavy - weekly quizzes and problem sets mean you probably are using two or three evenings a week to keep up by going to study halls. The problem set questions usually have some unique way to solve that requires TA input. Many of the time in lecture seemed to be wasted deriving ideas on the blackboard, which was difficult to see and interpret, when everything could have been explained in the PowerPoints.",
    "strengths: the way it is set up for learning weaknesses: spending too much time on derivations, not enough on actual applicable problems",
    "I thought this was a very well done course. It was difficult, but there was a lot of support, which was really nice.",
    "The professor was great and very engaging. Study halls were also a great resource to work together on psets.",
    "This course was interesting and the application-based aspect made the material seem much more relevant. Overall, there were so many opportunities to get help, and I especially liked the study-halls.",
    "The strength of this course is that the content is more application based than other physics courses and feels more relevant. A weakness is that the psets often feel tediously long.",
    "The course is structured to be supportive and as engaging as possible for an intro physics course. Highly recommend to a student who is at all interested in the health sciences. Sometimes the lectures are confusing\/disorganized, but the class is good overall.",
    "The only weakness is that in order to be able to apply physics to biology, the professor should have explained the physics behind it more thoroughly. It was hard to focus and understand when the professor would go back and forth on explaining the physics and applying it to the biology when the students haven't fully understand the physics yet. However, there is a strength of this class as well. Professor Mochrie is extremely dedicated to his students. There has never been a STEM professor at Yale who would attend ALL three study halls a week to help students understand the PSET on top with hosting office hours. I definitely regret not going to him for help more, but for future students taking this class, the class itself is challenging, but the professor really wants you to succeed and you will as long as you are willing to put the work in to.",
    "The strengths of the course are the great teaching staff behind it -- Simon cares about each student's success, will get to know everyone's name, and will even stay late at study halls with you. The TAs and peer tutors are also very helpful, especially during individual office hours. Another strength was the emphasis on collaboration; it was refreshing to have a STEM\/pre-med requirement class where you didn't feel like you were competing with your peers. A weakness of the course is the sheer amount of hours that must be put into completing problem sets every week; of course, you get out what you put in, but at times the problem sets felt very long and were not always reflective of exam material (exams were usually much harder). Another weakness is that there is little to no overlap with the lab component, PHYS 165L.",
    "The examples from the modules are really interesting and make the course fun. It might be useful to include some more \"traditional\" physics concepts--I know after a couple units, the two intro physics classes pretty much diverge. It makes the physics lab course a little difficult. Also, I didn't particularly like the push for a collaborative environment--I feel like it should have been more of an optional choice by the student. Personally, I'm more of an individual worker and would rather do everything on the homework that I could do on my own and then ask for help from a TA.",
    "More in-depth review sessions for the finals.",
    "The lectures should correspond more to the psets and tests. The only way to do well was to go to study halls and\/or office hours.",
    "strengths: great support system, psets help prepare you for exams, professor and TA's\/ULA's make themselves available, module examples help weaknesses: module is at times not detailed enough, and answer keys in general where it makes lots of jumps that you somehow have to follow. some of the pset problems are very long and complicated for no reason and i don't think i gain anything from these kinds of problems. the final exam is too long and hard.",
    "This course is extremely well-structured. The most engaging\/rewarding premed class. A lot of work but a lovely class taught by an excellent professor.",
    "Strengths: The format of the course is great - 2 midterms (with corrections) + final + weekly quizzes+ PSETs + some participation is very reasonable and a good spread of work. It's also very easy to get help. The study halls are fantastic, I went to almost all of them and it's a great way to work through the PSETs with other people in the class and TF\/ULA help; plus there are tons of office hours. The quizzes are sometimes group quizzes. If you, like me, don't have the strongest math background, this course is very doable. And there's no textbook to buy! It's also very apparent that Simon cares about us and wants us to do well. Weaknesses: Even though Simon is nice and helpful during study hall, he's not a good lecturer. It was super easy to get lost in lecture\/not know what the point of the derivation he's doing is\/not know the definition of a term he's been working with for half an hour\/not be able to visualize what's happening. The modules (which act as our textbook and are provided) are usually more clear but sometimes the worked out problems aren't as worked out as I'd like them to be and sometimes it was unclear what we actually had to know how to do (a module could have 3 pages of a derivation that we don't actually need to replicate). And the PSETs. Oh boy. I understand making PSETs challenging so we can master the material. I get that. But PSETs can be unnecessarily difficult, and some of ours certainly were (one that really sticks out is the PSET we had directly after the first midterm). I almost always got help from TAs\/ULAs when I worked on the PSETs and that's fine, but sometimes I'd get so stuck the TA\/ULA would have to just explain the next step and say something along the lines of 'I have no idea how Simon expects you to know what to do here.' This happened for usually a problem or two in each PSET. The end result of all this is that, as someone put it in study hall once, we're just learning how to solve problems how Simon would like us to but not always understanding what's really happening (this was ESPECIALLY true when we got to eigenvalues\/vectors\/modes.) Basically this class is an elaborate game of Simon says.",
    "Final exam was WAY TOO HARD. Homework were like a level 3-4 and then midterms were like a level 5 but then the final exam was a level 12?!? it was so hard and discouraging because I was truly doing so well in this course after seeing a lot of personal growth in this difficult stem subjects and felt it was unfair that I could not show this in the final exam.",
    "The course was very well organized and the professor and students tutors were encouraging. The course could be improved by having more peer tutors and TAs available at study hall.",
    "Strengths: Study halls are very helpful, as were the problem sets. I also liked the activities that we did in lecture sometimes and all of the questions. Weaknesses: Sometimes lecture moved a little too fast, I also think the final was significantly harder than the midterms.",
    "I loved that Simon was so clear with the way he taught us to solve problems. He had very clearly outlined steps that made the process easier to remember and very understandable.",
    "The strengths are the ways the class relates physics to the life sciences; this enables biology students to grasp how the mechanisms they learned in other classes come to be via physics. The main weakness of the class is how it essentially becomes a statistics and probability class at chapter four. It almost feels like we went from learning typical physics, which was enjoyable, to learning tangentially related mathematics every week. I understand the relation of probability to the physical life sciences we learned, but the inclusion of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, superposition, Taylor series expansions, etc. all were well beyond the course descriptions implication that Calculus 1 was the only requisite math. I thankfully had taken Math 225 and probability prior to this course, so these were not new concepts to me, but I felt very bad for my peers who were encountering these maths for the first time in such a setting. I have no doubt this is the first time many encountered eigenvector manipulation, and the way it was taught was essentially as memorization for how to use eigenvectors, not what an eigenvector was or why we use it.",
    "In lecture a lot of time was spent on deriving equations and less time going through practice problems or the practical application in terms of how the equations being taught could be used to solve problems, so reducing time spent on derivations would be nice. A strength of the course is definitely study halls, where most of the learning is actually done, and the poll everywhere questions in class.",
    "The topics in this course seem very random and doesn't seem like physics. The teacher's style of teaching can be very confusing and it is easy to get confused during class without the modules in hand.",
    "Professor Mochrie really cares about our learning so I found that to be one of the biggest strengths of the class.",
    "It could be improved with a better textbook",
    "The study halls were crucial in my understanding of the material. Doing the problem sets with other students and getting help from the TA's helped me learn more than going to the actual lecture. Lectures were very long and quite confusing, on the other hand. The one thing that I found helpful from lecture was going through calculation problems step by step. Being able to do corrections on the quizzes and midterms was amazing and helped me understand the material better.",
    "Strengths: Simon puts a lot of time into the class and cares about the students. The study halls are great. Weaknesses: The assessments were sometimes much more complicated than what we had learned in class.",
    "I think this course is actually structured pretty well, and Professor Mochrie clearly cares about making sure his students understand the material. I think the onslaught of problem sets is good for making us learn the material, but there were a few too many pset questions that were simply too hard for any student to answer without consulting a peer tutor or TF, usually because there was a very complicated algebraic manipulation or substitution involved. Overall, though, I think this was a solid class in terms of its structure, difficulty, and relevancy to biology.",
    "The textbook offers limited explanation of the topics and few practice problems. It would help if there were more resources for this course.",
    "This course is very difficult. The material is difficult and at times the professor does not explain the material in a way that makes sense. However, the structure of this course is incredible. The focus of this course is truly on understanding the material and not the grade the received. The professor structures this course that truly aides students in learning and creates a supportive environment even under the difficulty of the material.",
    "Strengths: A lot of available help Weakness: Lecture was hard to follow",
    "The study halls are great but the problem sets and exams are very difficult. The partial credit assigned is very helpful and very fair, as I feel like I learned a lot despite not being able to solve every problem. Although, the test corrections are very elaborate. It felt very unnecessary to have to explain for an entire paragraph why I forgot to add a negative sign.",
    "The course is structured in a way to help students succeed, the only thing is that the review sessions could be more structured.",
    "Great support, thank you!"

    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in physics, or even just statistics, as several modules covered the application of statistics to physics and biological models.",
    "PHYS 170 is great for people looking into med school or simply like biology more than the normal physics concepts. It is cool to learn about how certain biological systems actually work and why medicines work as they do.",
    "Sure, it was a way to learn mandatory physics",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who's interested in the biological side of physics, as well as any students who need to fulfill a physics requirement (for pre-med or otherwise) but doesn't want to take a straight physics course.",
    "YES! Mainly for the community that you'll find and Simon!",
    "Yes, I would take it over PHYS 180 any day.",
    "no i wouldnt.",
    "Yes! Simon is the BEST professor and he really cares about your success.",
    "If you're taking this, it's because you have to. For me, this class was literally a deciding factor in whether I would finish a major. It was well worth it and I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking to take an introductory physics course. The amount of resources to help students understand the material and succeed were wonderful. This course was definitely challenging and demands a lot of time, but I really did learn so much about physics by the end of it. Being an MCDB major, I am especially glad I took this course over PHYS 180. It showed me that despite being challenging, physics is actually interesting and can actually explain a lot about the mechanisms of biological processes. I enjoyed the way Professor Mochrie set up the Although completing\/studying for the weekly PSETs and Monday quizzes were time-consuming, I think they were helpful in making me keep up with the material taught, which could have easily become very overwhelming if I only tried to study before the actual exams. Additionally, he made it so that if students did much better on the final exam than the 2 midterms, the final would be worth more than the 2 midterms, which I thought was a good idea. Lectures could sometimes be tiring especially since there were 75 minutes long, but the in-class clicker questions were good to not only check understanding but to take some time away from staring at a chalkboard to discuss with peers instead.",
    "Yes. I wouldn't consider myself a physics person (I'm more a chemistry type) so I thought that any physics class would be a pain and was just something I had to get through. I was pleasantly surprised at how interesting the material in this course was. Don't get me wrong, the course was extremely difficult, but the struggle\/grind felt worth it because, if you're a premed or someone who is interested in bio, the homeworks\/lectures served to explain how stuff that you might already be familiar with is powered by physics.",
    "Yes, it is mandatory for pre-med kids.",
    "yes (if you have to take some form of physics). Psets were manageable, no prior knowledge required, it is a lot of work so expect this class to be a priority but you don't feel like your hard work goes to waste",
    "I warily recommend this course. The life science twist to this physics class can be interesting, but it might have been too much of a stretch. The real-life examples felt like oversimplifications of natural phenomena that were designed to add some life science to pretty standard physics problems. It really didn't feel like a physics class and more like a statistics class. I learned a lot in the class, and it was very rewarding to work hard on problem sets and feel more prepared because of it. However, I often questioned if I should have done PHYS 180 as a much more conventional physics class.",
    "Honestly, probably not. I took 170 over 180 because I had never taken multi-variable before and 180 lists it as a pre req, but I found out from a friend who took 180 that you don't really need to have taken multi-variable. I did feel more connected with my classmates than in other large lecture classes just because none of us knew what was going on and we would have to seek help from the TAs and peer mentors and also help each other out frequently. Also, the grading system of this class is pretty generous; there are weekly quizzes of which the three lowest can be dropped and you can earn back 40% of points you lose on midterms. If you are really into biophysics and have a strong math\/statistics background, you might get more out of this course. But for me, it was often a lot of memorizing specific methods to solve a certain kind of problem. I spent a lot of time on this class but I'm not sure of how much I actually learned about physics.",
    "Sure if you are into math. It is math heavy, which I like but others may not.",
    "yes! Simon rocks and really really cares about his students.",
    "Yes. I am very glad I took this as opposed to a different physics course.",
    "Yes I would if someone is interested in learning introductory physics that has biological applications.",
    "Yes--this is a more engaging way to fulfill a physics requirement (for premed).",
    "Yes, to a student who needs to take physics and is interested in the life sciences. If you're at all interested in these fields, take this class over 180.",
    "This class is required for MCDB and I will definitely take this over PHYS 180 if you are like me, bad at math.",
    "This course is most likely taken as a pre-med requirement or something like that. I would recommend PHYS 170 over 180 to anyone who likes biology and physical applications to biological phenomena (e.g. understanding PCR, molecular motors, etc.). If you want to learn the most fundamental concepts of physics, take 180.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you are choosing between PHYS 170 and PHYS 180. If you have to take a foundations physics course and you are interested in the life sciences, TAKE THIS COURSE. Although some of the content doesn't seem traditionally physics-related, it's so much better to be in a class where you find the material interesting.",

    "if you are choosing between physics 180 and 170, do 170 for sure. it is much easier than 180 and easier to get a better grade in. the fact that its not on a curve means that theres a very strong collaborative environment in the class. Psets take a couple of hours every week but its not too bad if you work with other people. Overall, i came in expecting the absolute worst from this class but it ended up not being too bad. The final exam was annoying though but overall the class isn't that bad.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student looking for an intro physics course. Virtually everyone in the class is taking it because its a requirement for their major or premed. I would recommend this over 180, especially if you dont want to do intense math. It made me appreciate many scientific things with a new perspective. At times the class is frustrating because of the long psets, but thats expected.",
    "If you have to take physics for MCDB\/EEB\/etc., take PHYS 170 if you don't have as strong of a math background. It's a doable, if frustrating class. I don't regret taking it over 180.",
    "I would recommend it only to students who have to take it. While the material is so interesting and impressive, the workload is almost that of two courses.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a non-toxic learning environment (hard to find in pre med courses). The course is not curved, so you're not competing against your classmates, but keep in mind even if you aren't competing with your classmates within the class itself, you are still competing with your classmates overall if you're premed, so it's less stress, but just enough to keep you going. Anything 92+ gives you an A. There are many resources to help you succeed. The professor actually wants to get to know you. The material is actually interesting, although hard to understand because the way that it is presented is probably different than how you have seen it before, and this might cause some confusion. In other words, the conventions, variables, symbols, and ways to think about certain concepts might be different from how you've seen it in high school. Also there is a giant unit on probability?!? I mean, I won't complain considering the course is pretty laid back already.",
    "Yes, probably better than 180 if you are premed",
    "I loved this course. Everything about the course was centered around ensuring student success. Simon was very approachable and kind, Study Halls were incredibly helpful, and all of the TAs were super helpful. I have never felt as supported in my learning as I did in thos course.",
    "Yes. While the course jumps from physics into varying maths such as probability and linear algebra, the mathematical know-how actually required is surface level at best. This course does imbue in its students an appreciation of how physics folds into the life sciences, and ultimately will better prepare a student for the MCAT than 180\/181 in my honest opinion.",
    "It's a great class, but shouldn't be taken with other classes that too have heavy workloads. I think Professor Mochrie assumes his class is the only class that you're taking.",
    "Definitely a good alternative to 180, but the resources offered in this class are definitely worse than the resources offered in 180.",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "take it over 180!! its easier and more interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this course over PHYS 180 for pre-med students. You don't need as much of a math background to succeed.",
    "Yes. Even though this class is super hard, it is honestly one of my favorite courses I have taken.",
    "I would only recommend this course to those that need to take it. I loved the professor and would take this course over 180 again.",
    "Most people taking it are doing so to fulfill a requirement",
    "Yes, very supportive environment."
