   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course, the teacher is funny and relaxed but teaches you a lot and you will come out of the course having learned something new.",
    "This is a good class to take. Just be aware of your level in French. The texts are old, poetic, and not in the kind of French you learn everyday. That's just one thing to be aware of.",
    "An excellent course that will give you a very solid foundation in the subject area. Medieval lit may seem boring (and some of it is, as some of everything is), but the works we read\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly in their entirety\u00e2\u0080\u0094were real works of art, tragic or comic, graceful or hilarious. The field is very open to both historical readings and readings based more in critical theory. Professor Cayer is a super teacher who is breathlessly excited about the material and much more human than many professors his age.",
    "FREN 213 is a great introduction into French medieval literature and by far my favorite course of my semester. From poems to epics to short stories, the readings for the course provided a comprehensive view of the literature of the time, supplemented by the rich commentary provided by Professor Cayer. The workload was manageable for most classes (though plan ahead during the unit on La Mort du Roi Arthur)! Professor Cayer is extremely helpful with his comments on written assignments, and I felt I was able to really work on my written expression in this class as well. Highly recommended to all students with a sufficient background in French.",
    "The readings for the course are interesting and Prof. Cayer's love of the subject is evident. Try it out!",
    "This was a really enjoyable course! The readings were fun and well-chosen and the material we covered was rich and diverse. The workload is not insubstantial -- I wouldn't take this as a fifth course, since there are twice-weekly readings (many of which are quite long) and short writing assignments due on a more or less weekly basis, as well as an in-class midterm, a long final paper, and a short creative assignment at mid-semester (which was, incidentally, really fun) -- but it's a great Hu class with a really good professor, in which your language skills will improve tremendously and during which you'll learn a lot about a fascinating area of literature. I recommend it really highly."
