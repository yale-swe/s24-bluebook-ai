    "I would recommend Old French to any student with an interest in the middle ages, or in Arthurian legend. Old French is a required class for all students in the French Department.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wished to learn to read Old French.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that it is a course designed to acclimate one to a medieval language and give them the skills to broaden their knowledge of it and continue to expand this knowledge in the future. I would recommend it, as I think that such a skill is not only useful but necessary for anyone wanting to study the Middle Ages in depth. The course will most certainly give them what they need going forward."

    "This was an important course for me in that it provided me with exposure to literature of the high middle ages and gave me the skills to continue reading old French.",
    "It probably didn't contribute to my dissertation, but the ability to read Old French might in some way come in useful in the profession - e.g. for teaching.",
    "This course has deepened my knowledge of medieval literature and the skills necessary to conduct research in Old French. This course will contribute to my own research, and allow me to access a broader range of materials than I would have been able to encounter before entering the class.",
    "Yes, my Old French definitely improved a lot during this course."
