   "comments": [
    "Very project-dependent, which makes it somewhat risky to take depending on what you're hoping to get out of it. Many of the guest lectures were fairly repetitive and didn't seem a great use of time. The lectures early-on from Maureen could have been more engaging and deeper, felt somewhat rudimentary and not new information (basics of powerpoint). It's neat that it's set up as a client class, which brings a unique perspective to the course.",
    "I think more hands on team assessments would be useful. i.e. based on your feedback this is what I think this team would need and should do.",
    "Strengths: Very defined outline and structure of the course throughout the semester and the instructor also gave sufficient time for students to interact with clients besides classes. The instructor gave helpful feedback throughout the semester and invited sustainability-focused consultants to share their experience during class. Weakness: The course experience highly varies due to clients. It usually took up to three to four weeks on average to start working on projects efficiently. Mid-term presentations happened right before spring break, leaving two to three weeks for students to actually work on the project.",
    "More feedback and supervision on projects",
    "Weaknesses: Only white speakers came to class. Very biased perspectives.",
    "This class can tailor to a lot of different kinds of students and can lead to a new experience each time. The lectures were not necessarily tied to our projects, but they offered interesting insights into the life of a consultant that we could maybe draw parallels to in our class projects. It was also useful how there were feedback opportunities built into the course. Everything was direct.",
    "It's great! Maureen does an awesome job at organizing the clients.",
    ".",
    "The in-class time was mostly guest speakers who work within the business and environment space. I would have liked to have a few classes that were workshop-based that helped us build consulting\/team work\/presentation skills. I took the sustainable entrepreneurship consultancy class this semester, and that class did a group job of curating the in-class time to help us improve our performance for the client projects. I would recommend talking to Peter Boyd who was the faculty advisor for that class, to ask him about running workshops during class time.",
    "Real life projects are the best thing about the course. Success of project can vary between clients.",
    "Strength: opportunity to engage directly with corporate clients. Weakness: in-class presentations were fairly weak and flat."
