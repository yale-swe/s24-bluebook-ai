   "comments": [
    "As a French major, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone (including non-majors) with even the slightest interest in seventeenth century French literature. Professor Semk makes the course very engaging and interesting and really allows to you leave having a confident grasp of the century's rich literature as well as a great working knowledge of \"grand si\u00e8cle\" France. The reading is not too much and all the films you watch are great !",
    "This course is not only about cinema portraying seventeenth century France, but about music, pedagogy, and social life in the twentieth century world. It is the best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "This is basically a literature and film course on seventeenth century France. We explored different topics each week by analyzing a literary work one day and a related film the next. It was a lot more literary analysis-based than I anticipated, so think about that before taking this. Work consisted of 3 short (3-4 page) papers on one of the works you studied in that unit, plus a final paper on any topic related to the course (about 10 pages). Professor Semk is great, he is really excited about what he teaches and really care about his students. If this is an era in France that interests you, and you want to explore it using literature and film as a means of doing so, then this would be a good class for you."
