   "comments": [
    "Greatly improve writing and reading abilities, minimally improve speaking abilities.",
    "I understand so much more about French culture after taking this course. It was amazing to realize I could read texts, watch movies, and discuss both entirely in French. This course definitely reinforced these abilities with great grammar exercises that enriched our class discussions.",
    "I hugely developed my proficiency in spoken French, my reading skills significantly improved, as did my ability to write in French, and my knowledge and appreciation of French literature deepened. I learned so, so much from this course. After every single class, I felt that I had learned French deeply and fully, in a way that would allow it to stay with me for the rest of my life.",
    "This is a rigorous capstone to the introductory French sequence at Yale. I exponentially improved my speaking and writing abilities.",
    "I dramatically improved my reading comprehension skills through the various assigned texts and became much more diligent about grammar rules in my writing.",
    "I improved my French reading comprehension, writing, and speaking skills, as well as gained much more knowledge about French literature.",
    "French grammar, speech, reading and writing.",
    "The biggest skill I gained in this class was learning to pay attention to detail and perfect my french grammar. It also enabled me to practice my speaking skills, as well as writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: improve your French, oftentimes interesting material. Grading seems fair. Weaknesses: a big jump from L4. Much, much more difficult. Even though the class only meets 3 days a week, expect just as much work, graded much more harshly. Sometimes difficult being assessed, considering half of the class is fluent\/learned French from a young age.",
    "I think that the workload was appropriate for the material that we had to learn. The practice helped us to make sure that we understood the grammar exercises. I also really liked the discussion aspect. There was definitely a focus on that aspect of this class.",
    "This has been, by far, the best French class I have ever taken (I've been taking French since 4th grade). Madame Schneider is absolutely its greatest strength. She is brilliant, dedicated, hilarious, and compassionate. I could not imagine a better French professor. The conversational format of the course is fantastic. All the students sit in a U-formation of desks. This allows Madame Schneider to move about the center, giving the class a very dynamic, involved atmosphere; additionally, students are able to all see each other, respond to Madame Schneider and to each other, and build off each other comments. This encouraged active participation and made it very possible for every student. I also loved French culture we studied in class: the films, the plays, the books, and the stories. Every single one of them was gripping and memorable. I cannot think of a single criticism of this course.",
    "At times, the sheer amount of homework assigned feels tedious, and the participation grade is surprisingly hard to score well on. That being said, all of the work pays off in improvement of French.",
    "I think the course balances reading, films, conversation, vocabulary, and grammar very well. so you are exposed to all learning forms without getting too tired of any one.",
    "Overall, I think the course was a good fit for its aims. The workload was on the heavy side, which was at times hard to manage with four other courses. Content-wise, the course was apt and the readings were enjoyable. It could be improved by clarifying exactly what was expected from written assignments.",
    "Weaknesses: sometimes a lot of major assignments are all due in the same week Strengths: most things. The readings are super interesting and class discussions are always engaging. I feel like my French speaking abilities have improved a lot since most of class time is spent discussing readings and participation is strongly encouraged.",
    "This class is known for having a huge workload. It would be very helpful if we could have a certain amount of late days per semester to turn in assignments without losing credit."

   "comments": [
    "If you strongly want to better your French skills, then yes. But your speaking probably won't improve that much, although your writing really will. It's a lot of work and I often wondered whether or not I should have taken the class. Don't expect it to be an easy or logical follow-up to L4, it's much more of a jump than L4 was to L3.",
    "Definitely! This will help them to be able to both speak and understand French much more than they did walking in!",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. If you want to further develop your skills in French, there is simply no better place to do it than with Madame Schneider in French 150. You will be able to throw yourself into enthralling French literature, you will make huge strides in your ability to write French, and your speaking will dramatically improve. I promise you will be absolutely thrilled that you decided to take this course.",
    "If you're willing to put in the work, this course will improve your French, so I would recommend it.",
    "It is a great course for anyone looking to take their reading\/writing\/speaking of french to the next level. It is a lot of work but the results are worth it!",
    "Yes, it greatly improved my knowledge of French grammar and exposed me to a lot of great literature.",
    "Yes!! You will learn a lot and all of the work feels very worthwhile",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, only after warning them greatly about the huge workload."
