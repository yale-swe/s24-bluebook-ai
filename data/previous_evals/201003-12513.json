    "MICHAEL VEAL IS MY LIFE. luuuvvvvv. I will buy him stingrays forever and no cats. No but seriously, chillest professor. Really knows his stuff, fair grader, doesn't hesitate to provide first hand experience (i.e. bringing in an expert on Indian classical music and having him teach the class how to sing the ragas). If you get into this seminar, take it.",
    "Definitely take this course. I learned so much about other musical cultures, and had fun while doing it. I find that the information I learned in this course has given me a new perspective when listening to any type of music - I can apply principles I learned in this class to all cultures. Professor Veal is great and definitely makes the class worthwhile. The workload is manageable - you can get away with not doing the reading but it's definitely worth it to read them. They're interesting and not too long. Take this class!",
    "Yes. Freshmen, take this class. Part of the college education is to learn how to think in a different way from the way you have thought before. This class is it. This class takes a whole new approach toward music--by tying in social, political and historical perspective. And those macromusical elements tie nicely with the sonic (micromusical) elements. After taking this class, you'll not think of music the same way as you did before. At the same time, you'll not only learn how societal factors play into music but how music plays an important role in the society.Also, you listen to bunch of music in class(great way to expand your musical taste), and the discussion is pretty much analyzing each music. Half of the class was about discussion and the other half was his lectures, during which you have to madly jot down notes(he talks fast).Third, you come out of this class learning some fancy words. Some of Professor Veal's and our favorite words were: syncretism, confluence, juxtaposition, historically and ancestrally derived concrete terms, micromusical analysis, macromusical analysis, hybridity, continuum, hocketing, ensemble stratification, reelaboration, deconstruction, recreating national identity, tan singing. Really, these words pretty much well-describes this class.Lastly, Professor Veal is incredibly amazing. Every student loves him, and he has a great sense of humor. This class was one of those that I looked forward to go to, and you can bond with your classmates really easily. One of those intimate-setting classes.p.s. It's about 80 pages of reading for the most of the weeks. And five(six) essays throughout the semester, last one being the final paper where you get to pick whichever music culture you want to investigate.",
    "This class is really interesting and I learned soo much. There were four different units--Indian, Indonesian, West African and Cuban\/Jamaican music. There was a bunch of reading to do, and it was definitely a good thing to do it because Veal asks us questions during class. You really go into the history of the music, the culture around it and the musical elements themselves. Very interesting to learn about. The class can be a bit boring at times, with some lecture like classes, but it's still worth it. Michael Veal is great and fun and ridiculously knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend Music 008 to another student. I learned so much in such a short period of time, and I have a healthy appreciation for many musical forms that I would have otherwise known nothing about. Professor Veal brings the material to life, and I was fortunate enough to have a great group of classmates who I\u0092ve become really good friends with. Many of my friends outside of class are in other freshman seminars, and I have rarely heard feedback about other seminars as good as what we say about Music 008 and Professor Veal!",
    "Great! Michael Veal is awesome. I really liked it because it was a good mix of history and music. A lot of people in the class are musicians, so that's something to know going in, but they don't have much of an edge on non-musicians because the music we cover is completely non-western. A really interesting class and a good schedule balancer.",
    "Definitely take this chance if you get the chance. It is a great way to get a writing credit without killing yourself with work. You don't need to know much about music to take the class.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you are looking to investigate what \"music\" means to different cultures around the world, to be able to identify the cultural region that a musical selection comes from just by listening to it, or to understand how social history helps to shape a society's music. Professor Veal is engaging and easy to understand, and there are many exciting first-hand learning opportunities (e.g. learning to sing classical Carnatic Indian music in class). If you are looking for a course that will help improve your writingcapabilities, this class would not be as beneficial as an English writing seminar."
