   "comments": [
    "My writing has improved significantly over the course of English 120, and I have become a lot more confident in my ability to express my ideas on paper. I came out able to see flaws in my writing that I would never be able to recognize before. English 120 really bridged the gap between writing for class and writing for popular consumption; I am actually proud to show my friends the essays I wrote in this course. You will probably improve your writing more in this class than you will in any other writing class at Yale. But be prepared for a lot of hard work. If you want an A-range grade, you will really have to earn it.",
    "Take it. If you schedule your time well, you can easily take out all of the essays. If you're afraid of the professor criticizing you, don't be - he is extremely supportive and helpful.",
    "I would summarize this class as an amazing chance to read some great modern writing, and a good way to improve your own writing. It is one of those classes you really have to take before you graduate. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Take ENGL 120! There's no reason you shouldn't. You write personal essays where you are pushed to be creative!",
    "Definitely take it! One of my favorite classes, and I'd definitely recommend taking it with Prof. Macdonald as well. He was always extremely nice and caring, and he was great at guiding discussions and writing workshops. I definitely feel like my writing has improved because of this course. Don't leave Yale before taking this class!",
    "Well-known class from the Yale English Department that definitely lives up to its reputation.",
    "Probably the best class I've taken at Yale. The readings are mostly quite engaging and provide useful models for students' own writing. Students have two to three weeks per essay, allowing ample time to practice both writing and serious revision. Professor Macdonald was an extremely good teacher, balancing lecturing and student discussion and always open to meeting with students. This class drastically improved the quality of my writing and especially my confidence in writing and editing papers. Definitely take this class!",
    "English 120 is amazing - and that is coming from someone who has never really enjoyed writing much before. The essays are all interesting, and you have a fair amount of time (at least two weeks) to write them all. Professor Macdonald is great, and always works with you to improve your essay after the first draft. Readings are fun, workshops are helpful, and class discussion is always open and pleasant. Definitely take this course - it was my favorite this semester, and I'm a science student.",
    "Read essays, and learn how to write them. Focus on different tools you can employ in your writing. Focus on style. It's great, take it",
    "You should definitely try to take English 120 at some point. And Professor Macdonald is cool\/funny\/a good teacher.",
    "The thing about Eng 120 is that your experience depends heavily on the professor and somewhat on the class. It also depends on what you want to get out of it. I can easily see someone just writing the essays without much effort and without examining the sample essays. However, as we performed \"surgeries\" on each text, we discovered a new layer of technique that we were previously unaware of. Building on these pieces of knowledge could really improve your writing.",
    "I would recommend the course for someone who likes to write. The pieces cover a variety of topics and styles, but it can be overwhelming if you do not enjoy writing.",
    "English 120 requires very little reading but a lot of writing. I would recommend the class to students who want to write essays or who need to take English for premedical requirements.",
    "This is a must-take course for anyone who is prospective English major, anyone with journalistic aspirations, or just anyone who wants to improve his\/her writing. The course really does a great job in covering all important thematic, structural, and stylistic elements of writing, with a special concentration in nonfiction, journalistic wiring.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 for a fellow student. The class is taught well and you get to write a lot of different essays that, as far as essays go, are pretty fun to write. The set up of the class is good - You write an essay approximately every 2\/3 weeks (one draft and final). You will probably write this essay the night before it is due - so let's just say plan on staying up late one night a week. It's actually not that bad though and the class itself is very enjoyable and I got a lot out of the discussions."
