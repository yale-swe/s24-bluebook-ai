    "FREN 270 is a great course that not only introduces you to important authors and poets of the 19th and 20th centuries, but also teaches you a unique approach to reading difficult poetry - one that goes beyond content and form to encourage an exploration of the text that is understanding, flexible, and inclusive of what can be deemed significant. The workload is very manageable and Prof. Connolly is fantastic. Take the French section if you can!",
    "This class is a general survey of \"mad poets\" (as in \"insane\") from the 19th and 20th centuries. Most are French and a few are German. The chosen poems are incredibly rich and worth the time you spend reading them. Professor Connolly is also in INCREDIBLE lecturer. Take this class, if for no other reason, to hear him talk. This is also a great choice of a writing credit. The assignments are a very manageable: 2, 3-4 pg papers (with revisions) and a final 9-12 pg paper. If pressed for time, you can also get away with doing very little of the readings.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone who might be interested in poetry or French literature. It is a great introduction to all the major French poets during the 19th\/20th centuries. Their names will come up time and time again, and their works are all tied together in interesting thematic ways.",
    "Take the class if the writers and the material interests you.",
    "Take the course for the reading list, which is probably one of the best at Yale. These are poems and poets that don't bear a lot of fruit the first time around but instead reward repeated readings--it is good to read these while you're still an undergraduate. Readings aren't too heavy, and Professor Connolly is a charming professor. Lectures tend to be heavily focused on biographical information, but this was his first time teaching the course, so I imagine the lectures may be a bit different next time around. I would not recommend this course to someone with zero French background. The English translations were seriously lacking some weeks, and having some French (not a high level, just some familiarity) makes this class much richer.",
    "Awesome. Recommended for anyone interested in poetry, even as an intro. Manageable and enjoyable reading load. Opportunities for paper revision.",
    "Absolutely! One of my favorite classes this semester. Connolly is an amazing professor and is always well prepared for lectures and sections.",
    "Definitely take this course! Professor Connolly is a great lecturer and a wonderful guide for this material."
