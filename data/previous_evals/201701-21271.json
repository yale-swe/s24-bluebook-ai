    "I definitely improved my Chinese language abilities by a lot. I now feel somewhat comfortable reading and listening, and I feel confident in my ability to speak basic sentences.",
    "This class was a pretty straightforward continuation of CHNS 110. As such, it was extremely well taught, rigorous, and rewarding. As for what skills I developed--my Chinese, of course!",
    "Better proficiency in Mandarin.",
    "I learned a great deal of Chinese in the year I took it, much more than I expected I would. I feel competent and am ready to learn more.",
    "I learned an incredible amount of Putonghua for a single year. I think it gave me the right skills so I can go to China for one year to continue my studies in Chinese.",
    "I've learned more vocabulary and grammar in this course than I would have thought I could in a semester. Chinese is a beautiful language, and though it is early days, you begin to get the sense that you can work your way around a simple conversation by the end if you apply yourself to the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course is fantastic. I would recommend that the L19 and L20 lessons take up the usual 4 day timeframe each -- both lessons felt rushed and I had no idea what to expect on the daily quizzes. One weakness of the course is the instructors' narrow reading of translation exercises. Especially in a lower level language class, I think there is a lot of value in being able to communicate what you need with a limited vocabulary. Another weakness is the course's lack of instructions -- I often felt tests were unfairly graded due to lack of instruction. If a question asks for the reasons that something did or did not happen, and there are 5 reasons, the test should specify exactly how many reasons satisfy the question.",
    "Strengths: The teachers all are very engaged and invested The class is rigorous, but flexible if personal problems arise The level of Chinese attained at the end is really amazingly high! Weaknesses: By the end, the homework assignments were a little repeatative I felt the course moved too slowly at times I wish we had learned some traditional characters",
    "More presentations on topics of choice rather than lesson presentations.",
    "I think the only improvement the course can have is more emphasis on characters on tests (more than one character per test maybe).",
    "This course is very good at getting you to learn pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar in the abstract, and is good at applying them in specific situations, but not in general. If I had to recommend one change, I would ask for there to be more space for creativity in the course. In my mind, the only way to be able to talk is to adapt the grammar and vocabulary to new circumstances, and I feel that there isn't much of an opportunity to go beyond the rote sets we learned, or learn specific vocabulary that is meaningful to us. While I was able to get some of that on my own, I wish I had an outlet for it in class."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn a foreign language properly, you have to put in work every single day. Chinese at Yale is a daily, 1-1.5 hour homework commitment. If you are prepared to invest the time, you will be shocked by how well you can understand, speak, and write Chinese by the end. If you are not willing to put the daily effort in, you will struggle.",
    "This is the best way to learn Chinese to be honest. It's a lot of work but it will pay off.",
    "Yes! Definitely learned chinese",
    "Yes, the class is great. If you put in the work (which the course forces you to do) you'll learn a ton.",
    "I would totally recommend this course. It is totally rewarding, and it really pays back all the effort.",
    "Anyone wanting to learn Chinese at any point in their life should take it here and take it now. The program is outstanding, and your ability to hear tones and other pronunciation will only get worse as you get older. If you feel uncertain after chinese 110, it gets easier, and more fun as you go along, and really beings to become useful. Additionally, take advantage of the opportunity to go to China with light fellowship. I didn't take it, but plan to, and everyone who I know who has gone has benefited immensely."
