   "comments": [
    "If you took L1\/L2 of Chinese at Yale, do not take this class with the expectation that it will be the same. It is definitely more work, and less supervision. There is a fixed daily routine (minus movie-screenings, trips to Chinese restaurants, Chinese tables and all the novel fun stuff that you do in L1). This class is no fun, so do not take it for fun, it is not an easy A either. The textbook passages and recordings are entertaining. But other than that, take this class if you absolutely must.",
    "If you come back from a summer in China like many of us do, you expand your vocabulary, but there are very few opportunities to speak. It's a must if you want to continue studying Chinese, but not nearly as fulfilling as a summer in China.",
    "Chinese 150 is the first L5 Chinese course. It's significantly more work than L3\/L4, but you'll be able to feel your language skills improving at a much more dramatic pace. I now have the confidence to speak Chinese that I didn't have when taking L4.Also a lot of the people in my class were Light Fellows over the summer, and their speaking skills really contributed to the Chinese-speaking atmosphere in the classes. Both professors are great and their teaching was really effective in helping me remember all the new words and sentence structures.",
    "Chinese 150 is the only choice for the returning Light fellows who want to continue Chinese. I was hugely disappointed by Chinese 150 mainly because of its lack of intensity compared to the summer programs and opportunities to speak up in class. Teachers tried to squeeze too much into 50 minutes that we didn't have enough time to practice and digest things we learned. Questions were also often discouraged. My speaking, if not listening, abilities dramatically decreased over the course of a semester. I know it's unfair to compare Chinese 150 with summer programs, but anyways I was very disappointed and unmotivated to study Chinese. But I think if you keep yourself motivated (which is very hard) I am sure you will learn a lot in this class except speaking.",
    "The standard Chinese class. Disappointingly more of the same \"memorize essay + characters, recite in class.\" L5 students should be challenged more to have actual discussions in class. After a summer in Beijing, especially, CHNS 150 seems like a regression. You go from the free form discussions of your summer xiaobanke to straight recitation. Considering Chinese is only one hour a day, I don't believe this is the best way to really learn the language and retain the characters and vocab you learn during the semester and ultimately leads to an unsatisfying experience.",
    "Yes I recommend it if you want to continue with Chinese.",
    "Intense. Everyday, tons of vocab, three weekly quizzes, biweekly essays and weekly listening assignments. Add in presentations, weekly tutorial (with a TA), and written and oral tests, and you've got a significant time drain. But totally worth it if want to keep learning Chinese. The textbook is manic and hilarious.",
    "If you are serious about continuing your study of chinese, by all means, take this class. It is a standard, effective chinese class with the usual workload. I wouldn't take it unless you have a sincere interest. It would be torture if you weren't motivated or interested. The teachers are extremely well prepared and the course is well organized and stays on schedule. The class work and homework is also very predictable which makes it pretty easy to manage with other classes."
