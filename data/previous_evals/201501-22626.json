    "very unorganized and hard to follow.",
    "No I would not recommend it.",
    "Lecture that can be supplemented by just doing the readings.",
    "Low work chill class",
    "If you want a simple political science class, this is it. With 6 in class assignments that are pretty straightforward, you almost never have to attend lecture if you have other commitments. Plus, you can drop your lowest writing assignment grade as well, which takes off a lot of pressure. You will not learn much about the political implications of religious belief or the link between religion and politics as the material is presented very quickly and there is no focus. Overall, it's a pretty easy memorization type class that can turn out to be a GPA booster if you put in the minimal effort required.",
    "Take it if you are interested in world politics and religion. Otherwise you will be bored. Can't use laptops in class so class drags on forever.",
    "It's a broad overview of politics and religion. We never got really in-depth anywhere with anything. I would be wary of taking this as a gut because the graders can be very arbitrary with their grading without giving any feedback.",
    "Take it. Not hard to do pretty well. Lecture is somewhat boring, but Sigrun is the cutest (she gets super excited about the material and game of thrones) and she is very accommodating and genuinely wants you to do well.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course, unless it is necessary for your major. While I learned a decent amount about religion, I did not feel like the course was especially applicable to a political science major. The final exam was also not representative of the general course material.",
    "Religion 'n' Politics is a heck of a class. The professor, Sigrun Kahl, is just about the sweetest lady you'll ever meet, and the topics can be quite interesting. The one criticism I'd offer is that grading is a complete enigma. I am convinced the grades are chosen by a game of random chance, or perhaps a wheel of fortune the TFs kept handy. The students who never went to class did the best, and the students who were there all the time did the worst! I think this fact might perhaps explain why so few students ever attended.",
    "Yes. It's interesting and allows you to be so.",
    "Pretty easy class. Take it if you know absolutely nothing about religion and would like to know about the fundamentals and how they relate to politics.",
    "Interesting political science course with not too heavy of a workload",
    "A very enjoyable class, if you, like me, enjoy lectures. Although a bit of the charts get repetitive, this class is a fun change from the rote memorization that many courses encourage. Instead, learning to approach problems with a unified framework is the focus of this class.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "Easy. Good set up for grade, 50% assignment, 50% Final. Paper option.",
    "This is a fine course. Professor Kahl is really sweet, but she is pretty all over the place. A good 5th course, where you will learn, but it is definitely not amazing.",
    "Reviews will indicate that this is an athlete-heavy gut, which it is. Not difficult to do well on the in-class assessments. The syllabus has interesting stuff on it, but we didn't cover half of it, and Professor Kahl was a disjointed and all over the place professor. Content has potential to be good- even the final was well-formatted, allowing us to actually apply topics and theories to the prompts.",
    "This is a good course. Not a ton of work, but the content is very interesting. Instead of midterms, there are five in class writing assignments, which really makes it less stressful. Take this course if you are looking for an easier course, but don't want to take a boring gut.",
    "Very interesting class that outlines the development of different religions and how these trajectories resulted from or led to political reform. This topic is important because it asks questions, such as: Are nations with certain religions or state-church regimes more likely to enjoy democratic institutions or economic progress? A variety of factors have historically shaped the influence of religion on politics (and vice-versa) over time; studying these factors is necessary for getting a better understanding of how different regions have developed over time, and why present trends, such as the resurgence of religious fundamentalism, are occurring. The use of statistics and tables in lectures were helpful for understanding and recalling information.I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Disorganized although the material is interesting. It isn't presented very coherently. Easy overall but I don't know how much I actually learned.",
    "Really good class and very manageable.",
    "A good, easy political science lecture for a 5th class. The workload is very manageable and it is nice not having weekly section.",
    "SOCY 172 01 is a very interesting course. It thoroughly covers the relationship between various government systems and religions.",
    "Good class",
    "Good class to take. Interesting.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and learned a lot, especially gaining an appreciation and understanding of the nuances that underline each concept. The course had a broad title but I learned a lot of specific material and believe that my analytical skills of analyzing new material (like graphs and quotes) really improved. Prof. Kahl was always very supportive and encouraging. She really inspired me to learn on my own as well, in addition to the material covered in class. I think this is a good introductory course and one that allows you to explore further concepts you're personally interested in through the option of a research paper.",
    "A very disorganized course. The material itself is interesting, but the class was hectic in terms of both logistics and the way in which the material was presented. We jumped around a lot; I didn't really get a sense of the logical flow of the lectures and we always seemed to be rushing through class. Also, way too much Game of Thrones discussion during lectures. I studied the Game of Thrones Wikipedia page for the final because I didn't understand any of the references that were being made in multiple lectures. The professor does try to be helpful to students though.",
    "I would not recommend as I went in excited to learn about the relationship between religion and politics but didn't learn much besides what was needed on the writing assignments.",
    "The topics are interesting enough, and the workload is very light. Grading can be extremely frustrating because the instructor and the TAs seem to value brevity over sophisticated thought. The grade is made up of about five in-class writing assignments and a final exam (which is essentially just a bunch of the same sorts of writing assignments). The writing assignments and final ask pretty big questions and expect very particular, yet very concise, answers. Many answers are literally limited to single sentences. It ended up being more worthwhile to master the grading system than to master the material.",
    "This is a good fifth class. Take it if you're interested in religion (Christianity or Islam) or politics and are looking for a class with relatively little work. 50% of final grade is 6 short writing assignment\/quizzes (get to drop the lowest score) and 50% is the final. Reading not always required. Lecture can be boring, but the quizzes were usually fair as long as you study for them a little bit. The quizzes are nice because they force you to study for the final throughout the semester so you don't have to learn all the material right before the final. Prof. Kahl is kind of all over the place, can be confusing at times, and talks A TON about Game of Thrones, which is good or bad depending on whether you watch the show. I don't watch it, so it was really alienating and made me tune out for half the lecture when she would talk about Game of Thrones for 30 minutes. Not an exaggeration. Lastly, the final was pretty hard. Still, the class was fine--not my favorite but not the worst.",
    "A good Poli Sci class if you are interested in the intersection of religion and politics. There are better and there are worse classes in the major.",
    "Interesting and broad coverage of the relationship between various religions and their impact on political practices and norms. At times it is prone to making generalizations about religious attitudes, but that is understandable given the broad and complex nature of the topic."
