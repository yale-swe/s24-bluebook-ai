   "comments": [
    "It's hard to say how this class will be in the future since Kang Laoshi is retiring this year. As a course in the heritage speaker track, the class focuses on vocabulary acquisition and character recognition, with some composition thrown in. If that's what you want, then take the class. The vocabulary is not that difficult; all the words you learn appear regularly in Chinese newspapers and speech. Grammar is never explicitly taught.The workload is quite steady and there is always something to do. It's not too bad though, and the work is not intellectually draining.",
    "This is a great class that you can learn a lot from. The professor is funny and often goes beyond the scope of the textbook when teaching. The weekly compositions and presentations are probably the most time-consuming assignments in the class, but even then they only take 2-3 hours to complete. All in all, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in improving their Chinese, both in terms of the language and knowledge of Chinese culture.",
    "I speak Chinese at home and have been going to Chinese school on the weekends for many years before college, but I found this course still to be extremely tough. The workload is heavy, [there's a 4 day rotation cycle, with 2 quizzes, an essay, and a presentation along with other mini-assignments during each], but your Chinese definitely improves dramatically. Kang Laoshi was kind of intimidating in the beginning of the course, but he really grows on you over the course of the semester. Also, once you get into the habit of doing the work it definitely becomes easier. Overall, I would recommend this course.",
    "This Chinese course is rigorous but ultimately achieves the goal of improving the student's ability in Chinese. Overall, if you put in the work, you will get better at Chinese and have some degree of success in the class.",
    "I would recommend it, but it is very work intensive and the pace is fast. You cannot fall behind! If you keep up and complete all your assignments, you will do well."
