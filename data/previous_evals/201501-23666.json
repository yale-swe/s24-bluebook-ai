    "Guest presentations",
    "Guest lecturers were thoughtfully selected, and generally delivered well-structured and informative lectures. In addition, the project-based portion of this class was a fantastic supplement to class-based lectures and lesson materials.",
    "The clinical projects -- & everything but the occasional case of what is described below.",
    "The student discussions and the after-class dinners were incredibly helpful, and I relished the opportunity to network and get a better sense of conservation as a career path. I truly appreciate Brad's emphasis on honing networking skills and expanding our networks- that is arguably the most valuable lesson I gained from this course.",
    "The guest speakers in the course were all great, and the format of pairing their presentations with discussions worked well.",
    "For me, speaker presentations, workshops, and clinical projects were the most informative aspects of the course.",
    "I enjoyed the student run discussions that drew from weekly written responses, and of course the guest lecturer model.",
    "Dinners with speakers; speaker presentations; class discussions; learning from other student projects",
    "The networking opportunities and wide range of topics covered were the best aspects of this course. As I simply audited the course, I did not have the opportunity to engage in a clinic project, but they seemed to be an aspect of the course enjoyed by students."

   "comments": [
    "Professor is an extremely generous and skilled moderator of people and kindler of discussion, but sometimes guests and students need to be better directed or cut-off. I would like to have a bit more from the Professor's background and hear his thoughts rather than mostly those of outsiders and peers. This is not so much a lack of content problem but a lack of curation and more forceful instruction or direction of content. In other words, the only negative aspects of this course were the occasionally not-relevant or uninteresting ramblings or redundancies of students or guests, who sometimes do not know what they are talking about, coaxed to speak their mind and left entirely un-checked by the Professor.",
    "The in-class discussions can be repetitive - I might recommend cutting discussions down from an hour and a half to an hour or so.",
    "The client projects should perhaps be vetted further to make sure that everyone has roughly the same workload. Some projects were much more or less time intensive than others. Students who signed up for a harder project (though we could not have known which that would be at the time) probably got more out of the class than those with easier assignments.",
    "- A better sense of connectivity with the classes\/topics covered towards the end of the semester, to the core topics covered in the beginning - A wider range of geographical case studies - An evaluation of the usefulness of workshops throughout the semester"

   "comments": [
    "Checking in each week and reporting back for others to hear and give feedback on clinical projects was great, and lent a sense of immediacy to the readings and talks each week.",
    "Yes, the relationship between class discussions and presentations effectively framed workshops and clinical projects.",
    "The discussion was always very engaging and provocative, and importantly it always directly related to the subject matter for the week. Student comments were very well respected, and I always felt encouraged to speak my mind. I would like to see some type of group work embedded in the discussions. Breaking out into smaller groups may help shy students get a word in.",

    "I am interested in urban land management and conservation, and am pursuing the Sustainable Land Management, Use and Policy specialization. Accordingly, this course fits into both my personal interests and the requirements of my specialization.",
    "Fills out what was previously only a narrow professional\/personal understanding of land conservation with the broader view of what folks are thinking about and working in across the field. Fits nicely in my program because it is a potential avenue for further work to explore, but undoubtedly a space I ought to understand at least broadly.",
    "This class provided a great overview with plenty of depth about both how land trusts and private conservation operates, as well as the future of the movement and new initiatives. It fit in well to my program because my focus on food and agriculture policy ties in with land access issues that are being addressed by some land trusts.",
    "This course is really helpful in preparing me for work in regional planning and open space conservation at the government or NGO levels.",

It doesn't take a deep dive into any one topic, but rather involves a surface-level exploration of large-scale land conservation, conservation finance, outreach and engagement, urban conservation, community conservation, agriculture and other relevant topics. As such, it is most useful for students wishing to explore conservation broadly and determine if and where their interests lie in this field.",
    "The best reason to take this course is for the clinical aspect, so make sure you are invested in learning that way and that there is a project or two you are highly interested in.",
    "If you're at all interested in land trusts and conservation, take it!",
    "I would advise students considering taking this course to choose their client based on student recommendations and the care taken to write a thoughtful and clear project proposal.",
    "Take this course before Management Plans--it will help inform recommendations to landowners about the future of their land. I would encourage you to take this course in your first year. It really did change my way of thinking, and I wish I had been able to get more involved with this type of work earlier.",
    "This class is a great opportunity pick a project that you're interested and devote a lot of time to it."
