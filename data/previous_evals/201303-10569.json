    "i really enjoyed it. even if you don't do all the reading, you'll still come out of this class feeling like you've learned a lot of interesting material.",
    "A solid introduction to the history of Western Europe during wartime. Not as military-focused as the name suggests, it's more of a survey in cultural, military and political history.",
    "Good overview of Europe in the 20th century. Take it if you're willing to dish out $230 for course packets alone and then at least $80 for other books. And then are willing to do all that reading. Tip: don't buy the books. It's alright, but can definitely be a dry class. Not the greatest history class--could benefit more from another history class with a more accessible professor.",
    "Must take History class at Yale. Take it before Winter leaves, which will be soon.",
    "Do not take this class--it is a massive waste of time!",
    "Absolutely, take this class. Lectures are great and you'll have a scholar's perspective of the two World Wars.",
    "Take it because the material is important. Don't expect it to change your life.",
    "I was summarize it as an incredibly interesting history course. I would definitely recommend it based on my positive reaction to the course as a whole.",
    "This course changed my life! You must take it--Jay Winter is the foremost in this field and really really knows what he's talking about! Every lecture was amazing.The reading is very lengthy, but it was usually interesting. I didn't read everything, and found it harder than my DS syllabus from last year, but the point is just to get started and read as much as you can. Every extra word you read will make you that much more knowledgeable, so just try your best!The midterm paper was very interesting, you get to pick two great books and write about them.My section TF, Kate, was really hardworking and definitely knew what she was doing. Some people were complaining that she's a lot harsher than the other TFs (making us do writing exercises, etc.) but I think that means she really cares and that you're actually LEARNING something from her section.Take this class, it will change the way you view current events and it explains so much of why the world we're living in today is the way it is!",
    "I was really excited for this course, and to be honest I think it is overhyped, but it is still a good course. Professor Winter's lectures were often stimulating, though I have to warn you he assumes a lot of previous knowledge and that could be a little overwhelming for me.There is a lot of reading and if you're willing to commit to it (even if you skim and get the main argument) you will get a lot from it but if you're going to sort of half-ass it don't bother taking this class unless you're some sort of omnipotent genius. I struggled to keep up with the reading but it took me a while to realize that I don't have to read every word.Great overview of the First and Second World War.",
    "If you are lucky enough get the chance to take this course, TAKE IT. It was single-handedly the best course I've taken at Yale. Professor Winter is nothing short of a genius, and you would be remiss to pass up the opportunity to hear him lecture on his life's work. REMISS. Don't be intimidated by the reading, and take is credit\/D if you have to, because you will not regret it.",
    "Yes. I took it Credit D Fail, which may be a good option if you are interested in the material, but cannot keep up with the reading.",
    "Fantastic, take this course, but take it Credit\/D. That way you can enjoy the course (lectures are very engaging so you won't want to miss it), but not worry about doing all the reading. The amount of reading is unrealistic (the course packs for this class are the most expensive ones at Yale).",
    "Take this class!!! Winter is an incredible lecturer. He's about to retire; don't miss out!I took this Credit\/D and appreciated the ability to ignore the copious amounts of reading.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is an important topic and it is taught by one of the leading voices on the period. Winter's lectures are enough of a reason to take it.",
    "Just watch out if you don't have a solid core knowledge of the facts\/military history of both world wars. There is very little review of the basics and Winter jumps right into the themes. If all you have is basic high school world history, you are probably not prepared for this class.",
    "Yes. Total war is an excellent class that covers an incredibly important period of modern history. Well worth it if only to hear Jay Winter lecture. Always engaging, often riveting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another students however, it is very time consuming and reading intensive. On average there is probably 400-500 pages of reading a week.",
    "This course was really bad.1) Jay Winter gave completely disorganized lectures. He'd mention an event, say he'd be coming back to it, and never come back to it. one example which comes to mind: He said he'd talk about the 20 July plot in the lecture about resistance. He brought it up, said the name, and never came back to it. My notes usually had one line about 10 or 20 different events as a result of disorganization like this.2) This course is about Western Europe in the Age of Total War. That's fine, but it should be clearer about its focus at the outset. The lectures on World War I mentioned the word \"Habsburg\" maybe once and \"Ottoman\" maybe twice. There were one or two lectures about the Eastern Front during WWII, and I don't feel much more was said than that it was brutal and awful. I think as much time was spent on the \"Blitz\" as on the Holocaust, or the Russian Revolution, or Stalin. I mean, the Blitz and Britain are impressive. But come on!3) The reading is so enormous and so unwieldy. He must expect that students will skim and pick out the important parts. I'm of the opinion that teaching - especially teaching an INTRODUCTORY lecture to 20th century European history - involves giving real guidance to students who are still learning how to decide what's important. Maybe Jay Winter's reading loads are appropriate for an upper-level seminar. Definitely not for a lecture like this one.",
    "This is a great class. I would recommend it to anyone. The lectures are incredible. I would have seriously regretted not taking this class.",
    "Yes, because the subject\/readings are interesting and relevant. Not with Jay Winter if possible.",
    "Total War was my first history class at Yale and I couldn't be happier that I took it. Professor Winter is a fantastic lecturer who is extremely knowledgeable about both world wars, and he has put together a very well-organized lecture schedule that touches on many of the important themes of the time without falling into the trap of stretching himself too thin. The grade in the course is split evenly three ways between section participation, the midterm paper, and the final, and though we haven't gotten the final back yet, the midterm papers were graded fairly and section was solid. Check out the syllabus while shopping to see if the midterm paper is something you'd be interested in writing -- it is a bit of a bizarre combination of history paper and literary analysis that seemed to leave most of our class a bit bewildered. The other thing to be aware of is the massive reading load. There are probably 300-400 pages per week of reading, and most of it is very dense. The readings are well selected and very interesting, but essentially impossible to keep up with throughout the semester.",
    "A really great course! If you're interested in this period, its events, and their consequences, definitely take it. (That said, it's not an intro course, so you need at least a basic grounding in the people, places, and events of the two world wars.) If you're not, you might find the workload heavy and the lectures not worth your time. If, like me, you love this period in history, or at least are interested in learning more about it, then DEFINITELY take the course. Winter is fantastically knowledgable and passionate about his subject, and it's infectious. The readings, although really heavy, are very interesting. Only a midterm paper and a final, which is really manageable if you study.",
    "A good class on a fascinating moment in history. Do more of the reading than I did.",
    "Great course with a great lecturer, a lot of reading though.",
    "It is a presentation of different theses about different snippets of both world wars. Do not take it unless Professor Winter significantly cuts down on the reading and better organizes his lectures. Also, make sure you get a good TF. Professor Winter expects his TF's to provide a historical summary of the period and effectively synthesize a hefty amount of reading so if you are stuck with a mediocre TF this will make the class unenjoyable. If you get a great TF I believe the class could be quite interesting, even if it is still a bit disorganized.",
    "Yes, especially for someone with little background on the time period. If you've taken classes in this period before, it might be a bit redundant. The only criticism I have is the reading load- absolutely ridiculous. So heavy that most people just forgo the reading all together.",
    "Take it:)",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "The course changes one's perspectives about the wars and covers an incredible amount of material. I would recommend the course but prepared to do a lot of reading.",
    "This is a solid history course on an important time period, and it has less work that most history courses (but lots of reading!). Just a midterm paper and a final (to which you are provided the possible questions before hand).",
    "yes yes yes. please. it's such an important class, and it's taught so well, and you'll learn so much. why would you not!",
    "Definitely one of the best lecture courses at Yale because professor winter's lectures are well-organized and interesting to listen to. There is also so many things going on during the time period so it's nice to get a euro-centric view of the world wars without getting distracted by what was going on in the us or Asia. Be selective with the readings, as long as you understand the main points and a few arguments about each of the main themes,you'll be fine. Think of it as a class where you have the opportunity to learn about the time period that defined the world we know today.",
    "Should have taken it while you had the chance.",
    "Take this class before you graduate especially if you want to be a history major! And try to do the majority of the reading, I really regretted both as a I studied for the final and for life that I hadn't done more.",
    "I think that in some ways the thesis of the course gets in the way of its best material. The best elements of the class do not revolve around hashing out a definition and time period of Total War, but rather Jay Winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mastery of the cultural history of Europe and his lectures that bring it to life. Europe in the Age of Total War is a lot of reading, some writing, and many great lectures. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of the reading packets\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just do what you can. Take the course!",
    "Take it.",
    "I would recommend the class, but it was not my favorite class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "This is an excellent course. You'll feel like a better person after taking it. The reading can be extremely overwhelming at times and practically impossible to keep up with, but as long as you do about 50% of it you should be fine.",
    "Definitely take this class. Jay Winter is so knowledgeable in the topic and presents the material very well. I always looked forward to class and I feel like I really learned a lot. Lots of reading but the majority is actually really interesting and you definitely don't have to do all of it.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class, and Professor Winter is a great lecturer. However, there is a lot of reading.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course. There's a reason Winter is known as one of the best lecturers at Yale. A ton of reading but you can get away with not doing all of it.",
    "Yes, interesting lecture.",
    "Great class. If you love this period of history you will like this class. It's in depth analysis of WWI was very different than any other course I had taken. This is NOT a military history course but still covers battles\/tactics. There is a lot of reading and you really have to keep up in order to do well. Professor Winter is fascinating to listen to."
