    "Don't take this class. It's much more intensive than 125, and significantly less enjoyable. One of the few things that got me up in the morning to go to this class was the idea of going to Italy this summer, but I'm still really not sure if it was worth it. I think I must have learned a lot based on the amount of work we had, which hopefully will prove true in the future, but right now I just feel very burned out."
