   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved this course. I felt like I learned so much. The theory was heavy---but not too heavy, just enough so that we really got a grasp. Definitely take it if you're a sociology\/anthro\/social sciences major and you want to really take an analytical look at the way the body has been treated and should be treated in the social sciences. It's really important, informative, and interesting.",
    "Embodied Sociology: what is it? In short answer, a very interesting blend between psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and sociology, all focusing on how having a body with sensory motor capacities forms our human experience. This class was thought-provoking and enjoyable. Professor Mahler is a very caring and eloquent teacher, and the small class size really facilitated interesting discussions. This isn't for everyone: be willing to think very abstractly for a semester. Two short papers and five reading responses total, so minimal work for sizable intellectual reward.",
    "Take this class! Professor Mahler is a wonderful professor who makes this very nebulous topic understandable and also adjusts the classes according to to the interests of the students. If you're at all interested in cog sci, neuropsych, sociology, or just the way the body is experienced and used by individuals in society, you'll get a lot out of this enjoyable course (which has a very manageable amount of weekly reading, and useful, non-busy-work assignments). Even if that sounds super confusing or uninteresting to you, shop this class (and don't be afraid of the first few readings on the syllabus)."
