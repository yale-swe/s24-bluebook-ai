   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot more about the psychology behind propaganda and persuasion. We also learned a lot about vulnerabilities in our American culture that make Russian information warfare more effective.",
    "Better understanding of the origins and extent of the Russian disinformation campaign in the United States",
    "An incredible overview of the complex circumstances behind Russias disinformation campaign during the 2016 election.",
    "The course did a good job of developing knowledge on the 2016 election attacks as well as putting it in a historical context.",
    "There were two big take aways from this course. First, disinformation is real, it is happening, and everyone needs to know about it. Second, there are no obvious solutions to disinformation because it's a very multifaceted problem with roots in many individual issues. This was made apparent in our final policy presentations -- almost every person in the class presented on something entirely different. The class starts with the history and motivations of Russian intelligence conducting disinformation operation, moves on to the psychology of disinformation, continues to disinformation as seen on social media and ends with the effects of disinformation on democracy.",
    "I sense of what the most cutting-edge challenges and solutions with the impact American cyber culture are.",
    "This course was excellent at using social psychology to highlight aspects of the relationship between social media usage habits and the formation of political opinions. It was also very good at clarifying how classic Soviet propaganda doctrine links to Russian foreign policy and grand strategy today."

   "comments": [
    "The small size created great discussion on the readings. The assignments weren't too long or difficult to write since you had multiple topic options.",
    "Learning still a very new topic so there's much to be discovered, but I thought Asha did a great job in organizing the weekly class topics and selecting interesting readings. The media bubble analyses were one of the most interesting assignments throughout the course, learning about how news is portrayed and different narratives fed to varying audiences. However, the workload could be calibrated a bit better. The media bubble analyses became a little repetitive at some point and could be done every other week instead. I also thought some of the short papers seemed unnecessary. It might be helpful to have a course assistant help with some of the organization of the class (e.g. posting media bubble submissions) in the future.",
    "Very comprehensive and engaging material that is difficult to teach (because news is unfolding as it is taught). Improvement: maybe get a pure technology expert in the future (someone from Facebook perhaps).",
    "Especially appreciated the guest speakers and the insight they brought to the issues.",
    "Strengths: - Class allows you to spend an entire semester understanding and crafting solutions to a fascinating policy issue - Students and professor were all really invested in the class and came from all walks of life (tech, Russianists, political campaigns, military, psychology, law, etc.) - Fascinating guest lecturers who were very knowledgeable and added a lot to our class discussions Weaknesses: - Weekly media bubble responses were really interesting at first but became repetitive after a while. I think it would have been really productive to discuss as a class what we were trying to achieve by writing them and to adjust the exercise over the course of the semester accordingly",
    "This is a policy-focused course and in some ways excludes are more wholistic understanding of the subject matter by leaving out a less solutions focused or \"bottom line\" analysis of the subject.",
    "Strengths: excellent and cross-disciplinary readings; ability to tailor writing requirements to suit individual student interests. Guest speakers were uniformly outstanding and greatly contributed to classroom discussion and focus material. Weaknesses: \"juice to squeeze\" on some of the readings--several, notably \"1984,\" were significant investments in time that did not really contribute to class discussion or final research projects. Recommendation: Would recommend that students identify one of several individual tracks they are interested in at the beginning of the term. Based on their selection, students will complete required core readings essential for the meat of the course (such as \"Bowling Alone\"), but be able to focus on optional readings that will augment their papers and research (\"1984\" versus \"Mistakes were Made\", by way of an example). The expectation is that students bring their perspectives from their optional readings to bear in classroom discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely take this course if you're interested in the topic. Three essays, a final policy paper, and a weekly media analysis for homework but the topics are open enough that it's not overly difficult.",
    "Yes, it's a fascinating and very relevant topic that hasn't been covered much academically yet.",
    "Absolutely. Really exceptional class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The subject is so timely and relevant, I found myself constantly applying what I was learning in outside conversations and projects.",
    "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student interested in policy issues related to social media, disinformation or Russia. It was an exciting opportunity to grapple with a critically important, and highly relevant policy issue in a structured way with students from all across Yale.",
    "Absolutely, this course offers many very interesting and very relevant lessons. If the student is interested in the topic they should absolutely take the course.",
    "Absolutely--this course's devotion to applying cross-disciplinary methodology to a complex problem set is precisely the sort of work I expected to do as a graduate student."
