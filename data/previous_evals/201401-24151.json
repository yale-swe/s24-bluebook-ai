   "comments": [
    "Disappointing, for what could have been an interesting course. A lot of constant tedious busywork is due regularly. The book (the Plague by Albert Camus) was not helpful. Only about 20% of the lectures provided useful information, the others were very simplistic. For example: during the lecture on GIS, we really didn't learn how to create maps, we just spent an hour learning that maps are important and what different types of maps look like.",
    "interesting course. But way too demanding in terms of assignments. Also they have this double marking system where each assignment is marked by two different professors so one will give you a high mark while the other finds random things to pick on and lower your mark. Wish it was not like that.",
    "-I liked the team-taught approach--all the instructors were fantastic and it was exciting to learn from their expertise-I enjoyed The Plague but don't think 6 assignments on were necessary--the updates were good, but perhaps the study questions could be replaced with different YouTube video assignments-would like to know grades on study questions-I really liked the textbook--it will be very helpful in the future-some of my favorite assignments were the Ebola and Legionnaire's disease exercises, and the food-borne outbreak exercise with Dr. Mullens",
    "This class really should move faster and cover more material. It wasn't as rigorous as hoped, which was surprising since the class was condensed from 3 hours down to 2. I think the lack of objective content (such as material presented in the textbook) made the class frustrating at times; discussions and subjective approaches quickly devolve into \"spinning our wheels\" without a solid objective foundation.One of the best aspects of the class was the interaction between the instructors and the variety of backgrounds and experiences they can bring to the class. The classes where they all were present and taught were some of the most interesting ones.I liked having numerous assignments, but was surprised there wasn't any feedback on smaller assignments. Finally, I liked the idea behind The Plague but wished some of the assignments would explore other outbreaks and other scenarios. The world is bigger than Connecticut and Oran! :)",
    "This is one of the worst courses I have taken at YSPH. It is taught at a high school level and you learn little of value. The assignments are awful and you don't learn much of use from them. Reading the Plague was horrible. That is a work of fiction set in the 1940s. This is an epidemiology course, not an English course. It was an interesting concept, but poorly executed, and probably there is no good way to teach science with a novel; the Plague needs to be scrapped. Assignments were horrible. What use is it to \"pretend\" you have way, way outdated technology? When are we ever going to get dropped off in a situation like that with minimal resources, most, if not ALL of us will never experience anything like that. We should focus on more MODERN outbreaks that will be of some use to us. At least the assignments were easy and took very, very little time to complete and were graded very generously. I was just SO DISAPPOINTED in this course. It had the potential to be SO GOOD, but it was just SO BAD. I (and many of my classmates) am really interested in this topic, but I didn't learn anything practical. Maybe if you sent me to work on the PLAGUE in 1940s Oran, well that would be aces, real swell I tell ya. I'll shake a leg and give that outbreak the kiss off, dollface.",
    "This course focuses on the book \"The Plague\" throughout the entire course. First of all, that is a horrible book and to base every assignment on this book is a terrible idea. The book has nothing to do with real life public health investigation. The book is outdated, I would rather have real world present then a fictional book.",
    "Honestly, this course made me feel like I was in high school again. Spending the whole semester reading and doing assignments on The Plague felt very unnecessary. The instructors were very nice and approachable, but I wish the course had been more challenging.",
    "The course has incredible resources that few people get to access. The lecturers have great experience and are in some very high positions. It is great hearing from those people and doing case studies. However, everything to do with The Plague is an absolute waste of time. There are so many books, fiction and nonfiction, that could take its place and serve the same purpose. The Plague has very little to do with epidemiology and leaves students grasping. Look up one of the dozens of novels that are about outbreaks and are legitimately interesting\/informative to keep students interested in the assignments.",
    "This was a great course with lots of good insights from a variety of experts in the field. My biggest critique was that, for several homework assignments, I felt that we didn't get the answers (learn the correct responses) until after we got them back. It was also really difficult to squeeze all the information that was expected from us into the stringent word count! It was very frustrating to be docked for not including certain details or not explaining things well, when there just weren't enough words to do so. I know, I know: We'll have these limitations in the real world.I really appreciated that the instructors took the time to conduct a mid-semester appraisal of the course. I feel a little bad about it, because I think that the class was a bit too harsh and focused on the negatives (as we're all wont to do). None of the comments were unanimous, and everyone had positive things to say - it's just easier to focus on the negatives.Oh, and I wished that we learned more about epi curves. They can be such valuable little tools and you can glean so much information from them. Please include a short lesson about them, working through examples to show how an outbreak of X transmitted through Y manifests on an epi curve.",
    "This class shouldbe expanded to include the state, nation and even global structures (or agencies) involved in outbreak investigations. There is also an opportunity to include more recent or on-going investigations into the course content. It was surprising that we did not discuss the current ebola or MERS outbreaks at any length. It would have been interesting and more engaging to discuss current events.",
    "This class was good but needs many improvements. I thought the series of very small assignments worth only 2.5 points were useless. Also, the book is not that good and beyond the first section really serves no purpose. The book made the class more about literature than anything. The best classes were the ones where we broke off into small groups to do the case studies of investigations.",
    "The course did a good job getting students very familiar with what it would be like to work as a public health practicioner at the state\/local level, particularly in the area of foodborne\/unusual outbreaks. It was useful to hear about the different instructors' field experiences and have them weigh in on career paths. However, lots of the guest lectures were redundant with material taught in other courses common to most EMD students.Additionally, using The Plague for assignments felt a little less useful than using non-fiction or primary sources to generate surveillance plans, for example. Digging through a work of literature did not seem like the most efficient way to teach students how to design a surveillance system or investigate an outbreak. Using more case studies (a real strength of the course) may have been more useful. It would have been really interesting to do more exercises similar to the training EIS provides, since there were some instructors with EIS experience.",
    "This course has a lot of potential however the material that is currently taught in class does not go into much depth and only scratched the surface for most topics that that are discussed. Also, there are 2-3 lectures that seem to present that same material.",
    "Response to this is similar to the findings from the mid-course assessment.",
    "I thought this course would be more exciting than it was. We talked way too much about food Bourne outbreaks. We also should've been given the grading criteria before we submitted the assignments not after!! It was impossible to figure out what you were looking for. There are so many other interesting books we could've read like Laurie Garrett. The plague was dry and boring.",
    "The instructors were very kind and clearly cared about the class.However, there were too many small weekly assignments that didn't seem to add much value to the class and weren't follow up on\/discussed afterward. Also, the Plague as a disease outbreak case was not helpful - it wasn't written with public health in mind (per se), so trying to determine incidence\/prevalence and to account for practical\/logistical concerns was really difficult because many of those details were not provided. Lastly, the class lectures were not well organized throughout the semester.On a positive note, I really enjoyed when we worked through case studies in class."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend it. Students would get the same usefulness by coming to the first lecture in this class, then dropping out and just going to the Public Health Surveillance class instead.",
    "yes",
    "Would definitely recommend--gives a good introduction to the foundations of outbreak investigations and also provides opportunities to practice skills gained through a variety of exercises. enjoyable class.",
    "This class explores outbreak response and is taught by practicing epidemiologists. It's an interesting blend of instructors and content, but sometimes moves slowly. I would recommend it, but you will have to have some patience (especially with pretending you're in Oran and some unclear grading standards). I would add that this class doesn't work well if students don't participate, so I'd encourage you to do your part to contribute to lively discussions to get the most out of it.",
    "NO! Well, ok, assignments were insultingly easy, and not based on anything in class, so you didn't need to go to class. It was just so disappointing. This class should have been AMAZING. Like wow, we waited our whole time at YSPH to take this class, and it was a dud. We learned nothing. We could have learned SO MUCH and HAD FUN and been INTERESTED in the topic, but no. And yes I am bitter, I am very interested in this field and this class was of no use to me. It needs to be COMPLETELY STARTED OVER FROM SCRATCH. Maybe that junk flies at UCONN, but this is YSPH, have a little pride. Geez.",
    "I would not recommend this class. STAY AWAY, you will be disappointed.",
    "You will understand food outbreaks really well. Some interesting things to learn, but you will do busy work that will not really help you learn anything.",
    "This course takes you through the experience of investigating an outbreak with a series of real-world examples and using multiple scenarios.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because a lot of the material covered in this course does not go beyond some of the topics covered in our core courses. The course focuses heavily on state level outbreak investigations with particular focus on food-borne illness. A lot of the lectures are redundant and are not taught at a graduate level.",
    "The course is great for those looking to learn the ins and outs of working for a state or local health department. It is also good for those who may want to build the skills to conduct outbreak investigations but have not already taken other EMD courses (it can be somewhat redundant for EMD students). I would recommend it for those who want an overview in these areas or those who don't mind incorporating literature into their public health studies.",
    "It does not particularly make one capable in outbreak investigation. It gives you basic skills to get started. Easy class but a mock investigation team project would have been more exciting.",
    "This course is and introductory look at public health surveillance and outbreak investigations. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in outbreak investigations\/surveillance for infectious diseases.",
    "Kinda boring. Interesting guest lecturers and class activities"
