    "This was a great class. If you are interested in democracy, the democratic process, or how journalism is supposed to facilitate an informed public that can thoughtfully discuss the issues of the day, take this class. Sleeper is a great professor, and will get you thinking about our country in a whole new way.",
    "It's a crucial class--it really is the ultimate antidote to Grand Strategy. Its title hides its broad scope: it is really about what made and makes America and other similar societies great and what its future leaders must do to preserve it. But unlike other, more \"realist\" classes, its thesis is that America was made great by public virtue and the vibrant flow of information, debate and deliberation that is essential to any republic. And also by government decisions to help keep that state of affairs going. Great for those interested in journalism, because it reminds us what the whole point of journalism is in a democracy, and really for any Yalie who wants to commit themselves to public service, in whatever fashion.",
    "YeS. Take this class. Even if you're not interested in journalism (and especially if you are) this class with give you a lens you'll find pertinent in every manner of public life."
