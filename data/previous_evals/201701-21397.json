   "comments": [
    "strength: syllabus, class discussion weakness: uninteresting paper prompts (could be more creative)",
    "Great syllabus, both in terms of good literature, and very interesting combinations of books. Sometimes it might have gone better if we had read excerpts instead of the entire novel, in cases where it was emphasized that didn't need the entire thing",
    "It's kind of boring. Could use a little more variety in classes-- group work, maybe some projects, etc. to break up the hour and fifteen minutes twice a week. IT was sometimes very hard to sit through. Also, I think some of the works should be reevaluated--the instructor can probably sense which were least preferred by the students and why",
    "Fantastic readings that beautifully reverberate throughout each other. Professor Homans was a wonderful discussion leader. The assignment schedule also worked well; having 'only' a 7-8 page paper at the end of term took some pressure off of finals period, and I appreciated the opportunity to write a paper of the same length earlier in the term, rather than a shorter ~5 page assignment.",
    "I benefited most from the discussions that were guided but pretty open-ended. Since the course is covering transatlantic literature, race and gender, and a decently long time frame, I know it's tough to select a reading list. However, I think I could have benefited from some readings on Asian\/Middle Eastern Americans that may have been influenced by other minority literature in the West. I think it was less important to the course to have read Wynema and The Bondswoman's Narrative in their entirety, though the contexts in which those works were written were very important. I think being able to rather trace the impact of the slave narrative, for example, out to more readings from the Civil Rights Movement would be interesting.",
    "There were definitely many times when section felt low energy or not super engaging. I'm not sure how much of this was Professor Homans fault; I got the intention that many professors were taking the class credit\/D and\/or came to class unprepared and tired. For the most part the reading was manageable though there were a few times, mainly when we read \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" when it felt like too much. The syllabus of the class was well put together and Prof. Homans had clearly though through the readings as a cohesive collection to draw connections between them. My main concern with the syllabus was that the number of historical slave narratives we read became repetitive.",
    "The syllabus was really great, and Professor Homans did a great job of facilitating discussion.",
    "Sometimes I wished we talked more about what Prof. Homans wanted to discuss than different tangents that students would take us on."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it. Homans is a great professor, and you will learn a lot about both about analysis and a cannon that is often neglected.",
    "not really",
    "Would absolutely recommend the class. A really fascinating journey through anxieties & conflicts of race and gender from mid-19th century to the present.",
    "A solid continuation of the first half of the course, so it's certainly accessible if you didn't take the first half. Many of the readings of the syllabus are vital and you'll probably be a better person for having read them. Prof. Homans is very helpful and does a good job of presenting the texts as a cohesive unit.",
    "It was really interesting! I would totally recommend it people who are into this sort of thing."
