    "Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be discouraged by the long Friday afternoon time slot. Pamela makes the time fly with class trips to the book collection at Haas and excellent guest presenters who are working in graphic design in various capacities. Pamela and Lacey, our teaching fellow, were full of excellent advice, both when we presented our progress on projects in class and if we sought out any additional help via email throughout the week. I cannot think of a better way to have spent four hours of my Friday this semester. Excellent class, excellent people.",
    "Yes, take it. Even though it is 4 hours on a Friday afternoon, it is definitely worth it."
