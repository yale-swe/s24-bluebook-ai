    "Strength is the content. Very interesting and great guest speakers. Class could be more organized and structured.",

   "comments": [
    "This class was amazing. The professors were so interesting and intelligent while also being incredibly approachable. The guest lectures they brought in almost every to every other lecture were the same way. There was only one final paper but I feel like I learned so much just by listening to experts in the field talk about different aspects of developmental psychopathology. The practicum requirement was also an awesome part of the curriculum that was refreshing to get off campus and rewarding to get to work hands-on with autistic children (where I was placed). This was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. Cannot recommend it enough.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has a vague interest in Developmental Psychopathology. I came from an English background, and I was pleasantly surprised with how accessible this course was. I also think working with the special needs students in the practicum program was one of my favorite parts.",
    "A must take!",
    "I would recommend this course. The volunteer portion was one of my favorite things I have done at Yale and I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity."
