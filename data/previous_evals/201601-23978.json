   "comments": [
    "critical refugee studies was a spectacular class that thoroughly critiques dominant narratives of refugeeism. it is especially relevant for folx who work on refugee-related issues (approaching them from a top-down perspective) & folx in migration studies (critical refugee studies highlights the agency of those who move). i had major breakthroughs in this class re: national constructions, humanitarian interventionism, materiality, terrorism, & imagining freedom. the workload of the class is very balanced - a weekly reading response, a midterm paper, & a final project. the opportunity to do a meaningful creative or service project over a final paper shows how rigorous your learning is in this class. professor tran is an absolute gem of a professor. she is so generous with supporting students.",
    "This seminar is an introduction to critical refugee studies which seeks to critique and unpack how we conventionally think about refugees. The class included fantastic readings that deconstructed legal notions of refugeeness as well as representation. Studies had to post reading responses weekly. We also had a short midterm paper (5-7 pages) and a final project. Some students worked on a community service project of creating a rethinking refugees awareness week while others did 15 page paper or other creative projects,",
    "This class is fantastic. I would definitely recommend it. I can only imagine that the class will keep getting better with more iterations. Really interesting reading materials that will get you to think critically about the refugee discourse and what exactly a refugee is.",
    "Definitely, definitely take this class. It's fantastic. Professor Tran is wonderful and the material is fascinating and important. For the final project you have the option of doing a traditional essay, a creative project, or a 'service' project. Nearly everyone in our class ended up working together to put on \"Rethinking Refugees Week\", which was an incredible learning experience and a great way to take the class material outside of the boundaries of the classroom. This is what all classes at Yale should be like!",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class. Refugee studies is often discussed in a glib way in other classes - refugees are seen as a side casualty of broader historical trends rather than centered as part of a discourse that disentangles problematic power dynamics in state-to-state interactions (and the framework of the nation-state itself). Professor Tran is the kindest professor ever. She cares about us and remembers details about our lives. This course was in high demand this year, and for good reason. The syllabus pushed us to think in new ways, and the service project many of us undertook in lieu of writing a final paper allowed us to get to know each other as a class and to share all the knowledge we had learned. Definitely take it!",
    "Take it!",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. It will change how you think about refugees, and you are probably thinking about them in a deeply flawed way. Professor Tran is an incredible teacher and academic. She is a true asset to Yale and to ER&M. She is compassionate, insightful, passionate, and encouraging, but also rigorous and demanding (in the good ways!). ER&M 221 01 is an amazing course and one of the best I have taken at Yale thus far. It is rooted in illuminative, rigorous, profound, philosophical, discerning, incredible texts, but also allowed us to apply what we had learned. Ideal! Amazing. 100% recommend.",
    "ERM 221 is a phenomenal introduction to the theoretical study of \"refugeeness,\" forced migrations, displacement, and international\/national responses to \"refugee crises.\" Professor Tran is a very enthusiastic, thoughtful, and accessible teacher. She is passionate about the topic we cover in class and takes an interest in her students. I do think the class would have benefited from a historic perspective of refugee studies as well; this would provide more context for the theoretical discussions later in the course. Additionally, I think it would be useful to incorporate more multimedia in the lesson plan. One week, we watched a number of documentaries instead of reading political science articles, and it was a breath of fresh air. Including more multimedia would make this very good class a great class. Overall, I really enjoyed this course and it opened my eyes to theoretical understandings of refugeeness!",
    "It was a course that challenged the master narrative surrounding refugees, statelessness and displacement through refugee narratives, case studies and theoretical texts. I would highly recommend this course to anyone! This is a very unique course and I think anyone who is going into academia, politics, non-profit work or is merely thinking about the current refugee situations around the world needs to take it.",
    "This class offers a way to think about the power structures, implications, and importance of how refugees are represented and discussed. This class is important to think about the structures that create refugees and what prevents refugees from living fully complex lives. Would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who cares about immigration, refugees, and critical thinking.",
    "Take this class! It is interesting and fun and will challenge your notions about human rights and the nation state in a unique and interesting way.",
    "Potentially the best class I've taken at Yale. I loved this class. Where to start... the readings were amazing, a wonderful mix of challenge-levels. We processed the readings in class in an appropriate way, deepening our relationship to the material. Students got to know each other, which is rare and wonderful for a seminar. Discussion was balanced. The assignments asked us to confront our own assumptions and dive deep into the content. The class encouraged creativity, vulnerability, and exploration. It was an ideal learning environment to approach one of the most important contemporary issues. I am so, so grateful for this class."
