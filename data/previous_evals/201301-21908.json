   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a 'survey course' in French Lit. You go through all the main authors and important Literature and your french definitely improves in the process. Its great to practice your written french too.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. This course covers works of literature that everyone should read. Your written and spoken French will improve dramatically as well.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course (and Professor Pinzka!) to any student with an interest in French literature, without hesitation. I had always wanted to take a course inFrench lit, and this class absolutely exceeded all of my expectations. The course provided a fantastic overview of French literature from the medieval period to the present. We read texts written by some of the most famous French authors of the last several centuries and discussed them at a very high level, commensurate, I would say, with a course in English literature. Although we did not always read the authors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most famous texts, it was certainly enough to get a sense of their writing (plus, it would be impossible to read all of the most famous texts in their entirety due to their length). The amount of reading was no small feat but 100% worth it if you have an interest in French lit. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get discouraged if, at first, it seems like a lot: you will need to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and will \u00e2\u0080\u0093 learn to read French faster as the semester progresses. In addition to improving your ability to read and analyze French texts (and of course listening comprehension skills as sitting in any hour and fifteen minute class conducted in a foreign language will), the class also provided a terrific opportunity to practice both spoken and written French. Professor Pinzka did a wonderful job encouraging everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation, and speaking about French literature (as you would about English literature) really helps you improve your ability to converse in the language. The written assignments (three essays and a shorter individual response over the course of the semester) were also at a very high level and should again provide a fantastic opportunity to improve your facility of French writing given the need to communicate your literary analysis just as you would for a paper written in English. Although the course is conducted at approximately the same level as you would expect for a course in English literature, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that discourage you from taking it either! The experience is extremely rewarding and I would say the best introduction to French lit you could hope for. Professor Pinzka is moreover a really terrific instructor and person, and she makes the experience extremely pleasant and enjoyable for students. She is extremely kind and approachable, highly knowledgeable about the authors and texts, very thoughtful and constructive in her comments on written assignments, and always organized and prepared for class discussions. The class was an absolutely wonderful experience with a phenomenal instructor, and I am so glad that I had the opportunity to take it with her this term.",
    "This class offers a great overview of major French authors, poets, and playwrights. It also teaches you how to be a better writer and speaker. My French flourished under Professor Pinzka's guidance. Absolutely take this class!",
    "Yes definitely take this if you want a comprehensive survey of French literature. Just be warned, it's a lot work. Totally worth it though.",
    "A good overview of French lit, spanning a wide range of time and genre. Since much of it is based on class discussion, make sure you have a strong class that will participate well. Readings can be a little overwhelming at times, especially toward the end of the year, but you leave the class having a read a good survey of historically significant French literature."
