   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's harder than L1, but that's expected.",
    "Yes i would, but though it says that no knowledge of chinese characters is necessary, most people in the class already know some reading and writing. However, that does not mean it isn't possible if you truly are illiterate, only that it will require a fair amount of work.",
    "Absolutely recommended. This course is mandatory for those who took Chinese 112. Liu Laoshi is a phenomenal teacher; so accommodating and helpful. Work hard, and your Chinese will improve vastly.",
    "I would say to take Chinese but heed the warning that it is a tough language and Chinese department at Yale is very hard.",
    "Chinese 122 is a continuation of Chinese 112. Liu Laoshi is probably one of the friendliest professors that you'll ever encounter. For the heritage Chinese speaker, this class is definitely preferable to the regular track.",
    "Take the class! I actually made some really good friends in that class because of the small class atmosphere and just way everybody bonded as well as through the group projects.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student interested in Chinese. Although it is a lot of work, it is definitely a worthwhile class.",
    "If you took the first term of the heritage course this is the natural progression. It is a wonderful course that is both structured and interesting. The daily quizzes are a very effective motivation for you to learn the material and the homework complements what was taught in class very well. The teacher can only fittingly be described as a sweetheart. She cares for her students and is obviously excited by what she does. My Chinese improved so substantially after taking this course that I cannot but emphatically recommend it to everyone who has the sufficient background.",
    "Chinese 122 02 is a rigorous beginner level course for heritage mandarin speakers. It is a must-take for any heritage speaker that want to learn mandarin. The course requires little prerequisite knowledge, and promises dramatic improvement. Fast-paced, interesting, and foundational."
