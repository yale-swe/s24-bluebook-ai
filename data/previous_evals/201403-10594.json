   "comments": [
    "ANTH 500-01 is an introduction to all of the great monographs that every anthropologist should read before teaching Introduction to Anthropology to undergraduates. The material allows you to see the way the discipline has grown, thereby allowing you to see how current theoretical trends and current fieldwork methods have come into the discipline. The assignments give us the chance to scrutinize these theoretical frameworks and fieldwork methods. I recommend this class to any sociocultural anthropologist who plans to teach some day.",
    "This class is very useful for its intended audience (I'm sure others would like it too if they could take it). There is a lot to discuss with each book, too much for the length of time, but the instructor did a good job helping us talk about what we were interested in but also get some key points from our readings. The writing assignments throughout and the final assignment were a great learning process and a great way to organize the course!",
    "Great introduction to classic anthropology. Provided a good overview of the development of the monograph and fieldwork methods."

   "comments": [
    "I'm under the impression that the course significantly contributed to my disciplinary foundation, and that I will periodically allude to the monographs and anthropologists we explored throughout the course of my academic career.",
    "As mentioned above, this course provides with the tools to teach these classical monographs to undergraduates. The assignments have provided me a chance to scrutinize the ways anthropological fieldwork and ethnographic writing is carried out. I will take all of these lessons with me as I move forward with my own research.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of anthropology a lot! Was great and useful to be immersed in it! It also gave me a foundation in the history of my discipline, which will be very useful in my own research and professional work!",
    "This course was essential for a degree in anthropology. I really appreciated being able to spend a week (sometimes two!) on a text."
