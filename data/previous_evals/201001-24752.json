    "It was a fantastic course. The discussions were lively, the class trips to the art gallery and beinecke, etc were fun, and the readings helped me better understand the class topics. The reading is a little on the heavy side and there are weekly reading responses, but it was really worth it. The weekly discussions and readings are organized into clear themes.",
    "You should definitely take this class. Professor Bertucci is incredible. The topic is incredibly interesting... even if you are not a History of Science person, so many important implications for art, theater, and intellectual history in general. You will be constantly inspired and engaged by the high level of discussion in the classroom.Be aware that the amount of reading is significant, but doable. The writing assignments are not overwhelming, culminating with one ten-page research paper at the end: a pretty reasonable expectation for a writing-intensive class."
