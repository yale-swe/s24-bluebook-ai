    "It would be wonderful to have a full intensive course on timber modelling and finance. Although I understand there may not be enough interested students alone in this field. Two classes a week would be great to get into more detail.",
    "Deborah is an excellent lecturer, and so, wonderfully responsive to whether or not students grasp\/are engaged with the material she's covering. I wish all my instructors cared as much about students as she does.",
    "Deborah was a great instructor. Even though she was super busy and spread a bit thin, she tried her best to give us what time she had available. This type of competing priorities was super worth it to me to have the chance to learn from someone who is actively practicing in her field right now. Her competing responsibilities to her day job made her too busy for the class but also super interesting to learn from. Deborah is the first female teacher I've had at FES, and it was so wonderful to learn from her and witness her badass-ness.",
    "I loved the course. It was a subject I knew nothing about and didn't particularly care about but now as I am looking for summer internships I'm adding ecosystem finance to the list of possible careers. Deborah is an excellent professor."

    "I liked that the instructor had a lot of real-world experience, and a very applied and common-sense approach to the topic. She also has an excellent sense of humor.",

    "Lectures were engaging and assignments were well thought out.",
    "I like how the course is taught from a very practical perspective. Also Deborah makes it very interesting.",
    "This course provides a pretty broad overview of environmental and forest finance. Deborah is an expert, and has great examples and stories from the field. She also presents the information in a very approachable\/not overly technical way.",
    "One of the best aspects of this course is that it was taught by someone with real experience in forest and ecosystem investment. She was not simply going by a textbook, but giving us real world examples to work with and telling us how to interpret things in real life.",
    "Deborah is very clear in her explanations and she is very fun.",
    "Great content and introduction to environmental markets",

   "comments": [
    "Focusing the readings perhaps so that they are less but more focused. The quantity of readings sometimes led one to become overwhelmed by the content that was explained.",
    "Faster turnaround on assignment grades.",
    "1. This course has a potential to be one of the good courses in FES, and is currently suffering poorly from course design. 2. It would help to segregate course into three sections - finance basis, forestry basics, and forest finance. Finance basic could be a pre-req (ex 1\/2 semester Maureen Burke's class or full semester basics of finance in SOM). Forestry basics could be a 1 day 2 hour refresher or discussion done by TA or some other MF student who is good in forestry basics. 3. Forest finance should be a 1\/2 semester class, which would decrease the strain of traveling on Deborah, allow her to actually address her knowledge in a more organized manner, and keep students interest in class by matching the pace. 4. The assignments should be all group assignments instead of individual assignment. Ideally cases should be discussed or evaluated to replicate real life deal or work flow. 5. This course should really include some guest speakers ideally people who are investing in timberland or forests or agriculture or ecosystem finance. Firms like Encourage Capital or RMS Capital would be good starting point. 6. Forest finance should combine with Conservation Finance Network to do a Job or Networking Trek in Boston\/NYC and give student real life perspective. 7. Another good input would be to bring someone from broader financial industry along with experience in forest finance, who can actually entail difference, similarities, trends, and expectations from the forest finance industry. 8. The course has LOT of repetition and organization of course material is poorly at the moment. If we are talking about evaluation and challenges associated with it, lets do that only in that class. Lets talk about Risk in another one. Most of the lectures at the moments are huge mumble jumble of risk evaluation limitations forestry policy - which is often repeated 15 times over the semester. Referring to Daniel Gross's Energy Project Finance for structure might be a good idea. The drawback of lack of structure is that Deborah has lot of knowledge, experience, and insights to lend to the students, but it gets lost without a good structure. 9. It will be good to introduce students to a few simple sample Forest Finance models as well.",
    "Class timing",
    "Sometimes it was difficult to reach Deborah with questions about assignments\/requests for help.",
    "Scores on the homework assignments need to be returned quicker.",
    "If this course could meet earlier in the week or earlier in the day perhaps it would have fewer time conflicts.",
    "Tutor responsiveness to student questions.",
    "I wish there were make up classes for the ones that were cancelled. Also it is scheduled at the worst time. I had a hard time focusing.",
    "Assignments need to be returned sooner, we could use more practice (i.e., more frequent homework assignments), and the room needs to be changed. The timeslot is necessary given Deborah's work schedule, but the room needs better lighting to accommodate this timeslot. The lectures are fairly dry, and could be improved by shifting the focus to assignments and practice\/application (with timely feedback). I feel like this course could benefit from SOM's organization\/resources (more assignments, maybe meeting multiple times a week, and more TA's to accommodate more practice) and possibly team teaching to reduce the burden on Deborah.",
    "I feel that the ecosystem services topic was not deep enough. It would be good to have examples beyond mitigation banks. Carbon credits were covered with one example, but I expected more. In addition, it would be good to have more international examples (both for forest and ecosystem services).",
    "The class and the assignments were up to standard from my expectations."
