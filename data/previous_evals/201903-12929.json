    "I developed comprehensive knowledge and skills to engage in formal-theoretic IR research. Topically, this course covers most topics in IR and IS. Referee reports enabled me to critically analyze published and unpublished formal-theoretic texts, and this is something that is going to be very useful in my future career as an academic.",
    "I became familiarized with formal models in IR and learned how to engage, understand and critique formal models.",
    "I got a better sense of the important formal theory papers in international security. I built upon my game theory knowledge and had a chance to build my own model."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Among many others, the single most important strength of this course is Alex's willingness to go over the logics and implications of the readings one by one both in class and in his office hours. In preparing presentations and learning about the texts, this was very helpful. Alex already added relevant readings on alliance politics to the syllabus, so his next teaching could spend a week on it. But topically the course is already very comprehensive, and including\/excluding certain topics may depend on students' needs; and Alex frequently asked students for our opinions on the content, pace, and workload, over the course of the semester.",
    "This course is great in introducing students to leading research using formal models. I do think this course could work better with other formal courses that provide technical training. Oftentimes, the gap between student's technical understanding and the level of difficulty of the assigned reading is relatively big.",
    "I liked the syllabus\/course reading selections. I liked that the material was very focused on international security. I think the student presentations were helpful, especially given the class size. It worked well to have roughly one student presentation per week, so students could practice giving talks and engaging with tough material, but also without having the instructor's insights marginalized. In the course, we sometimes took a step back to review solution concepts and basic approaches. That was really helpful, and I think it could be done even a bit more frequently, though I realize that is not the core purpose of the class."

    "If he or she is in IR and\/or Formal Theory, I would definitely recommend this course. Even for non-IR students, this class could be an useful extension of PLSC 518. Introduction to Game Theory.",
    "I would recommend this to other students if they are up for a challenge and committed to formal model in IR.",
    "Absolutely. I got a lot out of it."
