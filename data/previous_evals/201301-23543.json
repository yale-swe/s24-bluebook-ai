    "I took this course as a special project with Ann and did not participate in the full classroom sessions because of a timing conflict with another course. Working with Ann was great and I learned a lot from the two projects I took on to fulfill the requirements of the course.",
    "I think a few more field trips into the field to try and identify some other health issues would be great. We did see the major ones though.",
    "This course is necessary because pests and pathogens and climate will affect every forest in the world!It is necessary to know what is healthy and what is causing a lack of health. However, this course did not really spend time teaching specifics about different pests\/pathogens... which I know would be difficult to do since there are so many and they differ by region, let alone country. To get past this, it was great to have individual presentations where the students could pick a topic that interested them specifically so that s\/he could learn more about their area of focus!",

I also liked getting to choose my own topic for the other two presentations, and getting to hear about many different areas\/health concerns since my peers got to choose topics that interested them but that I would not have spent time learning on my own!",

    "Course did not really become a discussion. One student would present material and peer students would not pay very close attention to what was being shared. As a result, I did not learn as much as I should have. I was not pushed hard enough in this course. Instructor should demand more from students.",
    "Maybe a little bit more on a healthy forest v unhealthy forest from a standpoint of stand dynamics and regeneration and age classes. Also deer herbivory would play into this as well.",
    "I would have preferred this course be more of an entomology course focused on identifying pests; maybe pathogens, too. I feel like I understand that there are pests, but I don't know anything deeper than that. The wide variety of topics made the course too broad, general, and conceptual. There could have been more case studies about individual pests and pathogens.",
