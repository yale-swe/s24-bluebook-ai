   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because I really got a solid foundation to becoming fluent and renewed my love of the language.",
    "A fine course. If you took L2 already, it's essentially a review of L2 with some new vocab and grammar content. Well taught. And Profesora Reymundi truly cares and is good even for people who don't speak Spanish that well, like me.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to a fellow Yale student. Coming out of four years of Spanish in high school, this class provided a smooth and enjoyable transition into college Spanish, both reviewing things I had learned in the past and pushing me.",
    "It's a typical spansih class!",
    "SPAN 130 furthers Spanish language and comprehension skills. I would recommend this class to other Yale students if they are interested in learning Spanish and having a little bit of fun.",
    "A formulaic but rigorous introduction to functional Spanish. Take it so that you might move on to more interesting and engaging classes.",
    "The class is good for learning grammar, some vocabulary, and for improving reading and writing abilities. The course lacks a conversational focus, however. I would recommend the class to other students, with this caveat."
