   "comments": [
    "You have to have a research project in mind before taking this class. You will learn how to writ an NIH proposal. This class would take a lot of time, but worth it.",
    "This class gives an introduction to the NIH grant application process and asks students to write a grant. The major strengths for me were the structure (deadlines made me get words on paper) and individual sessions with Dr. Ma to go over comments and overall strategy. The class itself was a weakness. Much of the lectures were not very helpful, as they gave the same information as the NIH website. Another problem was that the students were at very different levels in planning their grants--with some real, in-progress work and others made up for the class--which left a gulf between the types of feedback that would be useful to each group. A version of this class specific to each of APMPH and PhD students would be much more helpful for everyone. A specific recommendation would be to do some reviewing at the beginning of the class, so we know what reviewers are looking for and can write our grants around that, instead of becoming familiar on the review criteria at the end. Strategy and practice with other parts of the grant, like human subjects and biosketches, would also be helpful.",
    "great course if u want to learn how to write grant proposals",
    "My overall assessment of this course is excellent. I liked the peer review and feedback activity.",
    "At the beginning of the semester I was in doubt if I should take this course, and I'm so happy I did. This is not an easy course; it requires a lot of time, but it's definitely a worthwhile investment. Dr. Ma was extremely helpful, and I was impressed with the amount of time and attention she dedicated to giving us feedback on assignments.",
    "More practice discussion sessions and presentations, and less lectures will be more beneficial for students.",
    "Strength: ability to work on our own design, NIH mock reviews, well planned out schedule of semester Weakness: dull lectures, not sure if this should be a mandatory class",
    "this class should not be one of only two courses available to fulfill the capstone requirement, especially because the other is often offered at a time that conflicts with multiple other classes",
    "Great and informative",
    "Strengths: - useful course for anyone who wants to apply for NIH grants\/ learn how to write grant proposals",
    "This course was incredibly informative and provided me with the guidance I needed to help write my own grant and prepare to write other types of grants in the future. The introductions\/explanations of each section prior to writing each section was very helpful, as was the feedback we received after the fact. It was a lot of work, but in that regard it helped give an accurate reflection of what writing a grant actually is like. I think that is a great class for students who have the time to put in the work.",
    "Strengths: The course is really thorough, well organized, well taught and a true capstone course. You will be pushed to do your very best. Weakness:It was at the end of the course after the critique by fellow students and seeing other's proposal that I think I finally got the big picture and came into my own. Bummer! 'cause the final resubmitted proposal is 20 0r 25 marks? I wish she'd give more weight in marks to the resubmitted proposal.",
    "Totally worthwhile. Makes adequate use of once-a-week schedule and genuinely applicable to the needs and experience of aspiring researchers. Through no fault of the instructor or design awareness of the ever changing requirements of different proposal types was a substantial challenge. Limited to the NIH proposal mechanism; NIH a reputable but admittedly competitive and increasingly resource-scarce funding body.",
    "I think this is an important course for Yale\/YSPH to offer. My primary concern with the course is that it addressed the superficial parts of grantwriting, i.e. drafting a proposal and what elements it entais-- this is the part that we can learn about more easily and for which many resources are available. More useful would have been to greatly extend the instruction about peer review, resubmissions, etc. This is the part that's less familiar to us, and it would have been very helpful to read through and discuss more examples of original proposals, their reviews, and resubmissions addressing the reviews (failures as well as successes). I know this is a difficult thing to implement because the grants are confidential, however maybe some faculty could contribute theirs.",
    "The course teaches the NIH proposal writing methodology and fund-granting process. This is a useful skill to have as a researcher.",
    "Course content and assignments lead to the development of a substantial piece of work."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is an excellent instructor. She is really organized and would give concrete advise.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Great. As mentioned above, the lectures weren't always very helpful, but Dr. Ma was awesome to work with. Very helpful and understanding. My meetings with her helped me immensely.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Gives constructive feedback, good for proposal",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0See above.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is an excellent professor. She dominates the topic and is able to transfer her experience and knowledge to the students in a very clear way. She is very passionate with teaching and caring for students' understanding.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Strength: very thorough, wants students to learn, fast responses on emails and office hours Weakness: does not give much advice on how to have better study designs",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0means well and very approachable but lectures were very dry... but, the material is dry, so can't blame her",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Great mentor",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Strengths: - having been on the review committee herself, Dr. Ma knows the process of applying for NIH grants very well and had helpful tips for how to make our applications more attractive",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0The professor was very experienced and knowledgeable, and a great teacher for this topic. She used her real life experience to guide our education, but also successfully balanced the harsh aspects of grant-writing with constructive, supportive criticism. She was also happy to help students whenever they sought advice, and happy to work with students's schedules and personal demands to make it possible for them to get the most possible out of the class. Most importantly, it was clear that she wanted to invest in our education and in better preparing us for our future careers, and this made me want to do my best in the class.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr Ma is excellent and spared nothing to give us the best. She was also very accessible and would see you outside of office hours. Her feedback were thorough, objective and intense. She is very detailed oriented and will correct your grammar, tenses, apostrophe.......(you get the drift), I absolutely loved it. This is one professor who worked harder than her students, I had to sit up and bring more to the table just to keep up with her.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Excellent. Inviting. Patient. Supportive. Knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Very accessible and knowledgable and available to students. Incredibly devoted to the course and provided excellent feedback to the students-- above and beyond what would be expected.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0The professor is eminently qualified to teach this course given her many years of experience as a NIH reviewer. However, the professor appears biased against non-PhD students taking the course. She believes they are working on \"fake\" research proposals and are probably \"time-wasters.\" When one considers the amount of time this professor invests in the course, you may find the time-wasting idea plausible. But, it isn't, for at least two reasons: first, this course is not a course eligible to only PhD students; second, it is for the purpose of learning and whether a MSc student has a \"real\" project for which to develop a proposal or not should be immaterial.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Knowledgeable instructor with real-life experience as a grant reviewer."

    "It's a good structured environment in which to practice writing a grant. You can get good feedback on both the science and the writing\/strategy aspects. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course based on the fellow student's workload. In general,if she\/he is taking other heavy courses, I would not recommend this course at all.",
    "Very useful course for students planning to apply for a research grant or preparing their research prospectus, especially for second year PhD students, and other students interested in these activities or looking for a capstone course.",
    "Dull course with a lot of work, good product can come out of it, good to take if planning to do research",
    "I would recommend it to another student, especially PhD student.",
    "I would definitely recommend, for the reasons stated above, but I would just warn them about the time commitment to make sure they would not get overwhelmed.",
    "I would recommend it only if you a hard worker, though if you're not a hard worker but willing to learn and expand, then this course is for you. cuz after all is said and done, if you can't write a convincing proposal to fund your research, then all the research skills you learnt is a waste, or wouldn't you want to be a principal investigator?",
    "Totally worthwhile.Few courses are as genuinely and directly applicable to the needs and experience of aspiring scientists who require funding to do research.",
    "The course teaches the rigorous methodology of NIH proposal development and the NIH grant writing process",
    "Great course for NIH grant preparation."
