    "This is a great class to read some of the formative texts of international relations - from Thucydides to Mearsheimer. However, it is not the most exciting seminar, so if you're not interested in the subject, you shouldn't take it. But if questions of foreign affairs fascinate you, this is a great class.",
    "Yes, its a great seminar for those wanting a historical foundation for further studying IR.",
    "Yes. Good books. Great professor.",
    "I read a lot of books that I am glad to have read. Class could be a bit boring. Professor Russett is clearly an expert in the field, and it was interesting at times to hear him talk about things about which he is very knowledgeable, but he is not exactly the most dynamic of instructors. I did not at all feel a personal connection with him throughout the course. Interesting subject matter. Good class, but not as great as I had hoped.",
    "Classics in International Relations is an amazing courses that teaches you the history about how political theories have changed over the past centuries. It was a great intro into political theory that allowed us to apply what political thinkers thought to today's real world dilemmas. The course encourages you to make insightful commentary on the material in class so best be prepared."
