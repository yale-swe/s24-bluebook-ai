    "The trip, obviously. But also the fact that the end product is designed to be a publishable paper.",
    "The trip to Brazil.",
    "Field work, incredible planning and organization in Brazil by Jeff, allowed us to accomplish many research objectives in a week. Mark was incredibly generous and supportive through the entire process, although much of the work we had to do even fell outside of his purview. The best part were the two weeks we spent in Brazil seeing a beautiful place, meeting amazing people, and seeing a real, potent conservation issue on the ground. No better way of learning, and it was incredibly eye-opening and humbling learning from some amazing classmates.Mark also structures the class well, forcing us to do a lot of preliminary background work, leading up to the trip, and then keeps us on task for the writing and analysis part. Somehow it works!",

   "comments": [
    "Mark needs to have an outline for the semester at the beginning of the class, with firm details and all. He should assign the different subjects for the pre-trip booklet on the first or second week of class and have people start putting that book together in the first three weeks of class. And have people build a lit review for their subject with an annotated bibliography in advance of the course. As for how it ran down in Brazil, I have few changes to suggest. It was helpful when Mark suggested we break into smaller groups--I think sometimes we didn't know what the process was and take enough agency to do that ourselves (like at the IFV nursery), but I appreciated when Mark split the group up--we learned much more in small groups. I'd also suggest limiting future trips to people speaking the language. I think you'll get a better work product.",
    "Have a project with more focused objectives going in, and a client who is more specific and organized about what they want. We were definitely grasping at air for much of the time trying to figure out what would the best way to focus our efforts.",

    "Excellent: Jeff Stoike was amazing. Mark was busy this semester so not as engaged as he might be, but the reality is he has an open door policy, so if you seek him out, he's always available. My classmates tended not to, though, and didn't get quite enough coaching in the class at times; still, I blame them for not actively seeking out the support they wanted.",
    "Excellent availability, although brief meetings at times. Of course in Brazil, both Mark and Jeff were available 100% to support our work and offer advice, I can't suggest any improvements.Also, even though Jeff was in Brazil most of the time, he did a great job of supporting us and providing us information and contacts throughout the semester.",

I didn't feel quite as prepared as I would have liked before we left, and I think if Mark had jump-started the process with us building our pre-trip book and doing presentations in January, then moving to building our questions\/target interviewee list, etc. in Feb., we would all have frontloaded some more work and have a bit more of a lit review under our belts before the trip.",
    "To learn from Mark, and to go to Brazil.",
    "Wanted to see a beautiful place, work on real research toward a publishable paper (which we'll be working on for a while), learn a bit more Portuguese, and just have a very memorable and valuable experience that you can only get from FES.",
    "highly recomended. intresting subject material and location of study.",
