   "comments": [
    "This was a wonderful class. Professor Grimstad is amazing, and the reading list is interesting and engaging. All the work is the 20 page paper at the end.",
    "Take. This. Class. Absolutely Amazing. Paul Grimstad is a great teacher and the source material is guaranteed to be interesting (it is Poe, after all). The professor's enthusiasm for the material is infectious and because the grade is based partially on participation, everyone contributes and the discussions are fantastic. This course does not have tons of work outside of reading and one long paper due at the end of the semester. Of course, your grade rests heavily on the paper.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take this course if you want to learn A LOT about Poe. Seriously, it was a wonderful seminar, and we touched on so many more topics than I expected. Prof Grimstad is awesome.",
    "yes - great author and great professor",
    "I probably wouldn't take it again.",
    "This class is what it says it is - an overview of Poe. The reading load is light but class discussion is not always that focused because of Professor Grimstad's many digressions (which are admittedly often interesting but often extremely tangential to Poe). Grimstad will support you in writing whatever you want, and if you're into Poe this class is a great way to read a lot of his works and write about them.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this to another student. This class was outstanding beyond words. Seriously, take it. The Poe is thrilling and Professor Grimstad is the man. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale by far.",
    "ABSOLUTELY YES YES YES. The material is wonderful and Prof. Grimstad is a phenomenal professor -- you'll both really feel like you understand Poe the man and his work and a lot about how literature is studied and analyzed after being in these discussions (because Poe is fairly widely used as a base for 20th century literary interpretation and he's responsible for inventing both the detective story and sci fi). They were always among the best part of my day on Tuesdays and Thursdays",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. I really came to see Poe as one of the greatest writers and minds I've ever studied. The reading list is awesome, and Professor Grimstad is exceptionally smart, very nice and funny, and knows Poe backwards and forwards. The problem is that he tends to let the class get way off topic for periods in which just one or two people wax poetic about some unrelated philosophical work or idea, and so I was sometimes disappointed that we didn't pay enough attention to the wonderful works themselves.",
    "Great reading, not too much work, enticing classroom discussion. Take this course."
