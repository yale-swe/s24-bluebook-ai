   "comments": [
    "Ted taught me to appreciate and love photography as an art so grateful for this experience!",
    "How to use an SLR camera and think critically about the process of taking and editing pictures. How to better appreciate photography and understand what makes a good photograph.",
    "Ted's class was awesome because it was the perfect balance between developing technical aspects of photography, and engaging with great photographers in learning to develop our own personal styles. Ted was an inspiring guide, and his own passion for photography came through in every discussion, crit, and field trip.",
    "This course was incredible. I came in as a completely untrained photographer, and come away with the confidence that I can both better understand and appreciate photographs that I look at, and take meaningful photographs myself. The class was definitely more focused on creating art through photographs rather than analyzing photographs that we see, however in Ted's comments on photographs that we looked at as a class, I really came to recognize a powerful photograph. I had come in with the impression that a good photograph was one that looked superficially pretty, and required a identifiable object of focus, and conveyed a clear message. I now can better understand that photos can be much more complex than such superficial messages - that photographs, especially when looked at as a part of a collection as we did in final projects - can beautifully express more deep and genuine sentiments about both the subject and the artist. Likewise, I also developed my own skills as a photographer, both in such technical things as exposing and editing photos in Photoshop, as well as finding more interesting and novel things to take photographs of.",
    "Was new to photography so learned everything from how the basics of using a digital camera to how to use photoshop.",
    "I developed the ability to look critically at photos taken digitally and extract some meaning from them. I also developed a more critical eye for more technical aspects of a photo like framing and depth of view."

   "comments": [
    "An incredible course to be honest, not much I would change about it. Maybe focus a little more on technical training, but otherwise fantastic.",
    "Lots of flexibility, so you can focus on what you find interesting. Ted is super chill and a really awesome professor. Really cares about your work and pushes you to become a better photographer over the course of the semester.",
    "The only thing I would like to improve upon is the tangibility of the technical skills we acquired. We learned almost all of photoshop and all of our camera's functions in a matter of weeks, but it would have been nice to revert back to physical instructions (especially for photoshop) to continue to grow in our skills as we moved through the semester.",
    "One weakness that I might suggest would be that in the first few weeks, Ted could consider giving more structured assignments on our photo making with specific exercises in framing, exposing, etc. that would help to nail down the technical skills of taking a good photograph.",
    "I thought this course was well conceived and well taught - no further improvement reqd.",
    "The course might be improved by having a few more directed prompts for shooting."

    "Absolutely - Ted is the man.",
    "YES! Lots of flexibility, so you can focus on what you find interesting. Ted is super chill and a really awesome professor. Really cares about your work and pushes you to become a better photographer over the course of the semester.",
    "Absolutely! If you are going to take digital photo, take it with Ted!",
    "Yes, especially if they want to take a photography course that is not as time-consuming as black-and-white (though the course is still time consuming).",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to other Yale students. Students should go in understanding that there is a fair amount of gruntwork required in shooting hundreds of photos every week to make a good contact sheet, in editing photos in Photoshop (a time consuming process) and in printing for critiques. Some of the time spent in producing good prints is not super exciting. However, the critiques are so incredible and rewarding, and the time in class with Ted talking about photos is so illuminating that the gruntwork is amply rewarded.",
    "This is a great photography course for beginners. In addition to the skills you learn, you also get to engage with photography as a medium of art (in class discussion, photography books, museum visits etc), which I found to be a wonderful and stimulating experience. Would highly recommend this course to anyone with a budding interest in photography.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are self motivated and excited about developing your eye for photography."
