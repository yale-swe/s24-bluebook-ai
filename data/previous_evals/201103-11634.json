    "This is not a course that can be recommended. You probably need to take it if you are. You can take it earlier up to 4 times if you want. It is a good way to get credit for research you are doing anyway. However, you don't have to if you don't want to. It also depends on what sort of relationship you have with your PI and your labmates.",
    "Take Chem 490! Make sure you spend a summer in your lab before you start though- it's much easier to learn the ropes working>40 hours a week instead of>10 hours\/week. If you can find room to take is as a junior, it's really low-stress because you don't have to present or write a paper.",
    "It's just research. Your PI and project will determine how much work you do per week in lab.",
    "Your experience in Chem 490 depends entirely on what lab you work in. The course requires you to work in lab a minimum of 10 hours, but some profs might require more.",
    "Research for Credit. Find a lab, work for at least 10 hours a week, and that's it.Of course, if you're any good, you will work more hours than that, and research will become a central tenet of your Yale life. Ideally, you're working towards some form of publication, a good goal to have both for yourself, your future, and the future of the lab and the students - and you will come to care for both.The actual work will of course vary by professor, and supervising graduate students and post-docs. Have fun!",
    "It's fun if you like research.",
    "It's a requirement and even though it's time consuming, you can learn a lot. Choose your lab carefully.",
    "Exactly what it sounds like- working in a lab! Each lab is different and no two students have the same experience, so really have a conversation with the PI\/grad student mentor to have an idea about what your semester would look like."
