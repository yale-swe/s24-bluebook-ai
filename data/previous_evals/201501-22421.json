   "comments": [
    "This course is ok depending on who you are. You will read dead white men for most of it and a random woman (or is she a woman?) thrown at the end. It's basically a social theory cannon thingy. You don't learn about literature, which is not really a big deal since literature doesn't exist anyway. If you are a literature major and have to take this class, then I wouldn't recommend it. If you are a person interested in social theory and don't have to take this class, I recommend you take a class with professor Narges Erami (anthropology), one of the most admirable and intelligent people in this university.",
    "For better or for worse, this is not really what you would think of as \"Lit Theory 101.\" Instead of going over basic concepts or terms, the class delves into a study of not necessarily canonical works but ones from some prominent theorists linked by certain concerns about Literature. The texts can be frustrating at times, but the insights that can be gained are legitimate.",
    "This is a requirement for the literature major but I would recommend to other majors who are interested in literary theory and important thinkers such as Barthes, Derrida, Foucault. The course even covered Freud's Interpretation of Dreams and Judith Butler's Gender Troubles, which made the scope of the class seem more wide than just literary theory. The class had three quizzes and two paper which felt like a good balance of keeping up with reading and doing closer analysis of a few works.",
    "In Lit 300 you will study the major works of literary theory by such authors as Freud, Barthes, De Man, Derrida, Foucault, and Butler. Every week's reading is incredibly interesting and worthwhile. Although the reading is dense, Professor Jacob's lectures are helpful and insightful; she will guide you through these texts! I would highly recommend taking this course, especially if you are any type of Humanities of Social Science major.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't feel really motivated to read the people on the syllabus, and don't take it if you are already taking a lot of classes. I feel like I would have gotten the most out of the class if I had taken it during a semester when I had a light workload, because then I really could have spent time parsing the readings. As is, I feel like I blew it because there was so little accountability in the class that I didn't do a lot of the readings, not because I didn't want to, but because I didn't have time. It's a great class, though, and I really wish I had had the time to take it properly.",
    "I would not recommend this course, or the literature department itself. It is \"Political Leftism\" under the guise of a discipline about literature.",
    "ENGL 300 provides an introduction to major western literary theorists. Professor Jacobs not only helps you understand the argument of each theorist, but also provides a model for how to critique these theoristshow to reach their texts as literature. I highly recommend this course for anyone majoring in the humanitiesparticularly in Literature or English. It will not only introduce you to important thinkers\/critics, but expand your own way of thinking about reading, writing, and literature. It will force you to think about the big questions that underlie the work you do as a student in the humanities and will enable you to engage with the texts you use in your study more self-consciously and more critically. Professor Jacobs is an incredibly thoughtful and clear lecturer and I highly recommend going to meet with her individually!",
    "Solid class with quality lectures. The reading list is amazing so you should take it as long as you have the slightest interest in theory, whether you are a lit major or not. I learned so much not only about language but the way we approach knowledge and knowing in general. Don't get intimidated by the amount of Freud reading at the beginning. Reading gets shorter but also denser. Spend time with them if you can - you get more out of it if you do. Lectures make things pretty clear, so don't worry if you get lost. Lots of freedom with the paper. You can basically write about whatever you want.",
    "Take it because you need to for the Lit major. Very complex material, very interesting, but sometimes the point of the class and the lectures seemed unclear.",
    "I would certainly recommend LITR 300 to another student. The course will change the way in which one engages with the world, since nearly all interactions and comprehensions function through the recognition of some sort of representation or resemblance.",
    "If you are considering this course from the perspective of a prospective LIT major: be excited, it's a good one. But if you're not I would say still give a shot. I would recommend just take a look at the syllabus and go with your instinct. If these (Butler, Freud, Derrida etc.) are people you're at all curious to play with a little, do it.",
    "Do NOT take unless you have to. The end.",
    "This is a good class with a great list of readings.",
    "LITR 300 is a fantastic class that can totally alter the way you read and the way you think about literature. I would strongly recommend to anyone who's interesting in engaging in critical analysis of literary texts. It's eye-opening and unlike any other class I've taken at Yale. I wish there were more classes like it."
