    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in obtaining a good introduction to some of the major poetic works of the medieval period in Spain. The diversity of works studied both provides topics of interest for everyone and allows one to consider the theoretical challenges of assessing the works of the mester de clereca beyond their use of a common poetic form.",
    "SPAN 503 is an outstanding course for gaining a basic understanding of Christian Spain during the 12th to 14th centuries. It's also a great opportunity to read and discuss some important Spanish medieval texts, such as MILAGROS DE NUESTRA SEORA, POEMA DE SANTA ORIA, LIBRO DE ALEXANDRE, LIBRO DE APOLONIO, POEMA DE FERNN GONZLEZ and LIBRO RIMADO DE PALACIO."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to further my knowledge of the mester de clereca poets of the 13th\/14th centuries as well as their relation to writers of other genres in the medieval period. Though not directly related to my research interests, this course has allowed me to integrate medieval poetic works into my overall vision of Hispanic literature and will allow me to assess the way in which the medieval heritage has been invoked and transformed in other literary works.",
    "Yes, this course certainly deepened my knowledge of medieval Spanish literature. This will definitely help me in my future research."
