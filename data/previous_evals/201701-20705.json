    "Getting acquainted with a specific literature on the philosophy of history and the major players in the same thematic conversations.",
    "I learned a ton of new philosophical ideas and authors I had not read.",
    "This class is historicity. A whirlwind of 20th century Central European philosophers teaching us that philosophy and history are connected and must be studied in tandem. We also spent a lot of time discussing the present political moment (e.g. Trump), in light of philosophical texts.",
    "This class gave me a wonderful introduction to the intellectual history of Eastern Europe in the twentieth century. I particularly enjoyed learning about the influence of Hegel and Heidegger on various thinkers.",
    "A sense of European History and how it guides the way we think>",
    "Insights into ways that Eastern European thinkers thought about the relationship of the individual to History."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Not sure if Hegel, Marx, and Freud were necessary to begin the course. It felt like we would've benefitted from two weeks on Heidegger, as we did two weeks on Patocka & Heller.",
    "The course is structured wonderfully. The weekly student presentations and lively discussion keep everyone involved. The readings are meticulously picked by Professor Shore and it is clear she has read every word of them several times. The final paper is entirely open ended which allows you to work on whatever you find most interesting.",
    "Class never felt scripted - discussion was always spontaneous and authentic. I appreciated that Professor Shore curated the syllabus in a way that allowed us to draw connections between past and present. The texts we read are important (though some are at first hard to understand but Professor Shore always guided us through the difficult spots). Now is the time to be taking a class like this. One question I was left with after the semester's conclusion was: What was the overarching thesis of this class? We read material ranging from Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit to Jan Gross's Neighbors, and although we explored a number of themes otherness, conspiracy theory, intimacy I am not entirely sure what the connecting thread was. The class was thoroughly worthwhile anyway!",
    "Way too much talk about things that were tangential to the class.",
    "This class does a good job at introducing students to Eastern European philosophers and writers they wouldn't normally encounter in philosophy classes at Yale. It definitely requires a good amount of background in 19th century philosophy, and exposure to the continental tradition (especially existentialism) helps tremendously.",
    "This is an excellent course, it seems a little abstract in order though. If the chronological or thematic organization was more clear it would help make the course a more cohesive whole.",
    "Strengths: I thought the readings were very well selected, the professor knows a ton about the subjects, the weekly writing assignments were good at making one think about the material without being too big a burden Weaknesses: Sometimes I felt the discussion wasn't guided to the most interesting parts of the readings"

    "Interesting seminar with a focus on philosophies of history in the 20th century responding to totalitarianism and fascism. When I took this course in Spring 2017, there were also a number of works of literature that made the class even more engaging. It will help to have at least a historical background or interest in this region for your academic projects. I would not take this course if you do not already have coursework in philosophy or 20th century eastern european history.The reading load is very reasonable-- not less nor more than your average Yale seminar.",
    "Absolutely this is an incredibly unique and novel course.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Professor Shore is incredibly knowledgeable and passionately engages with the course material. Do not miss the opportunity to study these texts under the guidance of Professor Shore.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in reading Eastern European philosophy in a seminar style. Really, it's a great course for anyone interested in the continental tradition of philosophy. It may not be the best for students who have no background in the subject matter.",
    "Absolutely, this course was phenomenal.",
    "Great class, consistently interesting seminar discussions.",
    "I took this course because I absolutely loved Marci Shore's lecture course. I've enjoyed this seminar, but definitely not as much as the lecture course. If you find the syllabus interesting, then I recommend the course. I thought the readings were very well selected and the professor knows a ton about the material. However, I thought the class discussion was sometimes lacking -- I found that the Professor guided the discussion to what she finds most important, which is often a good thing, but sometimes that didn't line up with what the students were most interested in discussing. Also, fyi this is the kind of course where you don't really know how you're doing in it over the course of the semester."
