    "too many materials covered in this half semester class and it is hard for students who does not have previous advanced knowledge of epidemiology study to follow and catch up.",
    "Very informative class, but the homework assignments were a lot of work and the final exam although seemingly straightforward was not so clear.",
    "This course teaches important analytical methods using in epidemiological studies. The topics are important. But lots of them are covered by other classes here.I've heard that Maria plans to drop this course and extend survival analysis to the whole semester. I think that's a good idea.",
    "The course provides necessary and useful skills. The only weakness is that the course only lasts for half of a semester, so we are unable to learn some in-depth topics.",
    "Excellent course, really provided depth to my understanding of when to use different analyses",
    "Strengths: very kind instructor, excellent slidesWeaknesses: it took hours to complete the homework and the homework was too detail oriented and involved too many calculations",
    "Excellent course for each biostat student. It details all important epidemiological concepts (although I find it repetitive, since I learned this from other epi courses), and biostats concepts...her lecture notes are the best and surprisingly flawless. I am sure she puts hours and hours into this course. her notes are the best in the field...Although this was a half sem course, I learned so much more from this course than from other \"key\" biostat courses like \"categorical\"",
    "I did not like this course, it was very repetitive and between intro epi and categorical data analysis there was not much new material",
    "Well taught, very clear, and slides were extremely well organized and detailed.",
    "Excellent summary of biostatistics for epidemiology with comprehensive notes. Strengths include the detailed lessons and useful assignments. Weaknesses include the final assessment, which included limited time to answer the given questions.",
    "Very good and detailed lecture notes, lecture a little rushed",
    "Fantastic course! Filled in a lot of the gaps from the Fall course in Categorical Data Analysis.",
    "This is a very good course. Its main strengths are that it integrates basic epidemiology concepts with several useful statistical tests, and that the lecture notes are regularly very good for the homeworks and studying for exams.",
    "very nice job, super applied",
    "good. but if the instructor stops reading the lecture notes, the it could be better.",
    "Wonderful! Wish I had her earlier!",
    "a lot of redundant materials for biostat students",
    "Excellent.",
    "Course Materials (PPT slides etc) and lectures are really good for understanding.",
    "Good overall. Very useful and clear materials.",
    "Great course, learned a lot and found the material interesting",
    "strengths: incredibly well taught and essential course for public health professionals and epidemiologists alike; homework with SAS problemsweaknesses: should potentially be a longer course"
