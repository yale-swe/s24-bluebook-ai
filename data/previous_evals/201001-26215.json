   "comments": [
    "Good course. This class is a good compliment to Epi 1 and 2 and goes more into depth on Epi measurement issues than any other class. Some of the guest lecturers were not very good and the primary professor tended to go off topic during class.",
    "strengths - learn important concepts about measurement issues",
    "Wonderful and interesting course! Very applicable content, especially for conducting our own studies and life after YSPH. I really liked the use of guest speakers and the presentations at the end!",
    "this was a good course, in general. i think we could have gone more in depth in a lot of the measurement issues but the course provided a good overview of important things to consider when designing and evaluating epidemiological studies",
    "good class - covers important aspects of epidemiology",
    "great class.",
    "No strengths. The same issues are sung over and over again. Makes the class uninteresting and difficult to go to class.",
    "This was a great, multifaceted, experts forum of an epi-measurements class -- availing the students to some of the best that the Yale medical-research community has to offer in terms of epi measurements (eg, Dr Mayne, Dr Irwin, Dr Rothberg-Gould, Dr Illuzzi, Dr Lewis, Dr White, and Dr Ma).It really complemented the other coursework that many CDE first-years are taking or have taken, namely Epi II, Cancer Epi, and Psychosocial Epi.",
    "The course covered many important measurement issues of common exposures, confounders, and outcomes that we are likely to encounter, and gave us experience in assessing the quality of measurement of these factors when reading published studies.",
    "This course is very basic and should be required for first year Masters students. By the 2nd year, 95% of this course's content has been covered in other classes in EPH.",
    "I think the midterm and final are helpful, but the homework assignments did not especially provide an added benefit. I also really enjoyed the group project, but I would extend the page limit to allow more discussion about measurement issues with the confounders and disease.",
    "This class was very repetitive of what we learned in Epi I and Epi II, and most epi classes at YSPH. I don't believe that this course needs to be a course on its own but perhaps embedded into another course or taken as a half semester course.",
    "useful but dry.",
    "It was a requirement ;(",
    "I think this should course should be taken as a culmination of the 2 year MPH experience (encourage students to take this as a second year) - this way, student will have already had the chance to become better at epi methods and can concentrate on the more difficult aspects of measurement. My suggestion is to make this a 1\/2 semester, 2nd year course that is more concentrated and can be more challenging.",
    "The course was great; one of my favorites this semester. I think it was partially because of Prof. Ma though--she really cares about her students and is not afraid to be frank with us.",
    "This is an excellent course, and one that is a complement to Epidemiology I and II. The course covers measurement issues related to a range of health-related variables and is challenging and interesting in that it focuses on critical thinking and analysis. The course is well organized and makes good use of several guest lecturers.",
    "The class teaches students how to criticize the methodology of studies so as to encourage higher-quality in academic epidemiology. I think it teaches this sufficiently, though is slightly repetitive in its discussion of themes. Other than that, I gained a lot from the course.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it gives you the ability to rigorously critique an epidemiological study. Dr. Ma gives you the framework to analyze how measurement occurs, and what biases may be inherent to different techniques. I enjoyed the lectures and found Dr. Ma to be an excellent professor. The one weakness I found in this course, however, is that there just didn't seem to be enough material to fill an entire semester. By the end of the term, this course felt very repetitive.",
    "This is an excellent overview course about the potential issues in measurement that can arise in chronic disease epidemiology. It provides a broad survey of various exposures (and some outcomes), providing insight into the reasons for various measurement issues and how to avoid them (or at least, take them into account). Dr. Ma does an excellent job of combining her own lectures with a sprinkling of other experts to provide a balanced and well taught course.",
    "GOOD",
    "This course is intersteing and helpful"

She doesn't avoid complexity, and she is brilliant and humble enough to welcome divergent opinions for the greater good in learning and research.Hers was a great, multifaceted, experts forum of a measurement class.Bravo!",

    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma definitely seems to care about students, and provides helpful and encouraging feedback. I think she also brought some relevant life experiences into the course instruction, making the class a bit more interesting and relevant.

    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Prof. Ma did a fabulous job with the lectures and guests that came to speak with us. She was really flexible even during class time to answer our questions and was very frank with us. I liked that the class was very open. I actually really enjoyed the presentations from the students as well--I am under the assumption that some of those are their actual research projects (really exciting to see all that going on with fellow students behind the scenes!). It really brings together how we can apply what we learn in the classroom to applications out, and that's always important.Prof. Ma to be an extremely good\/understanding\/yet still solid instructor. Most students I talked to really liked\/respect\/admire her and her work, and I think that builds an atmosphere where it is really conducive to learning.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0I found Dr. Ma to be a wonderful instructor who was willing to share her own thoughts and feelings about any areas pertaining to conducting epidemiological research without telling students how they should think about certain issues which was refreshing. I also appreciated that she took class time to go over the main take home points from assignments so that students could walk away with these messages and make connections to epidemiology and biostatistics even if they had not picked up on them the first time through.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Professor Ma is a clear and interesting lecturer who is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter. I appreciated that she added personal anecdotes to her lectures and took an interest in the students.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is a very good lecturer, and manages to make a sometimes less-than-interesting topic a highly-relevant one. Her lectures were well-organized, and her guest lectures were often very enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Excellent. Very knowledgeable, kind, approachable, and funny! A dedicated and patient teacher.",
    "Instructor: Xiaomei Ma \u00a0Dr. Ma is a skilled instructor and always made herself available to her students. She also made us feel like her colleagues, which was much appreciated!",

    "This course is very basic measurement issues. It is a broad overview but inappropriate and redundant for 2nd year students.",

Most students I talked to really liked\/respect\/admire her and her work.",

    "This class will give you a solid background in critiquing epidemiological studies. I feel like I had some ability to critique papers beforehand, but this course provided a solid framework to use in the future. Dr. Ma is an excellent teacher, though individual lectures can sometimes feel dry and repetitive. Much of what you learn is covered in other courses, so the main strength is learning how to apply it towards your critiques. I recommend the course, but don't expect it to be more than it is.",
