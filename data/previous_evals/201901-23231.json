    "I learned intermediate spanish including vocabulary and grammar. Also learned how to develop our reading comprehension through short stories and novels in Spanish and our listening comprehension through short videos and audio.",
    "Review of grammar learned in Spanish 120, coupled with a new lessons. A lot more emphasis on critical interpretive work on short stories and films.",
    "Learned more spanish, speaking reading and listening, and more about the cultures of spanish speaking countries",
    "My spanish improved greatly. I learned a lot of new vocabulary, grammar, etc. but the best part was that my confidence in speaking conversationally grew sooooo much!",

   "comments": [
    "The small class sizes and wonderful relationships that can be fostered between the professor and students are huge assets to this course. But this class often doesn't foster long-term learning. I don't see the point in learning a massive set of vocabulary prior to an exam which we will immediately forget. When there's such a large amount of material, it makes it impossible to actually internalize the material. I feel the same way about the novelthere's just no conceivable way that most of the class has the time to dedicate two hours to reading it every night, so people are going to read it in English online or not at all. By asking for less time from students, I think more people would have engaged wholly.",
    "Well structured course - perhaps there could be more unity among the assessments and course materials",
    "A lot of time and work. Faculty should make it clear at the start of the semester how much work the class entails.",
    "I thought this class was very insightful and taught me many concepts about intermediate Spanish well, however I felt like we learned vocavulary and grammar at such a fast pace that it made it hard to actually grasp some of the more difficult concepts. I think we'd benefit from spending more time in class reviewing grammar and vocabulary.",
    "The course is very reading-heavy, and there are days when daily homework is either really sparse or really heavy, so make sure to plan ahead.",
    "Strengths: amazing teacher weakness: textbook costs too much",
    "Great Course! Only weakness was that we had a very short amount of time to read the shipwreck novel towards the end of the semester. This was unreasonable because it was everyones first large book in spanish and every night there was a ton of new shipwreck\/maritime vocabulary that seemed to have no relevance outside of that specific nights reading so the nightly reading assignments took a long time and were difficult.",
    "Giseli Tordin was an amazing professor and made the class as great as it was. The syllabus and textbook were not as good."

    "yes! Especially if taken with Giseli Tordin - an amazing professor",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they were prepared to review grammar and vocabulary on their own in addition to in class. This class is a big time commitment and you should be prepared to account for that with your other classes.",
    "Yes! For the continuation of the Spanish sequence",
    "Yes! You'll learn all the typical things but what really sets it apart is the emphasis of not only learning the rules of spanish but actually speaking. Your confidence will increase greatly",
    "Yes because of Giseli."
