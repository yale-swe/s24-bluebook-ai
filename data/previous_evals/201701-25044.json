    "Broad set of climate change issues.",
    "I was auditing the course ; although my involvement was low it did help me gain an overview about energy investments.",
    "Presentation skills. Reading skills.",
    "Comprehensive understanding of energy markets, transitions",
    "Great class for developing knowledge in a wide range of climate issues and solutions",
    "This is a great course to sum up the Energy Studies program. We learned a lot about the reality of today's energy sector in terms of investing, economics and environment.",
    "Exposure to a wide range of discussions, research, and developments currently taking place in sustainable finance and climate change risk assessment. Got a lot of practice thinking critically about different viewpoints on the same topic and asking guest speakers questions.",
    "We learned about energy industry outlook from investing perspective, climate change from the business acumen, carbon modeling and social price on carbon that more and more nations ought to start implementing going forward.",
    "By taking this class I expanded my horizons about the future of the energy on Earth and how the climate change is going to affect the world's energy mix. Learned so much from speakers whose jobs are directly linked to climate change and whose jobs are affected by climate change."

   "comments": [
    "Interesting speakers. Not much work. Lots of assigned readings (sometimes dozens and dozens of pages) but no incentive to actually do them.",
    "More discussion, less lecturing.",
    "Very knowledgeable and engaging professors, speakers",
    "Great, laid back lecture. Oristaglio is the best.",
    "Strengths: great professors and interesting guest speakers Weakness: lacked class discussion",
    "A very solid fifth class that allowed flexibility in the amount of time required to prepare for class. I appreciated the low workload because I had several senior projects that would have made taking on a heavier workload from this class impossible. Professor Oristaglio organized some really fantastic speakers who are super knowledgeable and active in their respective fields. Would have been nice if there was a bit more time for questions after the talks and if the class had follow-up discussions. It would have been interesting to hear the takeaways and reactions of the other students in the class, especially since there were several grad students.",
    "Strengths: great, experienced and knowledgeable professors, amazingly insightful and wonderful speakers, terrific reading assignments flexibility and fun assignments as well as freedom with topics to choose for final presentation Weaknesses: could have been more structured, with clearer expectations with what presentations were supposed to be comprised of and a rubric on how presentations would get evaluated.",
    "The guest lecturers weren't as engaging as I would like them to be.",
    "Great speakers that have exceptional knowledge. The only area for improvement would be to organize half of each lecture as a panel discussion and discuss as a class the readings and talk about what the speakers just shared with the class.",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed the guest speakers. I also appreciated that the instructors provided opportunities to engage with the speakers in informal settings outside the classroom. Areas for improvement: I would have appreciated more student discussion and engagement."
