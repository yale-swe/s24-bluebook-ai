   "comments": [
    "It is a course in close reading of some of the more famous british poets for Milton on. We read Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and finish with a poet of the teacher's choosing (Walcott). I would recommend this course, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "It's a lot of poetry. I enjoyed the poetry a lot, but it's also a lot of work and can be a bit tedious. Really, take it if you are considering becoming an English major or if you are an English major, but otherwise there are better and more interesting English courses at Yale.",
    "I didn't understand why Yale wanted me to delve so thoroughly into poetry for the English major before I took ENGL 126, but I definitely see why now. Meaningful pieces, awesome discussions. It's a lot of work, but it's all worth it in the end - this is a truly great class. Unequivocal recommendation to any humanities-area major.",
    "This is a great class! So much more enjoyable than 125 and did not feel like a prereq at all. I learned so much, and my writing really improved.",
    "126 is significantly more manageable than 125. You read Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, and (in Reed's sections) Walcott. Anthony Reed is not your typical Major English Poet master, but he is serious, passionate, and fair. He leads a lovely section, and his inclusion of Caribbean poetry is surprising and appreciated.",
    "A study of poets. That were major. In English.This course is exactly the course you go to Yale to take--reading complex texts with guidance so that your experience is rewarding, enjoyable, and enlightening.",
    "I thought this course was wonderful. It's important to carefully consider the syllabi of the different ENGL126 courses, as they differ greatly, and I felt Professor Reed created an extremely nuanced syllabus with his inclusion of Derek Walcott's Omeros. Major English Poets frequently becomes \"Major English Poetry by dead white men\" and I think this particular section of ENGL126 avoided that bias quite skillfully. I feel I gained a great deal from the unconventional (but by all means worthwhile) syllabus.I thought Professor Reed was an absolutely incredible professor. Leading seminars is by no means an easy task, and many professors struggle to strike the proper balance in speaking too much or in being too hands-off. I thought Professor Reed approached this dilemma with rarely seen skill: he began each session by asking students what they understood from the reading, and molded his discussion accordingly. As a result, the level of classroom discussion was always perfectly in line with students' needs, and was stimulating without being too challenging or inaccessible. Additionally, despite his extreme intelligence, which comes through when he steers discussion in interesting and thoght-provoking ways, Professor Reed is by far one of the most accessible professors I have had at Yale. I never felt as though I couldn't approach him with any problem \u0097 be it a difficulty in understanding the material or a personal issue. Professor Reed is INCREDIBLE.",
    "Good readings, questionable professor; Omeros is particular is great. I had a better time doing the readings outside of class than going to section. The grading isn't that demanding but it felt very nitpicky.",
    "Much easier than ENG 125 and more interesting. The poets, with the exception of Pope, are much easier to get through. Also, Omeros, if your take Professor Reed's section is a wonderful break from the usual \"Dead, old white guys\" we usually read and also, just really interesting."
