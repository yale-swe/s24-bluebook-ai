   "comments": [
    "205L was a relatively painless requirement for the major. I wouldn't recommend taking it for any other reason though. Labs can take a while, but are not conceptually difficult. Outside of class, I usually spent about two hours each week on lab write-ups and homework (there was only homework for the first few weeks). As long as you follow along and participate during lab, the final (which is half practical and half short response) should not be a huge source of stress.",
    "Wouldn't recommend unless required for the major.",
    "This course has changed since a year ago in ways that have added to the workload but also made it more fair and less stressful. Instead of having to turn in the completed lab writeup at the end of the lab period, you take the lab book home and turn them in on a one week lab. They also piloted two-page summaries this year which formed a portion of the lab grade. Overall, well-designed experiments in a course focused on error analysis that you probably have to take. Also Professor Irons is super nice.",
    "Good class, probably one you'd have to take.",
    "Not the most fun class you will take at Yale, but from the way they changed the structure of the class it is much more manageable than it previously was last semester. You most likely got to take it, but it isn't that bad.",
    "This is a not-great class. You learn a lot of error analysis, but the actual labs (apart from a few exceptions) are fairly dull. The upshot is it is only a half-credit of work (unlike many labs) - you only spend maybe 2.5 hours a week on homework.",
    "The lab reports are tedious but not overwhelmingly difficult, and the labs themselves are interesting. It's a not too stressful and solid intro lab course",
    "As a first lab course, Phys 205L is a great option. The labs can seem a little long at times but I know feel very comfortable transitioning into another lab course.",
    "TL;DR - Take it. It is fairly manageable and you want to complete it as soon as possible, since it is not that big of a deal. PHYS 205L is a great lab, and it is way better than it was two semesters ago. It consists of weekly sections (available 5 days\/week, but you pick one section) in which you perform simple experiments involving various topics in physics. The students are introduced to topics such as dynamics, optics and electromagnetism, as well as equipment such as the oscilloscope, multimeters, function generators and so on. WORKLOAD AND GRADING -Weekly lab book + lab report -Data Analysis Psets (first couple of weeks only - easy) -Final Exam Each week you will have one section that takes between 3 and 5 hours to finish. You will read, print and take to class a handout (ClassesV2) that explains both the experiment procedures and the theory behind it. After class, you must finish your lab book (which you start during section but may finish at home), as well as a lab report (~2 pages) about the same experiment. Furthermore, during the first couple of weeks you will have really short problem sets on Data Analysis, which should not be a problem. Finally, there is a final (practical+theoretical) exam that takes place during the last week of classes, and is considerably easier than the normal weekly experiments."
