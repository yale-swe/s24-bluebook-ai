    "Yes! You have to take it for EP&E - and definitely take it with Kapustin. Even if you're not an EP&E major you can get a lot out of it - a nice overview of Western philosophy.",
    "The Kapustin hype is real, ladies and gents. Take \"Classics\" if you want to learn from one of the most eloquent, inclusive, and poised members of the Yale faculty. Do not expect class discussions as much as brilliant lectures from BK--in the end, they are some of the most intellectually enlightening experiences you will have at Yale. Take the class.",
    "Take it with Kapustin. It's not a real seminar--he lectures most of the time--but his lectures are some of the most eloquent, clear, sharp and brilliant words you will ever hear. It's also probably the least work of any seminar I've taken at Yale. A great fifth class even if you're not an EP&E major.",
    "This is a required course for the EPE major, so obviously if you're an EPE major, you know you have to take this. But it's not as if that's a chore or a terrible punishment. Professor Kapustin knows more than anyone about the works on the syllabus, and many of the authors, especially the more modern ones, are interesting and relevant. As a frame of reference for anyone who took DS, this class is very similar in terms of the material, the way discussions are structured, and the emphasis on writing. My one cautionary piece of advice is that the class time (at least with Professor Kapustin) is extremely intense and demanding--the work is not that burdensome, but the discussions are. Try not to schedule lots of other classes on the day that this seminar meets.",
    "If you're thinking of taking classics of EPE, you probably have to since it's a requirement. That said, definitely try to take it with Professor Kapustin! He's the bomb. Not that much work\u00a0\u2013 but do the reading, otherwise it's a long two hours. I wasn't enthused with many of our discussions, but I think that was more of a reflection on the class itself and not Professor Kapustin.",
    "Classics of EP&E is a survey in the history of political philosophy. No math, no worries. It is a fair amount of reading though.",
    "This course is excellent. It is very strong in outlining major themes but the professor is also nicely open to student input and discussion. The assignments were good, as well. They were not overbearing but they forced me to think and synthesize material. Excellent course!!!",
    "Classics of EPE is a great class. Professor Kapustin is incredibly knowledgable and you will have the chance to read a lot of texts that people often talk about but haven't actually read\/discussed.",
    "A short history of works that focus on the intersection of economics and politics. I would only recommend for EPE majors.",
    "This is a great, fascinating class. Definitely take it with Professor Kapustin.",
    "Classics of EP&E is a great class. Professor Kapustin is an engaging speaker and involves the students in the class.",
    "Professor kapustin is a great professor who is a compelling and engaging speaker and thinker, and he makes a great effort to know his students and help them learn. I didn't enjoy every work read but it's a worthwhile class.",
    "Professor Kapustin is amazing. The course is well organized and thought provoking. Take it if you get the chance!"
