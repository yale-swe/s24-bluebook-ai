    "PATH 650 is a great class to learn cancer biology. The organization is very well thought out with minimal busy work. The readings are very fun. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "This is a great course for someone interested in cancer and has some sort of cancer research background. The course isn't too focused on clinical stuff, so a familiarity with basic science is a must.",
    "A perfect intermediate cancer course that provides touches upon the vast number pertinent of topics in cancer biology, taught by the top professors in the field. Highly recommended for any budding cancer biologist.",
    "I would encourage others to take this class. I learned a lot about aspects of cancer bio i didn't know before.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student, especially someone well versed in Cellular Biology and Biochemistry. It's the kind of course you may never get to experience again."

    "Prior to taking this class, I had a very basic understanding of cancer biology. While I knew a lot about my research (in the cancer field), I never understood the \"bigger picture.\" What role did my project play in the cancer landscape? How are different therapies and drugs related to my project? This class answered all of that and so much more.",
    "This course truly deepened my knowledge of cancer and taught me how to pose new questions.I wish I had taken this course at the beginning of my senior thesis work rather than at the end of it (I am an undergrad).",
    "This course aided in my ability to read and dissect primary literature and opened my eyes to aspects of cancer I didn't know much about"
