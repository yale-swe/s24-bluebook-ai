    "Terrible. Waste of time, especially following a summer in Italy. Though, I think I had a particularly bad teacher, who did nothing to encourage us to push ourselves and learn\/use new vocab or grammar. Good news is the entire class is review, so no studying required if you know your stuff.",
    "YES! Great way to keep your Italian fresh.",
    "If you want an easy a, take it with Chris Nixon. If you want to learn Italian, take it with another professor.",
    "I would.",
    "Yeah I would recommend the course. It's pretty much a review of the information learned in the L1 and L2, with a larger emphasis and speaking and interactions. The movies that we watched were fairly interesting, and the tests weren't overly difficult. However if you really want to learn the language I would highly recommend studying abroad.",
    "You gotta take it for the language credit."
