    "Evolutionary Medicine is one of a kind at Yale and introduces the potential premed or just potential \"anyone who is interested in health issues at all\" to the evolutionary aspect and explanations for certain medical phenomena that occur in the world, such as the hygiene hypothesis or the evolution of drug resistance. I would definitely recommend this class to another student - the workload is definitely manageable and it's an interesting class in general.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is has a good background in the subject area. Otherwise, it's just too much to handle. The material is quite interesting, but requires a lot of background knowledge to fully comprehend. It isn't really a lot of work, although there is a 15-20 page paper. The midterms are also a bit challenging.",
    "This class looks at the impact of evolution on medical topics from aging to cancer to HIV to life history tradeoffs or parental imprinting. If you've taken lots of other EEB courses (esp. evolutionary biology), the first half can seem somewhat repetitious. But most of the class is very interesting and relevant to research, medical practice and every life. I'm not pre-med, but I think this would be a great course to take if you want to be a doctor- would definitely give you a new perspective on your field. The exams are a lot of writing, so make sure you know how to articulate themes well.",
    "This is a class that will completely change how you look at science, medicine, and your own health. I highly recommend taking the class.",
    "The course covers the medical and cell biological applications evolutionary principles. I would highly recommend it for any student interested in getting an education in a developing field which will no doubt have huge impact in the future of medicine(see House episode- \"Hygiene Hypothesis\".",
    "This is an overview of the past and current ideas about human evolution and how it relates to human disease and life course. This is a very scientific-based class, but the information is very interesting to non-science majors. I would recommend this class to biology majors mostly, or ambitious non-science majors, but be aware it will be much more difficult for those without a solid biological and genetic background.",
    "I loved this class. The information is really relevant, even if just for personal knowledge. I think the information is particularly useful for women, at least the part about childbearing and pregnancy. The paper seems daunting, but its really not, especially if you've taken EEB 122 before it. Other than that, its two pretty reasonable midterms.",
    "Take it. An evolutionary perspective on medicine\/life in general is a wonderful asset to have. The material is also very interesting.",
    "I really loved this course. I learned a lot of interesting theories and the professor is great. I am not an EEB major, but I recommend this course whole-heartedly if the material interests you. In the end, it turns out to be a lot of work for Bio course. 2 exams, 20 page paper, and a presentation. But, take it!",
    "Take this class!! It was my favorite class this year. Professor Stearns is amazing and very helpful. The lectures and readings are very interesting. Be prepared to think and do some work if you aren't already used to the information.",
    "Yes, but take it CR\/D\/F!!!!!! The material is interesting and relevant, but the way you are assessed in this course is unreasonable, especially if you have testing anxiety (the tests are designed to be long and impossible to finish). Taking it for a credit will allow you to see past the frustration and appreciate the class for its evolutionary insight into relevant medical topics - vaccination design, infectious disease control, antibiotic resistance, why we age and menstruate, etc.",
    "This class is a great look into topics of medicine, as they relate to Evolution. The material is very accessible, as is the professor and TAs. Great class.",
    "EXCELLENT CLASS, highly recommend. i'm not a science major by any stretch, but you really only need a decent grasp of AP bio genetics\/DNA\/evolutionary theory to understand this class. the concepts were always presented well and were very interesting, ranging from viral treatments of MS to vaccine failure. an area of bio that is not usually covered, but extremely fascinating. professor stearns is also a really gracious professor--he lectures well and always inquires if the workload is too much. he assigns a decent amount of reading, which is helpful, but not actually necessary, to understand the material. the exams mostly focus on the lectures, which are interesting and understandable.",
    "This is a great course. Professor Stearns is a very engaging lecturer and the material is incredibly interesting. Definately take it!",
    "TAKE THE COURSE. It's amazing, Stephen is amazing, the TA's are amazing (well I only know about Julie but yeah)... There is just so much to learn, and you learn SO MUCH DURING THE PAPER!!!",
    "fascinating lectures, stearns can be a bit dry but the material is great. you dont really need to do the readings to do well in the class either. class is a lot easier if you have a solid background in biology (genetics, immunology)",
    "Take it! One of the best bio courses I've taken at Yale (and I'm in the major). Prof. Stearns is incredibly knowledgeable.He also covers topics with a refreshing candidness that is rare in the bio department -- he says what is known, what is hypothesized, counterexamples, etc. and he also encourages us to probe the material ourselves, forming our own questions. I'm a pre-med and it provided new insights into ways of thinking about the field. Note -- the grading can be rough. While it's 50% A's and 50% B's approximately, getting the A is difficult (in our class only 4 of 24 received A's)."
