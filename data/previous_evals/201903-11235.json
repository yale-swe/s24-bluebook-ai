    "I learnt how to use math in the real world!",
    "I learned that math is inescapable and that math is also not that bad (this is from a true non-stem person). But also, I learned about geometric series and after years of being confused, actually learned how probability and counting works (Bayes Theorem, Combination\/Permutation, etc.). This is a bomb math class ngl.",
    "Interest rate \/ mortgage payments, Probability, rates",
    "Basic mathematics",
    "I further developed my critical thinking skills.",
    "I learned about calculating monthly mortgage payments, probability, aspect ratios, and more.",
    "How mortgages work. I had already taken AP Stat and Pre-calc so most of it was a review.",
    "Although I \"relearned\" mathematical concepts already introduced to me, the application to real world examples such as mortgage rates or voter probability proved incredibly useful.",
    "Learned about mortgages, probability, counting, aspect ratios... surprisingly interesting.",
    "I learned that rectangles are the answer to solving everything. Just kidding (sort of)! We covered many topics applicable to the real world, my favorite being compounding interest and mortgage rates. We also learned how to describe\/predict the motion of moving objects, how to complete the square to solve quadratic equations for aspect ratios, how to sum finite and infinite geometric series, understand probability and complex counting, reviewed the properties of logarithms and exponents, and how to use magic to multiply pairs of numbers in the 90s (more like an easy-to-memorize math formula, but that accomplishment is practically magic for me).",
    "I walked into the class thinking that I would know everything that we would learn in class as the course recommended the students to have no experience in high school calculus, but as I attended the class, I realized that I did not know anything that we were learning this class. As a high school student taking this course, this class helped me in a variety of ways, including unintentionally preparing me for the SAT math, and for me to enter the outside world with proficient knowledge on mortgages, which is crucial in the adult world.",
    "I learned how to apply mathematical systems to real life.",
    "I learned math in the real world which was very helpful",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of the use that mathematics has in everyday tasks and how, despite not being amazing at it, I can still learn these skills for future use in the real world. I also learned that math can be seen from a different perspective, through images or everyday examples, that makes it a lot easier to approach. Thanks to this course I have learned basic math skills that I will use in the real world and feel more confident with my ability to do so.",
    "Practical math skills such as calculating interest and mortgages, as well as cool math techniques and concepts that I find really interesting, i.e. concepts of inifinity, irrational numbers.",
    "I believe that I have gained so much of an appreciation of simple concepts in math. Like using math for mortgages and finding the possibilities in finding specific cards for gambling lol. I feel like this class also taught me to be more open when talking with other students although it may seem intimidating, that we are all trying to understand together.",
    "I gained a vast amount of knowledge about applying mathematics in the real world. Specifically, I learned about compounding interest and apply it to relevant situations in my life, and I learned about integrating probability into my life.",
    "I learned valuable things applicable to my real life after graduation such as mortgages alongside other skills that apply to the real world more scientifically like falling objects and infinite sums.",
    "I got a ton of practice thinking about math my own way, and solving problems creatively."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is structured well and easy to study for due to the high number of relevant study materials that are provided. The course could be held in a colder classroom.",
    "The strength is the professor. He's so great at explaining things and taking different approaches to facilitate learning that he can reach people at different levels at once. The class also has a lot of class participation\/group work, so you don't have to just wait on the professor to come help you, you have several students who are also trying to figure things out with you.",
    "Strength: Professor Smith was always willing to meet and help us understand the concepts. He was very fair in creating the exams - he really wanted everyone to succeed.",
    "Strengths: The class content was engaging, which is something I can rarely say about a math class. Brett was super helpful, and would help us substantially with our p-sets during Office Hours. The class was very manageable work-wise, which I really appreciated. Brett gave us all the tools to succeed. Weaknesses: None, really.",
    "The group work was both a strength and a weakness the professor should have spent more time explaining concepts and formulas, but at the same time, group work allowed you to work in teams to solve the problems.",
    "Brett was such an amazing instructor. Made me interested in the class despite despising math. Weakness were the psets were often much more difficult than the in class material",
    "Brett was an amazing prof!! Super nice and willing to help you with anything!",
    "Strengths: small class size, broad range of topics, friendly and accessible professor, helpful office hours Weaknesses: sometimes felt like the blind leading the blind in our working groupsmaybe would be better to start with an intro to the topic and then go into groups.",
    "Strengths were the topics we learned being generally interesting, but not spending so much time or depth on them it got too confusing-- just a nice introduction to math I might return to throughout my adult life. I really appreciated the workload and tests being extremely manageable; problem sets were brief and tests were always very straight-forward and predictable. Weaknesses might be Brett's teaching style-- it felt like in class we worked through the problems in groups but in office hours he actually taught and answered questions. Personally I stopped going to class and started just going to office hours towards the end of the year because I felt like what we learned in class, if anything, wasn't entirely relevant to the problem sets and tests. I felt really confident in this class because most of it was review I could learn from the textbook, but if I was reliant actual teaching I would have struggled.",
    "I did not enjoy this course. we start each class off in groups trying to solve problems we had no idea how to do, when he should have explained how to do the problems first and then we practice them. I admire Brett for caring about the learning\/problem solving process, but the teaching method flat out did not work. the textbook sucks and makes no sense. Kids were always confused and chatting on the side because the content made no sense, and as non-math majors, we had no stake in the class beyond trying to get our QR credits so nobody wanted to engage. Brett cares a lot and tries so hard to help out. style of teaching just didn't work.",
    "Great teacher but less time should be spent doing group work because some students became easily distracted",
    "One major strength is that the in class work revolves around group work. Not only is that a refreshing change from the structure of typical Yale classes, the group work induces more learning because several great minds are tasked with solving the same problem. We learn from and help each other. There is no sense of in class competition because we are all struggling through the psets, but we are all willing to help each other through them.",
    "Sometimes we spent a lot of time stuck on a problem in class and sitting around waiting for our teacher to make the rounds and come help us. I don't know if there is a more effective way to help more people at once...",
    "This course was great at using visuals to explain complex ideas. Units such as compounding interest for mortgages and loans felt very applicable to real life, as I'm now more knowledgeable (albeit still terrified) of inflation rates. It's a great QR to help students approach math problems using non-conventional strategies. I especially loved to work in groups when thinking through complicated problems in class. We could ask each other questions and check our answers. Also, exams were very much so like the practice exams Brett provided, so I often felt prepared for each midterm and final. We did, however, spend a lot of time on exercises trying to find patterns. While I understand Brett's focus on letting us come to our own conclusions rather than throwing formulas at us without context, I think we could have benefitted from less time struggling blindly. Additionally, the psets really stretched our knowledge. I'd have liked to use the textbook questions to practice models we learned in class, but many of the homework exercises were outside the scope of our classwork, and often couldn't be solved without office hour visits.",
    "The strengths of this course were that the professor had a lot of office hours which helped many students to receive help for the psets or when studying for the exam, in addition to providing a comfortable atmosphere that the students could ask any questions that they have. Also, working through the classwork with a group created not just an opportunity for students actively to engage in class, but also to share their thoughts and ideas to others, which strengthens the knowledge even more, instead of just listening to a lecture. However, the only weakness that this course had was that the wording of the psets was sometimes hard to understand.",
    "I think the course is taught well as is. Maybe there could be more general class instruction at the the beginning before breaking into groups, but overall, I thin the class was taught well.",
    "The strengths of this course are the professor himself, the class interaction (especially with every day being group work), and the flow of the lessons. Each unit builds off of each other and the way the class is taught allows for group discussion, help, and either one-on-one or group help from the professor. Some weaknesses of the class were the worksheets given to us in the class. At times, they felt very different from what we had for homework on the psets so it was hard to work on them without going to office hours.",
    "The class is very fairly graded and Professor Smith is amazing.",
    "The strengths are definitely using the book as a guide to what is being taught but also the teacher, Brett has been such an understanding and helpful person. The way he can explain difficult concepts using diagrams and charts in order to accommodate everyone's way of learning is great. Also, his ability to understand that the students will sometimes be late on deadlines is heartwarmingly helpful as the students are all going through things. One weakness is probably the amount of group work since every day, students are put into groups. I loved that it was randomized but then stopped being so towards the middle of the semester. Either way, I loved the class.",
    "Strengths: Professor Smith is always available to help students! Office hours are a great things and if that isn't enough there is always a way to schedule a one on one meeting. P sets are also not too long and there are some chances for extra credit. I appreciate how reasonable Professor Smith is!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is a great math class to take if calculus or statistic aren't your cup of tea. I enjoyed learning relevant mathematical information that could be applied to real life.",
    "Yes. So many people take QR credits because they seem accessible and they're not. This class actually is and its because the professor is very thorough in making sure everyone understands.",
    "If you are looking for a good QR credit, yes. I hadn't done math in a while though, so had to study quite a bit for the exams.",
    "Yes! Especially for non-STEM people. So good. You won't find another class as manageable, and a professor as helpful.",
    "Yes if you need a QR, but only if Brett is teaching it still.",
    "Yes. Its a good QR credit for non math people, but be warned that you will have to study and show up to class.",
    "Yes for a QR. and Brett is great",
    "Yes, but not to every student. I took this class because Im a humanities person who had never taken calculus and this felt like a safe, easy option-- and I think if anything it was too easy. Which is never something Ive experienced in a math class-- and it was kind of disappointing that I never really had to wrestle with the ideas. I didnt find much personal satisfaction in this course. But personal satisfaction is a lot to ask for; safe and easy is really nice, and gave me a lot of confidence that I could do really well in math.",
    "No. if you're looking for a QR credit and not great at math, better options out there.",
    "Highly recommend for someone who needs a QR and sucks at them",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who may not be the most mathematically inclined but still needs a good QR credit. The psets are challenging, but the midterms are always much more manageable.",
    "Yes, a great way to get a QR credit. The professor is really nice and helpful in office hours.",
    "YES! For non-STEM people who tend to be stronger in the humanities, this is a great QR course. It encourages learning the experimentation, visualization, and de-emphasizes complex formulas. I tend to be afraid of math, especially numbers and decimals, but this course introduced them to me in ways that made sense, and therefore less daunting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, whether they are in the humanities major or STEM major because it teaches the students about the real world math that the society often doesn't emphasize on during primary or secondary schools, which is essential to know while living in this society.",
    "Yes, I think it is a great QR to take if you're not particularly good at math or fond of math.",
    "Yes!!! I would definitely recommend this course to other students because of its ability to teach you about mathematics in the real world that is going to be actually applicable to things in our every day lives. Also, as a non-STEM major, this was a great class to take if you need to fill in a math credit. The classwork isn't bad, the math is approachable, and the professor actually makes it enjoyable.",
    "This course is a great and interesting QR credit, and Professor Smith is one of the best professors I've ever had. That said, it was not the QR gut I was told it would be.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to anyone who does not like math and sees no point in learning it because it teaches you to look at math from a new perspective. This course continues to emphasize the importance of a liberal arts school which is Yale. If you can take it, please do. You will love it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a non-STEM major looking for a manageable QR credit.",
    "Yes."
