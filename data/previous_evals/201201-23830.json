    "eye opening, but not very helpful with HMP students",
    "I don't understand the point of this seminar. It would be better off in career services where people have an option to attend it if the field interests them. Otherwise, we are just being required to listen to alums talk about their jobs that we may or may not have any interest in.It would be better to have seminar on policy issues we could learn about. For example, the session with Mark on the health care reform would have been really good if it was longer and more instructive. Or, it could be used for faculty to discuss their research like other divisions.",
    "I would say that this course was not necessary for HMP students. The speakers primarily catered to HPA interests, and I felt that there was a lot that did not relate to my preferences. However, I felt the first fall semester included wonderful speakers - two of which made a great impact on my career. Getting to hear Miki Kapur and Tammy Snyder speak was very enlightening and allowed me to take something away from their insight.",
    "Strenghts: Did not require outside work or preparation; some of the speakers were informative and excellentWeaknesses: As attendance was not taken at sections, many people stopped showing up and made discussions difficult to maintain with only a handful of students in attendance.",
    "The selection of speakers was not that great this semester. It was very global health and policy focused (i.e. there were fewer managament\/administration presenters, and fewer of those with atypical post-MPH positions)",
    "Too many Yale-affiliated speakers this semester.",
    "Great speakers - bringing practical world experience and expertise",
    "good. organizers make an honest attempt to bring in relevant speakers, which i appreciate. I've been to a few CDE seminars, and this one is way better.",
    "excellent."

    "it's fine.",
    "I would not recommend this seminar to someone unless they were particularlly confused on what type of job they wanted after they graduated and didn't really understand the career options. However, it is required.",
    "This course is entirely dependent upon the speakers. I preferred the fall semester which included more speakers that sparked my interest. Nonetheless, if there is an area of policy\/administration that a student is interested in, I feel that this seminar allows students to engage with faculty and professionals who can provide great advice and insight.",
    "1st semester version of this course with Betsy Bradley was preferred due to her ability to moderate more interesting discussions between the speakers and the students, also speakers brought in for the second semester were less interesting to me as they were mainly domestic based. Session with USAID\/Malaria speaker was excellent and extremely informative.",
    "I would recommended it based on the student's interests. If the presenter is on par with their career objectives, then go for it.",
    "excellent. recommendable to all MPH students."
