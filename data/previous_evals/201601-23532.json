    "Goooooooooooooooooood!",
    "Strong dislike. Wouldn't have taken this course if it weren't a global health concentration requirement. Some portions were mildly interesting, chiefly having big players in global health Skype in to lecture, but the whole premise of only viewing global health from the role of a finance minister, which is not only far out of the scope of most YSPHers but also not the only vein from which global health can and should be explored, really caused this course to fall very short of my expectations. Coupled with the insane amount of required reading and Skolnik's huge ego about everything he does\/has done\/will do and how he interacts with students, and it was not a pleasant experience. Note: I don't care how much global experience he has, it is incredibly inappropriate to slip into stereotypes about countries or to put on accents when talking about a particular country-- for example, he put on Nigerian accents when talking about Nigerian health, (mistakenly) used Italian words when attempting to speak in Spanish because, you know, we were talking about health metrics in a Spanish speaking country so that is always appropriate, and he relied heavily on international students to speak about the deficiencies' in their own country's healthcare infrastructure and health status, usually putting them in the spotlight to explain very difficult topics. I also felt incredibly infantized that nametags were required for the entire course, not that it particularly helped Skolnik, who referred to several students by completely wrong names (and some with egregious mispronunciations of their names, generally international students) for the entire semester. Thankfully, with his retirement, it looks like this course will finally get its much needed reboot. I am looking forward to seeing the changes that YSPH makes in order to turn this into a class that GHC students are excited to take!",
    "I learned a LOT from this course. Although I hate the cold call format in general, it is conducive to learning and keeps us on our toes (although it can be embarrassing and very intimidating sometimes). The policy briefs are graded very fairly and the expectations are laid out very clearly. If you just follow the format that Prof. Skolnik outlines for you in the beginning, you will do just fine. The 3 hour 5-8pm class time is pretty rough though.",
    "This class is very challenging in many ways but teaches a lot to anyone interested in global health. I am getting out of this semester feeling more confident that I can explain what global health is and what are its main challenges.",
    "Strength: Professor who is very knowledgeable about global health. Is very eloquent in his speech and provides a great example of how public speaking should sound like. Weakness: Long evening class. Should have a break in the middle to provide time for the students AND professor to eat.",
    "The class was extremely interesting and Professor Skolnik is extremely knowledgable and well connected. He brought in a variety of very interesting guest speakers and exposed his students to leaders in global health. The one drawback is that the class was offered at a very inconvenient time. Holding class from 5-8pm on a Wednesday was less than ideal. Additionally, it was difficult to stay engaged for 3 full hours. The assignments were also interesting, applicable, and reasonable. One weakness was that the deadlines for assignments and the course syllabus kept changing. The course syllabus changed largely due to speaker availability which is in large part unavoidable. However, I do think that professors should do their best to return feedback in a timely manner so that subsequent assignments aren't consistently pushed back. It would have also been nice to have more in-person guests if possible. The reading list for each course session was somewhat unreasonable but I appreciated that they were delineated as \"required\" and \"optional.\"",
    "Strengths: The professor, overall context of material, resources provided, and assignments. Weaknesses: Broad scope of material not covered in depth, actual time of class (in the evening for three hours), and inconsistency in grading material in a timely manner and in fairness with example briefs provided.",
    "Strength: interactive nature, guests who provided valuable insights. Weakness: Timing, lack of multiple assignments",
    "Skype-in guest speakers were fantastic!",
    "This course was an essential overview of global health issues. There is nothing else like this for Yale MPH students to gain a broad understanding of health issues and understand the key players that lead and work in the field of global health.",
    "I loved this class.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was the instructor Richard Skolnik. His experience and broad knowledge base enriched the course immensely.",
    "I feel that this is the only course I have taken at YSPH that has given me a solid foundation to become a global health practitioner. I hope that, although the course will be taught by a different instructor next year, much of the same material will be included into the course.",
    "This course covers a broad set of topics which is a significant strength. Also, we were able to hear from a variety of very important leaders in global health and learn from them. I learned so much by doing the policy briefs that I believe they are a great resource for learning. Even if they are graded rather harshly. One of the weaknesses of the course are the impossible list of readings assigned. This is a problem across the board at YSPH though. The course would be greatly improved if the weekly readings were manageable and attached to a weekly modest set of questions or suggestions for reflection. This would ensure students do most of the readings as opposed to the current state of things.",
    "The subject of the course is very interesting and there was a good introduction to resources for global health. The main problem was with the instructor and how the material was presented and reviewed. As someone who has had course in global health before this was not a particularly revelatory experience. It was just a good overview and a decent exercise in how to find and present information.",
    "Very thorough introduction to global health",
    "Strengths: professor's expertise, guest speakers, class participation Weaknesses: More diversity may be helpful in the assignments. Perhaps 2 briefs and another assignment to allow for different students' strengths to show."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0I would suggest Professor Skolnik narrowed down the reading each week to selected articles. The class could be divided into 2 parts as the 3 hours are really long. He is excellent in communicating with students.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0See response for last question. Probably one of the greatest faults of this course.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Skolnik is an expert on this stuff and we all know it. And it's very clear that he knows it too. But aside from this and his sometimes uncomfortable \"cultural targeting\" of students (for lack of a better phrase), he is really a stellar professor. I wish I had taken some time to meet with him outside of class but he always makes himself available to students, and offered to consult with us even after the semester via email (as he's retiring). His \"what do people get sick and die from\/why do they get sick\/why do we care\" framework is helpful for conceptualizing global disease burden, but sometimes it's easy to lose sight of the real people behind these numbers. (I think the only guest lecturer who really brought home this point was Dr. Sunny Kishore, who spoke about NCDs. Please bring him back if possible!)",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik certainly knows how to keep students awake for 3 hours long on a Wednesday night. He is very knowledgeable on really any topic but does not hesitate to defer his answers to ask to the right persons which I personally really appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0very knowledgeable and charismatic professor. I like his style of cold calling students (even though it is somewhat frightening and nerve wracking) because it forces you to pay attention and do the readings before hand. It also allows for more discussion during class. Professor Skolnik was also very helpful in giving advice about how to write and improve upon our policy briefs. I appreciate his obsession with clear, concise, straightforward writing. Very Hemingway.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Great Professor. Interesting to listen to, very knowledgeable in the field of global health and made it easy to learn especially for individuals in the management program.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0The professor makes the class - very knowledgeable and very accepting of all nationalities and backgrounds. Also shows he cares about students by making himself available and introducing the students to other global health leaders.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is very knowledgeable and interesting. He truly cares about his students and wants to help them in any way possible. He approaches grading his assignments with the lens of making his students better prepared to be effective members of the global health community in the future.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Strengths: personality, energy, teaching skills, knowledge of the World Bank and policy. Weaknesses: availability, willingness to listen to students in class",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Very wise man, and does deeply care about his students. It was an honor to be in his last class...",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Inspiring! I was challenged and I learned a lot because of it.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0He is amazing.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik was the highlight of this course. He is knowledgeable, experienced and an amazing mentor.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0What a wonderful experience to be taught by such a prominent figure in global health. Skolnik literally wrote Global Health 101. His connections with other people working in the field of global health really allowed the students to understand what a career might look like and what is needed to succeed in that career.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0It is a huge privilege to have Dr. Skolnik teach us this course. And I am honestly not surprised that Yale went to great extents to recruit him. However, he has shown a certain lack of sensitivity to student's feelings during the course. I believe this is mostly done out of clumsiness and definitely not outright malice or desire to offend. Additionally, Dr. Skolnik has spent his entire career helping the lives of some of the poorest and most vulnerable people around the world. His work has helped dramatically improve if not outright save the lives of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. Students should carefully consider this fact before judging or labeling a person. Finally, it is clear that professor Skolnik's teaching could benefit from being more attune to people's sensibilities.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0He knows what he's talking about, but likes to hear his own voice. I've never heard someone name drop so often in class. We get it - you know a lot of people. Direct quote from feedback from him: \"You rarely need a prelude to a question, since the person you are asking the question probably knows the background to the question. Thus, you almost never need to say \"given a, b, and c about d, e, f, and g, I wanted to ask you x, y, and z.\" Rather, just ask your question and ask it in as few words as possible. * I also want to encourage you to make professional comments in as few words as possible, also without unnecessary preludes. Both of these skills will endear you to your colleagues and others. The lack of them will worry people that you can't get to the point or that you are more interested in hearing yourself speak than in listening to others.\" Doesn't follow his own advice.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Clearly very knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Wonderful professor! Sad to see him go."

    "If you're interested in global health, you must take this class. I sort of dreaded it going in, knowing that I was going to be cold called and such, but it's really not that bad and you do learn a lot. The work load really isn't bad at all - if you just skim the readings (he tells you which ones deserve more of your attention) and follow his framework for the policy briefs, you will do fine. The time you spend in class is worth it and you get a lot out of it. (Although I guess this doesn't matter since Skolnik is retiring...)",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in global health or health policy. It is an eye-opening class that will challenge you in your speech quality and writing skills",

    "A great course for individuals who have no background in global health. Is also a great introduction to important and landmark papers in the field of global health.",
    "Very interesting course with exposure to a variety of different topics in global health and different leaders in the field. I think that it was Professor Skolnik that largely made this course a success so I'm sure if someone else is teaching it, it will be a very different course.",
    "The course offers a general basis of knowledge, and I would not say the material and level of difficulty were at a graduate level. It should go into more depth about the topics covered and be a more challenging discussion in class.",
    "This course should continue, and is foundation for the global health concentration.",
    "You will learn a lot about global health and how to communicate effectively, but it is not overwhelming. If you want to work in global health this is a must take course.",
    "Very useful",
    "The course covers the scope of Global Health today. Professor Skolnik tries to cover essentials in the world of Global Health and invite leaders to speak with and inspire the class. Under his tutelage we also learn to write a good policy brief.",
    "This course was great and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Hopefully there will be some changes and improvements now that Skolnik is retiring. It will be interesting to see how the class changes and develops.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who has the time to complete all the readings and participate in class for three hours at a time.",
    "I would recommend this course. Do the readings and go to class to really realize just how much you have left to learn about the global community."
