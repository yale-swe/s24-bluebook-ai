    "Would definitely recommend. You might come out feeling a little dejected when you realize how many problems there are in the world and how little TJ mechanisms can do for victims who have lost everything, but that's what makes discussion interesting.",
    "Very engaging course with an amazing reading list. Strong points are the reading list and the discussion. Weak points might be just the sense of summing it up, drawing some conclusions. It is very challenging to approach something as slippery as Transitional Justice. Very new topic.",
    "Transitional Justice is a very interesting class. If you ever wondered about institutions such as truth commissions or the international criminal court, or if you ever dream about working in such fields, this class will provide a nice introduction (but a pretty in-depth overview) of the world of transitional justice. This year, the course included two guest speakers, Professor David Dyzenhaus and Justice Richard Goldstone, and I assume that this pattern of inviting special speakers may continue for this class. Just to leave in a few notes about the professor, Pablo is an amazing professor, especially in small seminar settings, and he has a great ability in fostering discussions amongst students which very often leads to brilliant ideas. The readings are quite enjoyable and not overly burdensome. I would recommend this class to any student interested in post-conflict justice.",
    "If you're interested in the topic, yes. It's somewhat narrow and very theoretical at times, but I thought it was a worthwhile course.",
    "In depth discussion of transitional justice.",
    "Excellent course! Only one of its kind at an undergraduate level. It was well structured and I appreciated how Prof. Kalmanovitz brought in speakers\/authors throughout the semester. I feel like I came out of the class with new thoughts and ideas, with renewed interest in the material, despite having already come into the course with significant background knowledge. Class discussions were excellent, though sometimes, inevitably, challenged by the subject matter itself.Prof. Kalmanovitz is absolutely excellent. He is extremely approachable, engaging and interested in students' thoughts and progress. He is brilliant and it was a pleasure having him as professor and learning from him. I enjoyed the theoretical and thematic structure of the course, and I know that this is apt to change if Prof. Kalmanovitz chooses to teach it again. I am fully confident that if he teaches it again, it will only be better.I'm so thankful this course was taught by such a great professor during my last semester at Yale. It made Yale harder to leave, having such a great class, when I was fully ready and set on leaving before this semester. I wrote my thesis in this course and really enjoyed the experience and journey.HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",
    "I'm so glad I took this seminar. The issues here are both deeply interesting, philosophically and politically, and the seminar was well-organized to orient through these aspects of the budding field. Few courses in the department address this area of study, and Pablo is one of the few who studies topics like transitional justice. He was an amazing seminar leader, and the course was very well-planned. Reading was sometimes (not always) on the heavy-end by their nature, but they offer very useful perspectives that link up well as comparative pieces during one class, and in dialogue with each other across sections. The assignments, an 8-page mid-term and 15-20 page final paper were totally doable and the class was stimulating in many ways.",
    "Take this course. The topic is interesting as are the readings. It is easy to balance the readings with your other class work and having the class meet once a week allows on to engage with and think about the readings and come to class ready to discuss and engage with others. Sometimes the discussions can get a little off topic but it's still interesting to see how people think."
