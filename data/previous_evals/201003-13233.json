   "comments": [
    "Solid course about a crucial part in today's world, though it understandably skips a lot of material. Focuses on political history with a minor interest in the region's relations with the Western world. Prof. Foster is a good lecturer and very helpful. If you take excellent notes the readings are unnecessary.",
    "Amazing. Ben Foster is an expert lecturer. This course will allow you to contextualize the situation in the Middle East presently to better understand current events. The course readings, while overwhelming, are incredible interesting.",
    "I would take it if you want a good base knowledge and are willing to work hard at actually remembering all of the course work. It's very easy to let things slide and then cram before the midterm and final, but to really know the material you have to put a lot more work in.",
    "This is a traditional survey course of ME history, from Muhammed through present day--take it if you're at all interested in Middle East affairs. The ancient\/middle ages history gets a bit boring, but is really important to understand what happens in the OE\/post-WWI stages. Midterm and final are both reasonable. Go to the optional section--writing a term paper in this class would change it from a relaxed survey course to an intense history focus.",
    "I definitely learned a lot of information relevant to my understanding of current affairs in the Middle East, but people interested in taking this course cannot forget that it is truly a history course. I knew this going into the course, but I was hoping that connections to current events would be more heavily emphasized. The second half of the course if much more interesting as it traces the different countries in the middle east from the 1800s to modern day. The course requires A LOT of reading, some of which really is never touched upon in class and not required on the exams.Professor Foster is an impressive lecturer with vast amounts of knowledge about the subject area. At the end of each lecture, Professor Foster showed pictures that made the history more tangible.There is an incredible amount of information covered though, so studying for the exams was a hassle. Be warned that you will only get a very good grade on the exams though if you incorporate information from the reading that was not mentioned in lecture though. So make sure to take reading notes.I would recommend this course to students who are really interested in the subject and are willing to put the LARGE amount of works that it requires. If you are just interested in the subject and want to take it as a \"fun\" class (like I did,) I would probably discourage you.",
    "Midterm, final, friday classes to opt out of the semester term paper. Learn about the Middle East (from Spain to Afghanistan) from Muhammad (570 AD) to today. It is a broad overview that gives anyone the basic knowledge and vocabulary to understand anything you see in the news today. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Its a great survey course of Middle Eastern history; its relevant, interesting and well taught. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This course covers Middle Eastern history from the time of Muhammad to the present. It is a lot of information, but it is all very relevant to an understanding of the modern middle east. I would absolutely recommend taking this class. The subject material is interesting, and it is very well taught.",
    "This is a comprehensive course covering the Middle East from the time of Muhammad until today. It provides a very good basis knowledge of the region and should be a good starting point for delving into deeper knowledge of aspecific area of interest. That being said, the model for this course is not one I think I will be taking again...the knowledge base was simply far too wide for me and there were so many readings that I feel that I couldn't get a deep enough understanding of any of it.",
    "NELC 102 is a course about the history of the Middle East since Muhammad. It is not a course about contemporary issues in the Middle East. There is a lot of reading for the course, but I highly recommend reading all of it, because the texts are well selected and provide the necessary detail to understand better the historical context of the lectures. I loved this course and found that I learned a great deal about a topic about which I knew almost nothing upon enrolling in the course. The course can be taken in three ways, and the writing credit section is far more work intensive than the other ways to take the course. If not taken for a writing credit, the course only consists of two exams and maybe one paper (depending on attendance of the optional classes). For the writing credit the workload includes three papers along with the two exams. Regardless of the workload, though, I recommend this class to absolutely anyone interested in learning about the Middle East.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. The material is fascinating and very relevant to today's discussions about the Middle East. One of the best classes I've had at Yale. I also highly recommend taking the writing section - even though it involves more reading, it's worth it. Also, you only write 3 essays and it counts for a writing credit - and you get to pick your own topic for all the essays.",
    "Intro to the Middle East is an engaging lecture that gives a broad overview of the history of the Middle East starting with the Muhammad and the Muslim Conquests and ending with the present day. Prof. Foster is an incredible teacher and gives great insight into both the past and the present of the Middle East. I am extremely sad that I have already taken his other class and will miss his lectures. This is a lecture that is absolutely worth waking up for at 9 am on Mondays and Wednesdays.",
    "I would recommend not so much the course but the professor to every Yale student. His exams are a test of our knowledge of the subject's instrumental framework and themes, not so much specific details. I felt the exams were fair questions, not just memorization or reliance of rarely occurring vocabulary. There are not tricks for his exams, something of which not all professors are innocent.",
    "Take it! Especially if you're thinking of taking other courses in the region -- it's a great base line and covers a lot of material in a very manageable, understandable way.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn at least something about the middle east. If you have an interest in the region, this will provide a great introduction to it.",
    "This class is really what you make of it. You could get away with doing little of the reading and getting a decent grade, or you could do all the reading and the writing section and get a whole lot more out of it. The Middle East is a region of the world that is I think in many cases misunderstood or mischaracterized, so I think it's incredibly important to learn more about it. If you have the time in your schedule, take the writing section, because you'll end up getting a lot more out of the course.",
    "This is a wonderful course for people who know nothing about the Middle East. I could not have asked for a better introductory class. I found the syllabus very well organized and the lectures engaging. The readings were very long and sometimes interesting, but they weren't essential for understanding the course material. It's hard to study for the midterm and final but Prof. Foster gives hints throughout the semester on what kind of questions he'll ask. I suggest taking the optional Friday class so you don't have to write the term paper (during reading week, I regretted not taking the optional class).",
    "Solid survey of Middle Eastern history. Prof. Foster gives straightforward lectures that give you a sense of major events. Not the place to go for specific studies on topics such as Israel, Iran, Iraq, Islam but will give you general history and facts about these and many more topics.",
    "A fact\/date\/event memorization based history course that provides a cursory overview of some Middle Eastern topics from 570AD-present. Half of the course is spent on pre-WWI history, little of which has to do with the contemporary political structure of the Middle East, which is what I went into the course wanting to learn. The latter half of the course attempts to go through a huge amount of material in a very short timespan, and in general, the course is rather intellectually unsatisfying. An easy enough grade, but somewhat boring as well. Unless you are particularly interested, avoid and do some independent Wikipedia surfing about the Middle East to learn about these things.",
    "Take this class if you know nothing about the middle east. All in all, I'm really glad I took this class because I feel like I can now have an intelligent conversation about the region. This class does NOT cover current events though, so just know that. It also is a ton of information about a ton of countries over many years. This means the tests are nightmares to study for--so much memorization. I've never pulled an all nighter until this class. That being said though, if you go to the optional classes on friday, you only have to take a midterm and final, which means the day-to-day work for the class is pretty minimal. Most of the reading is worthless, except for the Bunton book which is amazing and will really help you do well on the exams.",
    "YES! Definitely, take it! I knew nothing about the Middle East before taking this course, and even though a lot is covered really quickly, I feel as though I was able to get a great overview of the region. If you know nothing of this region and would like to learn, take this class! Prof Foster is an engaging, highly knowledgeable lecturer.",
    "A must-take Yale course for anyone who hopes to understand anything about Middle East politics and current events. Professor Foster presents the information in a comprehensive, straightforward manner. He is someone from the old-school who has a tendency to hyperbolize the history or infuse bias into the presentation. However, this should not deter anyone from sitting in on every lecture. If you can, take the writing section which actually has some really interesting readings if you can find time for it. Plus, the TAs have historically been excellent (mine was). Really a top notch course.",
    "Can be a bit dry but its useful material presented in an easy manner.",
    "TAKE TAKE TAKE. Ben Foster is the man! this is a 9:00 a.m. class but I tried my best never to miss it because their's nothing like Foster's dry wit to get your day started. I also think it was quite an accomplishment covering such a span of history (roughly 1500 years) and such a wide region in this period. Foster did a good job.He was also able to tread some very delicate territory and give a forthright treatment of some very polarizing issues. This is the first class at Yale i've taken about the Middle East that provided some nuance to the Israel\/Palestine issue. Foster showed courage when he contextualized the violence and showed that terrorism was a tactic employed by both sides. He also gave a very frank account of the different Arab countries in the region, which left me feeling deflated about the whole situation.The class also isn't terribly difficult and the material is interesting and relevant.",
    "This is a great course with a great lecturer. It's a ton of information covering a ton of time. If you really feel passionate about this, then you can get a lot out of it, especially if you have an idea of what it is you're most in it to learn. The ending of the course felt a bit rushed (the more modern stuff) and could really deserve more time. It could be, in all honesty, two courses. But all in all, if you're interested in the Middle East, I strongly recommend it.",
