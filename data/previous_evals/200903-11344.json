   "comments": [
    "This course is a fairly broad survey of a wide variety of Spanish texts. Prof Estrella divides the course into two categories: texts about love, the philosophy of love, emotion, personal inquiry, etc; and texts about art's interpretation of history and the nation. I wouldn't recommend this course to someone who's unfamiliar with Spanish literature. Students who hadn't taken AP lit, for instance, were at a disadvantage because they had difficulty placing the texts in some context. The course is very enjoyable, and not demanding. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "This seminar is very enjoyable and sheds new perspectives on Spanish literature. Prof Estrella is one of a kind, and certainly makes the class what it is! You read a wide range of literature and certainly glean new insight after discussions in class. However, Prof Estrella rarely offered mainly guidelines as to his expectations for the class (regarding projects and papers), which sometimes made completing those assignments difficult. Nevertheless, I personally thoroughly enjoyed taking this course and thought it shed new light on how to read\/interpret literature in any language!",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Do not come into it expecting a survey course or introduction to Spanish Literature--the reading is mostly poetry and is selected by theme and topic rather than by time period or country of origin--but if you want an interesting and engaging first L5 Spanish class, I'd definitely recommend it. The reading load wasn't very heavy, and we only wrote three papers, but with all of the in class participation asked of us I definitely feel like my Spanish has improved, and I learned a lot of interesting stuff. Professor Estrella is great, too; much more lively and forthright than most Yale professors, which can take some adjusting to, but he's a really smart and interesting guy, and he genuinely wants his students to do well. Take it!",
    "This is a course about expression and thought in a general sense, with case studies in spanish literature. It is very incorporative, and one feels fulfilled afterwards in that the course is very \"fleshed-out\" with sources.",
    "I think that this class is definitely an interesting way to fulfill one's language requirement. If you enjoy literature\/reading in spanish, it's a really fun way to also work on your Spanish. At the same time, however, I do not feel as though it is a class where you really improve your language skills in any way. Although you may improve at reading, we never did any speaking exercises of any kind and only had 3 writing assignments all term.",
    "An excellent, and not exceedingly difficult, course. The readings are generally very interesting and provide a good background in important Spanish authors. Although the readings are time-consuming, especially if you have never taken a Spanish lit course before, there is very little other work and classes are enjoyable. Ernesto's accent takes some getting used to, even for native speakers, but he understands that and will help move the class discussion along if people are confused. Ernesto is an excellent, genial professor who loves telling funny anecdotes but can also speak at length about Kafka and metaphysics. Although there are no tests, quizzes, or vocab lists, the class will definitely improve your Spanish, probably without you realizing it until the end of the semester. A great freshman seminar.",
    "I loved this Freshman Seminar. Our readings were interesting and occasionally rather difficult. Thinking about literature in a different language, especially to the depth that we approached it, was invigorating. Prof. Estrella is a standout professor who is unparalleled in his knowledge of literature and philosophy from around the world. In class, he would bring this to the students through his monologues while leaving plenty of time for discussion. Perhaps the only weakness of the class is that we do not spend much time on writing. I would definitely recommend it as a freshman seminar.",
    "I would enthusiastically recommend this class to another student! It was a great opportunity to be able to discuss literature with other freshmen and to get to know one another in such a relaxed setting. The pacing was fine too, with one week per work or set of poems. I truly enjoyed reading the literature Professor Estrella provided, as well as listening to his own insights on the works.Professor Estrella was an incredible professor. He chose excellent works of literature for us to read, including both poems, books, and short stories. What I appreciated very much was the freedom to connect the Spanish literature we read to other works, not only American works but works from the ancient world, and even other European countries. What was perhaps Professor Estrella's greatest strength was how he would never intimidate anyone or force anyone to speak during discussions, and he would always listen to what you had to say. The workload is also not bad at all, and very open-ended. The \"reflections\" are not meant to be intense, they are relatively short papers, which encourage you to think creatively. I had hardly read much Spanish literature in high school, and taking this class was very helpful. I would highly recommend it to freshmen who are interested in reading Spanish literature and meeting new people!",
    "Take this class. I like poetry now; before it seemed silly, like a hobby only girl or emotional men got into. Now, I really enjoy listening to poetry. I also feel like my confidence to speak and write spanish could not possibly get any higher after surviving each (progressively less) nerve-wracking lecture. You will fear and love this class in equal measure. And there's hardly any homework! What there is will help you learn, though.",
    "This class reminded me a lot of my high school 5 AP class in terms of the depth of analysis and the nature of the texts that we read, but it did not have the stress that came with my 5 AP class, because we weren't writing essays about each text. The majority of the works I had not seen, and Professor Estrella did a good job of picking texts that weren't on the Spanish student's typical reading list. I liked that the class was relatively loose in its daily structure, and I liked that each student had to do a small presentation. Some amazing discussions came about as a result of those presentations.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class if you want to expand your knowledge of spanish literature and poetry.",
    "It's a good class to take in the sense that it doesn't require tons of work, but class could feel very long sometimes and some of the pieces we read could be a bit boring. Professor Estrella is good, but only take this class if you are really into Spanish Literature or kind of know some background on the subject."
