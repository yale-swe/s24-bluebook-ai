    "It's required for Theater majors, as it should be. If non-theater majors are interested in developing acting technique and refining their talent, I'd recommend the class.",
    "If you want to learn acting, this is the class for you. It's a great hands-on experience. Toni is the best. She's fun and interesting and always has funny stories. More than that though, she's a fantastic teacher and friend. She invests in her students so that by the end of the course she is not only a professor, but a mentor and confidant.",
    "The funny thing about Thst 210 is that no section is even remotely similar. Therefore, it is hard to make a 'recommendation', particularly because it is a requirement for the theater major. But if you do have an opportunity to take 210 with Toni, DO IT!!!!",
    "Yes. It's a chance to put theory into practice after taking THST110\/111.",
    "This section was based heavily on Uta Hagen's exercises and the works of Anton Chekhov. We learned a great deal about both artists and performing their works was a rewarding experience; I learned a great deal about having acting choices \"land\" on you, affecting your scene parter, and granting immediacy to every moment onstage.",
    "it really depends on who your professor is. not consistent in terms of content or quality, so far as I have seen.",
    "THST 210 is an amazing class, as long as you have Professor Dorfman. She is crazy in all the right ways. He is both demanding and extremely supportive. Most of the class consists of performing acting exercises, although Professor Dorfman permits her students to act out a scene from one of Chekhov's plays at the end of the semester as a sort of final project. The course can be quite emotionally draining, but otherwise has a very manageable workload. I would definitely recommend this class to someone.",
    "Yes! Take it!"
