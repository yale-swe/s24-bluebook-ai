    "The idea behind \"Anthropological Theory\" is to give undergrads a chance to do what you might do as a first-year grad student in Anthropology: take a crash-course in the \"greatest hits\" of twentieth-century anthro theory. So the class follows the arc from Durkheim (when anthro and sociology weren't two different things yet) into sociocultural anthro today.This has been one of the most valuable, enjoyable, challenging, worthwhile, and amazing classes I have ever taken. The readings are some of the densest ones out there, but if you give them a shot you'll find that you both trace a long history of how academics have thought about the production of knowledge (which will make you see everything around you in a new light, and probably fundamentally alter how you approach every other course you take at Yale), and they teach you to think more like an anthro theorist (I know that sounds weird; take the class and hopefully it will make more sense...). You write four or five papers that are supposedly about 1,000 words but generally end up being 1,500 to 2,000.In 2013, Sara Shneiderman taught this class. She is extremely good at explaining complex ideas in simple, colloquial, even understated terms. This leads to relaxed but blow-your-mind kinds of discussions. We were also lucky to have a very small class. In sum, probably the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "I recommend that all students with an interest in anthropology take this course. we read a lot of classic theorists who are all very important to the field.",
    "Anth: 311 is a \"great books\" course that covers functionalism, structuralism, and post-structuralism in a mostly chronological order. I think this class should be required of all Anthropology majors, concurrently with ANTH303: Field Methods in Cultural Anthropology. After this course, many themes including universalism, relativism, structure and agency, history, synchrony and diachrony, and post-modernism will be more approachable. Take this course! It is excellent! There will be a lot of writing, though. Writing consists of 5 2000 word essays, but they are all excellent exercises in relating theories in anthropology.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any other student. I think a class in anthropology is an interesting addition for science as well as humanities major.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. The class is an overview of how anthropological thought has developed. By studying different societal systems, the class teaches you about how humanity comes to organize itself. The class should be mandatory for all anthropology majors, and for those students who just want to learn about life from a new, interesting perspective, the class will not disappoint."
