    "Students are required to engage in close readings of texts of a manageable length. This is excellent. I was very happy to engage with a combination of musical and philosophical, &c, sources.",
    "The structure and breadth of the class was one of its biggest strengths. We were able to survey three very different slices of music history in surprising depth through a unifying Foucauldian\/Peircean lens. The breadth of the course could easily have filled 2 semesters, maybe even 3, but I felt satisfied with our treatment of each case study.",
    "The workload of this class is extremely high only because of the density of the reading, and I don't think that the density should be changed. But I think that this should have been offset by reducing the number of readings slightly: there were weeks when some of the readings were largely extraneous to our discussions, or we did not have time to discuss them. Consider switching some of these reading to \"suggested further readings\". I never understood what this course focused on. Does the course provide an historical survey of interactions between music and text on the level of particular compositions? Does it seek to understand the \"conditions of possibility\" behind such relationships? If so, the only unit that accessed this level was the madrigal unit. (I suspect that I disagree with you about the Schubert unit.) Does it seek epistemic shifts as in Foucault? If so, why is it ostensibly about music and language? I recognize that the course is as much about learning how to think critically as it is covering any particular subject matter, but if the content is going to be as amorphous in the future, the course description needs to reflect this. That said, I do appreciate the effort to grapple with these extremely and complex questions in a seminar. Class discussions were good, but your questions aimed to elicit specific responses and guide us a long a predetermined path rather than truly open up the materials for discussion. I found this frustrating. Accordingly, I most enjoyed your comments at the beginnings and ends of classes, and found them extremely insightful."

    "Yes!",
    "Yes, without hesitation. The course struck a characteristic balance between musicological concerns and broader concerns, but I felt that the class would have benefited from non-musicological perspectives at some points. So I would especially recommend the course to students outside of the department."
