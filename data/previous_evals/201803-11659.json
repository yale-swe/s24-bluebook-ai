    "I learnt basic concepts in music. The most helpful thing I took out of this class was about composing songs and identifying chords in songs.",
    "How to read\/write western music, the basic fundamentals of western music notation, creating melodies and harmonies in a western style, and an insight on what makes popular western music sound the way it does.",
    "This class, being an introduction to music theory, was just that. I learned all of the necessary tools to write and understand music at a basic level.",
    "I gained basic concepts of music theory",
    "Learned how to compose my own music"

    "Strength: It is very suitable for beginners, the knowledge taught is very useful. For weakness: the course may provide more chances for student to \"Learn by doing\"",
    "It can be really fast-paced if you had no previous exposure to music theory. It's sort of designed to be easier for students who play instruments too.",
    "Strengths: Great introduction to music theory, even if you have no musical experience before this class. Weaknesses: Low engagement level",
    "I think the amount of information in the course was balanced well with the time we had this semester (with the small caveat that I felt like there wasnt enough new content coming at me at times). One large problem is the lack of standardization across the different sections of this class, from content covered, to genres observed. From hearing my other friends experiences in their respective sections, I felt both grateful and robbed.",
    "should be more practice, a combination of theory and hearing",
    "we could have a more consistent way of learning to compose at the end of the semester"

    "Yes, this is a great way to get an introduction into music theory.",
    "If youre looking for an in to the music world, this class was exactly that for me. If you wanna learn to write music (starting that journey at least), or read sheet music for performance this class is for you.",
    "Yes, good course for non music major students as a introductory courses.",
