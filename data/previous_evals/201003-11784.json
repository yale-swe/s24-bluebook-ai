   "comments": [
    "I took this class looking to reinforce my existing Spanish-speaking skills before taking a higher level class. While the course definitely helped me practice my speaking, it didn't live up to the expectations that I had for it. My accent and pronunciation definitely improved, but if you are looking for a course which will help you improve your fluency with grammar, this is not that course. Overall, the class was all right. Some of the assignments seemed pointless.",
    "Take this class if you want to keep up your conversational skills. Don't expect to go into depth in any of the topics, except the novella which you spend about a month on. Also don't expect to get much grammar instruction. Don't take this course if you feel you're extremely well prepared in Spanish--take a literature class, for example, or the grammar equivalent to this.You get a course packet with a lot of readings about topics from tango to immigration, which provides a good variety. The workload is extremely manageable; there are a few written assignments, a couple vocab quizzes, and two oral exams. I almost always did my work the morning of class. The most important thing is to just be prepared for class and you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 150 to any student who wishes to improve his or her speaking and listening skills in conversational Spanish. I feel that this class helped me to be faster and more spontaneous while conversing in Spanish.",
    "I didn't feel like it was the best way to improve, and I would probably take a lit, film or other L5 class instead. And for a conversational spanish, we spoke surprisingly little. However, some people found it really helpful, so shop it and shop multiple professors.",
    "for a conversational class, we did a lot of writing, reading, and watched video clips. We didn't do that much CONVERSATIONAL talking as I expected.",
    "A good class for keeping up your Spanish skills but not necessarily improving them considerably. I did enjoy the class and met lots of great students; the class was a positive experience, but I didn't get as much out of it as I had hoped. Terry is a very nice professor, although she does grade the written homework a little tough since there were always small grammar mistakes that I would make without realizing it and without fully understanding how to fix them. Get a good partner for the oral exams, and start preparing as far in advance as possible to do well.",
    "Although Spanish 150 is fundamentally a conversational class, don't be fooled, a lot of effort must be put in, both inside and outside the classroom. In fact, in terms of workload, it was one of my most demanding classes in the semester. However, the experience is completely worth it. Although harder than some of the other L5 options at Yale, Spanish 150 will greatly enhance your conversational skills, leaving you almost fluent by the end of the semester. Don't worry about your conversational skills at the beginning of the class. Although there will be kids more fluent than you, your skills will improve almost exponentially with more exposure. Moreover, effort is worth a lot more than correctness in the evaluation of the grade. And finally, Terry Seymour is an amazing, engaging professor who will encourage you to reach your greatest linguistic potential. Take her if you can.",
    "Spanish 150 will probably help improve your conversational Spanish. The class was interesting for about half of the semester, and then began to become a bit boring. However, if you want to get better speaking Spanish, this is probably a good course to take.",
    "I would be hard-pressed to recommend this class to anyone. Spanish 150 is an okay course if your grammar is flawless but you want practice speaking. If you still need practice with the subjunctive, or you think your Spanish might be a bit rusty, or haven't taken a Spanish class in awhile, you would learn a lot more by taking a grammar course.However, I think you could improve your speaking equally well by taking one of the other L5 Spanish courses in a certain topic (e.g. literature), and the course material would be much more engaging and interesting.",
    "Spanish 150 is a great, easy way to get your language requirement out of the way if you took AP Spanish in high school and got a 5 on the AP exam. It didn't really improve my Spanish, but it helped me to at least maintain the level that I had achieved in high school. The class consists mostly of reading articles, short stories, etc for homework and then talking about them for the entire class period. Unless you want to start a new language, this is a good place to finish or begin your study of Spanish at Yale after you've taken the AP."
