    "I had taken CS201 previously, and in this class, I was finally able to apply my knowledge! Really exciting material - you learn a lot about the basic electronics and digital logic, and their implementations in processors and how computers work on the low level.",
    "A deeper understanding for the different parts of a computer processor and how they work together to create the machines upon which we rely so heavily.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of computer architecture, especially in relation to writing SystemVerilog code.",
    "I became much more comfortable with my electrical engineering skills after this course, and I really feel as though I learned how a computer is organized and works!",
    "This class was sort of confusing in that it spanned a great deal of topics but did not delve very deeply into any of them. The projects were interesting and the professor was great but otherwise the material was fairly dry.",
    "I have gained a very solid understanding of how computers\/processors work and how they can be implemented. And learned all related to those subjects, from data storage to boolean algebra.",
    "I learned how to get all the way from raw transistors to a functioning processor chip!",
    "I learned the basics of computer engineering from the perspective of electrical engineers. I learned to work in the EE lab and about simple processors and System Verilog coding.",
    "I learned a lot about computer engineering, including how to design an ARM processor.",
    "A ton of digital electronics and computer organization; FPGA & Verilog.",
    "kmaps",
    "I learned a lot about how computers work, the timing of signals, and storage elements. The course covered many topics besides these but I had already been exposed to them in CS 201.",
    "Really learned a lot about the basics of components used in present day technology and computer architecture, while seeing application of these concepts in lab",
    "Digital logic, constructing breadboards, coding in System Verilog, and working with FPGA",
    "Great intro to the field of Computer Architecture. Solid basic understanding of logic and components of a microprocessor.",
    "I learned about the intersection of hardware and software. I learned about everything from logic gates and boolean algebra to arithmetic circuits and the design of a simple processor. I learned how to solve those kinds of problems and I learned how to implement some of those things on a breadboard as well as on a hardware description language that simulates hardware.",
    "I learned about the basics of computer architecture and about Hardware Description Languages (though, I do not feel very confident at all on the HDL skills).",
    "In this class I gained a better understanding of how computers operate down to the digital circuit level. I also learned how these operations translates to hardware and how this hardware can be realized on FPGA boards.",
    "Learnt about ARM architecture, digital logic, combinatorial and sequential circuits. Also developed the skill of coding in Verilog.",
    "I developed a fundamental basis for computer engineering, learning first boolean algebra, using K-maps, understanding finite-state machines and the different types of flip flops, and finally how to build a microprocessor. I also learned some more practical skills through labs, such as how to use a breadboard and how to use FPGA boards with the Quartus program.",
    "From binary numbers to combinatorial and sequential circuits to microprocessors, this class ultimately taught me how CPUs work. I learned a lot about how computers work, and even got to learn about assembly code and machine language. At the end of the course we got to a basic ARM microprocessor.",
    "I learned all about digital circuitry, logic, and a bit of coding.",
    "This is a great class that really doesn't require any prereq knowledge, and is very practical and fun. I really enjoyed it, and the labs were very helpful in becoming more confident with basic computer engineering concepts.",
    "I learned about electrical circuits, logic gates, computer architecture and assembly code. I learned how to make a simple microprocessor and program a real-life vending machine!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were definitely in the labs and the homeworks- they were the way I learned the best. I think the weaknesses were the way the labs were structured- you have to write up a lot of code",
    "The course is, overall, very well structured and well taught. I'll just point out a few areas where it could use some improvement: 1. SystemVerilog, though an integral part of later labs, is never really discussed in lecture. This can be quite frustrating when working on the final project, yet still falling prey to silly syntax errors that the compiler is not very helpful in identifying. A more rigorous and complete introduction to the language in class would benefit the labs greatly. 2. The final few lectures, though they attempted to draw connections from the simple concepts to higher levels of abstraction, left me a little lost in class. Perhaps these explanations could be revisited to make them more clear.",
    "This is a class that deserves greater investment from Yale. The homework assignments and exams are very manageable, and the class is well-taught. The professor, however, desperately needs a structured team of teaching assistants or undergraduate learning assistants who understand the material as fully and deeply as he does. Many times, it was virtually impossible to get an email response to questions, due to the fact that there is not an established team to assist the professor. This class is one of the best I have taken at Yale, but it could be made much better and less stressful by implementing office hours and an online forum, in addition to establishing a team of TAs and ULAs.",
    "This course does a great job of giving students hands on experience in the inner workings of computer architecture and logic! I really enjoyed all of the labs, though the last one could have been a bit better organized.",
    "I thought that more help would have helped for the projects and the labs, for example having more TA's etc. Additionally, this class would benefit from having a discussion section to talk about the specific problems brought up in class.",
    "The labs the course had were enjoyable, but at the same time could be a nightmare if you did not know where to start. Part of the strength of the course was the bonding of the students and the help of the TF's. Some weaknesses include the lack of immediate feedback on assignments that made progress seem fuzzy and hard to judge - making course engagement lag a little.",
    "Material was clearly taught and well organized. The labs followed closely what we did in lecture. My only suggestion is that the class might have benefited from a fast-paced lecture on the right approach to, the syntax, and the \"gotchas\" of System Verilog: even if were too much to understand in one lecture, the slides would be great for reviewing the things we need in the labs. I think we did talk a little in lecture about Verilog, but perhaps only the hyper-simple \"or c, a, b\" type syntax that isn't practical to use in real programs.",
    "Interesting material and course. Takes a lot of time with labs. Weakness: class usually down-curved even though its not that easy,",
    "Jakub is definitely a strength of this course... He knew the content very well. Some of the labs were very cool, but the last two labs were huge failures. Creating an ARM processor and programming a soda machine, while very intriguing, took much more time than anyone expected. For the processor, Jakub should've provided us the skeleton code from week 1 to ease the project's pains. Additionally, he should've done a better job explaining the components of the processor: while we eventually covered them all in lecture, they should've been covered earlier (before we started programming the processor) so we knew when we started programming how everything interacted with each other. The last third of the course was definitely the weakest part, since it was a true lecture. I appreciate the slides, but I wish Jakub would've made it more interactive. The last weakness of this class was the competitive aspect: after getting the 90% portion of labs, I would help other students get to the 90% mark. However, this took away from time I could've spent going the extra mile. For this to be a great Yale class, the competitive aspects need to be eliminated.",
    "This is a rollercoaster of a course. But not just any old rollercoaster, but one of those rollercoasters that slowly pulls you back up a ramp and then releases you at the speed of sound down a neverending incline. That was this class. It was split into thirds; the first two thirds, encompassing basic logic, were not too bad. The last third all of a sudden used these simple concepts to discuss the construction of a full-fledged CPU and other elements of computer architecture. This was such a significant break from the rest of the class that many of us were very surprised (then again, this is not to say that the class needs to be easier. However, maybe the first two thirds should be sped up so that more time can be spent on the incredibly complex processor unit). Labs also became rather disorganized, as the last two projects were incredibly complex compared to the first two and took lots of TA time to help debug, etc. Furthermore, FPGA design was done in SystemVerilog, but we were never really taught verilog... this mostly consisted of giving us (screenshotted) code snippets which we had to retype into the IDE. It would have been much more helpful if we actually learned the basics of verilog first. However, this was a strong class in a number of ways. Lectures were never too fast and were very clear; Prof Szefer is very helpful and accommodating to student concerns. And as an EECS major, I had a ton of fun learning the course material & getting to work with FPGAs.",
    "Professor needs to respond to his emails more often!",
    "The course starts out pretty slow, especially for students who have already taken CS 201, and then covers a ton of material in the last few weeks. Also, I think that the final section of the course (focusing on the ARM processor) emphasizes memorizing over understanding too much. A strength of this course is how much it ties its content to the real world. The labs deal with interesting, real-life subjects and the focus on processor architecture is interesting as well.",
    "Labs were quite hard in the end, but rewarding when you finally got it to work",
    "The topics are interesting and Jakub is very kind and helpful. The first few labs were well fleshed out and enjoyable to complete. The last two labs, however were far more challenging and I would've preferred more introduction into System verilog and FPGA programming. It just seemed like a really big leap in how challenging the topics and labs were from the first half of the course and the second half.",
    "Strengths include Prof. Jakub's friendliness and great nature, clear and straightforward lectures, comprehensive notes, high level of engagement, and fair exams. Weaknesses may include the ramp up in difficulty from the beginning and middle of the course towards the last project, the microprocessor, although it is probably necessary.",
    "Some strengths of the course are the material, the projects, and the professor. I think the breadth and depth of knowledge covered was very good, and what we learned was very interesting and gave me a solid sense of an area that I was previously less familiar with. I thought the homeworks and exams were reasonable, and the projects were a really fun way to actually practice the material we learned. Two weaknesses were first that sometimes grading took a long time which sometimes made it hard to gauge how well I actually understood the material before exams. Second, I loved the last project a LOT but I thought it would have been helpful to have it broken up into testable pieces, because it was very difficult to begin. But don't get rid of the project because it was awesome, a highlight of the class for me.",
    "What is taught in class and what is assigned in homework and projects do not have the strongest of correlations. Especially with our final project, there was not enough of a bridge between the general concepts we learned in class and the actual application of it in the project. I think more attention needs to be paid to actually applying concepts once the class gets out of basic logic gates\/circuits.",
    "Lectures are solid and problem sets and exams are fair. There are many resources available for anyone who needs help, including Prof. Szefer. Labs, however, carry a very high difficulty curve for anyone new to the material. Lab procedures should be better explained to students as this is an intro level course. Many of us didn't know much about breadboards, FPGAs, and SystemVerilog, making labs extremely frustrating and time-consuming.",
    "This course provided a good mix of practical experience and classroom learn by incorporating labs to reinforce topics covered in lecture.",
    "Great course. Professor Jakub is a brilliant teacher, and the material in the course is also very interesting.",
    "Strengths of this course include the dense material that we cover and how fast we move through it. We were able to understand how to build a finite state machine by the end of the course considering we began the course learning about boolean algebra. The labs were also a strength of the class as I learned a lot, and we were able to achieve some very fun and engaging tasks. Weaknesses include that I thought the material taught in the course was very lopsided: it was very easy in the beginning, but by the last third of the class, it became very challenging. Another weakness is that though the labs were challenging (as they should be), it was hard to get help from the professor\/teaching fellows, as there was only one lab session per week, and a lot of students to only three possible advisors.",
    "Course instruction started really strong. The class lost a lot of structure after the second midterm. There was not a lot of guidance on the final project.",
    "This course was very interesting, however, it was also challenging and there were no planned office hours. Instead help on projects or psets had to be arranged by appointment which was sometimes quite the hassle. It would sometimes take more than a day to try to schedule a meeting which resulted in lower grades on assignments. This class would be perfect with more help\/guidance on projects and psets through stable, weekly office hours.",
    "I honestly think this class is great the way it is. The only thing is that we didn't get real feedback on the homework when it was returned, but I guess one could always go meet with Prof. Szefer or the TF's for detailed feedback to actually aid in understanding and moving forward from mistakes. Things also didn't really get graded on a normal timeline, everything got graded and returned in two chunks in the semester, and it would have been helpful to have things back in a more gradual manner.",
    "Professor Szefer was a great lecturer who understood where we were struggling and understood our concerns. The TAs in the labs were very helpful. The only thing I think could improve the course is that a lot of material we had only minimally covered ended up as being topics on the final exam and we were given short notice that these would be topics, but that's my only critique."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! A great introductory course in the EENG 200-203 selections. Jakub is a very strong and compassionate professor who will go out of his way to help you understand the material. This course also gives you a strong sense of what the EE major is like - would definitely recommend. You also get to do several very cool projects\/labs- like vending a soda machine!",
    "201 is an excellent overview of how computers work on a nitty-gritty level. In many ways, it mirrors and complements the concepts and ideas taught in CPSC 201, but from a different perspective. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a better (though slightly technical, not qualitative) understanding of how computers are built and how they operate. Be sure to also consider the time commitment of the lab portion of the class, which allows you to apply the skills you learn in class to actual circuits and machines, but can take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours a week depending on your level of investment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The assignments are fair, and the labs helped greatly in seeing how computer engineering has real-world applications. The soda machine programming lab was especially satisfying in this regard.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to both EE majors and non-EE majors because the material is genuinely interesting and Jakub is genuinely a great professor, probably one of the best in the EE department!",
    "I did not enjoy this course because beyond the professor, there was very little useful help. While the material was interesting, it was frustrating having to work exclusively with other students in order to understand the homework and projects. More outside of the class help would greatly enhance this course.",
    "If you are looking for a course that will provide insight into computers then this is the course for you. This course is not really a course where you build circuits or program all the time, if this is the case look into CS. It may also seem like an easier course, but towards the end of the semester the material ramps up fairly quickly in difficulty, so be prepared. All in all, this course was a nice course that adds space and spice to schedules, but I would be wary if you are not super interested in the material.",
    "If this class isn't required for you, it could be a lot of fun for a CS or ME major that wants to get a better grasp on how computers actually work. As a CS major myself, I found the course easy, but still super interesting! You get to learn System Verilog and work with FPGA's which pose a completely different programming paradigm than you might be used to. I loved it.",
    "Interesting and challenging. Lab components are fun. Beware the curve",
    "This class embodies what Yale is not. For projects in this class, if you meet certain criteria, then you receive a 90%. To receive a 100%, though, you experiment on your own, and then your grade is assessed on a sliding scale, where the most elaborate additions are given a full 100%. Additionally, this class is downcurved: a grade in the 90s does not equate to an automatic A\/A-. These aspects force students to focus on competition instead of collaboration: students don't always help out others in lab because they don't want them to get the full 100% on labs. Yale's environment is heavily focused on being collaborative--it's one of the reasons why I chose Yale--and this class breaks that. Therefore, I would not recommend this class. Jakub is a wonderful person, but for as long as he downcurves his students, I cannot recommend him as a professor.",
    "If you like digital logic & the inner workings, this is a pretty good class. Hopefully in future labs the last unit on the CPU won't feel as rushed and labs will be improved.",
    "Cool Projects",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they were interested in majoring in EE or EECS. This is because, especially with the final lab and section, this course is too difficult for it to be worth it to someone not majoring in the field.",
    "This class is a lot of work in labs if you don't handle timing correctly. Also some of the later concepts can take some time to grasp",
    "Yes, interesting topics! Be wary of the last few labs though",
    "Great intro to Computer Architecture, a course that may help entice you to study EE or EECS along with the other intros like EE200. Goes well with\/after CS201. Not necessary to take freshman year, but great class to use to get ahead and take less core classes sophomore year, or get going on advanced courses. Really enjoyable. Material can get dry, but homeworks are challenging and will snap you back to reality. Exams are fair. Lab every week can be a bit of work.",
    "I would absolutely recommend EENG 201, especially with Prof. Jakub Szefer. It was a really interesting class, and I felt that the homeworks, exams, and grading were all very reasonable. There is a bit of extra work due to the lab projects, but they were some of the most fun parts of the class and worth it, I think. I really learned a lot and Jakub is a great lecturer and a great resource. He was incredibly helpful and kind. Sometimes he can be slow to grade things. I think this class has a reputation for curving down, but I did not experience that-- the cutoffs for grades were what I'd expect for any other class (not a curve up, but not harsh).",
    "Absolutely NOT. I really would not recommend this course to another student. I took it because I thought it'd be a good complement to Intro to Computer Science. While there was some value in learning both of these topics, this course did not teach me what I thought it would. It was poorly taught; the professor is nice, but that's about where it ends for him. The TAs were as helpful as they could be given that the only people who knew what were going on were the people who seemed to only care about this class. I was lost just about all of the time and didn't really know what to do to catch up or get help. The projects seem really great and flashy at the beginning of the semester: DO NOT BE FOOLED. They are not fun, and are maybe only somewhat interesting, but any interest you have will go down the drain with the last project which just really kicked whatever life was left in me for this class right out the door. Do not take this class unless you're really feeling the electrical engineering thing and might actually major in it. Don't even Cr\/D it to be honest; you'll just be sad.",
    "I would definitively recommend this course to any student with interests in computer science or computer engineering.",
    "Yes. Professor Jakub is a brilliant teacher, and is very friendly too. Also, the course material is very interesting.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in electrical engineering or computer science. It has a good mix of the two subjects and you really learn a lot about how a computer works by the end of the class. Though it can be kind of confusing and challenging at times, the professor is very helpful and does his best to make sure you are learning the material as there are many opportunities to ask questions if you do not understand the material immediately.",
    "The class starts off really interesting, but after the second midterm, it really dropped off a cliff. Course instruction became much less structured and there was little guidance with the final lab project. There was little preparation for the exams this class. A lot of techniques for solving exam problems were discussed only over text conversations.",
    "Yes, it is very interesting and cool. However, it does take a lot of time and is intellectually challenging so only take it if you have to for your major or if you have the extra time to commit to it.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It is really interesting and you will learn a lot of practical and cool information. Labs are fun and not too difficult (they just feel like chill fun projects), and there is barely any writeup at all. You honestly don't need any background, although maybe having a slight stem inclination could be helpful, but literally everyone should take this class it's cool and manageable.",
    "Yes! It's a fun ride. I learned about electrical circuits, logic gates, computer architecture and assembly code. By the end of the course, you learn how to make a simple microprocessor. Professor Szefer is a great lecturer and the labs (which often involve typing up SystemVerilog code on computers and then testing them on real physical devices) were fun. The class usually ends up bonding during these labs. For one lab, we had to program a vending machine (yes, an actual vending machine was sitting in the lab for this one) and somebody messed up their code such that the soda that came out exploded on one of the TAs! The Professor and TAs are there for you and the TAs will often stay a bit after lab is over to help you. The normal lab sessions are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in the evening (like after an early dinner) but there are also open lab hours at later days in the week. If you complete the lab, you get an automatic 90% and if you do a little something extra you get 100%. It's great! In terms of the midterms and finals, just make sure to read up on the material covered in the book, as even though the lecture notes by the professor are pretty in-depth, the exams usually have more on them with material covered more heavily in the book (but you will know this during your study period.) All-in-all, great class! Really fun and I learned a lot."
