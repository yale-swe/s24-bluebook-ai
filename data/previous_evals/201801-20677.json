    "During this class, I gained a greater understanding of China and Chinese culture as a whole. I learnt about politics, economy and business amongst other things. My Chinese vocabulary has greatly improved throughout the course of this class.",
    "I learned third year chinese.",
    "Our teachers tell us that in L5 Chinese we are reaching the level of middle school students, so we learned vocabulary and grammar to discuss many things including the economy, entrepreneurship, movies, Chinese media, and current events. We also attained a level where we could communicate our own ideas and opinions about these things in class."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course include the professors dedication to the students improvement. Inside and outside of class, there are always opportunities to practice Chinese. The professors also ensure that you get enough practice in writing, reading and listening as well. They give clear feedback as to how to improve your skills.",
    "Everyday quiz is unchanged from 150. High workload, but excellent curriculum.",
    "The teachers are absolutely the strength of the class. They are so fun, caring and smart; it was a joy to come to class every day with them. The predictability of this class was nice because every lesson you knew what assignments or quizzes to expect on what day. On the reverse side of that, switching assignments up a bit every so often would be nice. I especially wish we had the opportunity to watch more movies or shows in Chinese, as well as read short stories or magazine articles."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Definitely! The teachers care about you a lot, and they get to know you personally since they are such small classes. There is a lot of spoken practice, and although a lot of independent study is required, you can see your improvement throughout your time in the class.",
    "Absolutely. But workload is high.",
    "If you are thinking about continuing to learn Chinese, do it! The teachers are fantastic and you will have a lot of fun. There is a lot of work, but as long as you have the time to put in the minimum level of effort before each class it will be enough to engage and learn."
