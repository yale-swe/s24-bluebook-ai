   "comments": [
    "Through taking this class, I was able to appreciate the multitude of allusions and cross-references that abound in classical Greek and Roman texts. I was also able to observe how the Greco-Roman canon interacted with and figured in other traditions, like the Torah and Gospels. I improved my analytical and essay writing skills, and gained a broad understanding of the classical literary tradition.",
    "My ability to read great works of literature and to empathize with others.",
    "I definitely learned how to read beyond what is on the page in Professor Freudenburgs class. His writing critiques are really helpful.",
    "This course helped me in reading a text and finding what is important. The essays for this course helped me make connections across texts and my writing in general improved.",
    "Ability to not only analyze the images of a single text but those of a series of texts chronologically Much greater understanding of the way meaning is predicated upon the form of verse",
    "I read many Greek and Roman literary works, and learned their themes, symbolism, and particularities.",
    "I developed stronger reading comprehension skills and learned to look within the text to find the authors meaning in the work. I also learned to write an analytical essay discussing aspects that I found interesting within a work.",
    "Understanding of a very broad spectrum of ancient western literature and some of the major literary works since antiquity.",
    "Of all my DS classes, this one felt the most like it was building off of previous knowledge and experience. So I enjoyed it most of the three, because I didn't feel like I was learning how to learn at the same time that I was taking in new things. I pretty much knew what was expected of me and what I should be getting out of the class, unlike with my other two courses.",
    "-Understanding of foundational texts in the Western canon -Extensive experience with college-level analysis and writing"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the main strengths of this course was how the sequential ordering of the texts allowed us to examine how later texts built on earlier texts. In the same vein, I thought one of the weaknesses was that the Bible wasn't as fully integrated into the curriculum as a work of literature.",
    "A strength: the depth of which we talked about a certain topic in a book A weakness: sometimes, the jump into a topic makes it difficult to understand the general idea\/purpose of the work",
    "Perfect. Directed Semester literature was my best course of the semester.",
    "Freudenburg is great -- there are really not any weaknesses to taking DS Lit with him.",
    "This class provides a good background in the Western cannon, and seeing how the texts in the course build on each other was great. The biggest weakness of the course was the fact that the reading assignments were very long and we didn't have enough time in class to really go through everything that we read. However, since the point of the class seems to be a survey of the Western cannon, with so many texts to read, we won't have time to discuss every part of each work extensively.",
    "Definite strength: YUAG visits and powerpoint slides of art during classa picture is worth a thousand words (corny, I know), but for a bunch of twenty-first the immersion is invaluable",
    "Strengths: The readings are classics, and the lectures and sections help explain them very well. Weaknesses: It is sometimes difficult to finish the long readings. I think the class could be improved by taking out Sappho, of which only scraps remain, and instead reading another ancient poet, like Horace.",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar sections because it was very helpful and interesting to discuss the works on a closer level. One weakness of the course is the amount of material we have to cover in such a short period of time. For some of the works I would have liked to have another class section to discuss, like the Aeneid and the Odyssey.",
    "Amazing professor. Lectures, seminars, homework assignments, and even exams excellently facilitate thinking and learning.",
    "I thought the course was well paced, we generally spent more time on readings that took longer, etc. Reading The Iliad over the summer was definitely hard and seemed unnecessary--why couldn't we have read it in pieces, like our other books? It's not like we discussed the whole thing on the first day. Other than that, i was pretty much happy with the course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Professor Freudenburg. The syllabus and the texts themselves are very rich and rewarding, and Professor Freudenburg had interesting insights into everything we read because of his deep knowledge of classics. Professor Freudenburg would often show us ways in which the works we read related to other aspects of Greek and Roman culture, for instance taking us on a trip to the Art Gallery and showing us intriguing mages of artifacts and ruins.",
    "Definitely. The selection of books with an instructor of expertise to facilitate discussion of the books is very engaging and insightful.",
    "Most definitely. At the very least for the opportunity to read all of these great works of literature. In all honesty, Directed studies courses make those who take them more human.",
    "In terms of Fall DS-Literature, definitely take Professor Freudenburgs section. I don't think there is a better section leader in the fall.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the texts we read form an important foundation for the reading I will do and the classes I will take in the future. In addition, the essays in this class helped me improve my writing.",
    "YesProfessor Freudenburg is a downright guru",
    "Yes, the course allows one to read great works he\/she would probably not have the opportunity to read for the rest of his\/her life.",
    "Directed studies is a lot of reading and writing, but you read really important works. In the literature section especially, the reading can add up to a lot of pages, but if you are willing to do the work, it is worth it and a great program. I would recommend DS to anyone looking for a good classics base to build off of in the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course! It leaves students with a much-needed foundation of seminal works of western literature, that will serve one throughout his entire lifetime. Learning and thinking are excellently facilitated through a combination of lectures, seminars, and writing assignments. Enjoy!",
    "Yes, even if you're not particularly interested in antiquity, there's something for everyone. But it can get a little tiring if the ancients are really not your favorite.",
    "Yes: -interesting material (even for someone not likely interested in extensively studying literature outside of DS) -excellent opportunity to develop analytical skills -well-taught (see other responses)"
