    "This was a fantastic class, though it is quite challenging. Learning the theory of crystallography is important but very difficult to understand. I enjoyed learning how to solve structures.",
    "Theory and practice of crystallography",
    "This class taught me the theory behind X-ray crystallography and structure determination before moving on to the practical component of learning how to obtain a structure from start to finish.",
    "Crystallography was a very interesting and engaging course. I learned so much about the theory and fundamentals behind the crystal structures that seem trivial in papers. I now have a greater appreciation for crystallography.",
    "I learned how to mount crystals and to collect and process data."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The theory section seems longer and more in depth than necessary. I wish we had spent more time on solving structures. I feel most of the class didn't understand the vast majority of the theory taught, and it can be really difficult to follow the pace of lectures when powerpoint slides are used. Once we got to solving structures the class was way better in terms of material covered.",
    "Hands on lessons were superb. I would have like more of an emphasis on practical components like mounting crystals and solving difficult structures. lectures were usually good but at times had too much detail.",
    "Brandon was a great instructor who was always available when we had questions. He did a great job of guiding us along the way when we had questions and letting us struggle to figure out what was happening at times. Some of the problem sets were a bit time consuming.",
    "The problems sets involving structure solution were extremely helpful and Brandon's accessibility really made this course impactful and one of my favorite. I think that it would be most helpful to slightly shorten the theory portion of the course as that information is very difficult to digest until you can put it into action, such as with structure solution.",
    "great class! Loved that Brandon was available so much for questions outside of class. Packets definitely helped."
