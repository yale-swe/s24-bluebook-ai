   "comments": [
    "I developed great articulation, discussion, and writing abilities in this course. It was a great introduction to analyzing philosophical texts.",
    "Very good understanding of Western Philosophy.",
    "Throughout the course I garnered a strong and clear understanding of the philosophy of many authors on the spring curriculum for Directed Studies: Philosophy while simultaneously developing my critical thinking, writing, and in-class discussion capacities.",
    "I learned that external reality might not exist, that blond beasts are the chosen ones (yikes!), and that everything might be one single thing (also pretty scary if you ask me). But don't be scared away! I read some of the most difficult texts I've encountered in my life in DS Philosophy, but they are so rewarding when understood with the help and guidance of discussion sections and professors (hint hint take Winkler).",
    "Clear, logical thinking.",
    "I learned the philosophical tenants of philosophers from Descartes to the modern day.",
    "This class has provided me with the ability to pinpoint more clearly the subtleties of philosophical arguments as presented in the text, both in seminar discussions and essay assignments. The course does a great job describing the general arguments of each author, but also in analyzing the smaller discrepancies in some of the great works we read, which can substantially alter one's interpretation of the text. As such, this course was extremely beneficial in gaining broader knowledge of the history of philosophy in the last 5 centuries or so, but also in helping me to think ever more critically. This transferred to my writing as well, helping me sharpen my arguments so as to further narrow in on clear, nuanced theses. This class, as a Directed Studies course, is a flash introduction you get through it realizing how little you know, receiving merely a glimpse of all of the different disciplines and lines of inquiry which fall under the realm of philosophy. It's a great way to get a taste of several foundational authors to see which few you might like to focus on in the future. The course is extremely enlightening, for it's main substance is the presentation of ideas, like Hume's understanding of the power of the passions over reason or Kant's understanding of human dignity, which have completely shifted the way we, as humans, understand ourselves."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is a very strong introduction to philosophy. It is well organized, taught by great professors, and allows students to participate and engage in a small classroom closely. It has few weaknesses.",
    "Excellent professor.",
    "Two major strengths regarding the course: (1) it challenges how you perceive and intake the world around you -- how to question, how to disagree, how to find alternative solutions; and (2) you are guided by a really amazing professor. Weakness: this really depends on the roll you get in terms of peers, but the environment may not be conducive to the pure collaborative spirit that Directed Studies tends to pride itself on, as there may be some people who talk excessively (creating a more oppressive environment) or some people who rarely talk (creating a more awkward environment).",
    "Ken Winkler is an excellent professor, especially in his ability to restate students' points in a way that flatters and expands upon them.",
    "Some of the readings are super dense, so 40 pages can take you 4 hours, but overall the message of each text is pretty radical and pretty interesting in its interpretation of the world and how we humans fit into it. You end up realizing that each week you'll read something fresh and plausible, and almost be convinced that \"Yes, this could be it! This sounds right!\" until you read the next week's author who tells you why his predecessor was wrong lol. This makes for a really interesting intertextual debate of which only you can be the judge.",
    "Strengths: Winkler's organization of the discussion -- he doesn't dictate what is said but contextualizes each person's point within the larger discussion and points out how each person's insight relates to the other's. Professor winkler is also very available to talk through papers, etc. which is great, No weaknesses stand out,",
    "I hopefully outlined the strengths the above response, and there really are hardly any weaknesses to list. Perhaps the only thing is simply the sheer amount of reading there were definitely a few weeks where I felt that I might have been able to understand certain ideas better by fully hashing out smaller portions of a major work rather than trying to traverse nearly the whole thing. I think this was most pressing when reading Spinoza, Kant's Critique, and Hegel."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Directed studies philosophy was a great introduction to the process of analyzing philosophical texts and the rigor of the writing that follows. Overall, professors are incredible and you learn so much, and really develop as a speaker and writer.",
    "Yes, definitely. Professor Winkler is great and the content interesting.",
    "Absolutely. One of the best academic experiences of my life - discovered a love for philosophy I never thought I had.",
    "I indeed recommend DRST 004 taught by Professor Winkler to any future Directed Studies student.",
    "Wholeheartedly yes if you're down for a good amount of very challenging reading (especially Kant and Hegel)!",
    "Yes I would recommend DS",
    "Certainly - DS Philosophy presents a fantastic line-up of authors in the spring.",
    "Yes, it is a rigorous and engaging course in many kinds of philosophy.",
    "Absolutely yes. But, as this course is part of Directed Studies, I suppose the question must be whether or not I would recommend taking Directed Studies. From my experience throughout this year, I have found the program to be extremely beneficial in rooting me in the foundational texts which I know I will always be turning back to, hopefully to dig into further throughout my time at Yale and beyond. Taking DS I think really helps you orient yourself, both in your studies at school but also in how you see the world as it currently surrounds you. The program helps you see how we got to now, why we are the way we are. Regardless of what major you might be thinking of, if it is feasible in your 4-year schedule, I would definitely recommend taking DS to gain a greater appreciation and understanding of the power of ideas throughout history have in shaping your present experience."
