   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. At the end, you really only learn the difference between race (physical) and ethnicity (social...how people view you) and how this plays out in the world. It's not that great of a class and there are too many other classes at Yale to experience. If you do take it take it Credit D.",
    "Great discussions, the class gives you a lot of food for thought. Take it, especially if you don't belong to a racial minority - it will give you a new perspective on ethno-racial issues in the US. But be prepared to study the readings in detail (every single one of them, though there aren't many) and take very meticulous notes on them - final exam questions are extremely tricky.",
    "100% YES! Fantastic introduction to race identity and construction around the world. Really makes you challenge your understanding of the way you think about the way people are categorized. Also, not that much work. Just two papers - midterm paper and final paper - and then a midterm exam. Not TOO much reading and very managable. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Yes, the topics are very interesting, especially as a white person. I feel like I got a lot out of this class. Hopefully you don't have to trek up science hill for it, though, and hopefully there are more people in the class. I feel like it was designed to have more than the six we had. You can do the reading at your own pace pretty much, maybe do some catching up a few weeks late. The essays are graded tough, but the second one is interview-based and really enjoyable."
