   "comments": [
    "If you are a person with any interest in humanities, classics, literature, or performance (especially its role in society), take this course! Pauline is an incredible instructor: fun, challenging, reasonable, thought-provoking, and she really wants to get to know you as a student and person. The literature you read is awesome (from epic poetry to Greek tragedy to historical fiction). You also learn so much about the origins of countless traditions, words, and institutions that we still utilize today (music, theater, philosophy, rhetoric, democracy, law courts, etc). Finally, the course gives you a Wr, and is designed to help you develop skills as a reader, writer, and thinker. This course has been the highlight of my Spring semester.",
    "Classical Civ 051 is a great class to take no matter your interests. We studied everything from literature to art to government. I would highly recommend this class to anyone and everyone.",
    "This course is a wonderful overview of Ancient Greek culture and literature. At least for this year's class, its small setting and extremely knowledgeable and open professor was extremely conducive to intelligent and engaging discussions. I learned a lot about Ancient Greek society and if you have any interest at all, you should definitely take this class.",
    "very good introductory course to Greek literature for amateurs.I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is simply worth honing one's reading and writing skills in one's freshman year (this is a freshman seminar).",
    "This is an excellent freshman seminar. If you have the opportunity to take it, do so. The subject matter is fascinating and Pauline does an excellent job of enlivening the material and in class discussions. The reading can be heavy at times, but it is fascinating material that allows you to appreciate better classical works of performance.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially to anyone who loves small, discussion-based classes or is interested in exploring ancient Greek literature. We read different kinds of works, including epic poetry, lyric poetry, drama, and even a short novel.",
    "This course is an examination of performance in Ancient Greek culture through the use of epic and lyric poetry, drama, and scholarly articles. While being a writing class, it also incorporates Greek history and myth. I would definitely recommend this class, especially to people who are looking to step outside of their comfort zone"
