    "A great way to attempt to complete a project that you otherwise would not have the resources to do. The course is pretty relaxed and totally depends on how much work you want to put into it. The course requires a presentation at the end of the term as well as a paper detailing what you have done throughout the semester but it isn't too bad if you have worked steadily on the project."
