   "comments": [
    "You won't regret it if you take it, but beware that for undergraduates, it is a little less structured than most other classes.",
    "Good if you need more of a background in the class for your career plans or writing a research paper, but lacks a lot of intersting theory or anything that will leave you with substance.",
    "This class was refreshing for its specific regional focus and in-depth analysis of post-Soviet conflict patterns. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in modern political developments, especially in this region in particular as there aren't very many classes offered undergrads that allow such specified readings and discussions.",
    "I thought the reading was pretty interesting- even when we read terrible articles, it was good to get practice criticizing bad poli-sci. In general I thought it was fascinating because I don't know when else I would've learned about Armenia and Azerbaijan, for example."
