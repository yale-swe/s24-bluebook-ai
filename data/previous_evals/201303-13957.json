   "comments": [
    "Professor Geballe is fantastic and you should definitely take a class with him if you have a chance. I really enjoyed the class. Each week was a different set of readings on a topic such as environment, history, health, economics, etc. Class was basically a group discussion, which meant that sometimes discussions were great and sometimes they kind of stagnated. The big project is you write a 20 page paper on a topic of your choice (as long as it relates to Haiti) which I found fantastic as you can really pick something you're interested in and professor Geballe provides lots of feedback throughout the process to help you.",
    "The material is there to discuss, but the discussions themselves not particularly stimulating. Professor Geballe can't differentiate between excellence and mediocrity. The people who care and work don't get the good grades in his curve. He picked favorites quickly, people who speak up a lot but don't add to the discussion. People who literally never show up and miss their final presentation also get higher participation grades than the rest of the class. Professor Geballe's knowledge of the environment was helpful. He admitted that while grading our term papers harshly, he was sleepy and couldn't recall papers in detail. Professor Geballe is always available for advice and encourages you to visit him, which is good.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student because the course material is extremely interesting and it gives you a solid overview of many aspects of sustainable development in Haiti.",
    "I would recommend this class because you learn a lot about the environmental problems in Haiti, as well as how the history has played an impact on the struggling economy and environmental challenges. It is a very complex country, but I am very happy that I was able to enhance my worldly knowledge through this course. There is so much information that you can really focus on the areas of study (environmental, economical, cultural) that you are most interested in.",
    "I thought it was going to be more of an Environmental Studies course, and instead I found it was more of a Haitian history course. However, I felt like a learned a lot of valuable information about Haiti. The paper at the end was a great way to shape the course into something that was meaningful to me; It was great how we could really delve into whatever topic we wanted. So overall, a great course.",
    "This class is a fantastic opportunity to take a class with a professor who truly cares about your learning and who will support you fully as you adjust to Yale. In the seminar style the professor is great at stepping back and letting the students lead and essentially teach eachother. WIth student facilitated discussions in every class, we all gained valuable leadership skills. While the final paper was substancial, we all learned a ton and generally enjoyed it because you can literally pick any topic under the sun. I still got out of bed everytime for this class, even though it's at 9 am. Very recommended!!! Great case study to draw larger conclusions about developing nations and sustainable development pedagogy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because although it is about Haiti specifically it really an intensive study relevant to a lot of the developing world, and by focusing on one country individually you get a much more up close understanding.",
    "It is a seminar style class based on readings having to do with Haiti. Classes are solely in depth discussions of the readings and the class's opinions on them. I enjoyed the class, but it is a good amount of work.",
    "As a freshman seminar, it's a really nice class to take in the beginning of freshman year. The class mainly consists of nightly readings and then one big research paper on a topic of your choice in the last month of the course. If you are not particularly interested in Haiti, don't take the class.",
    "For students interested in the environment, human development, and learning about a different country and culture, I definitely recommend this course. Professor Geballe does an incredible job in moderating discussions as well as in taking a personal interest in each of his students, giving valuable advice on how to adjust to Yale as a freshman. Additionally, this course is a great opportunity to learn from other students' ideas and viewpoints, demonstrating some of the vigor of the intellectual community Yale seeks to develop. This course was very enjoyable with interesting and thought provoking material. Though the large research paper due towards the end of the course looms over one's head as the major grade for the course, Professor Geballe was excellent at organizing frequent meetings to ensure that each student was making appropriate progress and had fully considered the ideas and aims of the paper at hand.",
    "I would recommend the course if it were improved. The topic is interesting and could make for engaging discussion, but our discussion didn't always help me better understand the questions at hand. I didn't walk away feeling like I learned that much though the research paper was helpful though."
