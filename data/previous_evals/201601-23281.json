    "Ancient Chinese Thought is an excellent introduction to classical Chinese philosophy. Professor Hunter's treatment of the material was nothing less than superb; over the course of the semester we read through close to a millennium's worth of Chinese philosophy, and the pace of class never felt rushed; classroom discussion was lively and, perhaps more importantly given the generalist nature of the class, solidly grounded in text. In terms of homework and assignments, the course is not onerous; only four short papers, a midterm and a final. But this is a course where close, careful reading is essential, so be prepared for going through many complex texts. When I took Ancient Chinese Thought I was continually impressed by the preparation of my classmates. This is a course that really needs each student to be prepared.",
    "Ancient Chinese thought is a mish-mash of history, philosophy, politics, religious studies, and cultural studies all in one. I feel like I gained a great understanding of all kinds of thought in Ancient China through primary sources. As I will be going to China this summer (along with more than half the class) to study Chinese, I feel like this class has given me a very tangible understanding of Chinese thought that has existed up until the modern day (i.e. Confucianism, Daoism) that will help me to better appreciate historical sites and Chinese cultural practices.",
    "Ancient Chinese Thought is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It could perhaps be best compared to DS H&P but for the East Asian tradition (and better.) You will read philosophy, history, and poetry from over a thousand years of Chinese civilization from the Classic of Odes to the Han Dynasty, and try to tease out the ways that different authors interact with various ideas. The class sessions consist of a twenty-minute introductory lecture (so don't worry if this is your first East Asian Languages and Literatures class!) followed by discussion. Whether this class is in your major or completely unrelated, this is a must take!"
