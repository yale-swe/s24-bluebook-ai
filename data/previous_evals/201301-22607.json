    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It should be a required course for all students, and especially for those in political science. It makes you see the world in a different way and think critically about the way we design our societies and institutions. It is an absolute necessity.",
    "It is not too much work as long as you stay on top of the readings. Make sure you put a lot of effort into your final paper however since that is the majority of your grade. Overall, you should definitely take this class. It is great class that blends theories and real work applications to the american political framework.",
    "The name of this course is deceptive. Although it is indeed focused on American political institutions, what you emerge with is a pervasive critique of mainstream administrative theory and public goods management. This course does a wonderful job of pulling back the shroud of assumptions that cloud thinking about how to govern. You will begin to think that all major public policy failures have a systematic cause; which is more or less the point. If you have any interest in the decentralized authority, citizen engagement, communitarianism, American covenantalism, theory of insurgency, this is a great course. If you don't like these things yet, you probably will by semester's end.",
    "I would recommend. This is a mixture of theory and application in governance and institutional thinking.",
    "This is a class in which you study a lot of institutional theory, especially theory from a scholar named Vincent Ostrom. Much of the class centers on the conceptual framework of, you guessed it, American political institutions, but rather than focusing on individual institutions like Congress or agencies, the class focuses on American government in a fairly broad manner. There is a ton of reading, but not all of it is necessary for the class. Workload is manageable, and the final paper gives you a chance to really go in depth on a subject you choose. Shop the class for sure, and if you like where it's going, Professor Fotos will be a wonderful guide.",
    "This class will give you an entirely new perspective on what it means to be an American citizen, a member of society, a part of government, etc. The readings are really interesting; the workload is light; and the guests are amazing. The downside is that there is one graded assignment all term, and Professor Fotos is very hands-off and disorganized, both in designing lessons and in setting expectations for the final paper. I showed up to class more than once having not done the reading; sometimes I wondered whether he had too. (But he is like the class grandfather, so I forgive him for any and every fault!)"
