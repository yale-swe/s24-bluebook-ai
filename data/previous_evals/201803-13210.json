    "I learned to understand and see biology in a larger scale of evolutionary analysis.",
    "EEB",
    "I learned about evolution, ecology, and the way species diverged through geologic time. In all frankness (which even Professor Near himself admits), intro evolutionary biology is all about big picture ideas and history, so it is difficult to walk out of class feeling like I learned skills of substance. But, I found through reading papers for section that in fact, these themes carry a lot of weight when I am thinking about clades of species. If you are a bio major or premed you are likely taking this class out of necessity because you already took BIOL 101-103 and it's way too late to skip out; if you're pure EEB grad school don't take this class \/ take the legit intro EEB course, but if you're going to be in BIOL 104 because you have to, this may feel useless at first, but it's still important to understanding how extant species came to be (and at least this module is the least painful out of the four intro modules, unlike BIOL 103). I found myself more engaged than I'd expected with the phylogenetic clade research paper, and could understand literature, which felt fruitful!",
    "Basic ecology and evolutionary biology",
    "We learned about evolutionary history, reading phylogeny trees, ecological change on Earth, patterns among lineages.",
    "I learned about evolutionary history and ecology, but not much beyond what I had previously covered in AP biology in high school.",
    "All the phylogenies",
    "I gained knowledge of where different groups of animals and organisms fit on the tree of life, why and when lineages diversified, and an outlook on the future of our planet.",
    "I love EEB! I am a bio major, but I'm not sure if I want to do MBB, MCDB, or EEB. Out of the whole Bio sequence, this has definitely been the best!",

    "I learned about evolutionary history, phylogeny construction, and Darwin's theories",
    "I learned how to construct and evaluate phylogenies, how to conduct a scientific literature review, and general trends and important events and timings in the evolution of life. I really appreciate how this course helped me develop a foundational understanding of natures coolest process and also how our specific network of species came to be. We also continued some of my favorite work of the biology sequence generally, which is learning how to read scientific papers productively.",
    "Learned about basic concepts of evolutionary biology, special topics regarding evolutionary biology, the life history of plants and animals, and human impact on ecology",
    "Wonderful introductory knowledge to evolutionary biology!",
    "I learned basic evolutionary biology and ecology concepts and a new way to approach biology.",
    "Understand the foundations of ecology and evolution.",

    "A much better understanding of and appreciation for the intricacies of evolution.",
    "I developed knowledge about evolution, how life is connected, and the origins of life. I also developed a greater appreciation for evolutionary biology in general.",
    "I learned a great deal about evolution and the processes of speciation and development.",
    "I didnt really learn any specific skills. Instead a lot of this course was just memorization of facts that were later tested in the midterms. I did end up learning a decent amount about ecology and evolutionary biology, but not as much as I would have learned had there been specific principles for me to follow and understand.",
    "I learned more about how phylogenetic trees are constructed.",
    "Understanding of evolutionary biology and ecology! Developed understanding of fundamental concepts such as the theory of evolution, as well as accumulation of general knowledge of biology that is useful for understanding one's place in the world as a homo sapien.",
    "I learned about general evolution and ecology stuff in biology.",
    "I gained an understanding of evolutionary principles and the organization of life.",
    "learned about phylogeny and how the theory of evolution has itself over the years pre and post Darwin learned to apply some simple mathematical techniques",
    "This class was great for giving an overview of evolution, how it occurs, ideas about the foundation of life, and systems of classification. I am not sure how much it focuses on ecology but it was a really engaging class overall and of course there is only so much you can cover in a half semester course.",
    "Although this course was very specific to biology, I also learned to form a research paper guided with the terms of the course. I was worried about writing a research paper, although short, but the guides and rubrics helped alleviate the stress and made the assignment very clear. I also found better ways of taking notes and creating study guides and overall keeping up with the fast pace of the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course material could be a little bit more organized in terms of fitting the appropriate materials under the topics. For example, some times the specific topics we discuss under an overarching theme is not related or doesn't seem to relate too much. I am sure they are in some ways, but it is not clear to the students. More efforts to explain and connect the dots would be much appreciated.",
    "The material that we were required to know was hard to discern from all the random white noise presented in class. The homework assignments did not particularly relate to the class material. The reading assignments should be reduced\/specified and incorporated into the course.",
    "The course fishes around at big picture topics, which I suppose is an inevitable artifact of the field, but often makes lectures feel like they're separate and not applicable in other contexts. But, I do think Professor Near tries to situate everything we learn within the context of \"bites of the tree of life\" (get ready to hear that a bunch this semester). I wish that we had more time to think about evolution and postulate hypotheses like BIOL 103 was set up to do, since exams feel like we're just spitting out what we heard Professor Near say during lecture onto a piece of paper.",
    "Too much memorization. Unfortunately unavoidable, but I just want to have my complaint heard that I hate memorization. Weekly quizzes would be a good addition to the course",
    "Strengths: Professor Near is an engaging lecturer, and Professor Lin is an amazing course coordinator who keeps the class very organized. No weekly quizzes, but rather a midterm and a final that is non-cumulative. Weaknesses: A lot of details from phylogenetic history have to be studied and learned for the exams; the papers selected for the class were relevant but not as interesting\/engaging as some other papers we have read in the BIOL sequence.",
    "Liked the trip to the Peabody-- made the stuff we were learning feel more tangible Learning the history of evolution was pretty interesting, memorizing it not so much.",
    "This course is well-taught and well-organized. I wish we had spent more time on exploring the tree of life in-depth as opposed to only having a few lectures on plant and animal diversity.",
    "I thought it was a pretty good intro course to EEB, good & interesting professor who was obviously passionate about the topic, sometimes seemed like it focused on specifics a little too much, but that's probably just what EEB classes are like.",
    "Strengths: engaging and interesting Weaknesses: how to study for the final exam was very very unclear",
    "The lectures were good, but the points of focus were interesting and seemed a little bit arbitrary.",
    "Prof Near is cool and keeps the class engaging! It could be improved with practice exams\/problems and a clearer understanding of what was actually important. I just ended up memorizing everything the night before each exam.",
    "I think Prof. Near is a really amazing lecturer and that made the course a lot more interesting. I think the way we were tested was really fair and I liked that our grades were split between exams and a writing assignment.",
    "Strenghts: lecturing style and professor were very good weaknesses: lots of memorization",
    "This course is almost all memorization, Professor Near even says so himself at the beginning of the course. I often found the content pretty interesting even though I am not super interested in ecological science. However, studying for the course always feels like a slog because of its memorization heavy nature. The tests contain little critical thinking when compared to other sections of the biology modules and especially when compared to classes like biochemistry, where there is an equal amount of memorization but more critical thinking involved. As a result, I don't feel like I got much out of this class. Of course, this is likely due to the nature of learning ecological science, but I wish more critical thinking could be injected into the course somehow.",
    "I enjoyed this course, I felt like it was well taught, structured, and manageable. The workload was spread out and used to facilitate learning and the lectures gave you all the necessary tools to succeed and learn.",
    "Great class. Only weakness was that there were no practice exams for the final and midterm, so you really had no idea what to expect.",
    "The course is good overall. It builds off the other courses in the biology sequence well. Perhaps sections could be made more engaging. They often involved reading a paper that few students really read, which made the section feel not very helpful.",
    "Somewhere in the bio sequence there should be a day where yall teach everyone the ins and outs of reading a scientific publication.",
    "The course is very well taught. Lecture is interesting, and Professor Near is fun to listen to. I enjoyed showing up to lecture, thought the writing assignments were more menial and less enjoyable. The exams were fair, but a lot of memorization is involved.",
    "Enrichment is an amazing help! Lecture is extremely informative. Only thing that might need work is slide volume, but perhaps the volume is unavoidable.",
    "I was okay with it as it is. However, if there were more tools for memorizing material thatd be great.",
    "Strengths: well-structured, clear feedback, engaging lectures, organized individual lectures Weaknesses: the connection \/ overall organization between lectures was not always clear",
    "I think this course was a really fun part of the bio sequence. Strength: very engaging professor Peabody Tours Weakness: I wish there couldve been more problem sets rather than the writining assignment we did. Or if we did do the writing assignment again I wish we had more time to coordinate with our TAs on how to write the papers",
    "Just memorization. There are many ways to teach evolution without having it be pure memorization.",
    "This course is well organized and lectures are well laid out. The work throughout the semester is very reasonable and having both a midterm and final spreads out the material in more approachable chunks.",
    "I thought the course was taught nicely and the notes had the perfect amount of information on them. Section was also engaging and informing.",
    "This course was a good conclusion to the biology sequence. It was well organized and the expectations were very clear. There was a lot of material for each lecture but the professor and teaching fellows did a good job of answering questions and making the information understanbale.",
    "I don't really see any particular strengths about this course. While it was cool to memorize the phylogenetic relationships between major groups of animals, I don't really see the purpose of phylogeny and evolutionary biology in the way that it was taught in the class. Like okay we argue that sponges or ctenophores are the sister lineage to animals... and so. literally okay, and now what... Maybe the class should have more emphasis on the significance of the material. I think the lecture slides were actually pretty good. They contained all the information that we needed to know for the final. I think a strength is that this course is highly memorization based. Another strength is that the class is not curved, so there is no competition! That's awesome. Very rare to see a bio class that is not curved. The writing assignments were a good grade boost I think. And it was fun. Otherwise, this class was unfortunately something I just tuned out of and didn't really care about. Just another thing to get through, to be honest.",
    "I liked how enthusiastic Professor Near was, but I wish lectures were more organized and important concepts were emphasized.",
    "I think the course is very rushed and the writing assignments are not relevant to what we learned.",
    "The course was extremely interesting and engaging. Content was clearly outlined and interesting slides were always included. One improvement could be that grading for midterms and homework were a bit wonky, as in answers seemed quite debatable.",
    "I think Professor Near could be done better at explaining things.",
    "I REALLY appreciate the stretch breaks in the middle of a lecture that long. I also think it was good how we started with the basics of learning about a phylogenetic tree and then built from there.",
    "I think the topics covered in this course fit nicely with the title of the course. Everything seemed relevant to the course and the material was pretty interesting. The only thing is that many of the topics covered in this course didn't seem extremely relevant or connect to the other modules. The lecture slides were often long and little disorganized which made it difficult to study from, but I liked that there were posted on Canvas before then so students can download\/print them before class.",
    "The strength was Samantha Lin, who was very organized and ran a very helpful enrichment. The weakness may be the lack of practice resources for the exam.",
    "The strength of this course is the organization. The weaknesses of this course are the lack of practice problems.",
    "The information provided during lectures was always interesting which managed to keep me engaged.",
    "I thought that this was a very good class, the best taught of any of the intro biology sequence. The material was not as interesting to be as Bio 103, but the professor was very engaging.",
    "The writing assignment and section were useless. Professor Near did a great job with lectures though and exams were fair",
    "One strength is that lectures were often very engaging.",
    "This course was the highlight of the intro BIOL series, and I've suffered through a semester and a half of molecular biochemistry to get to this point. It was a lot more interesting and required less memorizing of tiny molecules and pathways and lab tests. Professor Near was a good lecturer, and the homework assignments felt much more relevant to the course material. There was a lot of info thrown at us, and I stand by my belief that the weekly quizzes of 101 an 103 are better than the 102 and 104 midterms for retaining material and not needing to cram way at the end. But overall it was a good course, and even the section papers were interesting.",
    "This course is straightforward and easy to understand. The exams are mostly memorization-based, but this also means that there aren't many surprises.",
    "The strengths of this course are the way that lecture slides are provided before every lecture and the peer tutoring\/ review sessions provided for added help. One of the weaknesses is the amount of material packed in each lecture which makes it hard to absorb everything being taught.",
    "This was a strong course! Clear delivery of concepts, fair assessments, and quite engaging sections (especially compared to the previous courses in the bio sequence). I liked Professor Near's clear and energetic teaching style. My only complaint was that Professor Near forgot to attend the beginning of a review session once, although he did show up later.",
    "strengths: well organised weaknesses: some of the information\/lecture didn't seem too relevant",
    "Strengths Prof. Near is a great lecturer; I really appreciated his energy and organization and the coherence of his slides. I think the foundational work of the first half of the course eg teaching us how to build phylogenies and understand contributing factors of evolution was particularly strong. I also loved the field trips to the Peabody; getting to see this type of work in action was cool and inspiring. Weaknesses Itd be nice to see an example of the writing assignment; I feel like I caused myself a lot of stress over things that werent ultimately that important.",
    "Strengths are that it is organized well for student learning; the midterm and final helped students to consolidate information (as opposed to having weekly quizzes). Discussion sections were also very helpful. It could be improved with study guides \/ outlines for students to follow through each lecture.",
    "The writing assignments can feel a bit too broad, but everything else about the class is excellent!",
    "I think the strength of the course is the lecture and how slides and notes were organized. I think the weakness of the course was how discussion sections are organized. I think it's great for discussion sections to be journal clubs that focus on new papers and concepts, but it's also very useful if they focus on reinforcing concepts covered in lecture. I also think more regular assessments (weekly ungraded questions?) would have helped students get a sense of what they do and don't know.",
    "The course material was very fact-oriented. Not much application of concepts, more memorization.",
    "Strengths of the course were certainly the engaging and intriguing lectures presented by Professor Near. The course does a good job covering highlights within the rich history of animal evolution. Each lecture provided cutting, insightful new information that sometimes challenged ideas you had about the living world around us. The only weaknesses are slight: the course moves at a fast pace and the material is sometimes challenging because it is purely memorization-based.",
    "This course could be improved if it were more focused on concepts rather than details.",
    "slides could be more clear",
    "The homework for this class focuses exclusively on evolution. I think it would be cool if for the final paper students get the option to write about a topic in either evolution OR ecology.",
    "The professor was very engaging and the material was easy to follow. There were no weaknesses of this course.",
    "This course has very interesting material. However, it has the same flaws of all the introductory biology courses: it is too short and thus assessment tends to be simply about memorizing complex examples that are not that useful. As with all the introductory biology courses, these problems would be solved by having this course be a whole semester.",
    "Strengths: The lecture itself was engaging and Professor Near was a great lecturer Weakness: Sometimes there were a lot of topics covered in one lecture and not enough time to go over every concept thoroughly.",
    "The teacher is very passionate about the subject, but it lies on you to memorize the information for the tests.",
    "The lectures are engaging and the slides are fun. I think that grading across sections could probably be more standardized, and I wish that Professor Near was on time to his own review sessions, and that he wouldn't make off-color jokes during class. (The whole \"hold-my-beer\" joke to illustrate dangerous behavioral choices among human men was super weird, and perpetuates tropes about masculinity that are simply unnecessary for this class). Otherwise, he is very friendly, and very obviously passionate about the content- which is great!",
    "The course was taught well and the TAs and peer tutors were excellent help as well as Samantha Lin, as always.",
    "There should be practice questions for the midterm and final, since it was difficult to prepare with limited idea of how the test is going to be like. It will also be good if slides for each discussion section can be posted online after the session, so that students don't have to frantically copy down the answers from the slides every class. The grading can also be more clear. Even as there are detailed rubrics provided for the writing assignments, it seems that some TAs don't really follow it closely or grade it based on their own interpretations.",
    "Would've been helpful to have some kind of practice questions for midterm and final. Kind of hard to study with no direction. Also for the paper reduce the number of questions; couldn't answer in the page limit given but also extremely difficult to find answers to many of them. It felt like it was just a literature review and I didn't feel like I learned anything as a result because I was just scraping articles for anything that might be relevant to the questions.",
    "This class was fun and was very different from the other biology classes I have taken. I also enjoyed the final paper. The main issue that my colleagues and I had with the class was that there was far too much wrought memorization involved - we sometimes had to memorize facts and numbers that seem useless and easily available online. I have probably already forgotten half of what I had to learn for the final exam.",
    "One strength of the course was the organization of concepts we learned. Samantha Lin really excels in making sure that everything runs smoothly and orderly. Another strength of the course was its ability to tie in primary research papers with what we were learning in the lecture that week. It was interesting to see the research involved with evolution. One improvement could be tying the activities in section back to what we learned in the lectures because I feel like the sections are just borderline busy work.",
    "Strengths: plenty of resources with discussion sections, TAs, and enrichment Weaknesses: research paper that did not teach me much about the overall course topic",
    "A weakness of the course was that it was difficult to understand the level of detail that was supposed to be understood in order to excel in the course. A strength was that the sections were engaging and helpful for learning.",
    "I thought the class was pretty strong. Lectures were organized and homework was relevant and worthwhile. I thought the lecture slides could have more bullet points instead of images. Since there were no study guides, it would have been nice if the lecture slides were more informative and organized.",
    "The weakness of the course is that its memorization dependent. This becomes really annoying because you end up forgetting things after tests rather than actually learning the material. The strengths were that Professor Near was very engaging and entertaining, but only so many facts can be memorized.",
    "Strengths: - I enjoyed visiting the Peabody exhibits - It was very structured Weaknesses: - It felt quite regurgitation-based at times",
    "Professor Near was an awesome, engaging lecturer, and Professor Lin did a great job organizing the course! The lectures are super helpful in referencing to learn the material outside of class in addition to lecture. Main weakness of the course is not the fault of the instructor or the organizer, but just by the nature of it being a big STEM lecture it's hard to always engage all the students.",
    "The teacher was incredible, I loved this course. I also loved the field trip. I think section could have been a bit more useful by talking more about what we were doing in class as opposed to just papers.",
    "I thought this class was only okay. There was a lot of memorization and not a lot of thinking, a setup I did not enjoy. That being said, the material was interesting, and I did enjoy the problem sets and writing assignment; I found the writing assignment very helpful in teaching engagement with scientific literature. I found the tests usually fair, with a few notable exceptions. There were few problems similar to those given on the problem sets, and the readings were never tested (despite telling us that they would); instead, one question on the final asked us to match the reading to the author, which I found irrelevant and unfair.",
    "Almost by nature of the subject, the course required lots of memorization and tests depended on that which is unfortunate because it meant that student who may have understood the material but were unable to memorize every detail were at a disadvantage. However the lectures were always fun and the readings were interesting.",
    "A strength of this course is the organization of lectures it felt as though everything came in perfect order and all were summing to the course topic. Another strength was the organization and type of assignments, with the other bio sequence courses it was difficult to adjust to a different grading method and assignment style but his assignments were very straight to the point, clear, and overall were what I was expecting of a biology course. I liked how there was a balance between the quantitative and qualitative concepts of the subjects such that you can target all aspects of biology and all felt as though they served a greater purpose and weren't just filler useless assignments. Another strength was the amount of support and resources the class had. A weakness of the course was section, as with all other bio sequence sections I felt they were useless and just added more stress and information on us that felt completely useless."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, BIO 103 and 104 was the best biology classes I have taken at Yale so far. They are better structured and explained compared to 101 and 102.",
    "Yes - the section readings, lecture, and even the paper are interesting and fun. The only problem is that the lectures are too long to maintain this interest the whole time.",
    "No, only if you're doing Bio101-104 sequence.",
    "It's a fun class. Some of my friends say it's like watching a real life BBC nature documentary for half a semester, and I agree (it's not a bad thing! It's actually super enjoyable! Professor Near tells a story with each lecture and I never find myself disengaged). You're probably taking this because you're premed or pre-bio major, so there isn't really much I can say about your free will to choose this class or not, but at least this isn't going to hurt you emotionally like BIOL 103 did for many.",
    "Yes, it's a requirement for a lot of upper level classes",
    "Yes, you need to take this course anyways, so take it with Professor Near. He is a really nice and approachable professor who loves talking with his students. Be sure to stay updated on the material though; because we do not have weekly quizzes, it is easy to fall behind and let the material accumulate, which is trouble for later when you have the exams.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in evolutionary biology. It is a great introductory course presented in an interesting way.",
    "Yes, but only if they like ecology and evolutionary biology. If you don't think that fish are cool, you will not like this class",
    "yes.",
    "Yes. But much better than any alternatives.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if you have to take it, take it. It's decently interesting and Prof. Near is really a great lecturer.",
    "It's fine as an intro bio course. Otherwise wouldn't really recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in ecological sciences, but otherwise would not really recommend it. Of course, this point is moot since most of the people who are taking this course are taking it because they have to.",
    "Yes! Even if not a STEM person it's a cool class (that being said you have to take it with 103 which is more tailored to stem people)",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to a student who wants an intro to evolutionary biology, maybe to students interested in the E&EB major (the course is a good way to gauge interest in the subject), or to a student who wants to complete the biology sequence.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to a student unless they need to take it or they are very interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. I personally did not really enjoy the subject matter, so I was bored a lot of the time in the class. However, I know some people who are really into evolutionary biology and they enjoyed the course!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's by far the best taught course of all the bio sequences and the material is also interesting. One downside, however, is that there is a lot of memorization that is involved.",
    "Yep. Its taught well, and one learns a lot.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a basic knowledge of evolution and ecology, but most students take it because they are required to do so.",
    "Because its a half credit no, but I thought the material was really great for those poor souls going through the bio sequence. Keep going! You got this",
    "Yes--good introduction to a field and very reasonable workload.",
    "I would recommend if they are interesting in ecology and evolution.",
    "I wouldn't necessarily take it for fun but it was an alright part of the intro sequence.",
    "If you're interested in EE&B, take an actual EE&B class. This class is a good introduction and not a bad class, but I would only recommend it if it's a requirement.",
    "I wouldn't say that I would recommend this course, but people most likely have to take it anyways. It's a lot of memorization, but if you take the time to memorize everything (and I mean every last word, diagram, and phylogenetic tree on the slide), then you should be fine!",
    "Not really, unless you need it as a prerequisite or for premed. The entire bio sequence is a mess and not taught super well if you're genuinely interested in E&EB, take an actual E&EB course.",
    "If a student is thinking about EEB, then this class is helpful.",
    "Yeah, I think its a good class and Prof. Near is a pretty engaging lecturer. Its mainly focused on evolution and ecology though, which I feel is different from many other bio classes at Yale. So just be sure to know what you're in for if you're doing it \"for fun\" or if you have it as a requirement...then its a requirement.",
    "I know bio104 is the \"easy\" bio module, but it wasn't my favorite. That being said, Prof Near was a super engaging and energetic lecturer and made evolutionary bio as interesting as possible. My TF Liam Taylor was also awesome. I just wish we didn't have to memorize as much for the exams. BEWARE the final (and midterm) are super memorization heavy! Definitely memorize all those phylogenetic trees and random dates or else you will struggle on the final (like I did EEK)",
    "This course was required for me and I probably wouldn't have taken it if I didn't need to, but the course was pretty interesting (especially if you are into ecology\/evolutionary bio). I just don't really know how I would apply what I learned to other courses.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is a requirement. Otherwise, I think there are many more intellectually stimulating courses to take at Yale.",
    "Sure.",
    "If you're interested in the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course to all individuals if they did not have to go through the intro biology sequence.",
    "If you're taking it, you have to take it. Don't take this just for fun--it's not good enough for that.",
    "yes if interested in evolutionary biology",
    "It is better than the rest of the bio sequence. Mostly because of Professor Near",
    "This was by far the best of the four BIOL intro sequences because lectures were interesting and easy to follow (thanks to Professor Near), the readings\/section materials reinforced the concepts from lectures without being too repetitive, and the homework assignments were actually understandable and quite manageable. If you are taking the BIOL intro sequence and stick it through to 104, I would definitely recommend taking it with Prof Near.",
    "Yes, the course provided a good basis in this field of biology.",
    "Probably you're thinking about taking this because you need to for your major, but if you were possibly considering one of the BIOL modules for a science credit or just for fun, this would be the one to take. It takes a lot less background knowledge and is fairly accessible if you show up and pay attention.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to dip their toes into the world of E&EB because it is a good overview of the field.",
    "I would recommend only taking this course if you absolutely have to because of your major or premed\/prevet.",
    "Yes. Professor Near is a lively lecturer and the content of the course is interesting and fundamental",
    "Yes! Its a rare entertaining\/delightful\/enriching foundations course. I appreciate having a base knowledge of essential life processes and relationships, and take it with Near.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are interested in evolutionary biology or to anyone who wants to learn more about life's history",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Not only to those who need it as a requirement, but also to any student interested in learning about the history of life.",
    "Yes, I thought the course was really interesting and well-taught. I was not someone who thought they would enjoy ecology or evolutionary biology, but I very much enjoyed the class.",
    "Though most students take this course as part of the introductory biology sequence, this course was deeply enjoyable and is certainly a highlight of the sequence. This is one of the few courses I've taken at Yale where every lecture provided new knowledge in ways that forced to reconsider assumptions you once had about the world around you. Professor Near is at once a knowledgeable and passionate lecturer, which makes each lecture all the more engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to those that need if for their pre-reqs or pre-med requirements.",
    "Not many students will have a choice, but I enjoyed this course and I think it's a pretty low-stress, interesting introduction to evolutionary biology.",
    "not if it is not mandatory",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I assume most people take this class because they have to, but it's a pretty solid class. Professor Near is a good lecturer, the workload isn't very heavy, and you learn a lot of interesting things.",
    "Yes because this fulfills requirements for certain majors. It is also nice because it is half of a term and fulfills 0.5 credits.",
    "Yeah, it was a great course. Really good professor (Near), he genuinely made a potentially not fun class into a very fun.",
    "You probably need to take this course. It's less annoying than the other introductory biology courses and refreshing because the material is very different. If you do not need to take this course, just take evolutionary biology or comparative developmental anatomy, they are more interesting versions of this course.",
    "Yes, definitely if premed or thinking of biology as a major.",
    "Yes! This is a fun biology class. I also feel that I learned a lot of language that is necessary for verbalizing concepts about biology.",
    "Yes! Profs Lin and Near are great and both very enthusiastic!",
    "Yes! It was well taught and lots of help given.",
    "This course will probably be taken because it is needed for a certain major\/career path. In my opinion, this is the most boring out of the intro biology courses. Professor Near tries to keep lectures entertaining by telling jokes and showing us cool pictures, but it's just a boring class to take. If you just memorize the key turning points in evolution plus the basic principles, you'll be fine for the midterm and the final. The writing assignments aren't as strenuous as the BIO103 paper, but still required a lot of work to make it great.",
    "I absolutely would. Among all 4 introductory bio courses, this was my favorite. The professor was the most engaging and the topics were the most interesting.",
    "Yes, provided a good understanding of evolutionary biology.",
    "I would recommend it because rarely is evolution covered in school. It's very interesting to formally get taught about evolution in the lecture environment.",
    "I would only recommend this course if its needed for a major requirement. Otherwise youre just wasting a lot of time memorizing information that youll eventually forget. Its not worth the time commitment for just that.",
    "If you're considering BIOL 104, you probably have to take it. I will say it was the most enjoyable out of all of the intro bio courses.",
    "Yes, if they need it for a major or if they are interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. Especially if it's with Professor Near, I would recommend.",
    "Yes if they need it for a major or pre-med. It was interesting but maybe a bit tough to just take for no reason.",
    "Only if you love evolutionary biology and exploring the kingdom of life.",
    "depends -- I wouldn't recommend this course to someone not in the major if you want to learn about evolution and the tools that people use to explore it\/reconstruct history, would recommend otherwise, can feel like learning something unrelated to an MBB or MCDB major",
    "Absolutely! The introductory bio sequences are a perfect transition class, particularly from high school into college, due to the high level of engagement by the teaching fellows, Prof. Lin, and Prof. Near. Overall, the class is perfectly geared toward student learning.",
    "yes this course is good to introduce people to the concepts and principles underlying evolution so that they can see if it is something they would like to pursue.",
    "Yes, this class is very interesting and you learn a lot about the world around us and gives you a new outlook into science and how everything simply connects with the logical order of evolution and its processes."
