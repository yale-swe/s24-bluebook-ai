   "comments": [
    "Certainly- this is a very important class in learning how to read and write quality, unique, long-form essays.",
    "I would recommend it if you'd like to practice writing fun long-form pieces, but don't expect to learn a ton.",
    "Nonfiction Voice & Structure is one of the top non-fiction writing course at Yale, and it is not an opportunity to be passed up. Professor Strebeigh is one of the most dynamic instructors you will ever meet, and he really makes you consider how to arrange the pieces of your articles in a way that will raise them to a higher bar. To be clear: the class time itself is not particularly appealing, and can even get boring, but this class is all about carving out time for yourself to produce two pieces that are as close to professional quality as you can get. Sometimes the expectations are far too high, and there's a collective disappointment when everyone doesn't manage to produce an incredible piece, but there's a camaraderie to the course and you will come out of it with two pieces you're at least somewhat proud of.",
    "Yes, absolutely! The best writing course I've taken thus far at Yale. Professor Strebeigh is so talented and experienced and cares so much about the craft of narrative journalism. Prior to 454, I never really considered voice and especially creative structures in my writing, and now, I begin each writing project thinking about them.",
    "Definitely take ENGL 454. Fred Strebeigh is brilliant, and it will challenge you to write with more subtlety than is usually expected of journalists. Know, however, that it is a monumental amount of work, so it's better to take this class when you don't have too much other work. But do take it! I have never heard any one speak so passionately and intelligently about journalism as Professor Strebeigh. He is also both incredibly kind and inspiring.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It's a two and a half hour seminar that flew by- the readings are fantastic, and the discussions have been some of the most creative, insightful conversations I've ever had. You'll get to immerse yourself in two pieces over the semester, choosing your own topics, and doing really thorough sourcing. By the end of the semester, I felt that I'd joined two entirely new worlds, writing about things that I'd become part of. This course is transformative- I'm so grateful for progressing as a writer, so much more than I thought possible in one semester. It's the most rewarding academic process I've ever been part of, and the seminar was the highlight of my week. I will tremendously miss this class, and cannot recommend it highly enough.",
    "English 454 has a great reading list, and Professor Strebeigh is a very enthusiastic and energetic seminar leader--the 2.5 hour classes went by very quickly. I learned a lot about persona creation and different ways of structuring nonfiction. However, there was little guidance in the actual reporting stage of the class: not necessarily a problem, but it might have been nice to have some discussion time spent on reporting\/interviewing tactics before diving into our pieces."
