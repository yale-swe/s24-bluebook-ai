   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the 2 credit version over the 1 credit one since you can get so much more meaningful research done.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course if you love being in the lab and already have an interesting project to work on.",
    "straightforward year long course. you work in your lab and then you write a paper (grant proposal in the fall, final paper in the spring), make a presentation, attend three presentations each semester.",
    "MCDB 496 is a great to way to go about the senior project for the MCDB major requirement. It is likely that to accomplish anything significant in lab, you will have to spend on average 20 hours (or more) per week anyway. However, the time increase is not necessarily trivial and definitely ads up, so the rest of your schedule should ideally not be too heavy. The other requirements are very similar to the regular senior requirement so overall, it was definitely manageable.",
    "Take the intensive research for your senior project if you think you will be in lab at least 20 hours a week anyway. You do have to present twice in both semesters, but you get 4 credits from it.",
    "Research. And lots of it.Take it if you'll be doing\/you want to do a lot of research.Just know that the powerpoint presentation, poster presentation, and final paper come super quickly in a small period of time. Start working on them early so you will not get super stressed out with the other assignments you'll have then and so that you will produce a product you are proud of.",
    "Intensive research is a really great option if you enjoy your research and like your PI. It's definitely less work over the semester than research and another class would be, and its enjoyable."
