   "comments": [
    "If you plan on studying theater or are interested in theater history I would recommend the course. It's essentially an overview\/survey of theater from the 1700s through present day.",
    "you should definitely take it. It is so worth it.",
    "Take it if you want to be a THST major, otherwise there are more interesting syllabi",
    "An overview of theater from 18th century - a lot of history and a lot of plays. There is a performance element, but it's restricted to section and the final part of the course.",
    "A great class for those wishing to further their understanding of modernism and the time after the 18th century in theatre in a fun and engaging way.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS!",
    "I recommend this course for students relatively set on pursuing the theatre studies major. Others who are simply interested in drama as a form of literature I would encourage to take the course with lecturers as excellent as Marc Robinson.",
    "THST 111 is a great introductory class to theater history. Take it if you want to be exposed to interesting and diverse American and British playwrights.",
    "I think its just plain interesting if nothing else. A person could not like theatre and still find things interesting about this class, so I would recommend it to anyone who might be looking for a class to try!",
    "I would summarize the class as an in-depth look at major theatrical works from the the mid 18th century to the late 20th century. I would highly recommend the class to another student, as it is a great Humanities class to take, and is required for the theater studies major.",
    "Yes, because it is a prerequisite and is much better than 110. I'm not sure I would take it if I were not a theatre major though.",
    "THST 111 is a wonderful course. The reading for the most part is manageable, the lectures are engrossing and eye opening and the section material is very specific and interesting. I absolutely would recommend this course, not just for intended majors.",
    "Great class, I approach theater and analysis in general from a completely different standpoint now.",
    "This class is a good class if you want to learn more about theatrical cultures (e.g. O'neill, Stein, Williams, and Kane). The class is slow at times and there is a lot of reading to keep up with. Overall, it's not a tough class and very doable if you do the readings and really cogitate on the material.",
    "Take it if you plan on being a Theater Studies major.",
    "Take it! Great- very interesting",
    "A solid survey class even if you're not planning on majoring in Theater Studies, but nothing spectacular."
