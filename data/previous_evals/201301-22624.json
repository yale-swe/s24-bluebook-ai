    "I would not recommend it. Professor Hansen is an incredibly hard grader. A hard grader meaning that she seems to want to be a beacon in the History department to give low grades to show she is such a difficult teacher. The workload is quite substantial. Only take this if for some reason you a passion for Chinese Muslims.",
    "This is the worst class that I have taken at Yale. The class time itself made very minute feel like an hour. The professor was rude. The readings were awful. Do not take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone even if they know nothing about the topic as I did not at the beginning of the course. The workload is a little higher than in some other seminars I have taken. But there is a lot of interaction with others in the class. This semester it was taught as both a graduate and undergraduate class, so there was a wider range of students with whom to interact."
