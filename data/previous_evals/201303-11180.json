   "comments": [
    "Summers is terrific. He is incredibly supportive of the students, one of the most knowledgeable professors I've had (in 3.5 years) and his knowledge is incredible varied. For that reason, this course will give you insight into many disciplines. For example, when we studied China's acquisition of the atomic bomb, Summers explained the science of the bomb. You'll get insight into philosophy, politics, and many other disciplines from this course.",
    "A seminar where there is a lot of reading and a bit of discussion. The only major project is a paper.",
    "Very little work, you do pretty much nothing except for the week you have to present the material and the final presentation. No one really pays attention to what you say. Prof Summers is a very nice fellow but this is a pretty gut class. The entire grade seems to be based on the final paper. Not really sure exactly how it's going to turn out. You don't learn too much but if you want to chill and then write one term paper for the entire semester it's a good class. The material is not as interesting as I initially thought.",
    "The final paper is very easy to do, as long as you're passionate about the subject you choose. I think it's a nice way for a science major to get a HU\/WR credit because it still involves science.But the class structure, as others have said in other evals for classes taught by Summers, is a bit weird. I'd have to describe it as a weird combination between lecture and seminar, and not quite enough like the other seminars I've had.I would just say to try it and see how you like it.",
    "Depends on the student. I didn't necessarily love the material, but if you're into this kind of stuff then you'll love Professor Summers and the way he runs the class.",
    "This course was an interesting overview of the development of science in China over the ages. The texts we drew from were particularly intriguing. However, because it was an overview, it was difficult to delve very deeply in a particular subject that was potentially interesting. A large portion of the class was spent on the ancient Chinese medicine and the other half was spent on Chinese science and the bridge to modern science in China.Professor Summers is very well-read and very knowledgable in areas even outside of the class. Because of this, he pulled in lots of outside material and applied it to the topic at hand, which I really enjoyed. Professor Summers is very understanding and I really enjoyed speaking with him during office hours.Take this class if you are genuinely interested in any aspect of Chinese science or medicine - otherwise this will be a boring class and lack of participation will make this class boring as well.",
    "This class has little structure and few things actually count towards your grade. if you are determined and work hard, you will do great. if you are a slacker and dont do the readings you wont learn a single thing",
    "This was the weirdest class I've ever taken at Yale, but I'm actually really glad I took it. Light readings, cool topics, Professor Summers is probably one of the smartest people I've ever met. Truly. No idea- at all- what my grade is going to be though. Honestly, could get anywhere from an A to a C.",
    "This is a fun seminar designed to explore topics related to Chinese science, beginning with ancient astrology, medicine, and alchemy, and ending with China's nuclear project in the 1950s-60s. There is a 20-page research paper at the end, which I assume would be the main determining factor of your grade. Often times Professor Summers took over the discussions, but I really enjoyed the stories and insights that he brought to the table. The readings could get esoteric and monotonous at times, so I'd say having some background in Chinese history and at least a rudimentary understanding of the Chinese language would help. Other than that, the workload was entirely manageable. The reading assignments didn't get significant until we had to tackle the book \"China Builds the Bomb,\" but 1) we had two weeks to discuss it, so you could divide the reading into two parts, one for each week; and 2) it was an interesting book. As a History major, I'd say this course is on the more relaxed end of the workload spectrum. The only downside of this course is that I had no clue how I was doing grade-wise; I hope Prof. Summers comes up with a clearer system of feedback so that we have a better idea about our performances in class. In sum, I'd recommend this course to any student interested in not only Chinese science, but also the history of science in general.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the subject matter and what a lighter course load for your writing credit. You won't be disappointed!"
