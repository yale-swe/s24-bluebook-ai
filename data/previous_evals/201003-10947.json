    "The course gives an excellent overview of current trade theory and the most important empirical approaches in international economics. I highly recomment the course for all students in international economics.",
    "I strongly recommend this course for all students interested in trade. It gives a very good introduction in old and new trade theory and additionally leads students to the research frontier in empirical trade theory. One of the best courses I ever had, although the technical level could be higher.",
    "I would recommend it if the topics match the interests of the student, it is not one of the courses that is enlightening or interesting for anybody. I for myself had to discover that most of the topics bored me.",
    "I think it is very useful for students going to trade or development. Or any student that want to have a glimpse to recent work in trade."
