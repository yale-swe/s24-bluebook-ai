   "comments": [
    "Vani Kulkarni was very nice and clearly very enthusiastic about the material. However, the class was not particularly well run. Although this class was technically a seminar, Kulkarni lectured from a powerpoint every week. These powerpoints were never a realistic length--most weeks, we all stayed 20 minutes late and still only got through a small fraction of the planned material. Also, I think class would have been better if we had all done the same set of reading for each class. Instead, we were each asked to do some of the readings from a long list--this system meant that when we did have class discussions, it was only really possibly to participate fully during the parts of the conversation about the readings you had done.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who's generally interested in health& inequality in India (obviously).",
    "Seminar taught as a lecture, kind of boring, but if you're really interested in the topic you can get a lot from the assignments. Shop it and see.",
    "If the course is revamped, I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. The course material is very interesting and Professor Kulkarni is extremely knowledgeable. However, the current structure of the course is not very good and I didn't really feel that I ended the semester with a better idea of public health in India."
