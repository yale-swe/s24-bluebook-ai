    "In this course, I learned about the legacy of the later stages of the Civil Rights Movement, particularly with reference to its influence on the more recent Movement for Black Lives. I learned about the importance of thinking through historians' theories and practices when analyzing these movements, considering what is included in their historical narratives, as well as what has been glossed over.",
    "I learned so much about social movements in the US and theories of change. It was such a good course and the readings were incredible.",
    "Taking this course has greatly improved my knowledge of contemporary African American history. While the structure of the class follows a timeline, I don't feel like what I've learned is linear, rather each time period was explored through multiple perspectives that often intersected (black feminist, black nationalist, etc.). While reading a book a week was challenging, the practice has made me a faster reader and helped strengthen my reading comprehension skills. The writing assignments pushed me to produce meaningful analysis that deepened my understanding of the works as a whole. I also loved the Vlog and Interview assignments because they offered a new way of engaging with course material that pushed me out of my comfort zone.",
    "better understanding of the main events and players during the Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter movement, how black activism intersects with other social justice movements, such as the emergence of black feminism; prominent black women activists; also improved my writing and critical reading skills"

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were the incredible books we read and Dean Lafargue's contextualization of what we were learning about and discussing in class. I think at times, our class was a little quieter and Dean Lafargue felt the need to fill some of the silence, which was helpful because it gave additional helpful background information, but at times meant that the discussion wasn't necessarily as fruitful as it could be.",
    "I wouldve appreciated more feedback and structure on the interview\/vlog assignments for the class, but the discussion was great.",
    "The greatest strengths of this course are the wide array of perspectives that the curriculum explores and the emphasis that is placed on the student to draw connections between these perspectives and the various works that are read throughout the class. I also find it extremely helpful that Prof. Lafargue is so willing and able to help. He is prompt at replying to emails and setting up individual meetings. There are no major weaknesses with the course.",
    "strengths: variety of assignments (reading responses, oral presentation, interview, vlog, final paper); readings were interesting weaknesses: weekly readings were sometimes long so seminar discussion was sometimes slow, maybe would've benefitted from having guiding questions or important things we should focus on to guide our reading; sometimes work piled up because of the way deadlines were set up"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in learning about the continuities of the Civil Rights Movement when connected to the present Movement for Black Lives. I learned a lot about the multiple, diverse perspectives included within both movements, and Dean Lafargue's facilitation of the lecture through contextualization of the course material was very helpful.",
    "Definitely! Super important subject to learn about and very enjoyable course. Dean Lafargue is a great professor.",
    "Yes",
    "yes",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to a student who has the time and ability to read a book a week, sometimes on top of short writing assignments. Additionally, a student who takes this course must be willing to invest long term time into a large research paper. The workload is significant, but the knowledge and skills you gain from the class are fully worth it.",
    "Yes! Great class!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if you're mainly interested in the readings. The class discussions were not crucial to the understanding of the material since the assignments were pretty much based on the readings themselves. The books we read were incredible, I have learned so much crucial African-American history this semester just from the books we had to read which I value a lot.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in black activism and how it has changed over time, this course explores that. Professor Lafargue is an understanding, passionate, and knowledgeable professor who cares about his students and their learning. This course gives you a deeper look at the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Lives Matter movement, highlighting important social justice issues, from housing to education. This course is an interesting and important class to take."
