    "This is a good class if you are interested in learning more about how to analyze analog circuits. If you've ever looked at an analog circuit schematic and felt like you wish you knew how it worked, this class will help you learn what the components are doing.",
    "A lot of difficult material, but the workload isn't bad and Xia is a great professor who really cares about his students.",
    "Good circuits class - shame that it's basically the highest level circuits analysis class offered here. Recommended, but be wary of the uneven level of difficulty.",
    "If you've always wanted to know how amplification works, TAKE THIS CLASS. Your knowledge of discrete and IC amplifier design will be...thoroughly amplified! The class starts as an easy review of past classes but very quickly ramps up in difficulty once transistors are discussed."
