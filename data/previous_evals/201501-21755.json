    "You have to take it...",
    "Well you probably have to take it, so yeah. But it's really fun!",
    "A once-a-week meeting of the current cognitive science seniors. Required for all senior majors. Helpful in that each person will present their work (as it is at the time) over the course of the semester and get feedback from one another. Great in the sense that a small community of the senior majors gets to see each other.",
    "This is a great class. It meets once a week and two people each give about a 30 minute presentation on their thesis research. It is a wonderful chance to see the types of research that peers are doing. It's also a great opportunity to get some input into the topic of your own thesis from your peers. The cognitive science majors in our class really bonded during this process!",
    "This is the spring semester component to the cognitive science senior essay. It's very low work -- it's not really a class, you just meet one afternoon a week to talk about how your essays are going, and then two of your classmates present their thesis research to their peers. The purpose is really to facilitate your thesis research with a faculty mentor.",
    "A wonderful opportunity to get to know other cogsci majors and find out what everyone else is working on. It's amazing how different all of our projects are!",
    "The Senior Project course offers the opportunity to hear your classmates present on their research, as well as to share your own. Kate is one of the best instructors at Yale. She cares deeply about helping her students learn, and makes herself readily available to talk about anything related to cognitive science.",
    "This class is great. Engage with the other students in your year and get to know them; CogSci kids are a cool bunch."
