   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class without any major reservation. The readings are fascinating, and the assignments are very manageable and also interesting to do. The only potential pitfall will consist of your classmates.",
    "Take this class. Professor Engelstein knows her stuff and leads discussion well. The readings are fascinating!",
    "The class is like the title implies, the Russian Revolution of 1917. You spend the entire term covering this one particular year, with a brief detour to cover the Revolution of 1905. If you like this kind of narrow focus, which I did, this is the class for you. If not you might look for a Russian history class with a broader perspective and timeline. The workload is manageable. Two five page papers and a final ten page paper.",
    "It's a dry class, but it's pretty good. It's not hard at all, Engelstein is interesting and engaging... and it's also a non-American seminar if anyone else (like me) forgot to take one of those... I'm not passionate about the Russian Revolution, but I learned a lot about Marxism and Russia and have a more solid foundation of knowledge of an important twentieth century event that is little understood.",
    "Take it.",
    "This is an okay course. Discussion is way too disorganized, which is frustrating because the Russian Revolution is a really complicated topic, especially since it's micro-history. You really need to understand everything that's going on because it will be important for the next discussion. That being said, it is a really interesting topic, and Professor Engelstein will answer your questions if you are confused. I wouldn't take it if you're looking for a professor who is really engaged, but if you're interested in the topic, you'll learn a lot.",
    "The Russian Revolution is a good, not too demanding seminar. I would recommend it with some hesitation. It presents some very interesting ideas about politics, modernity, Russian culture, but I never felt we fully explored many of these concepts. Often times discussion became mired in the confusing, chronology of events and nomenclature of political parties and actors",
    "Unbelievable class - you must take a class with Engelstein before you graduate. You learn so much, and the seminar discussion is great too. There are three short papers - the last one is only 10 pages - which is fantastic for a seminar because it reduces the pressure of writing one final paper and having one thing determine your final grade. Also, you will never gain such an in-depth knowledge of this subject in any other class.",
    "This is a really strong seminar with a wonderful professor. She is open and available and sets high standards for her students. You will learn a formal historical approach, which is valuable for the study of any episode in history. Professor Engelstein focuses on using primary and secondary documents carefully and effectively by understanding their contexts and origins. There is a good balance in seminar between analysis of the assigned reading, background provided by the professor, and efforts to understand from a theoretical perspective the forces underlying the Russian Revolution's series of events. The Russian Revolution (1905-1917 in this class) is a fascinating period, worth spending a seminar delving into if you think you're interested. The discussions were not always thrilling, but it's definitely an interesting and valuable course."
