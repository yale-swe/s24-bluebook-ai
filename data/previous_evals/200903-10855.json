    "This Lecture Series was one of the most informative, useful courses I have taken at FES. Having the benefit of experts sharing with us their own research made the topics cutting edge and informative.",
    "If you are at FES working on marine or coastal issues I highly recommend this course for both of your years. The speakers are usually the best in the field and the workload is really low while you learn a lot.",
    "As a lecture series, some of these questions do not apply - overall I enjoyed the series and the speakers. I would have liked more variety - not just scientists, but more artists, policy makers, lawyers, advocates, community members or workers impacted by the issue, etc. But, It was a nice overview of an issue that I did not know much about prior to the series."

Really allows you to get in-depth exposure and given the opportunity to interact in the classroom and at dinner with leaders in the field. And because each week is a different discipline or approach to the same problem it allows you to see the merits of multidisciplinary work.",
