   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Long-term planning and research",
    "The senior thesis builds great research skills. In particular, I have learned a lot about reaching out to potential sources who are not a part of the research community.",
    "Professor Winroth's guidance has greatly helped me to approach the daunting task of completing a senior essay. Rather than worry about the entire paper, he has advised to complete the essay section by section, allowing specific focus without fear of the formidable task ahead. He also has encouraged new skills of research within canon law texts. His insights have been invaluable, and I look forward to continuing to work with him next semester.",
    "Ability to think clearly about historical issues. How to develop and execute research plans.",
    "HIST 495a is the capstone of the History major, allowing the student to conduct their own, independent research. The time commitment was fluid, so one of the skills I developed was the ability to schedule my workload more efficiently. Without weekly deadlines or scheduled class time, the student is on their own to complete the thesis. I was also able to develop my reading skills (reading for argument, not simply content). Coming up with my own topic was also quite difficult and rewarding.",
    "I don't think I learned any particular skills and insights from this class, though of course I gained a significant amount of knowledge related to my thesis subject.",
    "A great opportunity to develop in-depth research and analytical skills.",
    "I learned a great deal about my thesis subject- both horizontally and vertically. I expanded my range of knowledge and depth of understanding considerably.",
    "1. How to think and plan more independently for a year long project. 2. How to coordinate with people at different institutions. 3. How to manage my research-- when there are 50+ books on your topic, how do you sift through them? 4. How to navigate the incredibly well developed library network at Yale",
    "I learned how to work with archival documents and to start crafting a longer paper--my senior essay.",
    "Writing a history thesis has been a really meaningful experience. Ive learned so much about how to do research (both logistically and intellectually), which has been great. Hunting for sources, figuring out the right questions to ask and the content to be looking for, trying to make it all cohere; its been a real challenge, but a good one. Excited to move forward with it next semester as I learn how to put it all together.",
    "I've been learning how to plan and work on a much larger research project than I've done before. It's a much different process from what I'm used to and involves a lot of investment in the research itself.",
    "Research of primary and secondary source documents",
    "I researched my senior essay and learned a lot about the topic, urban renewal in New Orleans in the 1960s.",
    "Learning how to complete research on a larger scale, and synthesize great amounts of information",
    "research",
    "In the first semester of the senior essay process, I've already learned quite a bit about independent research, and the techniques that can lead to and support truly unique conclusions. I've also seen improvement in my academic writing, particularly in terms of structure."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "All of the small assignments limit your flexibility in changing your topic and rethinking what you're going to write about and how - please limit these little assignments!!!!!! and require meetings with your advisor",
    "I believe the challenge of any two-semester essay is finding the will to begin work with the deadline far away. Ultimately, the major guidelines prove useful in beginning this work. The great strength of the Fall Semester is the ability to begin research without the intense time crunch of an impending deadline. Additionally, working with such a valuable adviser has proved incredibly helpful.",
    "Strengths include personal independence, freedom to choose topic, and assistance from advisor, librarians. Weaknesses: There could be more comprehensive materials from Hist Dept, in addition to the senior essay handbook, that give advice regarding structuring a research plan.",
    "I wish there were a system in place to give a little more structure to the process, like maybe require monthly meetings with a small group of history majors and an instructor to present what we have worked on. My advisor is very busy and it is sometimes difficult to arrange meetings with him, so I wish i had some other way to keep myself accountable and get feedback.",
    "The course is strong because it gives the student an opportunity to work one-on-one with leading scholars in their field of interest. I sometimes wish the individual professor-student teams could have more discretion in the types of assignments that are graded. I understand the need for a unified system of assessment across the course, but sometimes certain topics are more amenable to different assignments.",
    "I appreciated the checkpoints set throughout the semester (re annotated bibliography, research plan), but I didn't think the 10 pages due at the end of the semester was necessary. The checkpoints were a strong point of the course, forcing students to work on their thesis, but the 10 pages seemed fruitless - with 50 or so pages due in April, it seems silly to expect students to write 10 worthwhile pages in December. Most of my classmates were forced to submit 10 pages just to get credit, even though they are aware those pages are not good enough to be used in their final draft.",
    "I really enjoyed meeting throughout the semester as a group -- hearing my peers' ideas and progress was incredibly inspirational, and their thoughts on my topic and recommendations for leads to follow were invaluable.",
    "1. Strengths-- forces you to work independently; exposes you to the many library resources available at Yale; entirely new way of thinking about a topic; forces yearlong planning. 2. Weaknesses-- I wish there were slightly more guidance on two things: 1. choosing an advisor (this was thrown at us in Spring semester, before most of us had even thought of a topic) and we were given a week. Some forewarning of this would have been much more helpful. 2. I may be alone on this, but my topic idea became less and less practical as I did the research and I soon came to want to change it. I think there are several in my position, but the how to seems a bit confusing. I wish it were better communicated. 3. I think that the Handbook is a wonderful resource, but I wish it had examples of some of the material we are supposed to turn in-- like what does a Research plan look like? Or a primary source analysis?",
    "My advisor was wonderful and provided extensive and significant feedback throughout the semester. Working closely with a faculty member is the greatest strength of the course.",
    "Rather than submit ten pages of writing, I would have preferred there be an option to outline the entire essay. For many students including myself, it would have been far more useful to have been given the chance to think about the overall argument of their paper rather than just have to write ten pages that might get used at all. This approach, of having two options for this stage, would make it far more fair for students who learn in different ways to perform well.",
    "I mean, the course doesnt have much happen in it, so not too much to say. The assignments are generally good, since they keep us moving forward and fulfilling goals. On one hand, it seems odd to need 10 pages done already, when theres so much more discovery and analysis still ahead, but its nice to have things written and out of the way. And Professor Blight has been a great advisor, pushing me in the right directions, giving good advice, and always demonstrating real excitement in my research.",
    "Strengths--the progression of assignments was helpful for me; I wouldn't have done much this semester otherwise. Weakness--It might be helpful to require students to meet with their advisors every other week at a minimum. This would have motivated me to work harder on research.",
    "Too many of the assignments are bunched up near the end of the semester. Also, things should be due on monday or sunday night, not friday.",
    "it was great. no improvement needed."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I'd recommend writing a thesis",
    "If interested in the Senior Essay, I definitely recommend completing the two-semester requirement. It allows more intense research, and I believe will lead to a better end product. It is an opportunity to begin research in an intense way so early in the year.",
    "It is the type of thing in which you get what you put in. It is a nice capstone of your academic experience, but as such it can be a lot of work.",
    "I have had a wonderful experience working with my thesis advisor on a project that has been entirely my own, from the start. It is a huge challenge to distill an entire area of study into one topic for a senior thesis, but also immensely rewarding, and I am excited to continue my work and look back on the finished product come April.",
    "There is no recommending this course - if you are a senior history major you must take it.",
    "Yes-- writing a senior thesis is proving to be an invaluable experience. Learning to organize my thoughts, plan out the logistics, and think practically for a year long project has been incredibly educational. I've had moments where I've had no idea what to do. I have reached out to professors\/advisers at a whole new level for this class and have made better bonds and learned, not necessarily more than other classes, but in a different way than any other class before.",
    "Another student looking at this eval is presumably a history major trying to decide if they should do a full year thesis. I would say that, unless you have a pressing reason not to, you should definitely do it! Its a culmination of three years of studying and learning and growing, and it pushes you in a really meaningful way. Moments will be hard, deadlines will be frustrating and seem arbitrary, but if you pick a topic that engages you and an advisor who gels with you, then it should be a really meaningful part of your senior year and Yale career in general. Just be sure to take advantage of all the time you have; theres lots to do, and youll never not feel behind, so keep working and youll definitely make it through.",
    "Required for a 2-term essay!",
    "Yes - I have enjoyed working on my 2 semester senior History essay.",
    "Yep! The History Thesis very much feels like a strong and helpful way to culminate the history major",
    "yup it was awesome."
