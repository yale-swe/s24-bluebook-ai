   "comments": [
    "A not-so-creative writing class that helps you critique others' essays but not necessarily improve your own writing.",
    "Yes! It's fun and a venue to improve your writing.",
    "English 120 is an excellent introduction the the study of essay-writing. There is a good deal of breadth to it, but also lots of depth, as far as what is studied and to what extent. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to improve their written work, whether creative or persuasive, and to anyone who as an interest in reading wonderful short, often creativenonfiction.",
    "YES! Take this class! First of all, you get graded to write about yourself and your own thoughts, which can be strangely therapeutic but mainly an incredible experience in realizing strengths and weaknesses of your own writing. You get very personal, one-on-one feedback from a professor about your pieces and a ton of freedom within essay prompts to write about whatever you wish. This class has inspired me to take more writing classes in the future and the homework never felt like homework.",
    "This class was awesome. It taught me so much about writing and reading and allowed me to be creative in a way that I hadn't before.",
    "Dr. Hopper is an amazing professor. She really made an effort to get to know her students, which I know made me feel much more comfortable in her class. Class was always interesting and engaging, and the readings were fantastic. Workshops were really helpful, if intimidating at first.",
    "I would recommend this to every student at Yale and have already been telling all my friends to take it. It's truly an incredible class and whether you're a writer or not, writing is one of the most useful skills you could ever have. Moreover just having these essays is amazing, to be able to see the work you have done and even see it in publications is like no other feeling. This class has made my writing infinitely times better.",
    "I would highly recommend English 120. It is just one of those courses that everyone should take.",
    "English 120 was an amazing class, and it really helped me improve my writing. The class can be a lot of reading and writing, but the type of essay (modern nonfiction) is engaging and even fun. Dr. Hopper was a fantastic teacher and incredibly nice woman, and I'd be delighted to take a course with her again.",
    "English 120 is the quintessential Yale creative writing class on the personal essay. Basically, you write five essays over the semester (a personal essay, a place essay, a portrait, a cultural\/social critique, and a humor essay). One week you write a draft and the next week you write a final version. In between, you have your drafts workshopped by your classmates for feedback (so sign up for an essay workshop that you feel comfortable sharing with everyone). The class is great and totally lives up to its expectation. Enough non-English majors take it, so even if you're scared of essays, you can still take it! It might be helpful to start it Cr D\/Fail to get an idea of how the grading will be. You'll learn a lot and notice the cringe-worthy writing habits that you have that you can change to make yourself a way better writer! This stuff will seep into your academic writing too, so even if you're not majoring in English, these skills will be helpful everywhere!",
    "I took this Cr\/D\/Fail as a second semester senior and it was so worth it. I'm so glad I finally took an English class and this was the perfect one for me. It was a great opportunity to learn how to write something other than an analytical or political\/history paper which were mostly all I had experience with before. The readings are amazing and the dissection during class is super useful too. Though I feel like I didn't put the efforts into my edits to make my pieces as good as they could have been, I still found myself improving a ton as a writer. The class also came at a perfect time for me because I felt like I hadn't had time to think or to parse any of my experience here in college, and this class made me really sit down and clearly write out what I was feeling."
