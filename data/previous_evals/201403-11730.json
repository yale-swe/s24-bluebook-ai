    "BIOL 101 is a very unique, very interesting introductory bio course. The workload is minimal, the grading is not harsh, and the teaching and content are excellent. But, if you've taken the AP and gotten a 5, or simply don't feel like you've forgotten everything you learned in high school, seriously look into the curriculum to see whether or not you'd be wasting your time.",
    "The course will be challenging if you have never taken biology before, or if you're taking the introductory sequence simply because you're curious.",
    "I would recommend it. You learn a lot about biology and I really enjoyed the connections to current topics and real life connections constantly being made, rather than just having it be boring memorization all the time. And the questions were neat in the way that they made you think and apply the concepts more than regurgitate facts.",
    "It seems like it's the best intro\/intermediate-level bio class offered in the fall semester. So if you're looking for a low-level bio credit (i.e. premed but not a bio major), take it. Koelle is a fantastic lecturer, and the material is relatively interesting. Also, his slides are so well-made that you honestly don't have to do the reading at all. However, watch out for (1) unnecessarily nit-picky grading and (2) premed classmates who respond to unnecessarily nit-picky grading by pouring hours beyond hours into memorizing everything ever said in this class.",
    "It is one of my most demanding courses having a quiz and homework due every week, which makes it stressful, however because of this you develop a better knowledge of the subject.",
    "I would only recommend BIO 101 to a student who must take the course. Honestly, I felt like I did not actually learn very much. Doing well in the class was dependent entirely on learning how to understand the weird phrasing of questions on the quiz, and not actually on understanding the concepts. I love the subject of biology, but I would recommend starting in a different course if possible.",
    "It was a decent introductory biology class, but the pace is really fast - if you didn't take AP Bio, you were pretty much screwed over.",
    "BIO 101 is a great introductory course to the biology sequence and Prof. Koelle teaches it in an enjoyable but productive way.",
    "You're likely taking BIOL 101 as a pre-req, but it's a pretty good class. Interesting material, although a lot of it is likely repetitive if you've taken AP Bio.",
    "Do not take this class unless you must. If you have never taken biology before, you will learn some basic terminology, but a deeper understanding of the concepts will evade you. I would recommend taking introductory biology somewhere else, if possible.",
    "BIOL 101 gives you everything you need to learn the material they want you to know. You'll come out with a good foundation, so it's a pretty solid intro class. It's really an intro class though; the material is pretty oversimplified. The focus on concepts is nice, but also trades off with learning in more detail. The quizzes are well written and nice in that they test applications and critical thinking, but the grading can be laughably stupid at times. You get docked for not using specific words, even if your answer articulates the same idea, even if the powerpoint notes themselves use a different phrasing. The homework is graded pretty fairly, and was a good enrichment for the class. If you've taken AP bio, you're pretty much set for this class. Just review the night before each quiz. You don't really need to do any of the reading, because he says you won't be graded on anything new in the reading. If you haven't taken AP bio, the readings might help. I heard the enrichment sections are helpful too.",
    "Biol 101 is a straightforward class if you have taken biology before but it is very fast paced. It is also very easy to get low scores in this class no matter how hard you try. The quizzes are very unfair in that they take way longer than the 15 minutes we get and are very easy to misunderstand even if you have MASTERED the material. They do drop one score but this does not help people who are forced to drop one score because they missed it or some other reason outside their control. I really felt like this class is definitely not ensuring that your mastery of the material reflects in your grade. They also mentioned grading was usually flexible but that was all lies. If you don;'t answer something the way they want it they will deduct or not give you points whatsoever. They said this class was not a premed weeder course but it most definitely is! I would definitely expect a better format and quality from a Yale course!",
    "A necessary pain. I didn't really like the class, except for the actual content that we learned, but I need it for my major and for premed. If you're a freshman and can put it off for your sophomore year onwards.",
    "A fast-paced, informative course taught at a comprehensible level. As long as you keep on top of your work and ask questions when you don't understand something, you can do well, although some questions on the quizzes are graded poorly. I would recommend this course.",
    "Hard. The real work of the class is in the quizzes, which are a little bizarre in that the teachers expect incredibly specific responses, but ask rather vague questions. They're probably trying to level the playing field for everyone, but they end up just taking points off for incredibly small details, and then later criticizing students who word-vomit in an attempt to cover all the required information.",
    "BIOL 101 is one of those things you have to take because you're going to be a bio major or a premed. It's certainly not a bad class, but it's definitely not anything revelatory either. I was honestly very displeased with the low level of difficulty of this class, considering the high level of difficulty of the placement exam - I definitely could have placed out of this class. Yale really needs to reconsider its placement guidelines for biology.",
    "I would not recommend BIOL 101 to another student who is not taking it as a prerequisite for biology majors because the material is dry.",
    "Although I was hesitant to take the intro bio sequence because I'd never taken AP Bio, I was honestly very happy with how it went and ended up inspired to pursue the MCDB major. The material covered is very accessible, so long as you put time into it. Professor Koelle's lectures were consistently clear and supplemented with interesting examples. For every complex topic, we had access to supplemental information through Piazza and discussion section. Take this course!",
    "I would recommend this class. It helps you to see how biochemistry is used to solve problems and the HIV lectures are a very apt example.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 to other students. It is difficult and there is a lot of information but it is manageable.",
    "General Biology course. You don't need any prior biology knowledge. Not too much work, as long as you go to class and listen.",
    "I would recommend it because the subject matter is very interesting and is clearly explained.",
    "You are likely taking Biol 101 because you have to , but it's not that bad. It's a good general summary and review of AP Bio.",
    "Just another boring requirement intro level class. Really quite a shame that the class is so bland. Biology is a really interesting concept and they described it in gray.",
    "BIOL 101 is the perfect introduction to Yale biology classes. Even if you were really confident in the biological sciences, since the value of this class is not only studying the contents but also the style of thinking and working, it would be worth it to take the class still. Personally, I already knew 70% of the contents taught, especially in the beginning classes, but I learned some really valuable concepts as well as skills in tackling scientific problems.",
    "It is a pretty straightforward intro Bio course, and if you study the lectures and study guides you should be fine.",
    "Bio 101 is a basic introductory class and that is exactly what you get. There are no frills or exceptional traits about the class. It's not an amazing class but it's not a terrible one either, and if you are interested in the life sciences at all then the class is a good introduction into the defining concepts of biochemistry which you can use as a foundation for future classes. The class structure is pretty reasonable with grading, although weekly quizzes can be stressful if you get nervous during test taking, but overall the professors and teaching assistants are there for support and there are many avenues of help if you need it. Overall, its a good class that you should take if you want to pursue a future in the life sciences.",
    "Easy start to the intro bio sequence. A lot of repeat from AP bio. Not exactly the most exciting course you'll ever take, but a necessary foundation for more advanced biology courses.",
    "Honestly, not a bad class. There's a nice curve (60% A's, A-'s), weekly psets, weekly quizzes, section, and an in class final. You can drop your lowest quiz and hw scores. the psets can get a little tricky and the quiz grading is VERY specific, but all in all very doable with minimal effort and minimal background in biology. Though, if you do have a background in bio, this should be pretty easy for you.",
    "The quizzes really do help students keep up with the course material. That being said there is A LOT of course material, and sometimes it an be hard to digest. Section is much more about enrichment than a time to have class material explained to you. However, enrichment sessions with Kate Gardner could help if someone is struggling with the class material. AP Bio is great prep for this class. Most of the class was unhappy with the grading. It was a bit unfair, and the answers they were looking for did not seem to match the question posed for many of the quiz questions. It's the only intro Bio choice you have.",
    "Probably a class you have to take if you're a bio major; if not, it's a good class to take anyway because there are some basic concepts that are relatively important just as life knowledge. The class is comprehensive enough so that most of the class can understand the material; however, sometimes the quizzes were graded in a very specific way, so if you knew what you were talking about but didn't include a certain vocab word they wanted you to use, they'd dock points. Other than that, grading was fair overall. I'd recommend this class.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. It is a good overview and if you never took the AP I suggest signing up for enrichments sections",
    "Despite the application-based feel of the biology placement exam, Biol 101 is just a huge review of AP Bio. I learned almost nothing new. But I got a pre-req down. I think the class would be a strong preparation for anyone who hadn't done much science in high school",
    "I would not recommend it and I know that many people don't, but unfortunately that doesn't matter because you are probably going to have to take it. My overall assessment of the course is pretty poor. The main point that continues to be emphasized throughout the course is that students need not worry about their grade and instead focus on learning the material. However, the way the course is run paradoxically forces students to do the opposite. Firstly, most of the \"learning\" that takes place in this class is simply memorizing the underlined words and very general concepts presented on lecture slides (the readings are simply not necessary as anything in addition to what is on the slides is never actually discussed\/tested). Following this, the weekly quizzes test whether underlined words and basic concepts have been memorized and regurgitated exactly as they appeared on the slides (slightly different wording or omission of what you may think is clearly understood, may lead you to lose points; for example, if you don't say \"according to the laws of thermodynamics\" when discussing something like Gibbs Free Energy you will lose points). Homework assignments can also be graded likewise, but this varies from TA to TA. Thus I would say a major weakness of this class is its very rigid structure and emphasis on one question one, exact, inarguable, word-for-word answer. That is not the true nature of biology. There are many different ways of explaining things and one answer is not always correct. Perhaps a strength of a course is that you learn how to approach classes where a very expansive topic is being covered and specific things that the professor deems important must be remembered. You also learn to stay on top of the work because of the frequent quizzes.",
    "Take 101 if you need it as a prerequisite for another class. On its own, it isn't a very exciting class, but it gets the job done in terms of teaching material.",
    "The material in BIO 101 isn't uninteresting, especially toward the end of the class when you dive into HIV and really get to understand how it works and how it is treated. However, you're likely taking this class because it's required, in which case you shouldn't worry too much about it. It's a good class",
    "Two weeks after the class has ended and I still haven't gotten the final back.",
    "If you are a non-science major I wouldn't recommend Bio 101 to use as a science credit. But as a science major I think that Bio 101 is a good course to take because it gives basic Biochemistry background and helps students to prepare for upper level courses and even Bio 102. I feel that if Organic Chemistry was required for the course, students could have gotten a lot more out of it though.",
    "I would recommend Bio 101 01 to another student because it is the course you have to start with to branch out it the Bio Department, and it is necessary for pre-med.",
    "Bio101 is frustrating in that most of the material has already been learned by many students in the course, but the way the questions in quizzes are worded make it very difficult to get a good grade. It does give a good cover of biochem, but much of the material is only touched upon without going into much depth. The concept that we will cover this more in future courses is bothersome when we are trying to learn now. I would recommend this as a necessary evil, take it if you have to for your major, otherwise it's not worth the effort and stress.",
    "BIOL 101 is what you would get from reading a freshman high-school biology textbook, and not very closely. Unless you have to take it, don't.",
    "Bio 101 is a course for anyone who wants to learn enough for an introduction to biology. I would recommend it to other students only if they're mildly interested in biology. Or else, they may find it a class that is too difficult with not enough benefits.",
    "Take it if you have to, obviously, or if biochemistry is just super interesting to you, I suppose.",
    "I think overall BIOL 101 is a nice class for reviewing knowledge in biology if one is interested in pursuing the field. It isn't extraordinary, but for learning biology it is pretty informative.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to a non pre-med student because I found it rather difficult at times. The workload is manageable, but there were some quizzes that I felt were unfairly structured. i.e. If you got the first question wrong, it's inevitable that you get the next 3 wrong.",
    "It's fine. Just go over the study guides and the lectures.",
    "Biol 101 was overall a good introductory biology course.",
    "Good and necessary class for premed\/bio people!",
    "Biol 101 was a very good introductory course into biology, in particular biochemistry and biophysics. I would recommend BIOL 101 to another student interested in majoring in MCDB or MBB or is interested in premed because it is a good class for building a strong foundation for future biology courses.",
    "Biol 101 is a great introductory course if one would like to pursue the biological sciences. The course introduces the concept of concise and specific answers to biological questions, and the student will gain a good understanding of how to approach higher level biology courses with the foundation he gained in Biol 101.",
    "I would describe as a standard intro course, but maybe a little bit more work intensive. I would say, as well though, that it starts pretty fast and you have to be prepared for that.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 if it was a prerequisite or you have a genuine passion for biology.",
    "Great class. I would recommend even for non science majors. It's easy to understand unlike other pre med courses and is really interesting.",
    "Survey of the types of molecules integral to organisms, with emphasis on DNA and RNA function.",
    "A large rigorous course in which you learn a lot about introductory biochemistry and biophysics. In terms of recommendation it was a great class, but I will say to expect a challenge and a respectable amount to time due to the amount of detail required by the material. Students who had AP Bio like myself may have an advantage, but I found it to be almost insignificant in the along run, so I will say not do not be discouraged in that sense. Knowledge of chemistry (organic chemistry) and physics would be helpful.",
    "I would say it is possible to do well if you already have a solid foundation of biology, but if its a new subject then you will have a real struggle to not fail the course without using every resource available such as enrichment and excessive wikipedia reading.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 to a fellow student - the material was interesting and engaging, and the class was neither too easy nor too difficult.",
    "I have discouraged friends from taking BIOL 101 because the course is so fact-heavy. I feel like the quizzes were composed of factual regurgitation and reasoning questions that were beyond the content discussed in the slides. There was a big leap of logic for some of the quiz questions. I don't feel like the quizzes were designed well for the set-up of the lectures and discussions, making them stressful. I wouldn't want other students to go through that stress.",
    "I would say it's a good introductory to the course, but it was not very interesting or thought-stimulating overall. The quizzes did not seem to help capture how much the information was understood, but seemed to target specific words and terms every time.",
    "It is a very interesting class if you like science.",
    "take if necessary or if very interested in bio; otherwise, you won't get much out of it and will find it pretty stressful",
    "I do recommend Bio 101 because they teach you how to think like a scientist. You're probably not going to get the grade you want, but you're going to leave with so much knowledge!! Plus biology is awesome.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because it is a great introduction into biology in general that allows students to be able to engage in and enter the world of biology with a good understanding of many basic concepts and mechanisms.",
    "This course is a great intro course to biology. I really enjoyed the material, as it is very interesting to learn about all the biochemical and biophysical processes that occur within our bodies and in the living world. Koelle is also a great professor a great lecturer, very organized and willing to help. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because there is certainly a lot of information.",
    "I would recommend - it gives a firm grounding in biology.",
    "I would say it's a good class, especially for a pre-req.",
    "I would recommend this course for those with a poor background in biology. For students who've taken at least 2 years of advanced bio in high school, try to skip it.",
    "The class is well taught and the P-sets are really no problem. The material is not super complex and hence manageable. My Biggest complaint of the class is the grading style. The quizzes often had ambiguous phrasing on the questions, which would lead to issues when trying to answer. The graders are looking for exact words or phrases and will mark you off if your answer is not exactly what they are looking for. The sentence limit and time limit on the quizzes make it difficult to give the exact phrasing they are looking for. The graders will often mark you off if you use phrases that mean the same thing as the answer but are not exactly what the grading rubric says. This would often lead to frustration with individual quiz grades, but overall the class grading is fair. With that in mind, it is not a bad class and I would suggest this class to fellow students.",
    "BIOL 101 is teaches fundamental biochemistry and biophysics. In addition to providing students with a basis for further learning in biology, BIOL 101 gives students bits and pieces of information about current biology work, such as experiments, discoveries, etc.",
    "It was a good introduction to the topic, but it was frustratingly basic at points especially if you've taken ap bio.",
    "BIOL 101 goes through a lot of material given the fact that it's only half a semester long.",
    "Bio 101 is a fast paced course that covers Biochemistry and Biophysics. I would recommend it because it is an in-depth introduction to biology. I would summarize it as mostly review for students who have taken IB Biology or AP Biology, and would warn those who haven't that they may struggle if they have never encountered the material before. It is both a good refresher as a much as it is a challenging course that presents new concepts in biology.",
    "You will learn a lot of information in BIOL 101. It is a great class to learn introductory biological concepts. However, its structure made it a very nitty-gritty class. The quizzes at times were either too specific or too general. They were always based on the lectures and the lecture slides, but many times, asked for very specific concepts. The homeworks are very helpful for understanding concepts, and section is great. My TA was very helpful in understanding concepts and was very readily available in section, before\/after lecture, and over email.",
    "A intro bio course with hard quizzes every week.",
    "It is a prerequisite for many classes - not great but required.",
    "For sure - I think it will be a great way to learn about interesting aspects of science. A very well taught course and I would strongly recommend it to anyone regardless of their interest.",
    "It really sucks that it's a half semester course. It's really easy to bring your grade hard and you have very few chances to bring it back up. I wish 101 and 102 were together as a full semester course.",
    "If you are not a science major or do not love biology, Biol 101 may discourage you to pursue biology. Some of the material is actually pretty interesting, although it may not seem like it in lecture. Overall, I would recommend this course because to not recommend it would mean to close off many other biology classes which actually are very interesting and engaging. It can be a pill, but it is a necessary one which will only help you in the long run.",
    "Bio 101 is more of less what you'd expect of an intro bio class. I appreciated that the class does not try to push lots of little facts but focused on big picture concepts. This probably made the class more challenging though because the focus is on how to apply concepts and ideas, but it also made the class more interesting. Professor Koelle generally works to include interesting real-world supplementary material. The last two lectures were on HIV, which was an interesting way to end the class and review lots of ideas covered throughout the class.",
    "The material covered in Biol 101 was extensive and extremely interesting. However, it was a challenging course and the workload was significantly more in comparison to my other courses. I would only recommend this course if you are interested in the biological sciences or need it as a prerequisite for another science course, but not if you are just looking for a science requirement.",
    "I would summarize this course as a well-taught and straight forward introduction to the biology sequence. I would recommend the course.",
    "Take it as a requirement for premed or your major, but don't expect to enjoy Professor Koelle's deliverance of the content.",
    "Most people take Biol 101\/102 because they have to but that being said, it's actually a pretty fun class! I had no experience with biology going in to the class and the class was very thorough and taught the material in a way that I could relate to it. It definitely takes a lot of work to do well in the class (quizzes every week- eek!) but the material is something that I will remember for a long time.",
    "BIOL 101 is good if you have no or little background in biology. Otherwise, you get lots of rehashed material.",
    "Good survey course, manageable workload, do not take for fun",
    "I would say it is a good intro bio class that teaches and trains students to think like a scientist. I would recommend it because I gained a deeper understanding of biology through it.",
    "Very difficult overall.",
    "BIOL 101 01 is a well organized course, with a detailed curriculum. I had learned most of these things before, but not for the most part not to the level of detail or from the perspective they were taught here. The work and sections are very helpful applications of the material you learn, and It provides ample resources for help. The professor is easy to understand and explains things well, the assessment questions can be difficult to answer in the manner they require though. I would definitely recommend this course to another student to get a strong biology background.",
    "Only take it if you must.",
    "I would recommend it because it's required for all pre-meds and bio majors.",
    "The course was essentially a more in depth look at biology concepts learned in high school. I would recommend this course to another student because it provided a good foundation for further learning in biological sciences.",
    "Yeah, it's not boring.",
    "Biology 101 is a fast-paced but very interesting course which requires a fair amount of studying and work to excel in. I would recommend the course because it is taught well and has lots of extra help available, although there is a huge amount of information to be understood In depth, which can be very challenging sometimes.",
    "This is a great overview of biology topics from a chemistry perspective. For those who took advanced biology in high school, no new information is presented. Everything is review, but it is worthwhile to see everything again before moving on to new topics. Professor Koelle is very clear and organized and provides lots of resources to help his students succeed (lecture slides are posted online before lecture, each lecture has bulleted \"key concepts\" and underlined \"key terms\" that are always relevant for exams).",
    "Not the most inspiring of courses, something I got through without too much pain, but also not among the more memorable courses I have taken. But thats the nature of a an introductory science lecture.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 01 to another student if they're interested in learning more about Bio and science. Otherwise, no.",
    "People only take it for requirement reasons..."
