   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who likes mathematical econ (especially indifference curves). It was my favorite class this semester, and had a very reasonable workload. It studies equilibria in different situations, and the problems are actually kind of fun because they're like puzzles.",
    "If you would like pursue a more advanced study in economics, this course is a very good starting point. It is certainly more mathematically rigorous than other intermediate level economic classes, but it goes beyond computations and leads you to fully grasp the theories.",
    "It's an Econ&Math requirement. I'm pretty sure that the only reason there were people in the class. It's challenging and theoretical (obviously) but doable.",
    "As with the other Econ-Math courses, take this only if you need to. Going to optional section was really helpful since our TA went over the homework problems with us.",
    "Yes. I thought that the actual work we did was quite fun and interesting. For someone who likes doing math and working with the numbers, it was a fun class.",
    "The textbook is riddled with typos. When you find yourself maximizing an \"objection\" function subject to an imaginary price vector the morning the assignment is due you will see what I mean. General equilibrium theory is conceptually hard to grasp, but who would want to do that anyway?",
    "If you aren't an econ major (and possibly a math econ major at that) you probably don't want to take this course. Of course if you are considering economics for grad school this might help you better understand what lies ahead. It's a good course that isn't too time consuming but the material isn't exactly easy. You probably should only take it if you are considering math econ as a major or are considering grad school. Professor Bewley does make the best of the material though and section lets you do the homework and succeed on the exams.",
    "Take this class if you're a Econ\/Math major, or just interested in a more challenging (and rewarding) econ course.",
    "A good course, you need to take it if you are doing Econ and Math. Sometimes the theory does not seem to relate to the real world, but it's still a rewarding and useful class.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the topic. It is a good class but can be a little to theoretical at times.",
    "Required for the econ-math major. Easy curve and grading, exams not too difficult. Material is not inherently interesting, but it is just math and not hard to learn.",
    "I believe Economics 350 is very challenging course and students should consider taking some course in Real Analysis before taking up this class. Nonetheless, the course is great and very fundamental to the understanding of many economic models."
