    "I learned how to speak and write Korean at a level equivalent to L1.",
    "I learned elementary Korean and the basics of learning a new language. Specifically, I learned basic vocabulary, basic verbs and how to conjugate them in several tenses, and basic grammar. The difference between this introductory language class and the ones I did in high school was that I felt pushed to use what I know to make sentences.",
    "Basic korean languge skills",
    "I developed a basic foundational knowledge of Korean including hangeul, present, past and future tenses, how to indicate direction\/ placement, and other basic word endings.",
    "I learned how to read and write Hangul, how to use basic conversational vocabulary\/phrases\/questions, how to conjugate verbs in informal and formal polite speech, what the irregular verbs are, and some small pieces about Korean culture (food, games, performing arts, politics, other traditions).",
    "Very basics of Korean language characters, conversation, and phrases.",
    "Basic knowledge of the Korean language was obtained, with basic abilities to read, write, and speak.",
    "Learned basic Korean."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths - really nice way to be a beginner in a language, felt that I improved a lot, loved the interactions in groups and with partners and cultural presentations and videos, nice use of a range of learning techniques weaknesses - could have been organized more clearly for grammatical rules - for example, maybe having them all in once place, especially because grammar is not very clearly written in the textbook",
    "Strengths: - providing easy office hours to attend - in class exercises that solidified the lessons Weakness: - sometimes unclear instruction - fast Korean dictations without any prior instruction or experience - unstructured explanation of Korean grammar rules",
    "Grammar points could have been more structured, could have covered more content",
    "Course was overall very strong. Professor Park is a wonderful teacher who was able to explain any confusions clearly. One weakness of the course was the lack of vocabulary. I feel we could have learned a lot more vocabulary but I understand the need to get the basics down first as well.",
    "Strengths include pacing (very helpful for progressing vocabulary!) and cohesiveness. The conversational sections were taught in a logical order that was easy to follow. This facilitated conversational presentations that were fluid in structure and allowed us to practice several different phrases or questions within one scene. As for weaknesses, I wish the language lunch tables were more accessible time-wise. I was never able to attend and would have liked to practice with my peers outside of class more.",
    "An excellent blend of lecture, participation, pair-learning, interaction, conversation, etc. with a seminar-size class. The high amount of interaction between professor and student and students with each other really helped us practice and learn better. The content did seem a little rushed; vocab quizzes of 10 terms a day are fine but 45 terms in a day are kind of death.",
    "Strength of the course regards the instructor, who are very sweet and want the student to succeed. At any time are they approachable for questions, and upload their material daily for those to review. Weakness of the course however was the pacing, which can be difficult due to the amount of work needed to be put in by non-native speakers.",
    "Strength: daily practice Weakness: The way the book used presents the information does not always seem logical to me. For example, I can give directions to how to reach Seoul from Busan, but I do not know how to say black. Thus, I would recommend teaching with overarching themes that facilitates memorizing new words."

    "YES!",
    "Yes, for sure, if you are interested in learning Korean - gentle learning curve!",
    "The curriculum seemed to lack structure in the beginning, but eventually, you realize that it's probably the most efficient way to learn the language. It's indeed a very practical language course, and you'll come away from it knowing the basics and completely capable of furthering your Korean skills on your own, if you wish. Regarding Professor Park, she's the kindest soul you'll ever meet and truly loves her job. Her enthusiasm and kindness are unparalleled and should be protected at all costs.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in take Korean.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Korean. The class was fun and engaging as well as productive and challenging. I felt I made a lot of progress learning Korean, and I'm very excited for next semester.",
    "Yes, enjoyable course",
    "Yes! Korean is a great starter East Asian language because it has an alphabet! If you're at all interested in learning an East Asian language, Korean is the way to go!",
    "Yes, Korean is a great language to begin learning because the alphabet is arranged by syllable which makes it easy to pick up writing and then begin reading. The homework always connected directly to current class material and I had fun learning more about Korean culture alongside my peers.",
    "Yes, overall well-taught language, fun, engaging, and I mean no other option if you want to start learning Korean from nowhere like me",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning another language, as it has been an absolute joy to be in this class.",
    "Yes! A very fun and welcoming class where I learned a lot in!"
