   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to anybody interested in cogsci\/psych\/phil",
    "Take this class only if you don't have motivation to read the current research on your own.",
    "Really interesting, interdisciplinary material. Definitely fascinating and relevant for psych and philosophy students. The worst part about this seminar was getting in. It's absolutely amazing and you should do your best to take it if you can.",
    "Absolutely take this course. In fact, take ANY course you can with Paul Bloom, and especially seminars. Bloom is FANTASTIC at leading student discussion - he cuts people off if they're rambling on, runs a tight ship in class but knows everyone's name and cites your reading responses, and responds provocatively to student comments while still letting students speak (basically, he plays devil's advocate). He also structures the course and the reading responses to absolutely maximize student learning. The end-of-class project was whatever you wanted it to be, and I had a great time with it. One of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "I would certainly recommend it, though next year the course will be offered as a lecture instead of a seminar. Take it!",
    "It was an interesting class with not a lot of volume of work, but you should do the work to get the most out of the class. This final project can be great if you pick a topic you're interested in.",
    "Take it if you can get in! Incredibly interesting topics, great teacher, etc.",
    "This seminar focused in depth on several specific issues in moral psychology. I would highly recommend it to anyone even vaguely interested in morality and discussion-based seminars.",
    "My favorite class at Yale: Survey of topics in moral psychology, riding the border between philosophy and psychology. The class manages to cover a fair amount of material but engage with topics closely at the same time. Readings are incredibly fun and interesting, class is enjoyable and everyone is engaged. Professor Bloom does a great job leading seminar discussions - getting lots of input while keeping the conversation focused. Plus Professor Bloom is kinda amazing. He is perhaps the best professor I've had at Yale.",
    "yes. take it.",
    "This course is a discussion-heavy seminar on moral psychology. Each week focuses on a specific topic, including religion, racism, intergroup psychology, sexuality, and the psychology of different ethical theories (i.e. deontology and consequentialism). A strong background is assumed, and the purpose of the seminar isn't to learn lots of material but to discuss and explore new ideas."
