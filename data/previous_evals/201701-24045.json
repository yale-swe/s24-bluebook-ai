    "I learned to analyze librettos to gain a better understanding of the shape of the music and opera overall.",
    "Prior to this course, I had basically no understanding of how operas work, and this course taught me everything I need to know to now be able to not only enjoy but also understand an opera. For every opera we studied, we looked back to the source material that it was derived from, studied how that source material transformed into the libretto, and then looked at various productions of the same opera to gain a better understanding of different directors' visions. This course has positively changed my life!",
    "I learned about various operas and what goes into making one. This course also broadened my knowledge of the various origins of operas and the librettos that accompany them.",
    "I learned so much about opera, music, writing, and analysis. I learned how to critique a production, and how to separate criticisms for a production from criticisms of a script\/libretto.",
    "i learned a huge amount about opera and how literature interacted with it.",
    "I learned to understand key elements of operas and evaluate an individual staging's qualities and problems.",
    "Familiarity with the development and history of opera, with representative works chosen from major composers\/time periods. General demystification of the art form."

   "comments": [
    "The strength of the course is that it has a very flexible structure, so the classes are always very enjoyable, since the majority of the time is spent just discussing the opera we are learning at the time. Homework assignments are also really interesting and fun, and Professor Malafronte is an expert in her field, so it is awesome to be able to bring any questions you have to class and have her tell you her personal experiences. There aren't any major weaknesses.",
    "Strengths- great class, the professor is AMAZING. Professor Malafronte is so smart, a great teacher, kind, and she makes learning about music\/opera fun! I loved every minute of the class. The one thing I wish had been different was having physical copies of the texts we read, which would make it easier to analyze and discuss in class.",
    "I believe that the course was pretty well organized but I thought it could be improved if more (small) assignments were added and fewer long ones were included.",
    "I think this course was overall very strong. I think it would benefit from one introductory lesson, after shopping period, of the key terms and notions to aide discussion of this often unfamiliar topic in the following lessons.",
    "Strength: very able and knowledgeable instructor. Incredible all-expenses-paid opportunity to visit Met in NYC. Weakness: I would actually have not been opposed to more \"lecturing\" - that is, just general information and context surrounding the operas, as the instructor was so knowledgeable and experienced."

    "This course was easily one of my favorite classes so far at Yale.",
    "Absolutely! I am not a music major, but I took this course to learn something I think will be useful in my life, so if you have any interest in opera, you should take it!",
    "YES!!! Definitely take this course, even if you have no interest in opera. You'll develop a deeper appreciation of both the art form and the people behind them. Great course with a wonderful instructor!",
    "YES! 100%",
    "Absolutely take this class, Judy Malafronte is amazing. She is super talented and at the same time really cares about us learning.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course, especially if your taking 5 credits. Even if your not familiar with the opera, Professor Malafronte is very engaging and you will end up loving this artistic form. This course's workload is not heavy, and you'll get from it as much as you put in.",
    "Yes, definitely recommended, provided you have some baseline interest in the subject. The small class atmosphere is very nice, and this is a course which is not terribly stressful but also packed with interesting content."
