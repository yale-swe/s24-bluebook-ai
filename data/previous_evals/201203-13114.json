    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It is interesting and engaging. I feel that you will learn a lot. However, the class is pretty disorganized and the grading criteria is unclear. If you are someone who needs a course with a set grading system and structure, I would not recommend this course.",
    "I would not really recommend it. I didn't really learn anything from the class, though I had high hopes, and although there is only two papers, I don't know if I'd repeat the experience just for a credit.",
    "This class should not be offered. This class is a joke. Honestly, I don't know how \"easy\" it is, because we didn't get a single grade back, and close to no feedback! We wrote about 3 2-page papers, 2 15-page papers, and gave several presentations.I don't think I learned anything and would seriously regret taking it. Even if you're just looking to fulfill a science credit, I would recommend taking something else.",
    "Minerals and Human Health is a solid fifth class. I enjoyed the fact that because there were no exams I was able to read the literature (some of which was over my head as I am not a science major) free of pressure. The opportunity became one of learning simply for the sake of learning and enjoyment. Overall, the course was great: the guest lectures kept each class meeting interesting and I learned a lot about a variety of concepts. At the same time, however, I was not prepared to write the midterm and final papers as we were expected to really engage with environmental and biological literature and report back in such a way that the assignment became one of paraphrasing hard-to-paraphrase material without adding much original thought. Overall, though, the workload was entirely manageable. If you are someone who likes deadlines and clear explanations for assignments be prepared for this class to jostle you a bit as we were often not given either of those things. Also, we did not receive any grades throughout the course of the semester, which was incredibly frustrating.",
    "A pretty easy course, though both profs are pretty unorganized and I have no idea what my grade will be. Still, a good course if youre interested in geology and health\/medicine"
