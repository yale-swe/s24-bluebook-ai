   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student (even though it's mandatory and my recommendation might not carry much weight either way). I would summarize it as a lecture\/discussion series involving the majority of tenured faculty within the Yale political science department, introducing students to a wide range of approaches, questions, and methodological tools that are used in the discipline today. I also would mention that a number of very useful pieces of wisdom were passed along regarding the state of the professional discipline of political science (beyond graduate school) and strategic advice about how to focus our efforts for the next few years.",
    "Seeing as how the course revolves around weekly readings selected by guest speakers, I would say that it really depends on who's scheduled to talk in a given week. Some of the readings and presenters were very interesting. Others seemed to connect less with the students. In the future, Intro to the Study of Politics might work better as a workshop that first-year students have to attend in the first term (in addition to a normal course load).",
    "I would highly recommend the course, but to take it with the commitment to do the readings to take advantage of everything.",
    "Required course, don't spend too much time on it, take five classes your first semester unless you're taking both stats and modeling, in which case Intro will be a nice respite.",
    "Political Science 510 is a circus of professors in the department. It is useful as a way to gain insight into the work that faculty do and are interested in (past and present research) as well as to understand the ways in which people work and the process of conducting research.",
    "New political science grad students have to take the class. I think it's useful."

   "comments": [
    "An interesting review of political science at Yale.",
    "Please see above.",
    "The issues were different from week to week, so \"deepening\" knowledge of the discipline doesn't appear to be the point of the course.I did enjoy hearing about Sue's project and her experiences as a political scientist.",
    "I learned about the breadth of methods in political science and how they may be used. It was great learning about the diversity of topics and ongoing scholarly discussions.",
    "Introduced me to some of the work being done in the department and professors I'd be interested in taking classes from outside my subfield.",
    "The course did not deepen my knowledge of the discipline terribly much. I learned a great deal about certain members of the faculty and read some very interesting papers. I expect this will not contribute to my dissertation greatly but was important for enabling me to learn more about others in the department, including the members of my cohort.",
    "Good start into grad school."
