    "N\/A \u0096 Elective: I took this course as an advanced substitute for the required Environmental Design course and thought that it filled this role very well. I would recommend this as a course to take if someone has covered the basics of Environmental Design previously and wanted to test these ideas through an interdisciplinary project. I believe that this is a key second year course because it provides a foundation of ideas about sustainability and the opportunity for collaboration, both which are useful in the second half of the March I program."

    "I wish we had talked about the different rating systems earlier because I think it could have been an excellent conversation, but when we talked about them in the class, everyone was so tired from working on finals that people didn't really participate much.",
    "I thought overall the course was really interesting... however, I found the exercises that didn't involve design to be the most valuable... I really enjoyed the assessment methods portion of the course, and I wish we had covered that earlier...Since there is limited time, we weren't able to develop the designs in a manner that was actually useful...Also, this is really the only course offered that covers issues of sustainability at the architecture school. It may be a more valuable course if it was two semesters... one semester of lecture \/ readings and one semester of design... and then people could opt in or out of the design portion.",
    "The assignment of a project in India was completely contrary to the topic of the course. Hello!? Sustainable design. Not \"conventional-design that sits at a desk and never visits a site and comes up with a greenwashed idea of what sustainable is\" design. The course is supposed to be about true sustainable design that recognizes the subtle nuances of the earth, reads the landscape, communicates with the people and client, recognizes the site in the context of the community and culture, etc. etc. etc. I was disgusted that we were asked to apply the term sustainable design to a project we had never been to and had no visceral knowledge of. Instead it became an exercise in cut and paste green design...the type that will make architects millions over the next decade but will leave our planet and its inhabitants ever more impoverished.",
    "The assignments were far too taxing for a 3-credit elective. It wouldn't be enough to just read 100 pages...We'd have to read 100 pages, meet with a partner from the Forestry school (our schedules were never aligned), AND collaborate on a write-up.Additionally, not enough time was spent on the final project. I think it should have been introduced 1-2 weeks earlier in the semester.",
    "very good and interesting comprehensive history of sustainablity and applicable to us. I felt the final project was very sucessful in encouraging forestry students and architecture students to work together. good project. could have used less of the smaller assignments.",
    "I think that the concepts and mechanisms the course exposed were very useful but could achieve a better final project if restructured. The project is something that should underlie the structure of the whole semester and the individual assignments can help reshape those ideas. For example, I think that the instrument development and case studies are better served as tools to implement during development of the project. On the other hand, using green rating systems on our projects was a good reminder across the board but came too late to act on or react to.The reading load at the beginning of the course was quite heavy, unfocused, and too general in my opinion. I think that these issues are general knowledge of a Yale graduate student in either discipline and that the originating sources should just be listed for outside reference. Instead, it would be useful to incite more debate and discussion of current projects and practices during the seminar time. In general, the first half of the course was too general and could be refocused on understanding simple and complex procedures at the urban and detail scale."

    "To be honest, I was expecting great things. I am at Yale, one of the greatest learning institutions in the world. Why was the caliber of conversation so low, so unchallenging? The material presented was either old school sustainability, or greenwashed hype. The professor is very nice and well meaning but failed to inspire or challenge the class. The architects in the course should have been required to read up on environmental issues before being in the course, instead we wasted weeks rehashing basic environmental problems that the Foresters have been studying and learning about for years. Concurrently the foresters should have been having assignments to teach them design and graphics skills so that they could contribute to the final designs better. We never did talk about sustainable design and what sustainability means for us - there wasn't enough critique (by the students) of the information presented - instead people we obnoxiously silent and unwilling tocontribute - or perhaps ignorant?",
    "I definitely didn't learn anything I could use to pass the LEED exam (perhaps this was a silly expectation)....But I did learn a lot about new\/ancient sustainable technologies from the Forestry students.",
    "it was very good to work with forestry students and very intersting to see their perpsective on things. i found this course very helpful",
    "My expectations for this course were to cover the historical base and development of ideas about sustainability and try to implement some new ideas through collaboration between the forestry and architecture schools. My expectations were well met but I think that if more innovative proposals were pushed in each of the three teams I think there would be a greater discussion of ideas in the final review."

    "Other than a few case studies and forcing me to look at a few more of the sustainable certification processes the course failed to inspire me in new ways.",
    "Make up my knowledge on sustainable urban development and design",
    "very high and very applicable to profession",
    "I appreciated this course especially in complement to the theories of environment course with Ariane Lourie-Harrison. Where Ariane's course challenged the theories and consequences, posed for discussion more radical proposals and installations, this course offered the opportunity to create a masterplan and system that works with the environment and a key cross-disciplinary opportunity."

   "comments": [
    "Naomi is a great professor and does a great job of encouraging discussion about the issues at hand.",
    "The TA was excellent and contributed significantly to the class. The instructor was well intentioned but did not take enough of a leadership role in the course in terms of pushing the envelope, challenging student ideas, even playing devils advocate where necessary. The assignments were often played out over in class and learning was very slow. Obviously the merging of architecture and environmental design is challenging.",
    "Sometimes, Naomi depended too much on the students to present the course material. Other times, Naomi took control and taught the lesson, but the class was more interested in having a discussion. I think there needs to be more of a balance between Naomi's presentations and class discussions.",
    "very good",
    "I think that the TA for this course should be a dual-major candidate as they offer this cross-disciplinary understanding and support. The TA could play a much more active role as well, helping to start an active discussion within the seminar and also to provide assistance and more informal reviews over the length of the team project."

    "It would be nice to have a software learning day for the FES students so we can help out more with the presentations.",
    "Provide extra sessions for architects and foresters in order for them each to bone up on any deficiencies. Maximize class time with presenting new material, push the envelope - we need to be more critical of what is being passed off as sustainable design. The design assignment, turned into more of a placing of \"green technologies\" rather than a designing for how people really interact with the landscape. We never even discussed design methodologies such as zone and sector analysis, niche analysis, random assortment, pattern recognition and mimicking, overlay mapping (GIS), observation(reading the landscape), etc.",
    "A big assignment every week is just too much. Additionally, we should be able to choose our group for our final project.",
    "less of the smaller assignments. although they were good for encouraging interaction between forestry students and architecture students",
    "My main suggestion is for a greater integration of the project throughout the semester. Also, to balance the workload better between the architecture and forestry students I would encourage finding outlets for software training at the beginning of the semester. This could also be structured as an exchange of knowledge where we teach each other what we know best, to create a greater common understanding toward the interdisciplinary collaboration."
