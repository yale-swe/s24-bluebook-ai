   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have to take ECON 131. It's better than Benkard's class.",
    "The first half of the course is about statistics. The lecture at times can be just a bit confusing but the professor is nice and helpful. The class gets better after the midterm.",
    "Make no mistake, this is THE worst class at Yale. Econ majors have to take it, so these reviews probably won't affect your decision, but don't go in with any high hopes. The lectures are terrible, the TA's this year were probably the worst, assignments were mediocre and contrived, the exams were just dumb. And whatever you do, do not take the oral exams.The only good thing about this course is that Kitamura is a really nice guy. But it doesn't help much. Blah.",
    "The lecture is terrible. The only learning I did was teaching myself how to do the problem sets. Sometimes seems to make simple concepts more difficult than they need to be",
    "Take this class, especially if you don't want to the workload of Econ 135 and 136.",
    "This is a basic and dry introduction to econometrics. It is useful stuff to know, but don't expect to rave about the class.",
    "It's basic statistics, coupled with some new topics (multivariable regression). If you've had any sort of statistics in the past, this class is a joke. You will be bored out of your mind, however...",
    "You probably want to take this class or a stat class just for regular life. It is useful for reading econ papers. Definitely take this instead of Econ 135.",
    "you have to take it to be an econ major other wise it is pretty boring. learning STATA was a great plus",
    "It was good. It has problem sets every week and midterm and final.",
    "This class generally has basic concepts. Professor Kitamura, while very helpful and knowledgeable, was extremely hare to understand in lecture, which made it hard to pay attention to him. I ended up teaching myself most of the concepts, which turned out to not be that difficult. It is a great class if interested in how we relate statistics and random samples to economic models.",
    "Econ 131 is required for the major, but make sure not to take it with Professor Kitamura, he is horrible. I could not pay attention in class at all, and ended up stopping going. You REALLY do not need to go to class to do well on the exams, the professor teaches horribly and class is abysmally boring. Make sure to take it with another professor",
    "If you have to take it, then do. Otherwise, definitley not worth it -- take a different stats course.",
    "Take it if you need to",
    "Maybe if you have to take it with Prof Kitamura that specific semester.. otherwise I'd recommend checking out the other teacher next semester.",
    "Hybrid of probability, statistics, and regression. The class is far too easy, making the curve ridiculously difficult.",
    "This is an acceptable way of fulfilling the stats requirement for EPE or the econometrics requirement for Econ. Professor Kitamura is more interesting than a lot of econ, math, or science profs, but he is still not all that fascinating and leaves much to be desired. The course teaches the essentials, but not in a very interactive or engaging way.",
    "Yeah! It's a good intro class for econometrics and is not to work intensive",
    "If you are looking for a valuable learning experience, don't take this class. If you need to take this for Econ major or want a class with a nice curve then take it. The problem sets are pretty simple and take 2-3 hours on average. Exams aren't bad but everyone does well. Most people never show up to class because all of the slides and lecture notes are posted online.",
    "This course was a solid introduction on statistics. The economic applications were limited to the economic papers that we studied, which were definitely interesting and a great way for us to see the direct applications of what we were learning. Prof. Kitamura sometimes made it difficult for me to pay attention, but his slides were superb. The problem sets were sometimes long and the grading for them was rather harsh at times (a check for two careless minor mistakes?). I definitely learned the fundamental basics of econometrics with this class, but I would need another class to really feel comfortable with econometrics though.",
    "It is a good class and covers important material. If Prof. Kitamura teaches you will have all the lecture notes (which are pretty good) and slides available online, which is convenient for review. Lectures might be hard to follow, but should not be too rough if you form study groups and attend review sessions.",
    "Confusing prerequisite",
    "The first half is very basic and somewhat of a drag. Once regression starts after spring break, things get a bit more interesting.The class is not much work at all, and going to class was often not necessary to do well on the exams.I'd recommend the class only because of the regression tools it equips you with. Other than that, the class was frankly quite boring.",
    "This is actually a great class, and not only for econ majors: poli sci and so on, it will teach you the basics of data analysis and If you have to take econometrics I definitely say take it in the spring",
    "If you have to take econometrics, take it with Yuichi. He might come off as dry and boring at first, but the class is really not that bad. Problems sets are half from the book (extremely simple) and half from material discussed in lecture. Midterm + final consists of material from class, problem sets, and old exams. Some people might say they learned by reading the book and not going to lecture, but the book is really a waste of time and money if you already have some background in statistics. Not a very hard class and the workload isn't too bad. About 45% of the class gets some type of A; however, the averages for both the midterm and final were pretty high so don't rely on too much of a curve.",
    "If you are interested in doing empirical research then this class is pretty important.",
    "Yes \u0096 a good introduction to statistics with a focus on using Stata software to obtain real results. You\u0092re given the theory in lecture but only need to know the applications in the problem sets. A solid foundation for anybody looking to analyze quantitative models."
