    "Absolutely take this class! It is one of the most interesting that I have taken at Yale thus far. This is really one of the most interesting and delightful courses I have ever taken at Yale. If you take the time to do the readings, it is also one of the most rewarding. I learned so much about the Himalaya, but also about a new way to look at the world. This class challenged me to think about culture and language in new and fascinating ways. The final project is great because it allows everyone to pick something that is of real interest to him or her. The reading responses are great to make you really consider what the main themes of the week are as well as how they fit in with the narrative thrust of the course. Everything was just wonderful. That being said, it could depend a lot of the students in the class, but the course title attracts a very specific crowd. Mark Turin is probably one of the best and most delightful professors at Yale, and is worth taking a class with.",
    "Take this class. Then take it again, and again, and again, and again. It is amazing.It's an anthropology seminar about everything in the Himalayan region (Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, etc). Although there's a slight emphasis on linguistic anthropology (what's up with all these endangered languages? what does a language revel about a culture? etc.), the course really covers everything from religion to mountains to temples to constitutions to construction. It strikes a pretty good balance between teaching content about this region, exposing\/introduction students to anthropological theory, and forcing you to engage critically with tough ideas.What really makes the course, as is always true, is the professor. We were also blessed with an eclectic and smart group of undergraduate and graduate students this year, but mostly Mark Turin is a ridiculously excited and exciting and energetic and passionate man who will make you love showing up to class every day and feel super motivated to strive through even the toughest readings. Be warned: he did not do a very good job of calling out BS in discussions, or really challenging our ideas. But he definitely will make you excited to think about ideas and challenge them on your own.",
    "This was a really great class. Mark is unbelievably knowledgeable and unbelievably nice -- he really, really cares about his students, and he takes your ideas seriously (so seriously, actually, that each week you're embarrassed to have turned in such a low-quality response paper and continually resolve to do a better job next time). Everyone taking the seminar came from a very different academic background but everyone had a deep, personal connection to the Himalaya region, propelling the class discussion to a very high, but very fascinating level. Like, actually, the final presentations that everyone did just blew my mind. The readings were fabulous, ranging from everything to ethnographies that read like a novel to a discourse on caves to the Muluki Ain -- you'll learn so much about indigenous languages and religion and post-colonialism and environmentalism and educational policy and etc, etc, etc. Plus you get to visit the Beinecke and the Map Department, meet a whole bunch of Himalaya scholars, and just really absorb anthropology at an expert but non-threatening level. If you're interested in the Himalayas, for whatever reason (we had some biologists in the class!), and if this class is offered again, definitely take it!",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "A standard survey of some important political and cultural debates pertaining to the Himalayan region",
    "SAST 369 is a survey class covering a wide variety of topics about the Himalayas.If you're interested in Himalayan Studies, or language and culture in general, you'll love this class! Each week's readings focus on a different element of Himalayan Studies-- census and national identity, environmental concerns, linguistics-- and the class is a seminar-style discussion of that week's topic. Professor Turin is an expert on Himalayan anthropology with decades of experience, and he invites a host of colleagues and interesting experts to visit as well. I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student-- it was one of my favorites at Yale so far!",
    "Take it. Great class with a manageable workload. The material is pretty widespread so it's hard to get sOmething entirely concrete from this class aside from theory and perspective but I think that's what's so great about it!",
    "Really interesting, low-stress course with a wonderful professor. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who already have a background knowledge of the region. The course organization was not very clear in my opinion. I think that a midterm paper should have been substituted instead of either leading discussion or writing reading responses. It was frustrating to have not received any sort of feedback in the course.",
    "ANTH 353 is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and it's mostly due to professor Mark Turin. With great depth of knowledge about the region, warmth, and a sophisticated, rapid-fire sense of humor, Turin proved a fascinating and adept director of discussion during seminar - a seminar full of \"whoa-intelligent\" people who all really wanted to be there.We toured multiple facets of the Himalaya, focusing in Nepal but branching out to Bhutan, Tibet, and Northern India, exploring concepts of ethnicity\/race, language, identity, caste, religion, textual and oral tradition, cartography, census, legal and political constitution, migration, natural ecosystems, the Himalaya in the western imagination, and present-day political goings on. Reading is about 200 pages a week, but is almost all very interesting; weekly response papers encourage you draw out things you read about and personally found interesting. You also have to read two books and write a final paper. At least for us, Turin often invited in fascinating guest lecturers in for half the seminar as well, which was nice.Only regrets: I wish I'd met more with professor Turin termtime. If this class is offered again and you're interested in anthropology, language, ethnicity, or the region as a whole, you'd be obligated to take it."
