    "Lections were very detailed with good explanation. This courses were very useful for me.",
    "The course was well designed and gave a broad overview of randomized clinical trials. I found the topics discussed in the class very interesting and engaging. It was a great overview of simple size calculations, power analysis, history and designs of clinical trials. I would recommend the course to students, PIs, research personnel interested in conducting randomized clinical trials.",
    "A lot of the material was review from regulatory affairs and clinical trials. It would have been interesting to find out more about clinical trials from multiple perspectives - not just how to set up a trial, but different considerations from the pharmaceutical industry as well.",
    "This is such a great class! I learned so much from Maria.",
    "This is a good course which covers the material implied by the title of the course. However, the vast majority of the course is spent listening to lectures. A format that is more engaging, perhaps with discussion of landmark trials during class in combination with lecture, would have helped my enjoyment.",
    "Easy course.Lightest one I ever had at YSPHIt is suppose to be that way. That is what i took out of it.The slides for the course are great and lots of meaningful information.Most of the information in the class is already known. It was a good review."

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is very understanding and tailors the coursework to the types of students taking the class. The class would have been more engaging if it was more interactive; instead of all lecture material, we could have had more class discussion about current topics in clinical trials.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is a great professor! She is very excited to teach, which really shows during her lectures. Her liveliness really made learning fun, and although some of the material was tough, she would always try her best to introduce difficult subjects. She would thoroughly answer any questions.",
