   "comments": [
    "Excellent course. Liu Laoshi is such a great teacher, but moreover, she is an interesting, funny person. She often shares fascinating personal experiences that give insight into China and Chinese culture. You get a lot more from this course than simply expanded facility with the Chinese language; you understand more about Chinese culture.",
    "It's a continuation of CHNS 132, so now that all the speakers from 132 are roughly at the same Chinese level, the class is a lot tougher and you can't slack off because there is no mercy in language classes, especially when the language is as tough as Chinese. It's really a lot of fun though--you learn a lot about interesting cultural and historical tidbits in China, and a lot of the discussions end up being relevant to your (presumed) status as an Asian American as well.",
    "I would recommend this class only to those who really want to improve their Chinese skills. It was a lot of work and I only got through it because I really enjoyed the language. It would have been miserable if I didn't have a passion for the language.",
    "If you're a heritage speaker who wants to improve written and verbal Chinese skills, definitely take this course. I went from knowing 8 characters at the beginning of 132 to being able to write full paragraphs of Chinese without much effort, and my verbal skills have improved dramatically. Liu Laoshi is incredibly helpful and very kind, and I cannot think of a single complaint about her. The class is definitely a lot of work: while none of it is \"hard,\" it's a whole lot of rote memorization and recitation, and the sheer amount of time you'll have to spend copying characters is definitely frustrating at times especially given daily homework and daily quizzes. In the end, though, it's completely worth it - I've really improved my Chinese ability and I wholeheartedly recommend this course.",
    "Chinese for heritage speakers, part II. Great textbook in the spring, a lot of cool, really broad topics touched upon in class, even in the context of seemingly dry grammar-based lessons.",
    "If you speak Chinese at home, but can't read or write a single word in Chinese, take this class and your Chinese will improve immensely. The entire class is taught in Chinese, and the material covers interesting topics centered around cultural aspects of China and its differences from American culture. Highly recommended!",
    "Take it if you want to improve your Chinese skills. Your skills will indeed improve. It's not an easy language class",
    "CHNS 142 is well worth the struggle. I know of a few students who, after CHNS 132, switched into the non-Heritage track for L4 Chinese, but I was glad to have stuck with CHNS 142. It is undoubtedly difficult, but the gains that I've made in Chinese are more than I ever imagined. When paired with CHNS 132, I went from having extreme anxiety at the prospect of needing to converse in Chinese to being able to converse in Chinese with peers without first converting it from English to Chinese in my head. Liu Laoshi is fantastic, not only as a professor but also as a friend, and she truly cares about her students. The lesson plans for CHNS 142 are much more interesting than those for CHNS 132, and incorporate more than just the book's lessons. Additionally, the environment of being around other Chinese-Americans with similar backgrounds in Chinese provides such an amazing community. Some of my classmates are now my really good friends, not only because we had to study together but also because we understand each others' upbringings and identities as Chinese Americans. In short, I highly recommend CHNS 142."
