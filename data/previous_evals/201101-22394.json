    "I'm not sure if I'd recommend it. I think in other semesters it's been a really fun--if intense--class for people and this semester was an off semester (that's what I hear from people). Professor Reed blamed it on our class, but I'm not sure if that's fair. I think if you really want to learn about art and want to study it and work at it, then sure, go ahead and take it with Robert Reed and just be prepared for some stressful things. If you just want something different and want to try drawing, probably take it with another professor.",
    "Take this course if you are willing to wake up early and give yourself up to Professor Reed's method (madness?). Also, only take this class if you are going to have enough time to dedicate to it - a lot of time.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken here at Yale. That doesn't mean everyone who wants such an experience should take it. You should be willing to put in work to see the results of your labor. But it's very worth it. Take it and STICK WITH IT to prove yourself to yourself.",
    "If you want to learn how to draw and learnlots of technique, this class is not for you. It's highly individual and depending on what kinds of things you decide to focus on, you could be dealing with very abstract stuff, or very literal stuff.",
    "It's a ton of work if you take it with Robert Reed, but it's so worth it. Pretty sure this course almost killed me, but I wouldn't change a thing.",
    "Here's my hook: take prof reed's class and your drawing will improve. So long as you have time, that's a guarantee.The problem of course, is that you might not have the time. Or, you might not be aware of how much time you have to put in.So here's my warning: if you take this class, put in the time from day one, and don't stop. You will see improvements by leaps and bounds, and better, convince yourself that you can teach yourself anything.If you don't, then you risk having the experience that our class had: more haunting than pleasant. Every monday and wednesday morning, I remember being engulfed in anxiety -- will prof Reed roast me today? -- and being relieved after class had ended. Everything about the class was desperate, desperately trying to avoid repudiation; desperately trying to finish drawings.Prof Reed could have handled things better, in my opinion. He could have been less angry, more forgiving. But I recognize too the potential that this class can be so long as you put in the time."
