    "In this class, we read different works of political philosophy about power. I have mixed feelings about this class, because I'm not really into philosophy. Sometimes the readings felt intimidating or unapproachable. There wasn't much group discussion. The assignments were a 2500 word paper and a 4000 word paper, which is very reasonable and manageable.",
    "Maybe it was because it was the first time it was offered, but I do not think this was a good class, even though it had the potential to be.",
    "I was drawn at first by the entertaining introduction to the syllabus. The class turned out, however, not as entertaining. The lecture was a bit scattered, and the discussion was monopolized by several students. This improved in the later classes but the discussion was still uninspired. Perhaps this is a result of a different student-professor dynamic -- Professor Lebron taught at UVA before, and this was his first semester at Yale.",
    "No, I couldn't recommend this class. Material is good for the philosophers (Nietzsche, Hobbes, Mill, Marx, Lukes, Foucault, etc.). Almost too dense, and I didn't get much out of the class discussions. What Professor Lebron said made little sense at points, and his interpretations seemed entirely his own. Could potentially get better, but I'd avoid it until Lebron has time to grow as a professor. Oh, and his paper prompts made NO SENSE.",
    "PLSC 282 is a survey seminar of the basic philosophy of power. It explores mostly descriptive questions, like \"what is power,\" and \"how do we identify power.\" If you are a political science major, you should definitely take the course. Come to class prepared by having spent time on your reading. Readings include: Marx, Neitzsche, Hobbes, Foucault, etc.I would definitely recommend the course, but don't take it expecting a light workload.",
    "Take it, I think it will be better next time",
    "No",
    "Stay away. Stay far, far away. PLSC 282 was the worst course I have taken at Yale so far -- hands down. The class was poorly organized and poorly taught. Discussions were extremely dull and added very little to my understanding of the material. We fell behind the syllabus very quickly, and ending up only getting through about 2\/3 of the listed material. Both paper prompts were confusing, bizarre and difficult to answer effectively. Everyone I spoke to in the class struggled significantly with both due to the weird structure of the prompts. Professor Lebron does not seem prepared to lead the class. He often seemed unfamiliar with the material, was not good at leading the discussion (i.e. striking an effective balance between lecturing and letting the students speak, etc.) and was relatively unhelpful with our assignments outside of class. I would absolutely avoid this class and any other classes he is teaching in the near future."
