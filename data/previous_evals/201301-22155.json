    "Professor Illakowicz is one of the nicest people I have ever known and I would highly endorse any of her classes. She is a superb teacher.",
    "Definitely gained an appreciation for Polish cinema through this course--and this is coming from a Polish student. Thought-provoking and innovative, these films were a treat to see. The class did a good job of challenging you to see the allegory.",
    "This class is a basic filmography class where the students analyze the life of Poles through World War II and Communism. I would recommend this class to anyone who has ever had an interest in European Communism. Since you do not need to know any Polish for this class, anyone can take it.",
    "yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Take it! It's not a killer amount of work and the two papers you have to write, Prof. Illakowicz is very open to editing and helping you make the best paper it could be. Just DO NOT blow it off. This class is not a joke. Participate, care about the material and things will be great.",
    "I would definitely recommend FILM 241 to anyone interested in filmmaking and\/or Polish\/Communist history. It's also a great way to get a humanities credit."
