    "If you need it for a credit of some sort, otherwise, there are better seminars out there.",
    "I would asolutely recommend social movements to another student. There are weekly reading responses, one open note in class midterm and a final paper. The discussions are lively, but prepare for a lot of self-righteous students pushing a political agenda. Even including them however, the class really gets into theory as opposed to history which is an interesting premise for discussion.",
    "Take it! Eyerman is everything you want a seminar professor to be. He's great at leading discussion, he'll genuinely respond to all of your reading responses with thoughts and questions, and he's actually one of the biggest names in his field. Even if you're not super interested in \"social movements\" per se - honestly, I wasn't, past Occupy or the Civil Rights movement - take this class for the social theory and for a chance to hang out with Eyerman.",
    "A course on different aspects and topics in regards to social movements, taught by a great professor. It primarily focuses on social movements in the US and Europe over the past 100 years. Great class with interesting discussions! Take it.",
    "Theory. If you're super curious about social movements and ecstatic about the idea of this class, this should get you where you want to go. If there is a group of friends in the class; a good class chemistry, discussions will be great. If you don't engage with the material of the courseon your own time, beyond what's required, however, you will get far less out of the course.",
    "The textbook may be a little dry but the discussions in class are usually very exciting. The course is very much concerned with the culture of social movements, particularly solidarity, identity, and motivations. It would be advantageous to have had some background in sociology or social theory.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone--it's interesting, the in-class midterm is incredibly manageable and the final paper is on a topic of your choice, meaning it's actually interesting to research. Professor Eyerman is wonderful. Even if you don't have a strong background in sociology the readings\/discussions will still be accessible to you.",
    "Take Social Movements! Professor Eyerman is one of my favorite professors at Yale and he does a really great job leading this course. While your mileage may vary based on the other students in the seminar, we had a lot of people who cared a lot, which led to good discussions (so really, do the readings and speak up in class). There are a few long-ish weekly readings (usually one chapter of theory from the textbook and one or two online articles\/chapters of case study), weekly reading responses, an interesting in-class midterm, and a final research paper. This isn't a history course; it focuses more on the theory of social movements and applying that to various cases."
