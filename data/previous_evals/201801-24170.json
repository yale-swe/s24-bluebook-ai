    "The course offered a strong background in heritage and museum practice in the UAE, both through fieldwork and secondary literature. I learned to think through questions of nationbuilding, tradition, modernity, and urbanization in a way that greatly expanded my understanding of urbanization and globalization in the Arabian Peninsula, and the role of museum's in urban centers more generally.",
    "Even though the course was designed around material outside of my main field of interest, I learned new methodologies and approaches to contemporary art history in the UAE. This class was very useful for understanding the function of art and museums as political tools.",
    "I learned how to think about museums in various contexts, both historical and nation-specific ones, as well as learned to engage critically with the idea of the museum as a cultural product. The trip component was integral to my understanding of the themes presented in the course, and highlighted how important it is to conduct on-site fieldwork."

    "The course was largely research-focused and driven by the students various interests; the professor managed to expertly guide our work while offering room for exploration. This has easily been one of the most enjoyable and stimulating seminars I have taken, and I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to take part in it.",
    "The strengths of this class were the quality of Professor Rizvi's teaching combined with the students' range of backgrounds. The course did not have any weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. The course far exceeded my expectations and introduced me to an unfamiliar region and unfamiliar body of scholarship that I found generative and plan to continue to explore in relation to my own work; this is a rare privelage in graduate school, when we are often directed to focus on our own research.",
    "Yes! It was a wonderful opportunity to travel and conduct fieldwork in the UAE. Even without the trip, the course was well worth my time because of the phenomenal class readings and discussions.",
    "Yes, if the student is interested in intense engagement with the subject at hand. This course would not suit someone looking to do the minimum."
