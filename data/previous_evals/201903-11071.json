   "comments": [
    "The course's greatest strength is Dave's passion for the content and his genuine personability. That being said, I sometimes felt that the content of class discussion was too surface-level - we would often only skim our topics of study and we sometimes shied away from \"big questions\" about morality, the nature of power, and how these questions play into China's rise. In the future, I would hope that discussion of the course might tackle these more difficult issues, beyond surveying the news of the day.",
    "Overall the class is great--very comprehensive and engaging, amazing guest lecturers, interesting discussions. The news discussion part is my favorite. To improve: -Consider reduce the number of reading materials--leave only the essentials and cut the 2-hour podcasts out. Take only 1-2 chapters from each book per week. Highlight the focus of the chosen topic. Perhaps scan the materials into pdfs for students beforehand? -Diversify the assignments--memo writing may not be that useful for non-Jackson students. -Share more stories from your diplomat career--we are very interested.",
    "I wish Dave talked more. He clearly knows so much about China and has so much we could learn from, but he doesn't say as much about his stories. Also there is so much reading. Also, there is no need for a TA.",
    "Strengths Dave is the best and he's very clear about expectations and what you'll get out of the course. Sense of how diplomacy works and what diplomats value in writing and communications. Dave manages to be very busy but still give you very thoughtful and substantive comments. Weaknesses Wish it were two times a week and not on a Friday afternoon but nothing is perfect.",
    "It could use longer and more involved discussions about the readings. The syllabus and the readings are very helpful--I learned a lot from them.",
    "I thought the readings were INCREDIBLY interesting, though I do think there was a lot of it. I wouldve liked if we did a LOT more discussion of the readings. Sometimes, there was almost no discussion of the readings, which was rough when there was a lot of information that had been covered. I also felt like the class leading was much too short, and wouldve liked if the students leading had more opportunity to talk about their views\/lead the class in discussion. Often, discussions were given less than twenty minutes."

    "I would recommend this course to a student seeking an introduction to China's rise, yes.",
    "Maybe. If you want to learn how to write policy then yes.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any Yale student. The skills developed and the fascinating knowledge about China are must-haves for any student interested in East Asia or US diplomacy.",
    "Yes, Dave is great and the class is really interesting if you want to learn more about China",
    "Yes, especially to students interested in state department work",
    "100%. If you want to understand China this is a great foundational course. Impossible to cover everything but with the various memos you have a ton of opportunities to write about what you want.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It provided a really good background of Chinas history and I thought it was a very challenging but also very informative way to learn about China."
