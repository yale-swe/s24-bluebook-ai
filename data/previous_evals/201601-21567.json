    "I would only recommend this course if you are REALLY REALLY REALLY interested in ancient myth. The course practically has no sci-fi and was a lot of work. Discussions were interesting though.",
    "Ancient Myth, Fiction, and Science Fiction was a fantastic freshman seminar. The syllabus was great and all of the readings were engaging. The papers helped students to engage in the readings and better understand the material. The course was a great opportunity to take a small seminar with great peers and a fantastic professor; discussion was always engaging and enlightening. Professor LeVen is a fantastic professor. She is incredibly intelligent and did a wonderful job of leading a fascinating seminar. She provided many insights into the material and was extremely knowledgeable. I would recommend both this course and other courses with Professor LeVen to other students.",
    "CLCV 056 is an enjoyable class to take, even for a non-classics major. There is a fair amount of reading, but it is all interesting and fun to have discussions about. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in taking a literature class, regardless of your major plans.",
    "Highly recommend if you have an interest in fiction and\/or mythology, or if you enjoy reading interesting literature with an awesome professor. I'd think anyone with any humanities leanings would enjoy this class.",
    "This class looks at classic texts and begins to extract pieces to help understand how to define a myth, what is fiction, and what makes up science fiction. Primarily discussion based seminar.",
    "Fantastic- the small seminar with such a great professor is a great opportunity, especially for those freshman who are majoring in the sciences and don't typically have the opportunity to take a seminar style class in the humanities",
    "This course is the ideal seminar: close-knit group, discussion-based learning, and interesting material. I would absolutely recommend the class. I learned how to read more closely, think more deeply, and write more clearly. I always looked forward to coming to class.",
    "CLCV 056 (Myth, Fiction, and Science Fiction) is a good introduction to ancient Greek and Roman texts and how to think about some of the bigger questions that they bring up. We investigated questions of beliefs - of what texts indicated about a civilization's beliefs at the time, how much readers are supposed to believe, and why writers choose to do this or that technique to convince readers that their stories are true. Pauline LeVen is very good at leading discussions. LeVen clearly knows a lot about what she is teaching but is also interested in hearing what her students think. She has set up papers in a manner that helps teach students certain foundations of writing analytical papers, and her feedback is very helpful. In short, the material of the class itself is intriguing, and you will also learn how to think about and investigate a text like this for the future. Highly recommend this class, or any other by LeVen."
