    "I took this class and am not a music major, great if you want to learn about the fundamentals of classical theory, and even enlightening for someone who is not a classical musician (I play in live bands).",
    "It's a good and necessary class for a musician to take. I had to take it to take lessons for credit, and you will too if you are planning on taking lessons. You will learn a lot, but be willing to spend a bunch of time on the assignments.",
    "It was great! If you want to learn the basics of compositiion, take this class... the quality of the class definitely depends on the grad student who is teaching it."
