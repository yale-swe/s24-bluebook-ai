   "comments": [
    "A good introduction to research on early modern books; a very sharp argument that one ought to read books, rather than texts.",
    "Materializing the Word was a superb course. I had been interested in book history previously, but it deepened my understanding of the breadth of the field. The majority of the readings were engaging and helpful (a personal high point was the readings on the book in the digital age and a low was some of the more philosophical essays early in the course. I very much appreciated the Beinecke classes, though I wish we could have had more time to examine the books on our own rather than largely at the end of class. I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would recommend this course to all who interested in scholarship of literature of all kinds. While the class technically defines itself as focused in the early-modern period and in England, the discussions and readings are relevant to all fields, as are the skills acquired through visits to the Beinecke and small projects Professor Kastan assigns. As was evident by the diversity of the students enrolled in the class, the topics are relevant to medievalists and modernists alike, to students from the department of Chinese or History.",
    "History of materials instead of history of ideas. Highly recommended."

   "comments": [
    "Materializing the Word made me realize that book and printing history could be a major area of interest for me in the future.",
    "The topics discussed and the skills acquired in this course will without doubt stay with me throughout my graduate career and beyond. The field of book history was entirely new to me before this course and afterwards I feel that it may indeed turn out to be one of my primary interests, at the very least one that will influence the course of my future research and ultimately my dissertation in a way I would not have foreseen. For that I am tremendously grateful, inspired and excited for the future!"
