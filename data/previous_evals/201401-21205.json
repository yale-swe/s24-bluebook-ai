   "comments": [
    "Definitely! It is a low work class with a great introduction to poetry. Though I would warn them, there isn't a whole lot of direction.",
    "ENGL 246 is an introductory poetry workshop. With Professor Zarin, we had no syllabus and no agenda and our discussions were largely based on poems that members of the class were asked to bring in each week. The workload consists of one poem per week, with no regular feedback from the professor. I would not recommend ENGL 246 because I think that other poetry classes at Yale probably have more structure and more constructive criticism. The class might be useful for those who already have a vested interest in poetry, but I don't think that it makes writing poetry any more approachable to new students.",
    "Amazing. I highly recommend this class. The way it worked is that each week students brought in one poem by a poet they admired to share with the group, and one poem they'd written themselves according to Zarin's assignment. The first half of class was spent discussing the \"anthology\" poems and the other half to a fairly standard, but high quality, workshop. Take it if you want to improve your poetry.",
    "Engl 246 is a good way for anyone who is interested in poetry to dive into the medium of writing. It's up to you how much you get out of it, but if you're invested, I would definitely recommend taking it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, because it tries its best to give a fairly comprehensive view of verse and verse writing.",
    "Professor Zarin is wonderful (try to meet with her one on one as much as possible) and this is a very solid poetry course. You write and workshop poems in class, so it really matters how much effort you (and your section) put into your poems."
