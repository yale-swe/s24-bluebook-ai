    "There were several speakers who gave excellent talks. Sten Vermund, Sarah Fortune, and Kate Clouse were the standout speakers in my experience. They were very engaging, organized, and great at presenting. Some were not so great, however. It would be great to bring in speakers from other public health programs with stellar reputations, such as Columbia University.",
    "Seminars were interesting but I wish there was more of a focus on field epidemiology, there seemed to be a lot more microbiology focus. I was also disappointed by the lack of diversity of seminar speakers, especially the low number of women who presented",
    "I, in general, enjoyed the seminars. Some were a little too technical and failed to hold my interest, but feel that overall I learned a lot about current research in infectious disease epidemiology.",
    "Interesting seminars. Would have liked to have seen more women and people of color presenting. The women were almost always the best speakers we had. Also, at the end some times the professors took up a lot of question time so I wasn't able to get my question in.",
    "I think this is a class that is important to have. That being said, I wish there was a more diverse set of speakers. I know last years class complained about this also, but there was a lot of molecular based research. Also, getting speakers from a larger array of EMD career paths. The majority were in academics, and while I know a lot of research is based in the academic setting, it would have been nice to have a couple more non-academic speakers.",
    "The course was ok. I do wish that we got more variability in the speakers. I feel like the same four topics were covered over and over again throughout the semester.",
    "Would like a wider variety of perspectives--felt like the vast majority of the class was molecular epidemiology which is not necessarily what many of us are interested in. IT would also be interesting to have speakers who are not necessarily research-focused but instead practice-based.",
    "This course should be changed in the future. I understand that molecular scientific research is important in the EMD department. However, PhD level research is not the only aspect of EMD that Yale's EMD students are interested in. Other departments seem to use their seminars to explore their diverse fields or learn skills they need in their field. I feel as though this seminar has no diversity. Some EMD students may be more interested in non-laboratory based research, while others may be more interested in working in infectious disease areas of health departments in public health practice. The seminar should be diversified. Yes, the type of seminar we currently have should be included. But perhaps a talk from somebody working as an infectious disease epidemiologist in a health department, somebody working in infection control in a hospital, or somebody working in another area of public health practice would be beneficial to students. I feel as though these seminars could be used to introduce us to the scope of careers we could go into with our degree, and I feel as though these seminars are very narrow. I know I have many peers who do not want to continue on to research or a PhD in epi or infectious disease, and unfortunately I feel as though that is all these seminars expose us to. Additionally, not all EMD students have a strong science background. Even those who do may have trouble understanding the complexities of these talks. The EMD program offers minimal laboratory options to student; I feel as though we are listening to high level information that we are not exposed to in our coursework.",
    "The seminar was overall engaging and informative. I enjoyed some presentations over others and I thought the course was a good way to learn about current research and projects in the field of microbial disease epidemiology.",
    "Interesting range of speakers on a broad variety of pathogens. I think it would have been nice to have some more practice-based people come in and speak, I feel like we didn't get to hear much from people outside of academia.",
    "A lot of interesting topics. However, a lot of the lectures contained mainly basic sciences and it was difficult to follow",
    "Good way to learn about different research in infectious disease, sometimes it got a little complicated so difficult to understand.",
    "Great diversity of speakers and topics.",
    "This seminar series was very interesting, and provided a broad view into the research that epidemiologists do in the realm of microbial diseases. However, there was a lot of emphasis on vector-borne diseases, and it would have been nice to have had a bit more variety of research focuses.",
    "Overall I found this seminar to be unnecessary as a \"mandatory\" course. I acknowledge that some of the presenters were fascinating and helped me explore potential career\/research paths within Infectious Diseases. However, I also know many of the presenters worked in fields that simply did not interest me and I wish students had the option of only attending the seminars that captivated their interest. It's important to recognize that at this point in their studies, graduate students are adults and should not be \"forced\" to attend lectures that inhibit them from utilizing their time\/resources at Yale to their full potential."

    "I would absolutely recommend it. You get the chance to hear fascinating talks about different infectious diseases, as well as the opportunity to speak with the guests themselves. If you're lucky, the person speaking will share your research interests, so you can connect over that. The free lunches are always a plus.",
    "I would recommend it. Good overview of current research in infectious disease.",
    "An interesting way to hear about a lot of different research pertaining to EMD, while eating lunch (which usually is pretty good, but rotates between about 3 different types of food). Note on food: DiBella's is amazing. Pizza was pretty good. Pasta depended on the day. The other sandwiches were not so great.",
    "Listen to very technical and molecular talks that may be difficult to follow at times.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, especially if they wanted to learn about current topics and projects in the field. The course is a good way of getting in touch and meeting prominent and well known figures in microbial disease epidemiology.",
    "Good way to expose yourself to a variety of EMD topics. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "No! There are better ways to use a weekly seminar - perhaps helping students better grasp social equity since there is prevalent trend in the sciences of students being absent minded when it comes to cultural competency in their work."
