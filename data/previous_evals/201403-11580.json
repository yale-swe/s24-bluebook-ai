    "Interesting exposure to new material from the perspective of a practitioner",
    "Blew my mind. I had never heard about agroforestry, and the introduction that Eric provided opened up a whole new world for me.",
    "MIssed out on the field trip which I hear is the best part. The lectures were worthwhile and provided a good general overview of the field. Doing independent research on a topic of our own choice was nice too since it allowed us to approach the material from a perspective that we found interesting.",
    "This is a unique course and it is one of the most forward-thinking that I have taken at F&ES. Eric has a wealth of knowledge to share and is incredibly accessible.",
    "Professor is so knowlegeable in the subject that he makes the couse extremetly interesting.",

    "More field trips",
    "I wish it was a full semester long, which I know is already going to happen. Additional field trips would also be helpful and well-suited to the material. The most difficult part of this class was the timing for me- 6pm-9pm, which was tough after a full day of class.",
    "Lectures. More discussion or interactions would be helpful. A different format for some of the classes besides a continual lecture each time for three hours would be better.",
    "Perhaps more grounding in theory or current debates in the field of environmental studies. Having this class co-taught with a Yale professor could help provide that more academic perspective.",
    "I would have liked to have seen a little more depth in the treatment of the various mechanisms through which carbon is sequestered in soils and biomass of agroforestry systems. Maybe talking in further depth about quantification challenges faced by the sector. I think this deserves a full class, especially if it is a 3 credit course. Maybe making Nairs piece on methodological challenges required reading?",
    "Enjoyed the articles, but it could have been more valuable to have more targeted response questions. I often felt like I was just writing to meet the word requirement, versus for deeper understanding. Could provide a review summary or would also be interesting to read articles about other agroforestry projects."
