    "This course focuses on three vector-borne diseases: malaria, dengue fever, and lyme disease. The first half of the course is about the biology of the diseases in the human host and in the vector whereas the second half of the course is about prevention and treatment of the diseases",
    "We learned about the biology of malaria, Lyme, and other vector-borne diseases, as well as interventions.",
    "I learned about the immune system and the pervasiveness of different vector borne diseases.",
    "I learned about the principles of vector borne diseases as well as basic epidemiology. I learned about the biology of multiple pathogens themselves, the entire process of transmission, immunology, and human interventions for these events.",
    "I learned more about malaria than I ever hoped to know. More than I thought there was to know.",
    "I learned about the basics of vector borne diseases, as well as specifics on malaria\/Lyme disease. I also learned a lot about the immune system and feel much more comfortable w\/ basic biology.",
    "I developed knowledge of malaria and other vector-borne diseases and specific knowledge about their impacts and their biology.",
    "I learned so much about the immune system, vector borne diseases and host behavior. I learned how to write a scientific research paper and do academic readings on malaria\/lyme disease\/dengue, etc.",
    "Better research skills as well as how to write a research paper."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course is really well organized and Professor Belperron does a very good job at teaching the material. I learned an incredible amount on vector-borne diseases and biology in general. My only complaint of the course would be the reading questions; I didn't really understand the point of them if they weren't going to be answered because I don't think it's necessarily a good indicator that you've done the readings.",
    "This is a very well-crafted course. The assignments are challenging but not too difficult for non-science majors and Professor Belperron always pushes her students to engage with the material meaningfully. All of the work felt worthwhile and I learned more than I ever thought I would about an interesting topic!",
    "Although it was a small class, it felt like a lecture due to Professor Belperron's teaching style. I enjoyed this and felt like I could engage more than I would in a lecture. If I did not understand something we learned in class I could easily ask a question during the lecture. The readings assigned were not needed to understand the material in class, which I appreciated. I wish our grades were posted on Canvas, but that is not a big deal.",
    "Course has multiple assigned readings that are not entirely crucial to the class. Some practice tests may have also been useful as the quizzes involved questions requiring high level of thought.",
    "Its hard to say because Im not naturally drawn to this subject. I found the lectures a bit dry, but that may have just been because they were about malaria and other vector borne diseases. Which I really should have expected since its the title of the class. The questions she had us write about the readings were confusing- I never got a sense of what a good question was so every one was a shot in the dark. But other than that I learned a lot, I liked the professor, it was an overall positive experience.",
    "This course has a lot of readings, but the professor does a great job of explaining their content in class. She's very available for questions and follow-ups on things learned in class as well. There are 3 quizzes which are fairly difficult, as well as a midterm, but the final is a paper which was a nice change for a STEM class.",
    "The course was overall fantastic! It was a small setting and Professor Belperron has fantastic expertise in the subject area. The one weakness was we never made introductions, so even though it was a small seminar we didn't really get to know each other until halfway through the semester and even then, barely.",
    "I thought that Prof Belperron's lectures were incredibly informative and she explains things in a really clear way. Her use of simpler metaphors to describe certain phenomenon's was also really helpful and she really ties everything into the broader significance of the disease's presence in the world. The pacing of the course was really fast and the quantity of information was overwhelming at times, especially when you're expected to know everything and be able to apply that knowledge to the real world.",
    "Strengths - covering a large amount of material in a short amount of time Weaknesses - doesnt leave much room for helping students who are struggling with the material, and office hours are not a regular occurrence",
    "strengths- Prof Belperron is incredibly good at explaining information in a way that everyone in the class is able to understand"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This class is one of my favorite classes I've taken so far at Yale. It's not easy, but the intellectual challenge makes the class more rewarding. Professor Belperron does a good job at explaining the material in an easy to understand way. The class is also very well organized; every lecture was important and fit in some way to the bigger picture of vector-borne diseases. If you're interested in health at any capacity, I think this class is worth taking.",
    "If you are a looking for a science credit and want a non-gutty seminar where you will actually learn something, take this class! It is not too difficult if you are willing to put in the work.",
    "Yes! Professor Belperron knows what she is talking about and is very approachable. The information is very interesting and the course is catered towards non-science majors. It was harder than I expected but I definitely learned a lot. Be prepared to put the work in, especially for the quizzes and final paper. There is no final exam which was nice but the paper is difficult. Try to start it before or during Thanksgiving break.",
    "Yes if they have a desire to learn a little about bio and public health.",
    "This is not a science gut. I know this is what they write on every lower level science course evaluation, but for this class its really true. The previous students warned me on course table and I didnt listen. I would recommend it if you are passionately interested in malaria.",
    "I would recommend if you're looking for an interesting biology class, or science credit for humanities. Professor Belperron specifically says this class is for non-STEM majors, and she makes the class a comfortable learning environment for all levels.",
    "If you're looking for a gut science class, this is not one. I learned a ton and was really glad that I took it, but it was my hardest class. The quizzes and exams are really difficult because you have to be able to apply the intricacies of each disease, host and vector and know what that means for transmission, severity of disease, etc. That being said, there isn't a ton of work that you have to do each week, though the quizzes are brutal.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is genuinely invested in the topic. Just a surface interest might not be enough to get you through the semester. The course is interesting, but complex and it takes a lot of effort to understand and keep up with it. Be prepared.",
    "yes- this is a great class for any students interested in epidemiology"
