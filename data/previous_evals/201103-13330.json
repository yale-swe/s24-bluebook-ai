   "comments": [
    "It's an overall decent course if you want to refine your skills in English in a relaxed setting. Good way to get into the swing of writing papers.",
    "Tough but fun, I would highly recommend this class. But, bear in mind, it is a lot of work.",
    "Definitely would. This is a great class for any incoming freshman concerned about their writing skills or simply want to polish them up. And Professor Fawcett is great!!",
    "I think it definitely depends on who is teaching, and what the subject is. Because the subject material of this class wasn't very stimulating, I think it completely relied on the teacher to be interesting. As for other classes, I think the material was much more interesting.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student, and anyone who wants to improve their writing skills. It is an intensive writing seminar which requires a lot of work, but it pays off very well. I would especially recommend it to non-native English speakers. My English improved a lot through this course."
