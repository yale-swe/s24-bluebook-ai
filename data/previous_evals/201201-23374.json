    "I have a background in human and physical geography so the content of the lectures in this course made me feel I was repeating things I had learnt before, though in less detail and at a much more simplistic level. I think this course would perhaps be useful for someone with no previous knowledge of physical geography, but I didn't find it very useful.",
    "This class was completely a waste of time and I am very unhappy that it was required. More stringent requirements should be made for classes to be presented as an integrative framework. This class should never be offered again.",
    "Question 1: The sole text for this class was in DRAFT form, and I emphasize, draft form. I've never been assigned to read something so unfinished and poorly written. I'm not sure who the intended audience is for this book when it's published, but it is not appropriate for a graduate level course. The readings were also confusing because there have to be an overabundance of research on the global trade in resources. At least this draft could have been supplemented with journal articles, etc.Most disturbing was my discovery that much of one chapter's content was completely factually inaccurate. I shared it with my friend who is a PhD candidate at Yale in biological anthropology because I questioned some of the assertions. She provided me with four paragraphs on what was wrong. Some of the claims she had never even heard of before related to human evolution and migration. I trust her knowledge of the subject and current research. If this chapter was so riddled with falsities, how do I know that any of what I read was actually true this term? His slides also featured material that said it needed to be factchecked. Why were we being taught material that the instructor was unsure of himself?Question 2: The lectures were well-meaning but meandering.Question 3: The assignments were not designed in such a way as to provide any kind of learning value. Manipulating Excel spreadsheets to answer basic questions, which are not really tied into the rest of the class doesn't offer much. Busy work like this is not appropriate for graduate students. Further, the grading seemed haphazard with no input on where points were lost or examples of a correct answer.The other assignment was basically to summarize and edit the draft chapters of CHad's book. Definitely a conflict of interest and with only three paragraphs to both summarize and critique, it was pretty superficial. Even when he was not pleased with our efforts, he could not provide an example of what he wanted.",

    "The TA, Sameer Kwatra, was the worst I've experienced -- graduate and undergraduate included. Very disappointing. He was a poor communicator and I don't think cared about his job.Sameer was extremely untimely in returning problem sets. And when he did return the weekly problem sets (usually a month or so after they were due), his comments\/ grading was totally irrelevant. I don't think he read our responses or understood our rationale. Not surprisingly, I think this was due to the fact that English was a second language for Sameer. When the problem sets require qualitative responses, it helps when the one grading them has a solid understanding of the language.",
    "It exposed the students to almost all the working fields of the environment",
    "Unique knowledge of professor.",
    "The final negotiation exercise was fun and informative, and using the resource matrices was helpful for painting a picture of resource allocation imbalances in the world.",
    "The best thing about this course is that it tries to cover global resources in general. It is helpful for person who is not very familiar with field other than their to learn in brief about other fields."

   "comments": [
    "For me, the course was way too basic and simplistic. It covered a lot of topics but in too little detail, so I felt I didn't really learn anything - I just learnt there are a lot of topics that relate to global resources. A tighter focus would be good. I also think the weekly exercises need some work - I don't feel I learnt a great deal from them, I just got frustrated using Excel! I think some important complexities were missed out of the discussion. I know it's supposed to provide a general overview, but I think more effort could be made to highlight the interconnections and complexities involved in the issues discussed. It felt like we were just being exposed to lists of factors and information without much critical analysis.",
    "The assignments didn't really add much to the material taught in class. I believe that the quality of the assignments need to be improved.",
    "The data for all homework were not update therefore conclusion reached maybe are the the current situation.",
    "Everything about this class needed improvement. The lectures were not coherent. With regard to the readings we were asked to edit the profesor's book which seemed to be thrown together and did not provide valuable content. I actually question the validity of much of the content of the book. The assignments were unhelpful and a waste of time.",
    "The readings were from a draft textbook that was VERY incomplete; entire sections missing, question marks, etc. It made it very difficult to believe the validity of any of the readings and mostly they felt like a waste of time. In addition, the level of the reading material was, I would wager, around a high school course.The course is ambitious in trying to cover a huge range of topics. Yes, that is difficult. But there are better ways it could have been done. More effort should have been made to understand the class's knowledge, so as not to waste time on BASIC concepts and dig in more to advanced topics.The usefulness of the homework assignments was lost in the confusing directions and spreadsheets. We spent more time trying to decipher the instructions rather than even learning or completing the assignments.",
    "It needs outside readings to introduce students to debates and build literacy. The problem sets currently do not further students' learning.",
    "The assignments could have been more organized and more integrated into the weekly topic schedules.",
    "Clearer instructions on homework. This came up to be a big issue, and I spent too much time trying to understand what I was suppose to do.",
    "While I enjoy Chad personally, this is the worst class I have ever taken. It was in no way appropriate for a graduate-level, professional degree program.",
    "Pretty much everything. Chad is a very nice guy, but he is not a good professor. Chad should seriously be reevaluated, I know he's on tenure, but I feel like he does not fit the role of a professor well and time is wasted on students. I learned next to nothing and the course was completely irrrelevant and useless to my academic enrichment. I only stuck with it because it's a requirement for my degree.",
    "I thought the pace was really slow. There needs to be more facilitated discussion and less lecturing.",
    "The Teaching Assistant was very poor. Let's get someone who can speak English!The syllabus was entirely confusing. The problem sets were numbered erratically... they did not correspond with the ones posted on Classes V2.The spreadsheets were poorly designed. The problem sets were didn't require much thought beyond data mining.",
    "it is perfect.",
    "The draft of the text book is not very clear, and has typos and some mistakes. This should be improved.",
    "The readings for each topic were sort of stream-of-consciousness feeling, and felt like we skimmed extremely huge issues with little depth. While I appreciated what the goal was (to also offer critique of each chapter of the draft), it didn't really help me much.",
