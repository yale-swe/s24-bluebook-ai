   "comments": [
    "How to use Owl Purdue to work out how to do MLA. How to read fast. How to keep quiet so that everyone could have a chance to talk.",
    "Amazing syllabus and introduction to post colonial literature",
    "I developed better close-reading skills; an appreciation for postcolonial world literature; knowledge of the debate around the definition of world lit and English's place in it; and experience with archival research and academic writing.",
    "Prof. Richards' exercises on close readings were really helpful -- both, I think, for first years and for upper-level students. She also taught me that there are so many different ways to write a paper, and I really appreciated how willing she was to let us figure out our own writing style rather than conform to hers.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze language more closely. I then was able to learn how to form an argument based on close reading insights.",
    "I learned about several writers working in English throughout the reach of British colonialism.",
    "I learned how to do archival work, and compare archival texts\/videos to the literature we read. I also learned how to evaluate what makes a text a World English Literature text.",
    "I learned how to really close read, looking at how language works to reflect the content. I also learned how to combine archival research with analysis of the literature.",
    "My writing skills developed immensely with this course - I learned to consider new themes, ideas, and motifs in literature that I'd never thought of before. I think both the professor and the fellow students contributed to this; I learned as much from the comments and insights of my peers as I did from the class material itself. My close-reading and analysis skills were improved, as I learned how to write at the college level. Overall, I learned that while the traditional essay structure I'd learned and used in high school was still valid, there are many more, unique ways to write a literary analysis paper.",
    "Great learning of Literature analysis skills",
    "-Better understanding of the impacts of colonialism on societies around the world",
    "I read incredible texts from all over the anglophone world, and developed a deeper understand of how the English language and anglophone literature function as tools of colonialism and suppression, as well as self expression, communication, and conversation. I had the opportunity to practice analytical writing that brought works of literature into conversation with primary sources from the archives.",
    "This course allowed me to improve my close reading skills and allowed me to read a wide range of post-colonial texts.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester! With each text we read, I asked myself the same question: what is world literature, how does this text fit, is it meant to fit, and what does it mean that I am reading it? I loved the close reading focus within such a theoretical class. Professor Richards had many rich passages to discuss, and we touched on themes that many people in the class were interested in -- figurative language, performativity, spectacle, representations of gender, etc. There was something in the class for everyone!",
    "I learned how to do better close readings and also incorporate form and content into my writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It needs to be smaller. We barely got a chance to discuss anything in any particular depth. There really should be more intro English classes available.",
    "Strengths-again, syllabus Weaknesses- more historical context given by academic articles, secondary sources?",
    "The course was a great introduction to postcolonial world english literatures! Professor Richards ran the seminar well and I loved many of the texts. The course moved quite fast though, and I felt like we could have benefited from spending more time on individual texts rather than cramming so many works into one course.",
    "Professor Richards created a comfortable and welcoming seminar environment that was inclusive to students of all levels and class years. She is just a very kind person and a caring teacher. I loved most of the books and I'm glad that this class is one of the required courses for English. In terms of weaknesses, I didn't mind the group work, but I wish we'd had more discussions together as a class. I also didn't love Robinson Crusoe.",
    "Strengths: syllabus, assignments, Professor Richards",
    "The strengths of this course are the individual texts we read. The weakness, however, is the lack of understanding of why we are reading all these texts and how they tie together.",
    "Professor Richards is great and facilitates discussion well. I wish there were fewer texts so that we could focus more on them.",
    "The strength of the course is that it encourages conversation which in turn helps our understanding of the text since different perspectives are so important to world literature. The weakness of this course is maybe it could be a little more broad in terms of books selected, but it still had a wide assortment of books from different regions.",
    "Great reading list - the attention to postcolonial authors was a much appreciated change from the usual focus on the western canon in the English department. I also really enjoyed delving into the historical context of the literature - though sometimes, I felt that seminar meetings were a bit dominated by lectures on the history.",
    "Perhaps this is a personal issue due to the amount of other coursework I had, but I felt that sometimes the class moved too quickly through books and read entire novels in very short periods of time. We more or less read one book each week, and only spent two class periods on each work we studied. This led to two weaknesses: reading would take an extremely long time each night, and many significant passages\/plot points would be left undiscussed simply due to a lack of time. However, this fast pace did allow us to cover a remarkable amount of ground over the course of the semester; we read a very wide range of genres and authors that may not have been possible had we read at a slower pace. I would recommend a middle ground of sorts: fewer books such that more time is spent on each, but not drastically fewer.",
    "Strengths: great choices in novels for us to read, good amount of context presented for each book Weaknesses: the format of the classes (almost always discussions) got very monotonous and it seemed like most people were not engaged",
    "Everyone from this seminar that I spoke to outside of class found it incredibly frustrating. The greatest strength of this course was its incredible syllabus. Im so glad that I had the opportunity to read all of the books that we read this year. They were thought provoking, difficult, upsetting, and beautiful. However, the discussions we had during the seminars were incredibly disappointing. Im not entirely sure how it came to be, but our conversations never covered the richest, most powerful, and most difficult parts of the book. We spent a lot of time dealing with themes like genocide, torture, sexual violence, and colonialismyet, we never seriously took the time in class to engage with them. It always felt like we were dancing around the issues at hand. It did not seem that anyone, including professor Richards, was seriously listening while anyone else was talking. And, as a result of that, I think many of the students with the most serious, well thought out, deeply felt opinions on these difficult subjects decided it was easier just to keep those thoughts to themselves.",
    "Weaknesses: class discussions sometimes unstructured, would appreciate more guidance for preparation for discussions. Would be interested in reading more Asian literature",
    "A wide range of in-class activities were helpful in stimulating discussion. However, I felt that the papers were too concerned with close reading and did not encourage us to engage with the wider context of the texts.",
    "Again, I loved the close reading focus, and how we were able to analyze each author's narrative techniques. I will never forget the class where we compared Google Earth to the ways an author can create a sense of place, or the class where we watched a video of a Kathakali performance and then dissected a passage in the God of Small Things to see what was gained and lost in the language. This was an excellently taught intro literature course, because we learned, step by step, how to close-read, form a strong thesis, and incorporate archival research into a literary argument. In terms of improving the course, I would transition from small group work to larger discussion a little earlier. I felt that as the semester went on, we could have spent more time developing interpretations of the text in addition to discussing our reactions.",
    "I think the reading selections are varied and good but I think we can spend a little more time on some books."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think it is a good class. It's interesting; we read good books; there's a lot to think about. But really it's too big, and there was no time to discuss anything deeply.",
    "Yes. Definitely.",
    "Yes, I would! I'm not sure I'd super recommend it as an intro to the english department, but it was good for students like myself who have an interest in the subject.",
    "I would, especially as one of the required English courses. I got a lot out of this class and I'm glad I read many of the books on the syllabus! If you are thinking of taking this class, make sure you are ok with lots of activities and group work, since that learning style isn't for everyone.",
    "I would not recommend this class to upperclassmen, who may be frustrated by the sometimes elementary discussions dominated by underclassmen.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who would like to learn to read more closely and form thoughtful arguments. A student who likes the seminar environment would also benefit from this course and its discussions of the texts.",
    "Absolutely! I read texts that I would've never been exposed to in my life if I had just continued reading popular books. I learned a lot about the different",
    "Yes! The reading load looks daunting but is actually quite manageable, and most of the works are really engaging and thought-provoking. I feel like my close reading and writing skills really improved from taking this class. Professor Richards stressed close analysis of the text, and conversation in the seminar meetings was not only concerned about themes, but style - which I appreciated.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, and already have: I chose to take this course because I was extremely interested by the professor's perspective on gender\/sexuality in literature, which is an area of interest for me. However, I know other students in the class who also found ways to pursue their own personal interests through the works we read. I strongly feel that the reading selections and essay prompts allow great flexibility for students to tackle any literary question or issue they want, while also exploring entirely new points of view. I loved this class and found it extremely beneficial, even though I am not an English\/Literature major.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would tell them that the material was interesting but the class period itself was not always that engaging, mostly because (in my case) the other classmates did not seem that excited to discuss the books.",
    "Given the experiences I had, I cant recommend the course. Maybe with another professor and another group of students the class could be great, but my experience was incredibly disappointing.",
    "Absolutely! Take this course if you are interested in contemporary literature outside the Western canon, engaging class discussions, really interesting assignments, and clear feedback that will improve your writing.",
    "Yes, I think the exposure to the literature we read is worth it."
