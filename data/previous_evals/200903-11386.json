    "A great way to be exposed all of the incredible cog sci research going on at Yale.",
    "Forums in which faculty from various areas of cognitive science present work to students, who should be reading and discussing the presented work as they turn over ideas for their own senior projects.",
    "This class is required as a cog sci major, so no real choice as to whether to take it. I liked seeing this broad range of fields covered in the class, though it's hard to get really into any single class because you get such a brief introduction to the topic (you usually find the kids who work under the guest lecturer participating the most each day). Professor Knobe is a great professor, if you need advice about your senior project, definitely go to his office hours!",
    "Great course. You have to take it, so yes. But it's fun.",
    "Required colloquium for all seniors: in the first semester, faculty present their research and what they've been working on.",
    "The senior colloquium is pretty fun. First semester it's hardly any work, we just get to hear from a lot of different professors from different fields of cognitive science, so it's really laid-back.",
    "It's the best part of being a cog sci major."
