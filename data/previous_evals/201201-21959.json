    "Takes you through about 10 shakespeare plays, some more entertaining than others",
    "What you see is what you get: you read most of Shakespeare's comedies and romances and talk about them. Lectures are good not great, although much better than I had expected. Highlights are A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, Twelfth Night.",
    "I would recommend it... I was not a fan of the exam format (it rewards memorization instead of thought)... But other than that, it's a good overview.",
    "This class is not as good as Histories and Tragedies, but it is definitely worth taking, if only because of the chance to read Shakespeare in an academic context. Prof. Manley is a bit too methodical in his analysis, but he provides interesting perspectives on historical context and art. I recommend this class to everyone.",
    "a good way of getting to know many of Shakespeare's comedies and romances",
    "ALOT of reading. If you're a Lit major then yes I'd recommend this class, if you're not, be prepared to read alot.",
    "Excellent course! Take it! The professor is great, the material is fabulous (duh), and the lectures are fascinating. You get a real insight in Shakespeare taking this course, and you can write about anything you want on the papers. Take it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Manley is actually very funny in a subtle way, and it's a great way to get a general introduction to Shakespeare.",
    "Yes! Manley's great, and you'll learn a lot. The workload really isn't that bad: two short-ish papers, an easy midterm, and your final.",
    "This is a great survey course of some great plays! You only read a play a week so the workload is very manageable and the lectures are interesting, Prof Manley is an interesting lecture and gives you great perspectives on some classic literary works.",
    "Excellent survey of the comedies and romances; informative and engaging lectures, fair workload (2 short papers, midterm, final), enjoyable reading list. Professor Manley is extremely knowledgeable and provides a skillful synthesis of contemporary sources\/analogues and generic conventions in discussing the plays. If you like Shakespeare or just think you should read Shakespeare, take this class.",
    "A class where you read a Shakespeare play once a week. I would recommend it if you want to read so much Shakespeare.",
    "ENGL 200 gives you a nice overview of Shakespeare's romances and comedies. You can do as much or as little work as you'd like - you read a play a week but I was able to get away without reading all the plays all the time. I did find that reading a play a week was a lot of work for me, and I felt the class moved a little quickly. Beyond reading, it's a pretty manageable work -- 2\/3 five page papers (depending if you're doing it as WR or not). I found section rewarding as it was a chance to delve into the text more.",
    "take it if you love Shakespeare, or even if you don't. It's great. Great Pre-1800 credit.",
    "Very good, take it.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're interested in Shakespeare OR if you haven't ever read any of the comedies\/romances\/problem plays. I am a huge Shakespeare nut, but I had only ever read the tragedies and histories--I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the comedies and even the romances (like a play as bizarre as The Winter's Tale). Professor Manley isn't the most engaging of teachers, but he is a super nice guy, and the teaching fellows were all fabulous this year. I'd definitely recommend, especially if you're an English major.",
    "A fun and relaxing course for those who want to explore Shakespeare's comedies!",
    "Take this! You learn a lot, and it's a great complement to Kastan's fall semester course.",
    "This class is often underrated in favor of Kastan's (far worse) class. Shakespeare's comedies are rarely as appreciated as his tragedies, and Manley is a drier lecturer than is Kastan, but makes up for this by packing far more information and interpretive rigor into his lectures than does Kastan. If you're a Shakespeare fan, this lecture is a must. If you want to come to lecture primarily to be regaled, then stick to Kastan.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in Shakespeare most definitely, otherwise take it Credit\/D\/Fail",
    "I would definitely recommend English 200 to another student. It is fun, enjoyable, and you will learn a LOT about life, comedy, Shakespeare, but mostly life! Take it!",
    "This class is great! A play a week, and by the end, you've got a handle on most of them. Professor Manley is a joy to listen to. His lectures can be hard to take notes on, as they seem sort of rambly, but luckily he posts the slides on classesv2. You get sort of sick of reading Shakespeare by the end of the semester, even if you love him. TAs were all excellent, from what I could tell.",
    "If you want to read the comedies and romances, take this class. The lecture isn't always thrilling, but Manley's analysis is really solid and profound if you really make an effort to follow his train of thought throughout class.",
    "Yes, I have a new appreciation for Shakespeare and it got me to think critically about themes of the plays.",
    "I'm very glad to have taken this class. It requires no particular prior knowledge of Shakespeare but leaves you, by the end, with a good working knowledge of the Comedies and Romances --- not sufficient for high-level analysis, but very respectable. A pace of a play a week means that you are never overwhelmed but that you cover enough territory that you are also never bored. Lectures were enjoyable, and section provided a good venue for discussion.",
    "Take it. It's great and you'll learn a lot. Manley is a great lecturer and there isn't too much work.",
    "This is a good course. The reading load (1 play a week) and writing load (2 papers for the non-writing credit) were manageable. I've heard better literature lectures at Yale, but Professor Manley will give you a good introduction to all of the plays.",
    "I would recommend it but it is a lot of shakespeare which I enjoyed but I was definitely ready to take a break from shakespeare by the time the semester was over.",
    "Its a good class, productive and interesting. I came in having never taken english before and left with a better understanding of how to write an english essay as well as a strong familarity with the works we read.",
    "There's Shakespeare, and it's all right.",
    "Very easy, you can get away with only reading 50% of the plays and still do really well on midterm and final. take it if you need a pre-1800, wouldn't take it just for interest though."
