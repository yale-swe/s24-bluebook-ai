   "comments": [
    "This class is great! Prof. Shore is a true discussion moderator (and not a lecturer) in seminar format, the class material is very interesting and has good interrelationships across the syllabus, and the workload was never unmanageable (and fun a lot of the time). She varies up specifically what she teaches about with every seminar, but the Marci Shore seminar experience is not to be missed.",
    "It's an overview of post-existentialist philosophy from Husserl to Heidegger to Sartre to Kosik\/Kolakowsi to Ingarden to Havel to Derrida. All the reading is stuff you should read before you graduate from Yale. Take it!",
    "I highly recommend this course. Each week arrives with a new set of readings (manageable) from primary sources. Students respond with a short, weekly journal entry with their immediate responses to the readings (nothing intellectual). Students also teach two classes, where they start the discussion of the week's readings. One final essay (15 page) is due.",
    "I enjoyed the course: I thought the syllabus was well constructed; I found the assignments to be meaningful and worthwhile; and I found Prof. Shore to be helpful in enabling our understanding of the material. But I wish she had participated in class discussion more -- about half of each class consisted of student presentations, which ended up being summaries of the readings that were hard to follow. I wish she had required those to be shorter, to constrain students, who tended to ramble on and on.If you want to take this class, make sure you're truly interested in the readings. Some of the writers were difficult and not that interesting, and that made those weeks very difficult to get through. On the other hand, some weeks -- like Arendt and Patocka -- featured lively class discussion, and I can remember the class ending with everyone wanting to stay put for hours more.",
    "Pretty good class. Don't take it if you're looking for a history type thing, and don't take it if you prefer lectures to seminars.",
    "Fantastic course. Professor Shore is really good at picking the right readings! It definitely made me do tons of serious thinking on the most important philosophical questions. But this class is intellectual history, which says it evaluates each philosopher without judging whether their views and methods are right or wrong. This can get somewhat frustrating at times. Overall, I high recommend this class.",
    "Don't take this class without any relevant background; the philosophy can be very thick and hard to pull through, and we basically never read the full texts. That said, Professor Shore is awesome and very helpful, and if you have a hint of an nterest in philosophy and its history, take it. But be warned: discussions of philosophical content figure way more than discussions of historical context.",
    "If you are interested at all in 19th or 20th century philosophy you should take this class. Where else is there the opportunity to read Eastern European philosophers?",
    "Recommended. It's a tough class not because of the workload but because the readings can be very difficult to understanding. Prof Shore does a good job of explaining the concepts, though. I think she overestimates the knowledge of students going into the class",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about existentialism and marxism, as framed in an intellectual historical approach. This means that you get a sense for the context in which the authors wrote, and the trajectory and patterns among ideas.It would help if you have some background in continental philosophy, though notnecessarily with these authors, as the readings can be confusing at times and class discussions can be overwhelming if you are not used to esoteric writing (disclaimer: I did not like how these authors wrote; I had taken a course on Nietzsche and one on Kierkegaard).This class only reads primary texts - you do not read secondary texts commenting on the philosophers. Much of class discussion was lent to discussing the evolution of ideas, and not a lot of time was spent dissecting arguments.You will come away with understanding what philosophers said and the connections between ideas over time. However, you will not have a good grasp for who made a good argument, or a bad one, etc. as the class discussions are content and historical in nature, not philosophical (plus, the authors use a lot of different terms, such that it sometimes does not seem that they are arguing against one another). That said, this is one of the few classes at Yale where you can learn about existentialists.The work was not hard - the weekly reading assignment did not take too long to write, the paper was short, the class presentations were fun. Professor Shore also gives a lot of feedback so you know what to expect."
