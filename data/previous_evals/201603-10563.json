    "My Chinese significantly improved from this course. I came into it as someone who could only speak and understand Chinese, not read or write. By the end of the semester, I had learned several hundred characters, as well as new phrases and expressions of speech I had not previously known. Even my speaking\/listening improved tremendously; coming to class and practicing the language every day certainly did wonders. Rote practice for writing characters came in the form of daily quizzes, and in-class discussions provided an opportunity to practice speaking.",
    "I learned so many Chinese characters as well as new grammar structures. The class also helped me gain insight into Chinese attitudes, culture, and perspectives. I also was able to connect my Chinese learning to my own life, and talk to other students in chinese.",
    "I learned many new characters, vocabulary, grammar structures, etc. and became more comfortable thinking and speaking more fluently in Chinese.",
    "I have definitely improved my Chinese writing and have expanded the number of characters that I can recognize.",
    "Improved writing ability, vocabulary, and pronunciation of Chinese",
    "I improved my chinese conversation and understanding of the language as a whole.",
    "I have learned a lot in CHNS 132, especially through our class discussions and essay presentations.",
    "This course really helped me develop my reading and writing skills in Chinese. I learned so many new characters and I can read so much better now. I also gained a lot of insight into the Chinese culture through the discussions."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course and thought it was very well structured in teaching a fairly difficult language. I thought it was good that all of the heritage speakers were put in one class, even though we were at different levels. I think by learning alongside people better and worse than me, I was able to gain a better insight into how to learn and become better myself. I think that the daily quizzes are a lot, but are good in keeping us students constantly learning and practicing our Chinese. I also think that Professor Liu and Chan were great in teaching the material at a fast-paced but fair pace.",
    "One jarring thing about the course was that despite it being meant for heritage speakers who are learning to read and write, almost everyone in the course already knew how to read and write at some semi-advanced level. This means that students who have no previous reading\/writing experience and have not been previously exposed to Pinyin will struggle at first, as they are somewhat behind the other students. This, however, is to be expected, as heritage speakers tend to be at various skill levels, and it is difficult to create a class that suits all heritage speakers.",
    "The strengths of this course include the intense language practice, small class sizes, and professor attention. The weaknesses include the fast pace, however, it was still really helpful in learning Chinese fast.",
    "Class size could have been slightly smaller to give everyone more opportunities to speak. Teachers are amazing, very flexible and energetic. Courses v2 was somewhat confusing to use and had some bugs, please consider moving to canvas.",
    "Strengths: This course was neither overloaded nor trivial; it was a good balance of work, reading, and assessments. Weaknesses: The instructors provided no way of keeping track of our grades in this class. We had assessments every day, but it was difficult to keep track of our overall performance, especially as the course progressed.",
    "The strength of the course is the speed. Lessons are learned quickly and vocabulary are taught at a fast pace. The weaknesses of this course is that lessons get very repetitive and repetition does not really help student improve grammar or speaking skills. In addition, the course did not really contextualize the development of history behind each character so rote memorization of that many characters was very difficult.",
    "Some strengths in this class was that we learned a lot of new characters, both in reading and writing them. One area of improvement that I would have liked to further was my speaking skill."

    "Yes. I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Although there is a lot of work, the class is very enjoyable and engaging and the work really benefits you. Professor and Liu and Chan are great and really make the course as good as it is.",
    "I would recommend this class to any other Chinese heritage student who is looking to improve his\/her grasp on the language.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot, and truly enjoyed it, so I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes! If you place into this level and want to take Chinese, definitely take it!",
    "Profs. Liu and Chan are very good at teaching the grammar structures and the subtle nuances of the Chinese language. The courseload is neither too heavy nor trivial; just the right amount to facilitate improvement of one's grasp on the Chinese language.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It truly does help the learner learn a great deal of vocabulary and thoroughly helps improve writing skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because while it has been challenging, I have greatly improved in Chinese.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because although it is a very challenging class that requires a lot of work, you do learn a lot in the class."
