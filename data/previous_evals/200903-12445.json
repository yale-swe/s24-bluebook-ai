   "comments": [
    "Yes! It was a fascinating class discussing in depth the trade circles that linked the historical global, focusing on the Asian continent and its connections to Europe and Africa.",
    "It's more like a lecture where Prof Siu talks and we listen, but the students don't talk much. nonetheless, Siu has interesting things to say. There is a lot of reading, but most undergrads don't do them. That said, the class is 60% grad students and 40% or less undergrad. Brings up fascinating topics but I'd like to see the class a bit more structured and less stream-of-consciousness style.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student. This is a great seminar taught by a great professor. It meets only once a week and you get to hear Professor Siu lecture on her area of expertise. Although there are a ton of assigned readings, you don't have to know every single detail, and Professor Siu guides you through the important topics and concepts.",
    "Yes, I would. Fun topics, not too difficult and great professor"
