   "comments": [
    "Attend the first section of the seminar and take a look at the readings and see if the class is for you. Some people may find the material interesting, but some may find it very logic-heavy.",
    "This class conducts a very interesting survey of social choice theory, theories of voting, of democracy, and theories of legitimate coercive force. There are 8 2-3 page papers and a final paper. I highly recommend this course for students interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would not under any circumstances recommend this course. Professor Donahue is a nice man, but he really doesn't understand the material, and as a result, the class is just not good. The readings are dense and not well explained in class, there is little meaningful feedback on your writing, and seminar discussions are disorganized and painful. If it's a new professor and you're interested in the material, I'd give it a shot. Otherwise, don't.",
    "Professor Donahue is really nice, but this seminar was not very well led. During class discussions, we often wound up rehashing relatively minor topics instead of moving on to the important parts of the week's reading. While the material was at times very interesting, it was also sometimes quite dense, and Professor Donahue did not do much to help guide us through the more complicated parts of the subject.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material was very interesting - you basically get to learn about all the problems that surround voting, from the most mechanical issues such as when different methods of voting would yield the same result to more philosophical issues such as what exactly the outcome of voting means and whether society must follow it. You are required to write 8 reading responses during the semester - they definitely require some time because they must consist in strong philosophical arguments, but they were very interesting to write. Professor Donahue is very knowledgeable about the texts and he shares with the class interesting takes on the readings. He will definitely sharpen your critical thinking skills."
