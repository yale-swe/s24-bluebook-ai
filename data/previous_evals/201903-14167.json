   "comments": [
    "This class gives you an incredible insight into the many different forms of corruption in different sectors, the way it is measured, prevention measures, and broad networks that connect different areas of corruption. This class will give you both broad insights and detailed looks into specific case studies, leaving you with a strong understanding of the issue of corruption today.",
    "This course is extremely practical. I feel like I am looking at the world through a newfound lense and find myself referring to the course content frequently in random conversations. I didnt realize how many issues that I study as a poli sci student were tied to corruption, and I didnt ever think of it as being a huge problem in North America. However, Professor Dezenski really makes you think about, and question, the world around you. Everyone should take this course.",
    "This course provided both great breadth and depth into the topic of corruption: why it exists, the effects it has, and its potential remedies. Provides great insight into the severity and widespread nature of the issue.",
    "The ins and outs of approaching corruption!",
    "I learned the tangible harms of corruption, as well as how corruption is carried out as an extractive process on a global scale. It was also clear that Professor Dezenski had a secondary goal of encouraging us to behave ethically in future employment, in part by showing us the tangible harms of unethical actions."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Explored a variety of global corruption, read a variety of texts, always learned somethign each lesson. Weaknesses: Sometimes it was too repetetive",
    "Strengths: Professor Dezenski. She is amazing and extremely knowledgeable. Also, the way the course is set up really allows you to bring in outside examples and reflect upon topics from other courses. I loved that. Weakness: Sometimes the grading was delayed.",
    "The courses biggest strength is Prof. Dezenski. Her knowledge, poise, and kindness made each class truly delightful. The only weakness regarding the class is that I wish we could have spent more time focusing on anti-corruption reforms.",
    "Strengths: great prof, great class discussions. Weaknesses: group project is never fun, sometimes too overwhelming with work",
    "This was an absolutely phenomenal course, I cant say there isn't a way to improve it, but I can't think of one."

    "Yes! Such a great class, probably one of my favorites since I've been at Yale. Really changed my perspective about corruption and how it connects with so many of the problems our world faces. SUCH a great class, so highly recommend. If you're reading this you should absolutely take it! Professor Dezenski is so wonderful, kind, and knowledgeable",
    "I would highly recommend this class, it is consistently truly fascinating. It unearths a whole new world of corrupt actors and practices that span every sector, every country, and every system. The class really makes you think about current events, global politics, conflicts, aid, the financial world, etc. from a completely new angle. Professor Dezenski is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, makes seminar discussions interesting and engaging, and generally gets students excited about the class. Highly recommend.",
    "Absolutely. This course is amazing. While there is A LOT of reading, the reading was interesting and highly relevant. Also, the assignments of the course really force you to expand your understanding into your specific fields of interest, which was really cool because everyone was able to discuss the content from different angles. You wont be okay if you slack off, but the readings are worth it and the class discussions are great.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is interested in learning about a very real issue in todays society. Prepare for the fact that the class is more practical than it is academic at times (based more on empirical work than theoretical work) but that is not at all a bad thing!",
    "Yes!! Prof dezenski is the kindest professor you'll meet. She is also immensely resourceful and knowledgable about corruption in governance. i came in as a non poli sci or global affairs student, having never taken a poli sci class, so dicissions were sometimes difficult for me to engage in. Nevertheless, i am walking out with a wealth of knowledge about corruption that will serve me well into the future, because this is something everyone will encounter in their lifetimes",
    "Absolutely, Prof. Dezenski is a professor who is both so clearly knowledgeable in her area of expertise, and so clearly cares about her students, both in their well-being, learning, and future ethical behavior. The material itself was fascinating, and felt surprisingly relevant as many of us start looking for jobs."
