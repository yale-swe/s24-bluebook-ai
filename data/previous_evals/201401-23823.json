    "This is Caitie - I would rate this as \"excellent\" in terms of the content. I only lowered my rating to \"good\" due to a few times when we had somewhat last-minute (i.e., less than a week) messages about what to prepare for the next week's class. There are certain weeks when I know that my homework hours are going to be tight, and I am disciplined about planning for these weeks in advance \/ doing work as much in advance as possible. Knowing the specific episodes, as well as having the PDFs of \/ links to the plays 2 weeks+ ahead of time (and not having plays removed at the last-minute) would have been helpful for me. I am probably unusual in this regard, but thought I'd mention it!",

   "comments": [
    "This is Caitie - I appreciated that Catherine would usually open the class with a stimulating, overarching lecture on that week's topic, and then open it up to discussion for the bulk of the class (inserting mini lectures as relevant). This worked great for me, as I gleaned much from my classmates, and as I enjoyed sharing my experiences of the works. Satire is, as I have learned, a social medium!",
    "I thought the class had a great balance of instruction and discussion. At times the environment felt a bit intimidating to us non-dramaturgy students, but the instructor was very conscious of soliciting everyone's opinion.",
    "Catherine Sheehy is just a total badass. She weaves seamlessly between instruction, opinion, tangential thought that actually totally illuminates something, and seeking her students' responses. She sets the intellectual tone of a room very high without making anyone feel stupid. It's thrilling and funny and challenging and stimulating."

    "This is Caitie - I LOVED the opportunity to write my own satire, and was glad that we were given an early heads-up about this on the first day. At first, I was hesitant to take on the challenge, but the more time I had to brainstorm potential topics and forms, the more I got excited about the prospect, until one day my satire idea popped fully formed in my head and I began to put figurative pen to paper, with enough time to write in 2-hour spurts over the course of a few weeks.",
    "The assigned writing project elevated my understanding of the material by asking me to apply concepts that were examined in class to works outside of the classroom. It really tested my understanding of the concepts but also allowed for me to interpret the concepts with respect to the specific pieces I chose to write about.",
    "I audited this course, so I didn't write the assigned final paper -- BUT if I had, I probably would have taken the option to write an original satire. I love that this option was offered as an alternative to an academic paper (it would have been equally challenging, if not much more so, and a whole lot of fun)."

    "This is Caitie - I was appreciative that Catherine pushed us to read \/ watch a lot of content. She reminded us often that we had a lot to prepare for the next week (and got specific about any exceptional weeks). I got so much out of the course due in large part to the sheer volume of material we covered. And I am really glad that we took on 2-hour classes every week, rather than fewer weeks of 3-hour classes. It was also very generous of Catherine to come in every morning to screen episodes an hour before class, as an optional add-on for us. I was usually able to catch the last episode screened each morning, and it was a great way to start off each class.",
    "It was a lot of reading. I think this is typical for dramaturgy but it was much more than I've had to do for any other class as a non-dramaturgy student.",
    "I felt that the amount of assigned reading was beyond what I could realistically accomplish given my other YSD commitments. At times I was disappointed that I couldn't participate in discussion to the fullest extent because I hadn't had time to complete all the reading assignments.",
    "There were definitely classes when you could tell that not everyone -- myself included -- had done all the reading. It was a lot. But it's a huge and fascinating topic and, honestly, I wouldn't recommend there be less reading. Sometimes we have to skim or skip and that's not great, but it still introduces us to the widest possible array of awesome literature. So yeah, lots of reading, but you know, it's up to us to get our butts in gear and deal with it."

   "comments": [
    "This is Caitie - the TV and film content was incredible. I never appreciated shows like Arrested Development before, because I had never been able to get through more than one or two episodes before giving up. Hilarious, I used to call shows like this \"too Flintstones-y\" because I would get frustrated when the characters would get into more and more trouble due to mind-numbing levels of stupidity. Same goes for Ali G, and I never even tried Bob's Burgers, etc. Now, I have developed an appreciation for this kind of satire, and the message it is conveying. It's more about the subject of the satire, not the seemingly annoying characters, who are actually well-loved by the creator (and, now, by me!).",
    "Knowing the assigned episodes before the weekend helped my time management.",
    "The supplementary materials were as important as the reading. I really loved the opportunity to watch videos in the 9-10am slot on Thursdays.",
    "SUCH great discussion of film and television in this class. Especially since TV is becoming such a fertile medium for good writers and actors these days, it was great to have a class that really engaged with smart contemporary media."
