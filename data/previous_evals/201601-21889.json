    "Jonas is awesome! Can't emphasize that enough. He makes Arabic class super fun and super engaging, and I feel like I learned so much this year. Overall, Arabic was an awesome experience and yes, would recommend. It is a lot of work, but the workload is not unreasonable and I feel like I'm coming out of this year with a rock-solid foundation for further study.",
    "I would definitely recommend ARBC 120 02 to another student who wants to get to know a language very different from English and is willing to put in the effort and hours to get results.",
    "You will need to invest a good chunk of time into this course but highly rewarding",
    "Excellent continuation of Arabic 110, with an emphasis on verbal forms and reading comprehension.",
    "It's a tough class, but you will come out of it knowing the Arabic language pretty well.",
    "Tough class, very worth it if you want to really begin to grasp the Arabic language.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone considering taking arabic. It is educational and interesting, and also fun as exciting. You'll leave the class with new skills and new friends."
