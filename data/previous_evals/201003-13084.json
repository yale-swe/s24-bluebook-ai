   "comments": [
    "Great course and a must-take for anyone who has been or wants to go Italy or is learning Italian. Professor Snowden, who a lot of people already know from Epidemic Diseases, is an awesome and underrated professor. He makes an effort to get to know his students--take him up on his offer and go to the Italian breakfasts.",
    "Take it. It was fun and not a terrible amount of work. Snowden is very helpful and great.",
    "Italy Since 1900 was a really enjoyable class. It really wasn't too much work (one take home final, section, a 7 page paper, and a final) and was very straightforward. Professor Snowden really loves Italian history and you can't help but get excited after listening to his lectures. Overall, its a fun class with not too much work and you learn a lot of interesting history.",
    "Definitely take it. Snowden is fascinating and brings in so many different facets of Italian history. Movies are also really great. Workload is manageable- take-home midterm, final, movie paper and 1 or 2 reading responses. Seems like a lot of reading but a lot of it is fairly optional as it usually get covered in class.",
    "History of Italy is a great survey course on modern Italian history. Great class to take if you've taken Italian language and are looking for a related class. Also great to take if you're interested in Italian film as you watch about 5-6 films throughout the course. Professor Snowden is great and makes the material very interesting."
