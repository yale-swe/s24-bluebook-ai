    "I became better at grammar and more comfortable speaking.",
    "I improved my French speaking and writing abilities.",
    "By taking this course, I not only improved my writing and speaking, but also polished my overall grammar skills. Also, by reading texts by authors from various francophone countries, I feel like I gained a lot of insight into the diversity of the french language itself.",
    "An intermediate to advanced understanding of French."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked how we discussed the readings, this helped my understanding of what was going on because sometimes the readings would be hard to understand.",
    "It would be nice if Prof. Koundi was clearer about when homeworks are actually due. I often did the homework for the day it was due, only to find out that I was the only one who did it, or that we would be reviewing it collectively, or that we wouldn't be getting to it that day. That means some people do a lot more work than others, because Prof. Koundi couldn't get mad at the whole class, or I would call out the answers with like one other person, or everyone would get a pass for that day. It just doesn't seem like an equitable setup. Besides that, it's a pretty strong course. You get out what you put in, just like everything else, but there's a ton of work so you're strongly incentivized to put in a lot of effort.",
    "The content of the course is interesting. The books for L4 are far more engaging than the books for L3. All in all, the structure of the French program needs work. The everyday classes aren't difficult, but the amount of tedious, mind-numbing work is. The vocabulary in particular is not a helpful part of the course and the exams are difficult to do well on because of strange specificities demanded from each unit. I don't think I got better at French in this course; I think I got better at memorizing twenty vocabulary words a unit.",
    "Materials covered are somewhat similar but very interesting. A good emphasis on literature over grammar structues\/mechanical aspects of french.",
    "This course provides a great balance of French grammar, reading, writing, and understanding of French history. However, some of the readings were too long and we did not have enough time to discuss all the detail in class.",
    "A lot of grammar was learned, which was great, but speaking in class was difficult and I felt that we didn't practice enough. We were often required to read to much to allow for thorough reading helpful to language learning."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I took it as a requirement but it really helps one improve their French because you work on it every day.",
    "If you need a language requirement, this one isn't a joke. It's a lot of work. It can be fun if Professor Koundi likes you, though it seems very stressful if she doesn't. Besides the students she takes a dislike to, it's a pretty fun environment. Also, she'll only dislike you if you do things like be late, not do homework, or use your phone in class. So if you're not openly disrespectful, you'll be fine, which is pretty reasonable. It's still 1.5 credits with homework about 4 days a week, but if you just sit down and bang it out you can do the coming week's worth in an afternoon. Not sure if I would recommend it to someone looking to become more familiar with another language for fun (because of the workload and time commitment), but you probably won't regret taking it.",
    "If you have to take it, take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The layout of this course really helps students improve their speaking, writing and comprehension skills while also allowing them to apply these skills when reading and writing about basic french literature. It is easy to perform well in the course if you actually do the work.",
    "I would recommend Mme Koundi's 140 to everyone who wants to pursue French language to an advanced level."
