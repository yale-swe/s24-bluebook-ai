    "I think this class could benefit from having a TA. During lab sessions and in-class work on the final project, Erich was pulled in too many directions by all the people who needed him.",
    "Just periodic check ins in the form of questions would be more helpful for me personally... it's one thing to listen to a lecture, but it's much more engaging when there are questions asked and you realize if you know (or don't know) what we are talking about."
