   "comments": [
    "If you're not interested in a book a week pace, this is not a good class for you, but if you can handle the reading (which is mostly fun and accessible rather than onerous), I would absolutely recommend the course. The readings and discussions are all valuable, and Professor Homans deftly leads the class in the most productive and interesting directions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student who is interested in the history of feminism in a fictional and non-fictional context.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student. The workload is reasonable, and professor Homans is excellent.",
    "Definitely worth taking. The syllabus is full of great readings, and Professor Homans is amazing -- if you end up with a good group of students, you'll have some really challenging and valuable discussions, and I definitely came out of the class feeling like I'd really grown and learned a lot.",
    "It was a very good course- I learned a lot about feminism as a discipline and discourse, which I think more people need to take the time to do (as feminism today has often become a word people use to adopt an identity that basically consists of \"I respect women\" without actually knowing the movement and any of its history or critque). Professor Homans was a wonderful section leader, and always sparked a really interesting analysis of the works! I would recommend it wholeheartedly to both English and non-English majors. You really get a good handle on the works.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was a good introduction to feminist theory, although it did leave me wanting to take a class just on the history of feminism and feminist theory. It was a really cool mix of reading literature and reading political essays, and talking and thinking about them together was fruitful and interesting.",
    "Yes, definitely. Don't let the name turn you off - I had little to no knowledge of feminist literature (and really, the feminist movement) before I took this class. I shopped it just because of the reading list (which is GREAT) but ended up staying with it for three reasons: 1) Professor Homans is a truly amazing teacher, 2) the discussion were really unassuming (people weren't pretentious or self-righteous or extremist or anything, really, except interested in the subject), and 3) between the discussions and the readings, you will legitimately never look at yourself\/male-female\/female-female\/Yale\/politics\/the world the same way again. Do yourself a favor and give this class a shot; I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy it but it was too good to dislike.",
    "This class was great\u0097a really thoughtful survey of the various waves of literature and non-fiction, so that there's something for the WGSS people and something for the English majors in every session. It ties together neatly and feels pretty comprehensive. Professor Homans was wonderful at moderating discussion and pulling the meaning out of sources which, at first glance, can seem dry or remote; she was warm and seems really, genuinely invested and interested in her students and what they had to say.I would recommend this class to anyone at all interested in women's issues and to many people who don't think they are interested. A lot of the later theory that we discuss in class is fascinating and mind-bending\u0097a seriously worthwhile intellectual exercise even if you don't buy everything at the end of the day. What's both good and bad about this class is that it will be self-selecting. The class will be filled with people who are already interested in, or passionate about, these issues (at least our class was); on the other hand, maybe it would benefit from a few skeptics or others who would've never dreamed of taking a course like this. But that's just how it is.",
    "Mix of feminist theories\/novels, political texts and stories alike. YES everyone should take this class, it's insightfully taught and brings out great issues",
    "This is a great course. Margaret Homans is always thoughtful, and really sweet but a little sassy too. The discussions are a cool combination of theory and incredible fiction like Toni Morrison."
