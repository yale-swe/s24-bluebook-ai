   "comments": [
    "If Koberda is teaching the course, definitely take it. It's a lot of work, but definitely worth the effort.",
    "I took this course with Thomas Koberda, who has now left Yale. Your experience will almost certainly be completely different from minesorry!",
    "This course seems to vary a lot with the instructor and under Koberda it was very hard and a lot of work. The pace was very fast, absurdly so in the beginning, but Professor Koberda realized this after a few weeks and slowed down slightly. Problem sets often took a very long time and the exams were challenging, with the exception of the second midterm, though Koberda is a pretty generous grader. Take it if you are interested in algebra.",
    "350 was a disaster under Professor Koberda, but that won't be a problem in the future, since he's leaving. If you want to know what the course is supposed to be like, read the reviews for Professor Casson.",
    "I imagine the experience will be quite different with a different professor.",
    "MATH 350 is absolutely essential material for any math major. This year we had Prof. Koberda; it was his first time teaching an undergrad course and it was a wild ride. However he is leaving so you will probably have different professors and things will be different. In one semester we covered *almost* everything in chapters 0-12 in Dummit and Foote Abstract Algebra textbook, and more (e.g. Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem). His lectures weren't great at the beginning but he improved quite a bit over the semester. We had an insane amount of homework assigned, but we did NOT have to do all (HW is only 10% of the grade and the grader only graded the first 10 problems that we submitted). We had two midterms and a final. Midterm 1 and final was hard (median for midterm 1 was around 45 out of 190 points), but he curves the class pretty leniently. The material is fascinating and we derived a lot of linear algebra from Module Theory which was very cool.",
    "Math 350 is an amazing course for a solid foundation in abstract algebra. It's a class a math major cannot miss.",
    "This review doesn't matter since you'll have it with a different teacher, one who is surely different from Koberda. This class was like being smacked in the booty with a cheese grater. Yes, it's painful since the grater is spiky, but that grater could be used in a much more painful way, couldn't it? Abstract algebra, if mishandled\/the instructor desires, could mess you up pretty badly. Koberda had some semblance of mercy upon us, but the tests still hurt.",
    "Yes if they're willing to put a lot of work in and are interested in algebra.",
    "Math 350 with Prof. Koberda is a class to be remembered. We covered 1 - 12 chapters from Dummit and Foote and did basically all of the exercises. Unfortunately, Prof. Koberda is leaving Yale in the end of the year. For that reason, any further comment I put here would most likely be irrelevant, except, maybe, this piece of advice: If you are a math major, you should definitely consider taking this class (regardless of the teacher) as soon as possible as it is the fundament for a lot of the higher level math classes.",
    "If you really love math this is a great class.",
    "This course is absolutely necessary for math majors, but contains an absurdly large volume of material. The course taught by Koberda was extremely rigorous and relied on the student's self-motivation, perhaps more than necessary.",
    "350 is a intro to abstract algebra, especially groups, rings and modules. I would recommend the class as the material is interesting and worth learning.",
    "Challenging course, not to be taken lightly, a must-have for any serious mathematics major.",
    "Imagine you're playing Guitar Hero II, and you put on the no fail cheat. Then you play \"Through the Fire and Flames\" on expert, and get a grade between B- and A based on your performance. That was this class. It went through too much material way too fast, and didn't build up any intuition or motivation for doing so -- lectures were frequently incomprehensible, making this a painful forced reading course in Dummit in Foote. The first midterm and final exam were basically impossible; to give you an idea, the median score on the first test was a 49\/190, which was more than a little disheartening, and I don't imagine the final was much better. Honestly, this is the only class I've ever taken that I would say noticeably decreased my general quality of life. All that said, as much as I hated this course, the grading was very fair, and I think Professor Koberda is a really nice guy who will get better at teaching. (He probably just greatly overestimated the ability of undergraduates.)",
    "This class is a must for any math major. Otherwise, it's definitely very difficult and I would only recommend it to someone who's willing to put in a lot of effort and time. I enjoyed the class, but I definitely struggled. Prof. Koberda was very supportive and provided extra help where needed.",
    "Math 350 is a fun course, and is definitely necessary for anyone who has a significant interest in math. It gives a solid and rigorous introduction to group theory, ring theory, and module theory, and equips the student with the requisite tools to understand further algebra-based math courses. At times it will seem like a firehose of information, but it is definitely worth persevering, as you will emerge with a much better understanding of algebra.",
    "With Prof. Koberda, it was a nightmare to try and keep up. With anyone else, it'll probably be cool. The material is neat and it's very interesting to build up these complicated structures starting from the complete basics.",
    "Too much too fast for the first few weeks; I felt like the rest of the semester was spent picking up the pieces, trying to understand all the various things he introduced during the first few weeks. Turned out fine in the end, grading was nice and lenient. Would recommend if you have seen this stuff before or are a good book learner.",
    "Math 350 covers material essential in many different mathematical fields.Math 350's material was engaging and helped me very much with abstract thinking. Professor Koberda took the class at a very fast speed. Be ready to do a lot of work, and independent studying as well."
