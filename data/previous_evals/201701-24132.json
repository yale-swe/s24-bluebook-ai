    "I gained a greater understand of human rights mechanisms and the challenges of instutionalizing human rights in ASEAN.",
    "I have a much clearer picture of the role Japan plays in Southeast Asia and of the ways in which Japanese society and government deal with its past. This class is great for anyone interested in SEA as well.",
    "This was a great class. I really learnt a lot about Japan and Southeast Asia. It was great to learn about the relations between these countries and the dynamics between them. Professor Asplund was pretty good",
    "I learned more deeply about Japanese foreign aid policy.",
    "I came in knowing very little about Japan, South East Asia, and their relationship, and I've gained a lot of exposure to ASEAN and human rights regimes and Japan's history as an aid donor.",
    "I now have a better understanding of Japan and its role in human rights within itself and within the region. The connections made between Japan and other countries like China, the US, Taiwan, and the countries of Southeast Asia were especially fascinating.",
    "This class was a considerable challenge given how advanced some concepts (especially the more theoretical topics covered) were, but I learned a great deal from taking it. This course challenged me to consider factors (especially in international relations) more analytically on different levels, and I felt I benefitted from the fact that the scope of the discussions varied considerably.",
    "This was a great course for learning about the nuances of an array of topics in the East Asian and Southeast Asian region. We also focused a lot on political theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The seminar is a balance of lecture to learn concepts and roundtable discussion. There were also a couple of opportunities for group projects.",
    "Readings were well formed for the weeks and the overall shape of the course was well structured.",
    "The class was good overall. I felt it sometimes did not have a lot to do with human rights in particular, but more broad scale economic and social relationships between countries in SE Asia.",
    "The strength was that there was a lot of information packed in to every class. The weakness was that sometimes, there was less discussion. I think the class could be more discussion based.",
    "I really liked how readings were organized every week, but I think discussions could be improved even further by having questions or themes to keep in mind while doing the reading, so students can better contribute and prepare for discussions.",
    "It was the perfect combination of the instructor speaking and students speaking, which few classes reach. We were able to discuss the readings in enough time but also hear Professor Asplund's insights (which considering his expertise in the field was really fascinating). Super interesting material and readings, and Professor Asplund is a great professor!",
    "I don't think the class has been offered previously, and to a degree its nature as a \"trial run\" of sorts showed from time to time. Overall, however, the class was fairly well-organized and remained engaging throughout the semester, during which we covered a wide variety of topics. As a non-political science major, this course was especially challenging given that a number of concepts which would otherwise be assumed to be familiar to the majority of students were fairly new to me, so this translated into a greater degree of effort outside of class in order to engage in discussions during seminars. The greatest weakness of the class was perhaps that presentations were not available on Canvas, which while not required for any sort of exam or essay, were often an intriguing follow-up to the readings for a given week, and I think I would have benefitted from being able to review the presentations outside of class.",
    "This class was great for gaining an understanding of the region and let us study whatever we wanted to, but it would be helpful if there was more focus to the class."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class.",
    "100%. This is the perfect seminar where I felt I both got to know the other students and learned a lot from the professor\/discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have zero to minimum knowledge about SE Asia and Japan. It was a good intro class to these topics. Does not have a lot to do with human rights, but you will learn a lot about relations between Japan and the rest of Asia, and Japan and the West.",
    "If you want to get an overview of geopolitical landscape in East Asia, this is the course to take.",
    "YES! Take this course, if offered. The material is fascinating, there's enough variety in coursework to keep things interesting, the topics change every week (but still show connection) and class was always great. Professor Asplund is also a great instructor and it was not a high-pressured environment at all.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. While the class seemed more or less designed with political science\/EP&E\/East Asian studies majors in mind, I would recommend this class to anyone regardless of area of study. I definitely gained a lot from the challenge of engaging with the wide variety of topics covered. I would recommend, however, that one be at least somewhat familiar with some topics beforehand, including recent\/relevant developments in the region covered within the scope of the class (Japan, East Asia, specifically the ASEAN member states). Professor Asplund was also fantastic and I would highly recommend taking a class with him in the future if one has the opportunity.",
    "I would recommend this class if you know what you want to learn and can utilize the resources in this class to do so."
