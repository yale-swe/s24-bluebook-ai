    "The way CPSC 150 is run is not for everyone. If you don't think you can sit for 75 minutes and listen to the same person talking for most of that time, then you would probably find this class boring. However, if you are the kind of person who is willing to immerse themselves in the mind of someone as brilliant and passionate as Gelernter, then I highly recommend this class. The class is capped at 25, making for an intimate learning environment where you can engage deeply with someone who is at the top of his field. Classes like CPSC 150 are the reason I came to Yale! If you can get past the format and style of teaching, however, the workload is fairly light. The reading is almost nonexistent, with the longest one being around 20 pages if I recall correctly. And for each reading, you spend several classes deconstructing and discussing it, so keeping up with the reading is not an issue. Additionally, the papers are short. There are 4 papers during the term, each one 300 words, and one final paper which is 1500 words. Don't be misled, though- Gelernter places a HEAVY emphasis on style. Because the papers are so short, he grades them word by word, usually making corrections for conciseness. He doesn't like the long, complex, flowery sentences of typical academic writing. He instead asks his students to write powerfully and personally, saying exactly what you mean, nothing more, nothing less.",
    "The few papers in this class were very short but graded very harshly. If you're interested in the philosophy of artificial intelligence I would definitely recommend it since Gelernter is well informed and very intelligent. Be prepared to spend time perfecting the little work you are assigned. There is a specifically concise writing style he wants.",
    "Take it. It's a lot of fun, not a lot of work, and will improve your writing. Hard on your grade."
