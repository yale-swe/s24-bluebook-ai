    "In the first semester of this class, the only material you'll learn that wouldn't be covered in an AP Physics C class is Lagrangian mechanics (two lectures) and special relativity (four or five lectures). Everything else is review, perhaps treated slightly more rigorously in the language of differential operators. This is kind of unfortunate, but so it goes.If you haven't studied vector calculus, some things might go over your head; it's pretty important that you concurrently take (or already have taken) MATH 120 or some equivalent. Note that MATH 230\/231 is emphatically NOT relevant to this class, and in fact seems to make efforts to avoid pertaining to physics in any way (not that MATH 230 is a bad class, though).\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\Professor Baltay is hilarious. You will come to love him as the class goes on. He's a quality lecturer, too. Problem sets in this class are not difficult at all, and don't take more than an hour or two per week to complete (excepting a couple of the end-of-semester EM problems, which have some of the ugliest integrals I've ever seen).\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\OVERALL ASSESSMENT: excellent class; less work. I would recommend PHYS 260a to any student who is interested in science and not terrible at math; and I would emphatically insist that any student interested in possibly majoring in physics or any of its derivatives (astronomy, geophysics, engineering, applied physics, etc) take this class.",
    "Absolutely take it",
    "If you've taken physics C in high school, this is a good course to take next. Unfortunately, you don't treat thermo or optics, which I might have hoped for. Baltay is big on relativity, which is good if you enjoy relativity. The books used for the course are awesome and very understandable and useful.It would be nice to cover other mechanics concepts in more detail and to perhaps have more thought provoking problem sets. Many were plug and chug until we arrived at electrodynamics, when the problems became significantly more difficult.The first midterm was easier than my physics C high school tests (disappointingly easy). I've heard the class gets harder as you go along though...If you haven't taken physics C in high school, you can probably survive because Baltay briefly treats the majority of physics C mechanics topics (but very briefly and to little depth...thus it might be preferable to take physics 180 where the treatment is more rigorous).I really enjoyed learning the Lagrangian method, but at the moment I'm not much a fan of relativity. I also enjoy electrodynamics.",
    "If you haven't had much experience with multivariable it can be a little confusing at times, but most of the time you can figure it out as you go along.",
    "I'd recommend the course to anyone who took AP physics in high school.",
    "Against the recommendations, I did take this course without any background in AP Physics (none in mechanics, and only a bit in E&M). I took Math 230 the year before. I did not find it to be particularly difficult, even given these circumstances, as the material generally is presented in a lucid way and the problems and tests are reasonable.",
    "First of all, Baltay is incredible. Take it if only to be in his class.We burn through mechanics in about 7 weeks, but it manages to be very enlightening all the same. E&M gets hard, but that is probably because I hadn't seen calculus based physics before. Definitely not the course to take for prospective electrical engineers, because you only touch upon how the electronics work, but if you want to know how our world works fundamentally, this is the course to take. I've heard 261, which unifies EM theory with relativity and also covers quantum mechanics, is out of this world.Note to prospective those deciding between 200 and 260: I came into Yale with no multivariable calculus background, and math 120 was a perfect corequisite. You have to teach yourself some of the math for 260, but for the most part, 120 covers all you need to know.",
    "You can't go wrong with this class. Solid instructor. Solid textbooks. Solid everything.",
    "If you have taken AP Physics C Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism and will be enrolled in multivariable calculus (math120 or the enas equivalent) there is no reason not to take this course. Physics 200 is more tedious and will simply review what you have learned in high school. 260 will teach you more, and it is not necessarily more difficult.",
    "It's hard but not like OMGWTF, at least not yet. Lectures can seem a little long when the professor is going through a really convoluted derivation of some equation, but his example problems are good, and if you ever look over your notes and work your way through one of his proofs, it's actually pretty cool how it works out. If you like that sort of thing.",
    "I would recommend Physics 260 to any student that is interested in studying physics here at Yale and who has a knack for the material! It's been great.",
    "260 is not really what it is often cracked up to be. It most certainly doesn't require 230, knowing basic vector calc is all you need, and often it can be learned along the way. Mostly it is a review of AP physics with a little more multivariate calculus. Cool things in the book, like the derivation of Lagrange Equation, were not at all covered... Special Relativity was pretty interesting though!",
    "YES take it! As long as you have the math, it's supposed to be way better presented than 200 or 180. good, solid physics course. Plus you get to learn general relativity!",
    "Physics 260 is a great course for people who have a strong physics background. The course moves through classical mechanics extremely quickly to get to the more interesting stuff, like special relativity. If you have a strong background in mechanics and E&M, this works out really well, but if you need a solid review in those areas, it might move too quickly. Baltay is a great professor, lectures are generally interesting (especially on the new topics) and homeworks are not too bad, though they sometimes cover stuff not discussed in lecture. If you are really interested in physics and don't need too much review of high school mechanics\/E&M, then take 260.",
    "If you have not taken AP Physics in high school DO NOT take this class! As great as the professor is, he moves as quickly as the students will let him, and this often means while some people are reviewing and expanding their knowledge in a certain area, others may be seeing it for the first time at such a high level, and speed.That said, if you have taken AP Physics, and if you know how to take triple integrals, use curl divergence and gradient, and know Stokes Thm, Gauss' Thm, and are comfortable using them, this is a GREAT class for you!",
    "The first part of the course upto Lagrangian mechanics is more or less high school physics with calculus notation coupled with some double and triple integrals (which are usually reduced to a single integral). The course only starts to pick up its momentum with relativity and E&M, which are both somewhat challenging topics at first. Being able to set up double and triple integrals, and knowing some fundamental theorems of multivariable calculus such as Green's theorem, Stoke's theorem, and divergence theorem, are recommended skills for the course. Don't be discouraged though if you don't have a firm background in multivariable calculus. You can pick it up as you go along. A strong background in single-variable calculus is a must though.Also this class has a lot of derivation of equations, and fewer application type questions, so it would suit the needs of students who are more interested in Physics from a theoretical standpoint than from a practical standpoint.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It moves at a faster pace than the other classes, mostly so that it will be able to cover more advanced and interesting material in the spring (quantum mechanics and general relatively). Sometimes I found myself very confused working through the problem sets and didn't feel like we had been taught what we were supposed to be doing, but by the time the final came around everything felt relatively comfortable.With regards to the math corequisite: it says 230, but you can definitely take this with 120. This is probably a better fit actually, and the majority of students were in 120 during the semester. Sometimes the physics was a little ahead of the math, but they were in general pretty well coordinated so that you learn math around the same time it is necessary in physics.",
    "PHYS260 is pretty good and you will definitely learn more than you did in high school. More material is presented than you will actually have to know for the tests, but if you pay attention it's really interesting. The class is mostly composed of freshman who don't necessarily keep the big picture in mind, but it's worth taking. The best math pre-co-req is ENAS151 or whatever the math dept equivalent is, not what the blue book says.",
    "If you've taken AP Physics C (or some calculus-based physics class0, a lot of the first semester of Physics 260 will be a review (mostly mechanics, some electrostatics). While there definitely is more advanced math involved, the class isn't unbearably hard. In fact, the psets can be somewhat misleading; they can usually be done just by referring to the examples in the book instead of actually understanding the material, which can turn out somewhat badly for the final. While I can't say anything for 2nd semester, anyone with a strong physics background should be able to handle this course well.",
    "If you love and\/or need physics and have a flair for math, take 260! The class spent about 6 weeks on mechanics, 2 weeks on special relativity, and 2 weeks on electrostatics. There are weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final, all of which are very fair. If you have a hard time with the problems, the weekly problem sessions are very helpful. But \"any fool knows\" that the best part of this class is Profesor Baltay. He gives great examples, clear explanations, and is very entertaining; although this is basic intro physics, I really enjoyed 260! As far as preparation goes, you should have completed a Physics C or equivalent physics with calculus course before enrolling in this. Also, I would highly recommend completing multivariable calculus before 260, unless you want to work ahead in math to stay afloat in physics.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for a physics or math major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, provided that they honestly evaluate themselves on their interest in physics. The exams are graded pretty leniently, and the problem sets are not too difficult as well. However, if one isn't truly interested in the material, it can be kind of a bore.",
    "This is a very good class with a very good professor. There isn't a lot work and the exams aren't that hard. Previous physics experience is a must.",
    "If you decide to enroll in Physics 260, be prepared for one of your most intellectually demanding classes in college. Dr. Baltay breezes through the Newtonian mechanics that is the staple of high school physics and focuses much of his time on complex junior-level physics topics such as Lagrangian Mechanics and Special Relativity (in its complete complexity). The subjects covered in the course are fascinating; however, they are very hard to grasp; furthermore, there is not much support from Dr. Baltay and the TAs for help. And finally, with respect to prerequisites, you do not need to have done Math 120 beforehand. In fact, I advise you to DO IT CONCURRENTLY. The topics covered in Physics 260, in fact, greatly complement the concepts taught in Math 120 and by the end of both courses, you will have a greater appreciation of both.",
    "Take 260 over 200 for Baltay.",
    "If you are interested in physics, this is the course to take. Baltay is fantastic, the work is not excessive at all, and the material is interesting. Although this is the most advanced intro course, that just means that you cover more material, not that the grades are more punishing. I can't recommend this enough.",
    "Great course to take if you already know some physics.",
    "You should take it, you don't need any more math than 120 or the equivalent engineering course at the same time.",
    "Physics 260 is a fast paced and eloquent approach to physics. I highly recommend this to all students considering their studies in physics. Even if you have not had a strong background in physics, you can still do well in this class. The midterm and final may be challenging for you, but anyone with a weak background can overcome that by studying a little harder. This course is a great introduction to the beauty of physics.",
    "Lots of fun. The relativity lectures especially were amazing. Electomagnetism is hard, so be ready. If you are thinking about taking this class at the same time as 120, I'd recommend looking over a multi textbook and getting the idea of a triple integral and a partial derivative over the summer.",
    "Physics 260 is a good place to start for the inquisitive and smart potential math\/physics major or for anyone with a good grasp of high school physics. Baltay is an experienced physicist and often has several funny tips to give to support your understanding. I took the course with only Physics C Mechanics under my belt and I ended up fine. The course comprehensively covers\/reviews Mechanics and Electrostatics during the first semester with a couple weeks spent on Special Relativity. Problem sets are usually around 5 hours a week, maybe less. Don't let the early weeks of class convince you that the class is easy; it will definitely pick up the pace by the time you cover special relativity. Reading the textbook will definitely help. Ultimately, a solid, interesting course.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you can keep up--Professor Baltay is great (something which people tend to not say about the professors for the other two intro physics classes), and you come away with a good understanding of the theory behind the material. I took Math 120 with it instead of Math 230 and was fine.",
    "I would recommend it. I think the value of the class depends a lot on what a particular person's math\/physics background and goals are, though. I would not recommend taking it concurrently with multivariable calculus. I also think having had a pretty solid physics background is important, and the class is definitely extra work (but feasible) if your high school courses were not as strong as normal AP\/honors. I think my physics background was weaker than most of the students in the class (and if I had any advice for students thinking about taking the class, I would say that a mediocre high school's \"AP-level\" physics is probably worth being suspicious of), and I think it would have been helpful to have spent class time on topics that 260 skips over. Even so, this was probably my most interesting class this semester and I enjoyed it. The professor is very good. I especially appreciated how he would prove concepts twice-- once 'simply' to show the physics and once more generally to get into the mathematical details. I think there is generally more emphasis on proofs and derivations in this class, which is what I wanted in an intro physics class. (It might be different if I planned on being an engineering, premedical, physical science, etc. major and needed to be able to remember formulas and common applications; I do think if I had any need for a 'practical' introduction I might have stuck with a different course.)",
    "The class was well run and I feel like the sequence of topics was appropriate. I enjoyed Lagrangian mechanics and relativity in particular. The pace of the class was a bit fast, though again this is understandable given that it is meant to be an intensive introduction to physics. I took this class concurrently with MATH 120, without having taken AP physics in High School. Professor Baltay is very clear and knowledgeable; his analogies are very helpful tools for understanding abstract or potentially confusing concepts. His lecture style is also very methodical, which made it very easy to understand material and take effective notes. Problem sets were a good length and of appropriate difficulty. Test problems were also appropriate for the class. Grading on tests and problem sets is fair.",
    "I would say it is a good stepping stone towards becoming a physics major, but that it requires a good grasp of an AP Physics C curriculum and calculus. For a student who has knowledge of Math 115 and an interest in physics, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "A sophisticated review of classical mechanics and electrostatics, and an introduction to Lagrange's equation and special relativity. It moves quickly, and sticks to the point. That's the course's biggest asset if you can keep up. The mechanics book is second to none.",
    "If you want to learn inroductory physics the right way, take Physics 260. We prove every formula we use (except a few fundamental empirical findings). Our textbook authors give proper discussion to philosophy of science. The problem sets are very doable in general, but every now and then you'll get an assignement with some killer triple integrals in spherical coordinates. The suggested co-requisite for the course, Math 230, will not (directly) prepare you for these (in time), so, depending on your background, you may have to teach yourself some mathematics on the job.",
    "260 is a very good course. I came in with only a shaky knowledge of mechanics (no e+m) and I think I now have a solid grasp of the concepts behind mechanics, special relativity, and electrostatics. The problem sets took anywhere from 1 to 5 hours, so it wasn't a terribly difficult course - I'm told it's a lot easier than 200, for example. Baltay is excellent. He's good at teaching simultaneously at a (somewhat) sophisticated and understandable level, although after an hour of class or so it sometimes starts to feel rather dry. If you're wavering between 260 and 200 (and I certainly was, since I switched back and forth about five times and bought the 200 book twice), I strongly recommend taking the plunge and doing 260. Even if you've never seen most of the math before or even any e+m whatsoever, you can definitely pick it up (though perhaps at the price of a sunday spent watching half of the MIT multivariable course online).",
    "Very solid introductory Physics class that moves at a fairly rapid pace and assumes quite a bit of prior knowledge. Overall, strengths = interesting lectures, advanced materials.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who would like to take introductory physics and is taking or has taken multivariable calculus. The physics taught here is challenging and interesting, and is good for following AP Physics C in high school.",
    "A fast-paced, challenging Physics course, recommended for students that have taken calculus-based physics before.",
    "I you want to take Physics and prefer a bit more of a challenge with the intro concepts, this is a good course. Pay attention in lecture and give your problem sets the right amount of time and effort and you should succeed fine. Definitely a class for those that enjoy physics though.",
    "Take it! It's not overly difficult and the material is very interesting. You cover the basics of classical mechanics but also get to explore special relativity and Lagrangian mechanics, and the material is presented very clearly so its not overwhelming.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Physics 260 to another student. It's a lot of work, but the work is fascinating. When you take 260, you jump into to actual physics. It's difficult because the concepts are difficult, not because the problems are contrived to be tricky. It's much closer to real, research-oriented physics than any other class I've taken.",
    "Physics 260 was a great course. Baltay is an awesome professor and Shankar is even better -and easier to understand- if he's teaching it. Math 230 is NOT actually necessary as a co-requisite. If you do Math 230 you will need to have already taken multivariable calc beforehand in order to do the math for phys 260. Math 120 actually follows the course better in terms of the math used (though you'll need some stuff like using stokes before you learn it in math). Also you NEED to have had Calc based physics already to know what's going on. you can do it with an algebraic background but you'll probably get a C and you'll be stressed and confused for most of the semester.",
    "Take this only if you have a very strong background in physics. It's a very challenging course. Also, it skips over some important topics e.g. damped oscillations so I wouldn't say it's the best preparation if you want to take further physics courses. I would have dropped a level if the professor for the level down had been better.Professor Baltay is an outstanding professor. He covers the material in a way that really encourages you to see the connections between different areas of physics.Overall, take this course only if you're willing to work hard, skip some important topics, and the professor is great.",
    "Physics 260 is a great class with a great professor. It is a hard class that challenges you and goes much further than your high school AP knowledge. Anyone who has a strong background in Physics (AP mechanics and electrodynamics) and is willing to work hard can take this class.",
    "Highly recommend if with Charles Baltay.",
    "Right choice for those who took AP-Physics and Multi in high school.",
    "This is an intensive theoretical approach to introductory physics; if you're interested and have a solid math background, it's definitely worth taking. (Multivariable background is VERY helpful though not necessary).",
    "Absolutely. It's a great course, you learn a lot, and it's very interesting. It's tough though.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has completed AP Physics and is looking for a broad preview of some more intensive physics topics. The tests and psets are very reasonable and the lectures are quite interesting. Overall, a wonderful class!"
