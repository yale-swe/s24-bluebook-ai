   "comments": [
    "NOT an \"intro\" course by any means, but very worthwhile and rewarding. Come to this class ready to discuss, to think BIG, to push yourself out of boundaries and boxes of what you think \"LGBT\" means, and to otherwise acquire more tools to squash all forms of heteropatriarchy with your intellect than you ever thought you would.",
    "Cool class if you're interested in queer theory! If you're not\u2026I would advise against it. A lot of queer theory.",
    "This is a crash course in critical theory with a focus on queer subjects. For anyone interested in queer academia or formal discourse about sex, sexuality, and gender, this course is probably the best starting point at Yale. I enjoyed taking it immensely, loved every minute with Joe Fischel, and truly enjoyed the coursework. If you care about queer studies, take this class! Don't worry about the word \"Intro\" in the title, either; whether you have little experience with queer topics or you're a veteran activist, this class should be well at your level (and if you consider majoring in WGSS, you might need it anyway)!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. JOE IS FANTASTIC. HE'S LIKE LITERALLY THE SMARTEST AND NICEST PERSON I'VE EVER MET. Make sure to go on Day 1. It's tough competition getting in. There's a lot of reading but there's almost literally nothing beyond that. It's such a chill workload and the first time I've really felt like what I got out was proportional to what I put in.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY WE TALKED ABOUT DUCK PENIS ONCE OK TWICE LOL",
    "This class in a excellent and moderately challenging introduction to important topics in queer studies such as queer and social theory, transnationalism and colonialism, gender theory, etc. I would highly recommend this course, even if you are not pursuing a related major. By using WGSS-related topics as subjects of inquiry, this class enables students to think about much larger and universal concepts (e.g. power) in illuminating ways. Joe is a great professor, and if you think you may be interested in the course I wouldn't let the opportunity to take it slip away.",
    "This class is the greatest. Take it if you want to think about lots of things in new ways (you have to be open-minded). You will not regret it-- great readings, great discussion, and fun times are all over the place. Joe is a hard grader, but that just means you have to step up your game."
