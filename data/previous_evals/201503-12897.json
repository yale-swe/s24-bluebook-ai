    "This course is less of a psychology class and more of a writing class. You learn the basics of experimental psychology, but the bulk of the class is learning how to write psychology papers. The grading of the papers is very tough, but you go through multiple drafts so they are doable. The content of the course is not very interesting, but after taking the course I feel well prepared to run experiments for my thesis and write it. Also, about halfway through the semester, you stop having to regularly go to class and instead have meetings with your TA to discuss your final paper, which is very nice."
