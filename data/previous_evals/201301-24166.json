    "Strengths: 1. The structure of the spring break trip provided an excellent sense of Haiti. I'm glad we were able to see Port au Prince, Deschapelles and Hinche to get a taste of the contrasts in lifestyles and level of health care. 2. I enjoyed the mix of disciplines in the class, and I think the instructors chose the group well. I found my classmates very impressive, and I felt that I learned a great deal from them. 3. Our contacts in Haiti were helpful, responsive, and as enthusiastic as we were. I hope that the class can continue working with the same people.Suggestions for Improvement: 1. provide a rough syllabus in the beginning so that we have a general idea of major milestones and due dates. It would also be nice if 2. During the trip, some groups had less time with instructors than others, so perhaps the instructors could divide their time more evenly among the groups. For example, Gary was most heavily involved with the Chronic Disease group (and appropriately so, as he is an MD). His perspective would have also been helpful to the data group, so it would have been nice if he could have joined thegroup for at least one of its major activities while at HAS (such as OpenMRS training). 3. During the trip, 30 minutes should be set aside per night for the group to discuss thoughts, ideas, and reactions to the day's events. This should include only the Yale group and none of the preceptors, so that people feel comfortable speaking freely.",
    "Strengths: started off semester with grounding in the history and cultural foundations of Haiti; covered topics relevant to each group's projects such that all students learned about chronic disease, agroforestry and its impacts on the economy, water and latrines, and mapping and data systems; guest speakers provided rich expertise on topics they'd come to discuss; opportunity to learn\/strengthen Haitian Creole-speaking skills through access to DILS course and Haitian Creole-speaking instructors; opportunities for discussion before, during, and after the Spring Break trip to Haiti; visited different Haiti-based NGOs, learning how they each work allowed students to formulate thoughts and opinions on the pits and peaks of development work and how it should be undertaken; professors shared their own experiences to enrich, not overtake, discussions -- this made the course feel like more of a roundtable where we were each bringing something to the table; provision of dinner, a gateway to Caribbean culture and opportunity to break bread and get to know each other better before embarking on a 10-day trip together; opportunities to join other groups during trip (didn't have to stick with own groupthe whole time).Weaknesses\/Ways to Improve: no syllabus (create even a sparse one so students have some type of road map for what the course would cover and when); no web component to Haitian Creole language learning (it was a shame that the DILS course scheduling was so rigid as all students could have benefitted -- a web component or in-class session dedicated to learning the most basic of Creole would be a huge improvement); in Haiti, daily oral recaps (of the day) were too frequent -- I'd suggest moving to an every other day format and having the free days be an opportunity for each person (not just a group representative) to describe the peak and pit of their day.",
    "The primary challenge in this class was getting sufficient guidance to develop the project prior to the trip. In some ways, the project built off of years past, but in other ways it did not, and if we had a bit more information about what had been done previously and what was already available, we could have potentially done much more with our time. Otherwise, the course was excellent. I learned a lot from it, really enjoyed seeing the different aspects of healthcare in Haiti, and felt like we were able to contribute at least a small amount to the work of our partners at HAS."

    "Instructor: Gordon Geballe \u00a0The course instructors (Gordon Geballe, Gary Desir and Robert LaMothe) were friendly, approachable, and provided a steady guiding hand throughout the semester. They facilitated our work and respected our ability to direct our own projects.",
    "Instructor: Gordon Geballe \u00a0Gordon is an intelligent, dedicated professor whose interest in sustainable development clearly went beyond the purposes of teaching. His action-oriented teaching style made students question what the \"right approach\" to development is and opened our eyes to the many forces (political, environmental, social, technological, health, etc.) involved in Haiti's current positioning. His kindness and lighthearted attitude allowed for a smooth trip in which students, hosts, translators, drivers, etc. felt like important members of the team and post-trip, we felt like an extended family, the culmination of which was the lovely end-of-the-year dinner.One improvement would be in the area of organization, even if just loosely organized -- for instance, having one clear meeting time (while on the ground in Haiti) would likely improve people's promptness."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Heather Elizabeth Fosburgh \u00a0Heather was always organized and prepared. From my perspective, she was essential to the success of the course, and the spring break trip went smoothly in large part due to her contribution.",
    "Instructor: Heather Elizabeth Fosburgh \u00a0Heather was the glue that kept the course together. Her knowledge (both via her work experience in the region and as a student in the class last year) allowed for more structure of the course and enriched course discussions.An improvement would be to make it easier for students to experience other groups' activities. This year, in my experience, many people needed to be asked before Heather allowed a scheduling switch."

    "This course is a unique experience that you will not get from any other course at YSPH or at Yale. You'll get the opportunity to collaborate with graduate students from other programs and to form a team dynamic with a diverse group of your peers. I was able to apply all aspects of my public health education to Haiti as a case study, including my knowledge of community health research, public health policy, medical informatics and physiology. Regardless of your prior relationship to Haiti, you will find yourself intellectually and emotionally submerged in the country's complex past, present and future.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in development, global health, public health, medicine\/nursing, cultural history, agriculture, or sustainability. You get a rich understanding of the nation of Haiti and how its political and environmental history has shaped its current positioning. You'll be an essential part of all classroom discussions, bringing your background and unique experiences to the table. You'll get to experience the richness of Haiti first-hand, serving as a conduit of information on the culture and on-the-ground happenings. You'll be pushed to think critically about development and the role of foreigners in development, constantly asking yourself questions like: is development work sustainable when its performed by non-Haitians? How can more Haitians be engaged in development work from the outset such that eventually NGOs go away and Haitian people pick up the work on their own?"
