    "You can learn a lot from research. Just make sure that you do your best to understand what's going on in the lab. Also don't wait too long to right the final report.",
    "Take one semester. It's allowed for the BS and two semesters is hell.",
    "Definitely take this course! This is a great way to apply what you have learned over the past 3 years and produce something meaningful. Don't be afraid to simply dive into your project. If you start with only a year, there isn't that much time, so get working!!",
    "I mean, you have to take it. But requirements-wise, this is a very reasonable major. :)",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to, but my main suggestion would be: start early! Know the due dates, and you'll be fine. The E&EB thesis is very chill, just make sure you pick a project you're actually interested in!",
    "I'd definitely recommend doing a thesis; having ownership of a piece of work is a great experience and tremendously important for exposing you to the scientific process. I thoroughly enjoyed mine. However, be warned that the department offers very little deadline guidance, other than a progress report if you're in the first semester of two and a final paper due at the end of the semester. This means you'll need to be on top of your work yourself to avoid an end-of-semester crunch, which can be brutal. I'd also recommend working closely with graduate students if possible; they are usually great resources who are more easily accessible than professors, and they are generally very smart and kind people. Highly recommended."
