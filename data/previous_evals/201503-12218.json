    "It is a great, classic history class!!! Although the topic seems strange, the history is so interesting, and it is fairly relaxed in terms of work-load besides a lot of reading. The reading is enjoyable though!",
    "Must take class for Yale.",
    "A must-take. Shop it even if you think you have no interest in European history or pre-1914 history. It will change your perspective on history and the world. I left lecture every day mind-blown and with my hand shaking from furiously taking notes (\"no gizmos allowed!\"). It made me want to be a history major. If you think lectures are inherently less appealing, shop this course and you'll know that's false. The midterms are manageable but graded a little toughly, and those are the only major assignments--a particularly good class to credit\/D, though I took it for a grade. Regardless, Professor Snyder is likely the best lecturer at Yale and this makes it worth it to take, no matter what grading scale you choose. My biggest takeaway from this class is how much of the world we just don't learn history about -- who knew Poland was so fascinating? I can never look at the world the same.",
    "The class was excellent. A relatively easy history class with the best history professor at Yale.",
    "I recommend this course to those who have never taken a course on Eastern European history. The pace is quite fast but the reading is manageable. You are not allowed to take any notes on any electronic devices in class, which actually was difficult for me because I am not a hand-writer, and the professor speaks very, very quickly. This class wasn't life-changing but I definitely learned a lot more about Eastern European history and got acquainted with several broad themes.",
    "As a senior in pre-med\/psych, I was just looking for a class like Gaddis's Cold War that I could take credit\/d and just enjoy learning from a great lecturer. I have never taken a history course before and knew nothing about any of these topics. After shopping this class and Cold War, I felt like the lecture in this class is far more interesting because of Tim Snyder. From just going to the lecture and doing less than half the readings (probably closer to a quarter), you can easily get a B on the exams which will safely put you in the credit range. Depending on your section TA, the amount of work you need to do may change. I split weekly readings with a friend and it became pretty easy to do just enough to participate a little in section (especially if you go to class) and not too much work.",
    "Eastern Europe to 1914 with Professor Snyder is an amazing course! Its strengths definitely lie in Professor Snyder's ability to formulate a story out of oftentimes confusing Eastern European history and to draw out key themes and ideas from them. Never before, nor will I ever, in all likelihood, have a professor who is so skilled at pulling key ideas and themes out of oftentimes confusing history, and I definitely left the course both with a better understanding of how Eastern Europe developed but also of how nationalism, states, and modern ideas of countries has developed over time. The course's main weakness, I feel, is that the sheer volume of material makes studying for the midterm and final somewhat exhausting - I believe when the course had its former format of three midterms, studying would have been much more manageable. That being said, the questions on the two exams were not unreasonable (big themes and ideas), and the amount of readings required are not overbearing (as I have heard in some courses).",
    "Very very good class. Will recommend. Only withdrew because of various complications.",
    "Yes! Take it, take it, take it! Professor Snyder is a fantastic lecturer. He was funny and engaging throughout the course, while still communicating a significant amount of information. The lectures are amazing and you will learn a ton. Plus, you don't have to do the reading to do well in the class as long as you come to lecture and take good notes.",
    "I would summarize this class as a highly enjoyable one with fascinating material and a reasonable workload. I would highly recommend to a fellow student whether or not he or she was a history major or interested in history.",
    "It's a great course that's worth taking, especially if you have limited knowledge of the region before this.",
    "100%",
    "Professor Snyder is a boss. Take this class.",
    "Absolutely amazing class! Snyder is simply the best and the expert on this subject. If you don't know much about Eastern European history take this class. There is a completely manageable workload besides reading, two non-cumulative midterms, a short map quiz, and section. All of the material is straightforward and the reading is very enjoyable. You will appreciate this class regardless of your major because it is sure to influence your understanding of history and what it means for a nation to be a nation.",
    "Take this course! Professor Snyder is amazing and makes difficult and confusing course material interesting and easy to understand. I did not have a huge interest in Eastern Europe before this course, but, after sitting in on the first day of class, I knew I had to take it. I usually easily zone out during lectures, but, with this one, it was impossible because lecture was so fast and interesting. Get ready to write a lot because laptops\/technology isn't allowed. The 2 midterms are not easy, but they're fair.",
    "A gem history course that covers a fascinating region's history. Very dense and fast paced, but Snyder has an unmatched ability to engross you in an exciting story-like lecture every class period. Just two exams and a section.",
    "Awesome class that provides a really good overview of Eastern European history-- a must take for anyone! I had no background in the region before taking the class and I learned so much! Very accessible and manageable class!",
    "If you have any interest in history, take it. Great survey course on a topic most American students know deplorably little about.",
    "Yes I would recommend the course to any student who likes to read and learn about Europe.",
    "Take it",
    "The class covers an incredible deal of history that is often overlooked in most of European history and brings life to these often untold stories. I would recommend that everyone take this class, of only to broaden their understanding of the Eastern European peoples and their intricate pasts and identities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It's a history class that relies more on memorization than most, which was difficult for me. But really interesting material, not much work",
    "Tim Snyder is both THE prime expert on Eastern European history and an incredible lecturer. The lectures are interesting, well organized, filled with funny jokes and anecdotes unique to Dr. Snyder. This class is something very special, if you have any interest, take it!",
    "Absolutely take this course-- I recommend it (and HIST 264, the spring post 1914 version) to everyone I know. Professor Snyder is a fantastic, funny, engaging professor who tells the history of Eastern Europe like it's a story. I looked forward to this class more than I looked forward to any other classes this semester, and am honestly sad that I can't take more lectures with Professor Snyder. Take this! You won't regret it.",
    "Amazing class, definitely worth taking. History of Eastern Europe is so unexpectedly rich and full of entertaining stories. The lectures would maybe be better organized if they followed a chronological path.",
    "Professor Snyder is the best lecturer I've ever had, and the class itself is really excellent and covers a lot of important material that is generally understudied. Definitely take it if you canI can't say enough good things.",
    "I would summarize it as the history and ideologies of Eastern Europe from around 700 to 1914. I would recommend the class. Professor Snyder is an incredible lecturer and the material is very interesting.",
    "If one is willing to pay attention to a fast-paced and engaging lecturer in Professor Snyder twice a week, and if one has an interest in exploring the development of larger historical themes over time, then History 263 would be a very good choice. A student need not necessarily have a particular interest in the history of Eastern Europe before the course to enjoy it. I actually appreciated Professor Snyder's no-technology policy, as I felt that it forced me to improve my selective note-taking skills. The two assessments were difficult, but not unreasonable, and though the reading load is quite heavy, it is not necessarily of utmost importance to one's larger experience of the class to complete the reading. Overall, I would recommend History 263 to another student.",
    "HIST 263 is an enjoyable history class on a topic that rarely gets a lot of airtime. Professor Snyder does a good job of making the material in the class very interesting and even though some of the readings are a bit dull, I never found myself bored with the material. There isn't too much work as there is only a midterm, a final, and a small map quiz and they are pretty easy to do well on if you've been keeping up with the material. Overall, it's a great class and a great way to try out History if you've never taken a Yale history class before.",
    "Overall a great class as an intro the eastern european history (surprise). I would recommend it if you want to have a better understanding of the region, but this is not a gut class - you need to put in the effort if you actually want to learn stuff.",
    "I would recommend Eastern Europe to 1914 to another student because I learned a lot and was very interesting in the material. The lectures are engaging and taught very well too.",
    "It is extremely interesting and rewarding, but also immensely confusing if one does not pay attention to the lectures and the readings to the fullest extent. I would therefore recommend any student to structure his\/her course notes FROM THE VERY BEGINNING in a coherent timeline or chart or whatever! Otherwise you'll wind up in the same spot that I was at the end of September, mixing up entire centuries of events in different countries and no longer being able to understand the lectures. And believe me, it was very unpleasant to find myself at that stage, because I had a mountain of course notes that I simply HAD to structure if I wanted to succeed in this class. It was an unpleasant surprise, so I would definitely recommend this course to any student, provided that they have the academic rigor required for this class.",
    "Excellent way to learn a lot about the part of Europe that is often overlooked or not taught in a high school curriculum.",
    "This course is amazing. The requirements (a map quiz, 2 in-claass exams, and section) are very doable. Professor Snyder is by far the best instructor I've had; his lectures are very interesting and peppered with witty jokes and insights. Definitely a must-take!!"
