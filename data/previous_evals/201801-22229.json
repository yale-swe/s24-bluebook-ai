    "We explored different theoretical approaches to 'context' in the traditions of philosophy of language and formal linguistics. We then explored different empirical problems, putting those approaches to test, and finally arrived to the conclusion that we needed a dynamic semantics approach to have a proper treatment of some phenomena.",
