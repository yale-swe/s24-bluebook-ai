    "Various animation skills, how to use different adobe apps to create animations",
    "I learned primarily how to use Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premier, and the Motion panel in Photoshop. I solidified a lot of knowledge about animation principles and how to apply them. This course also opened my eyes to different possibilities and frontiers of animation besides the classic Disney version with which I grew up.",
    "I have technical skills is softwares like Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere that I didn't have before. I also have a greater appreciation for the work art students have to do.",
    "With very limited experience with any sort of animation going into the class, I feel as though I now have a general entry-level understanding to DragonFrame software, Stopmotion, animation in Adobe Photoshop, keyframe manipulation in Adobe Premiere, and the principles of basic animation and moving image art.",
    "Photo-taking, Video production programs. Also screenings of various animated films were inspiring.",
    "I learned how animation works, the basics of photoshop, dragonframe, adobe premiere, final cut, illustrator, and after effects. I learned basic animating techniques, principles, and axioms and a little bit about its history and development."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is a lot of work, and starts very early, but you learn a lot of information if you follow along and take time outside of class to work on the projects.",
    "This course did a good job of showing the different styles of animation. Additionally this course focused a lot on learning software on which to create animation. I wish we could have had more mini animation projects or more collaborative projects so we could have generated more material.",
    "The DMCA hours aren't flexible enough, and that's the only place to work on some of the projects.",
    "The course is immersive in its approach and broad in its scope. You start animating from day one and you cover a lot of ground in the art form over the course of the semester. There are some trade-offs: The workload, while manageable, assumes that you can keep up with the learning curve without a lot of support, and you might find yourself wishing you could have focused on one type of animation more in-depth, rather than getting a surface introduction to many types.",
    "The strength of this course for graduate students is that the students have full authority in what he\/she wants to learn and pursue in this course. If you have a clear idea and vision for what you would like to achieve, this course is great. The course is very self-driven for graduate students, so if you are not self-motivated there won't be much to get out of the class.",
    "Strengths: - Animating is a lot of fun - The feedback Johannes gives you is insightful and thorough. - Johannes is easy to talk to, nonjudgmental, eager to help, and very knowledgeable. - Animating is a lot of fun Weaknesses: - Animating is a LOT of work. Like, if you want your work to look as good as you want it to, you'll either need to be putting in an hour or two of work every day into your projects, or pull about a weeks worth of long late-nighters. To low-ball it. - This class has no grades. Which means you will have no idea how well you're doing in it until the grade comes out January. - The pace the class blows through the software is pretty crazy. Unless you have previous experience with the Adobe cloud software, are a savant, or are actually the kind of perfect student who takes the time outside of class to apply the techniques gone over in class you're liable to forget more than you learn. Google will be your friend as you try to figure out how to do even the most basic things in complex software you've hardly even used before."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend if you have a lot of free time in your schedule and would like to learn a lot about animation",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is willing to put in the work to create a fulfilling animation. If you do not spend the time on these projects, it will neither turn out well nor will it be fulfilling.",
    "If you're interested in animation, definitely. It's a lot of hands on experience.",
    "This course is a good option if you have even the slightest inkling to learn animation: you will not leave disappointed. I took it to fill out my schedule, and because I was curious to rekindle an old hobby, but I was not anticipating the amount of work. There are few assignments, but each demands dozens of hours. If you want an easy A or a schedule filler, look elsewhere. But if you are legitimately curious, give it a shot. It can be really fun.",

Other: - You don't really need to be able to draw to take this class. I can't really, and I came away with something I was really proud of. Animation doesn't have to be beautiful to be compelling, and if you can make your shit abilities look like minimalist intention or style, it can actually work for you. That said if you struggle with even basic tasks like tracing, writing, or drawing basic shapes, you may be forced to lean more heavily on software to do your animating which is a serious challenge in its own right."
