    "I learned a bit about a new subject, although I (and many other people) would likely have preferred to have written about my own research.",
    "I learned a lot about a topic in that particularly fascinates me and practiced my skills at scientific writing, entirely self-directed.",
    "I learned the topic that I wrote my paper on pretty in-depth.",
    "I did not learn much other than how to do a literature review and present my findings of any topic in MB&B.",
    "I completed a literature review of a topic of my interest and got a better understanding of the field of study. Additionally, I presented findings in a final paper and in an oral presentation.",
    "I gained insight into the process of writing a scientific review through this course, which will be a vital skill in my future scientific career. Throughout this course, it was critical to learn how to manage references and synthesis information from a vast breadth of information. I learned a great deal from the senior project about not only the subject I chose but also important skills in reading and writing scientific paper",
    "The ability to take a wonderfully deep dive into the scientific literature on a topic of my choosing, and critique it positively with the intent of synthesizing an original work.",
    "Critically reading recent literature in MB&B",
    "How to write a literature review, do literature search",
    "I became better at scientific writing and synthesizing information. I know a lot more about my topic now!",
    "Learned how to write a literature review and how to read papers critically."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is not much work, which makes for a non-stressful but potentially lackluster 'thesis.' It is nice to be encouraged to study something new, but this isn't the best setting for that.",
    "Strengths: A great opportunity to deeply engage with a topic that you are fascinated with! I am glad that we had the opportunity to do a lit review, which I think was a cool idea because it let me engage the ideas I've learned from my courses in the major in a subject other than my research (which I've had plenty of time to write about\/present) Weaknesses\/Room for improvement: Unless you had a serendipitous pairing, your advisor probably had no idea what your topic was about, and therefore can't really point you in any specific directions. Furthermore, giving most of the students to the same professor prevented him from being able to give useful advice. I think this could be improved if more professors were selected as advisors to only a couple of students, and if pairings were made based on research interests. I also feel that the expectations for the length\/scope of the paper were a bit limited. Honestly, given that this is an entire course, I think it would be reasonable to let students write more than 4000 words and engage deeply with several papers rather than mostly focusing on a single paper - after all, this is the culmination of our studies in MB&B!",
    "I honestly think the senior project should provide the opportunity for people to write about their own research; but, barring that, it's set up pretty well. There are benchmarks throughout the semester, so you can't just leave it all to the last minute and get super stressed like some senior projects end up being like.",
    "This course is a good idea because it lets MB&B students discover and write about a topic that they otherwise didn't know. However, I think this course would be greatly improved if we could have public presentations about our senior project as the other majors do. It may be useful to have some lab research in this as well. MCDB has a year-long project and i think that this bio major should as well have a research component.",
    "A major weakness of the course is the required presentations at the end. The presentations took over five hours and we were required to sit in the room and be engaged with every student's presentation. It would make much more sense to require a poster presentation than an oral presentation for the sake of time and sanity. Furthermore, I think a major weakness of this course compared to other majors is the fact that the thesis is a literature review and not a research project. Students should have the right to write up the research they've been doing for years in a thesis rather than a literature review, and for students who don't participate in research (which is very few), they should have the option of doing the literature review instead.",
    "While it is a fairly freeform and self-directed class, the advisors are very overburdened and their accessibility is constrained essentially to the times of draft submission and final review, with little direction in between. Having a greater number of advisors would make a great difference for accountability as well as for the quality of the final product.",
    "Strengths- the assignment is unique, due date structure encourages working throughout the term Weaknesses- very little faculty mentor guidance, could allow for longer papers and\/or presentations",
    "Opportunity for independent work",
    "Strengths: deadlines are good Weaknesses: the draft being due after spring break is really tough",
    "The MB&B department should really change the way senior project advisors are matched\/chosen. This is a major that challenges you thoroughly throughout your time at Yale, and to have a capstone project that is not meant to be taken as seriously or as a break from the major is a disservice to the students that have decided to stick with MB&B. This change can start by either allowing students to choose their advisors and\/or having more advisors available to mentor students. Professor Soll wasn't able to supply meaningful advice or things to read, and I believe much of that is due to the fact that he had 17 students to advise. While it is understood by all the MB&B seniors that this project is meant to be our own and that we are the experts in this area, it still behooves students to have other opinions and other people reading their drafts to create the best thesis possible. I strongly feel that the MB&B department should increase support for students as they complete their theses.",
    "Strength: got to explore a new subfield in depth. My mentor was really helpful, and it was great to have an opportunity to really dig into new material. Weakness: the course often felt isolated\/atomized. It might be helpful to have some sort of formal peer editing process."

    "You probably don't have much of a choice if you're taking this course, but you'll definitely enjoy it and have the ability to take a deep dive into a topic that's close to your heart. Don't be afraid to reach out to your advisor regularly about your topic, and get invested in it!",

Also really try to work on the draft during spring break!",
