    "(Regarding the TA question, I realize that we did have a TA, and Ali is great in general, I just didn't happen to consult him for this class, hence the N\/A)",
    "As compared to classes at the School of Management, this courses took a much closer look at the empirical studies in the field and allowed us to dive much deeper into the material.",
    "I really learnt a lot on this classes. Even though it was at 8.30 on a Monday morning it was really worth it. The classes were very interesting, the professor was very nice and he was able to make the class interesting and we could participate a lot in the class discussion. He also provided coffee!! (every Monday).",

    "Going into the detail of academic papers, to be able to identify the strengths\/shortcomings of a paper.Very good facilitation of class discussions.",
    "I can't say enough good things about this course.The four short papers initially don't seem like anything different than other assignments for other courses, but the guide that Professor Gollin gave us really made us think about why the authors made the choices they did, and whether or not those were good choices. It really provoked deep thinking about the articles. I'd encourage other students to really take these papers seriously and follow the line of questioning Gollin proposes in his guide. It was hugely beneficial for me.The two assignments were also good, flexible enough to allow you to explore what you're interested in within the boundaries of the course.",
    "To become familiar with how to understand the empirical papers.",
    "The professor. Doug Gollin is clearly very knowledgeable, engaged and invested in the students gaining something important through this course. He was organized and designed a really productive semester.",
    "the readings, and the discussions of these in class. very intellectually stimulating.",
    "The open discussions in class were the best thing about this course. They allowed me to clarify the readings and lecture material and to better understand how to tackle the assignments.",
    "good instructor; interesting topics; very empirical\/econometric approach to the topics (which I don't get in many other classes)",
    "How the class is structure. The topics, how we discussed in class and of course Prof. Gollin, that he was really good at explaining and making the class really interesting and fun at the same time.",
    "The reading response assignments were a great way to dissect an academic paper and really understand it...",
    "Learn important topics in the junction of environment and development. Reading was heavy but it was so valuable and I learned a lot out of it!",
    "Prfessor's Gollin discussion and reading's selections.",
