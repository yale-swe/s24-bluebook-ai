   "comments": [
    "It is not an easy course. There are opportunities to ask for help but overall if you are looking to get a QR credit, this one is difficult.",
    "Great class that teaches how everyday electronics work- make sure you go to class as there is no textbook.",
    "I would recommend it - if you are interested in how stuff works, are willing to go to the class, and put some work into the class.Also fi you like physics a little.",
    "I would only recommend if you understand the necessary basics. I would also encourage everyone to make use of Professor Henrich's time. Your grades may not be spectacular, but if you go to him and show that you're interested and trying really hard and get to know him then it will help in the long run.",
    "Yes, this class is awesome. Aside from the first midterm being really hard, it is amazing. It is interesting, the prof is sweet, and the homework is very manageable.",
    "Take this class for a QR, but go to every lecture and pay attention. Keep up with the work. It's not something you can catch up on all at once.",
    "Good course for start",
    "Yes. Amazing class. Not difficult.",
    "People say this is an easy class. With very little background in Physics, I found this to be a huge challenge. I would advise that you only take this class if you have a background in the syllabus, as it is a broad course that brings in a lot of concepts; if all of these concepts are new, you will find it tough...",
    "I would recommend this class if you need a QR, and are bad at math. You still have to work, I would not call it a gut, but its easier than calculus and the material is more interesting.",
    "Learn how things work. Stuff is explained pretty well and you cover a lot of ground.",
    "Mostly covers physics that do not need advanced math. Make sure you keep up with lecture (don't know how you would do the problem sets without attending lecture) and keep track of the conceptual stuff. The topics are real-life applications, though I can't say they help me DO anything in real life.",
    "It was a challenging but very interesting course.",
    "i would not really recomend this class if you do not like physics",
    "If you have a physics background it will be pretty easy. That said, you have to go to class because the material is so varied and product specific that the class is the only way to find the information needed to solve the psets in most cases.",
    "I would recommend this if you have a basic background in physics.",
    "It's like a \"How Stuff Works\" class, but with a slightly less informative narrator than the one on TV.",
    "this is a pretty good class, but its pretty difficult if you're not a science person. since there is no textbook, you need to go to every class to do the problem sets.",
    "This course can be both fun and challenging. The first part of the course addresses physics concepts you may have seen in high school, but the rest primarily focuses on technological applications. Professor Henrich is very approachable: he holds office hours the day before problem sets are due (which help a lot) and is always willing to answer any questions you may have. If you want to take a science class that will teach you cool everyday applications, you should take \"The Technological World.\"",
    "If you have a good grip on physics basics, its a interesting course. I have to think that there is an easier way to get a QR or science credit.",
    "Recommended. You'll understand daily technologies much better.",
    "One word: STIMULATING. So many come to YALE premed not knowing if they actually want to follow the track. So many take multivariable calc, serious biology and chemistry courses. What this class does that those do not is open up your mind to what you can do if you follow the track. It was so interesting to learn how everyday objects work. It made me really interested in pursuing a math\/science background--so much more than any boring math or science class I have taken before.",
    "You should take this class if you took physics in high school and are looking for an easy qr\/sci. If you didn't take physics in high school this will be a lot more work for you and I don't recommend it.",
    "Very good class for a non-science major who is not afraid of doing some math for a Sc credit- really interesting real-world science applications.",
    "Class has a reputation as a gut, but it's not THAT easy. If you've taken high school physics, the first half of the course is all review. Second half is a little trickier - if you don't put in at least some time, you won't know the answers to the sometimes random and obscure questions Henrich asks on tests. Still a great way to get a Sc or QR credit, very friendly grade distribution (60% of class gets A's or A-'s). Weekly problem sets that are not particularly hard, two hour exams, and a final. Friendly grading policy - if you do badly on one of the midterms, it only counts 5%.",
    "It is NOT a gut course. Unless you're interested in Physics already and\/or have a quantitative mind, this is not something you want. The professor doesn't explain how to do problems - he explains concepts and expects you to understand how to apply them without helping at all. I regret taking this class.",
    "Awful. Absolutely awful.",
    "Tech World uses relatively simple physics to explain technological phenomena that seemed pretty complicated to me (LCD displays, antennae, x-ray photography, etc.). It was harder than other gut sciences I've taken - but then again, I didn't really put in enough time. I took AP Physics in high school and did well; I can't imagine how hard this course would be without high school physics. Go to Henrich for help - he's awesome, incredibly patient and helpful, when you arrange to meet him one-on-one.",
    "Pretty good way to do a SC credit because the material is occasionally really interesting. The textbook isn't necessary, but it might be worth it if you haven't done real science for a while.",
    "The class provides simple explanations for technology that we use everyday. Those explanations are simple enough to understand, and if there are any problems, questions are welcome. As long as a student is comfortable with stoichiometry, algebra, and other basic math, the course should not present a great difficulty. I would highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they can handle the material.",
    "An awesome course. People characterize it as a gut, but actually, you have to pay close attention to the lectures otherwise you'll miss out on a key point and you won't be able to understand anything else afterwards. I also loved the feeling of leaving class with a clearly defined new chunk of knowledge--it's something Yale's humanities often can't provide. Personally, besides paying close attention during lecture and scrawling all over the handouts Professor Henrich provides, I'd recommend going to the TA help sessions. Although I felt very confident about the material, I always had a few questions about the p-set and the help sessions were perfect for clearing these up and cementing my understanding of the material.",
    "I love this class. Best science credit for anyone who is QR-inclined. If you remember AP Physics from high school, this class will be a breeze. There is no textbook for the class, Prof Henrich lectures off a blackboard and powerpoint and gives handouts; these materials plus your notes are all the info for the course. Therefore, you\u0092ll be in a tight spot if you ever fall asleep during lecture as you\u0092ll probably have no idea what happened.Henrich spends up the to the first midterm covering all the basic electromagnetism you\u0092ll need for the rest of the class. This is the hardest part of the class for most kids that never took physics in high school (it still amazes me that kids manage to get into Yale without taking physics). Then he spends the rest of the semester using these principles to explain how LCD tv\u0092s, GPS, radio antennas, and a bunch of other cool stuff work. You learn some pretty neat things on how basic technology works, this was probably my most enjoyable class this semester.",
    "The Technological World is not a gut course, although it may have that reputation. The tests are difficult, especially since the test problems are unlike those we covered in the homework problem sets or in class. The majority of the topics deal with physics. Although Professor Henrich says that a student does not need to have ever taken a physics course to take the Technological World, it would be difficult to keep up with the physics in the first month of the semester if one had no prior knowledge or understanding of physics. I would recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in the science behind everyday technology.",
    "Substantial course in physics\/technology. I wouldn't say it's a gut course unless you are super smart, but it's definitely a manageable course. I enjoyed it very much, and I think studying for it on a weekly basis definitely helps because each week builds on one another.",
    "NOT AN EASY CLASS. The death of me. Too much work to be dealt with in one semester.",
    "This class is actually really hard. There is no textbook and the concepts are difficult if you have never taken physics\/aren't particularly strong in the realms of math\/science. Please be prepared to be confused. You will be fine, however, if you make the extra effort to schedule meetings with Prof Henrich and talk with him one on one. He is very helpful and open with students, especially one on one.",
    "Good class, I took it Cr\/D and really enjoyed it. It was super interesting if you are into that sort of thing, and not a lot of work outside of the weekly problem sets (they took about 2-3 hours on average). The grade dist is pretty generous, in my understanding, so this might be a good class for Sc distributional credit.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend APHY 110.",
    "Take it if you're a non-science major. It's not too difficult as long as you do the work. You have to go to the lectures, but they're interesting. A great \"How Stuff Works\" class.",
    "I'd recommend it, but like everybody says, it's not that much of a gut. It requires attention and work. But the problem sets didn't take long to do--I'd finish it during the 1.5 hours that section went for, and the TFs were really helpful in getting it done. However, the midterms required work, and everybody did really badly on the first one, and better on the second one. Also was really important to do the supplementary reading--looking overthe prof's answers to the problem sets and the reading in the physics textbook. But the material was really interesting--it's about how stuff works, and uses basic physics. Both fun!",
    "Great and easy science credit",
    "Great class, not as easy as you might think but soooooooo interesting!",
    "YES if you get basic physics or if you are willing to pay attention and class and work a bit. The teacher kinda makes it worth it.",
    "A good sc or qr credit that isn't too grounded in hard science. It isn't really a cohesive class either. It is a bunch of lectures on cool gadgets\/light bulb like stuff.",
    "Fantastic. Very practical course, not too challenging but very rewarding if you put in a little work, and Henrich is the man. If you want a science credit that is actually enriching and fascinating, then look no further (as long as Henrich is still teaching it)."
