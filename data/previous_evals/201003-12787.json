   "comments": [
    "Interesting lectures and survey course on dreams in literature. Don't expect to come to any earth-shattering conclusions though",
    "I thought it was a little boring. But if you are really interested in reading Freud and about dreams in fictional plays then this is the class for you.",
    "Yes! It's a very interesting topic and it's a class you'll look forward to every week.",
    "Highly recommend. This class is as much an exploration of oneself as an analysis of the literature on the subject of dreams.",
    "I loved the course. I wish there was more emphasis on the last section with freud and the readings after him, but I really enjoyed all of it. Prof. North gives wonderful essay feedback and is a wonderful resource if you go to him to talk about the course materials or the essays.",
    "A survey course on dreams in the Western tradition, starting with the Greeks and the Bible and ending with Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. Take it if you've taken Directed Studies or have otherwise obtained a passing familiarity with the thinkers in the syllabus - otherwise, you'll just be spending all your time getting broadly acquainted with each. Ideas presented in the course get a bit redundant and \"mushy,\" which is frustrating - there's little text-based close analysis. Shop the class and take it only if you like Professor North's teaching style.",
    "A fantastic survey course about the discourse surrounding dreams over the course of Western Philosophical and literary history. A great class!"
