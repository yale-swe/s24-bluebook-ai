    "intellectual history to the core, beware, do not take if this is something you are very interested in.For most students I would not recommend this course because it is not history, the readings are dense and can be difficult and you must be very interested in a topic that does not really have answers. I think I would recommend other history courses over this one, but that is more because of the material than anything else- this course probably was good for a certain person looking to learn\/do something that I was not- not the right course for me.Would also be better if you know something about British history or have a ton of time to dedicate to this course to learn more. Readings would make more sense that way.",
    "This is an intellectually stimulating course for anyone who wishes to know more about Britain or the British. The course material covers a wide range of sources, from political history to social history, so be assured to gain ample exposure from this course."
