   "comments": [
    "The class itself was a positive experience, but I would recommend it only to those seriously interested in the environmental engineering major. I don't have any experience with other intro engineering classes, but perhaps if you're really looking primarily for a deep introduction to design thinking in general it would be worth comparing what other intro engineering classes may have to offer, as well. I really benefitted a lot from the class, though, and would recommend it to those interested in issues of sustainability and industrial processes to remediate pollution.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. If you're not an engineering major, take it Cr\/D and you will cruise through and love it. It really changes the way you look at environmental issues and the world.",
    "Introduction to Environmental Engineering is a gem of a course. I am pretty far from a science major, and have taken neither chemistry nor math at Yale, but the course was still eminently doable and enjoyable. The first third is a review of chemistry, some of which was new to me; the second is a dive into the basics of environmental engineering, focusing on reactors and water treatment; the third is a less math-heavy unit on the frontiers of modern green chemistry. I learned quite a lot, and while I wouldnt call the course easy, there was plenty of help and guidance from the T.F.s and professors and opportunities for extra credit. A great class for science and non-science majors alike.",
    "You'll learn a lot about water. The class is fairly graded. I would recommend it if you're interested in water, but if you really want to see if you want to do ENVE as a major, talk to people in the major or go to Club ENVE. The class isn't as much of a survey as promised.",
    "Yes, it will open your eyes to some important issues.",
    "Great introduction to the topic! I would definitely recommend this course! It's a great opportunity to learn about such a pressing issue.",
    "ENVE is a great class regardless of weather you are interested in the ENVE major or not. (I know it can count for EVST as well and could offer a nice science base of ideas). It taught my a lot about the field of environmental engineering and opened my eyes to many of the issues engineers work on today. I would certainly recommend reading the book (at least Zimmerman's) to follow along with lectures as things can be presented in slightly different ways and the reading helped me clarify and review things on a number of occasions.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in how the environment works and more specifically, how different environmental engineering systems function in the world today. The class specifically focuses on wastewater treatment but covers a range of other topics as well from energy to air pollution to basic chemistry.",
    "This is an amazing course and if you actually care about learning something in science take it!! But be ware it is a lot of work, especially if you took chemistry and calculus in high school and it has been a while.",
    "It's intro chemistry but with an emphasis on how to use it for pragmatic purposes, such as evaluating cancer risk and the breakdown of chemicals in rivers over time. Interesting material overall and well-taught. I'd recommend it to any potential ENVE majors, students interested in \\environmental issues or anyone looking for a more serious science credit.",
    "It's an accessible class but it's definitely not a gut. Doable and useful for both engineering and non-engineering majors.",
    "I would recommend it to another student! It's first required for all Environmental Engineering majors anyway, but even if you are not an environmental engineering major, it's worth taking if you need a science credit. It requires a little bit of science background, but you can pick it up in the class if you don't have much. It provides good perspective on a lot of society's current problems with a new view on how to do environmental engineering.",
    "Take it if you're curious about the basics of environmental engineering, though it's really mostly useful for environmental engineering majors.",
    "The first half of the semester was basically an intro chemistry class. I was expecting more discussion and less problem solving overall. Also, the only time we talked about green design was the last class-- was hoping we would have done more.",
    "Take this class if you care about the world.",
    "The course was a good intro to Environmental Engineering, but was fairly basic in its scope. Although it is, apparently, more forward thinking than most environmental engineering courses, it mainly deals with sustainability and environmental management, instead of the creation and use of new systems (in addition), such as renewable energy. The course was a good intro and can be taken by people who are even tentatively interested in the subject (it is expanisve, but the grading is easy).",
    "This is not the most interesting class in the world, but it's easy, and is apparently a prerequisite for the more interesting ones that are available later. There is a fair amount of AP Chemistry involved, so if you didn't do chemistry much in high school or college you may find it more difficult. If you work at it it shouldn't be hard to get an A at all. However, it's not a very satisfying class: most of what you learn is fairly trivial, and the tests are made more difficult by asking the same questions repeatedly in varied and confusing ways. Not the best class, but not awful. Possible an easy STEM credit too.",
    "It is an ok course. The problem sets are pretty interesting. Nothing groundbreakingly cool.",
    "ENAS 120 teaches students how to think critically and quantitatively about environmental issues and prevention of pollution. The topic is highly relevant to all fields since environmental issues are becoming increasingly pressing and defining to our lives. The class covers topics ranging from pollution mitigation to disruptive innovation to life cycle analysis, and it arms students with the tools necessary to critically evaluate options from an environmental perspective.",
    "ENVE 120 is an introduction to environmental engineering with a strong focus on chemistry. It is a good course, though not great. The material is interesting and explores a wide variety of topics."
