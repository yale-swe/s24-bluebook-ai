    "This is a very chill senior seminar. Three assignments, reading every week is one book of PL plus a secondary reading or two. Final paper is only ten pages. Karan is really smart and pretty fun, plus his assignments will teach you a ton about reading attentively and thinking about literature, especially if you haven't taken his 201 class. Note that this class is more like a small lecture than a seminar.",
    "Yeppp, take it. Even if you're not that big on Milton, take it. Kastan will make it fun for you. The timing will be brutal, of course; for some reason, he really likes that 9.25. But take it regardless, especially if you don't like boring, snooty pre-1800s. This is probably the best one out there!",
    "Milton's Paradise Lost was by far my favorite class I've taken at Yale. It was challenging, enlightening, and most of all really fun. I came into the course not knowing who Milton was, and left with an appreciation for the sheer depth of symbolism, meaning, and literary references comprising the epic poem. Through the close-knit classroom structure and the specific, yet pointedly ambiguous writing assignments, Professor Kastan gave us the opportunity to explore the space of interpretive possibility. Writing the final paper on Chaos, especially, I found myself digging deeper into Milton's cosmology than I ever could have imagined - and yet there were so many more literary references I wish I had had more time to comprehend. I chose to take Milton's Paradise Lost because I needed a writing credit and I wanted to challenge myself. But it became so much more to me than just a WR. I came to feel truly excited every time I found a hidden gem in the text. I am a physics major, but Professor Kastan inspired me to continue taking English courses at Yale!",
    "Fantastic class. This is the third course in which I have read Paradise Lost and it just keeps getting better. Milton demands a course like this in which you can actually give the text the time it demands. The papers are tough but also so fun to write.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for another student interested in paradise lost.",
    "The class was fantastic, one of the best I've taken (and probably the only one for which I would wake up at 9 am). Professor Kastan is the best professor at Yale; I learned an incredible amount each morning and was always engaged. I couldn't recommend it more."
