    "a good lab",
    "One of the chiller labs. You'll learn new lab techniques and be shocked at how ridiculously unfair and hard the TAs will grade you.",
    "Pretty good compared to gen chem lab.",
    "I would recommend Chem 122 01 to another student, because the focus is on learning new techniques. Each lab is several classes long, so that we can focus not on writing the post lab, but on practicing distillation or IR or reflux. A really nice course, even if labs do meet for a four hour block every week.",
    "It's a lab course... you will learn how to run reactions with special equipment.",
    "Surprisingly, orgo lab was a much harder course than I had imagined. I actually spent way more time on EP's and postlabs than I wanted to - part of the reason was that my TA graded pretty harshly. Don't take this class unless you're a premed - but then again, you knew that already.",
    "This course is interesting and fun for those who like doing experiments in a lab, and the workload is completely manageable.",
    "This is a great lab course to introduce you to the fundamental techniques that are used by organic chemists. If you are at all interested in medicine, pharmaceutical making or just a chemistry junkie you should definitely take this lab.",
    "This lab is definitely easier than general chemistry labs, so in that since it's not bad. The only bad part was the final exam, which covered material not explicitly taught in the lab.",
    "No one takes this course except for as a req, but it was an informative class.",
    "Super boring class. Take only if you must.",
    "It's not the most brilliant class you will take, but it's solid.",
    "A great lab course, the environment is laid-back and supportive (basically the opposite of gen chem lab). The experiments are interesting and you can learn a lot from them. The final is multiple choice. DiMeglio makes sure that the expectations are known, she is a very professor, when she is walking around the lab she always makes a point to stop and talk to students and see how they're doing.",
    "The labs you do in this course helps you understand organic chemistry better. Not too much work, usually done within three hours if you come to lab prepared. No more titrations, so much more interesting. If you're taking orgo and have time, I strongly recommend taking this lab.",
    "Hopefully you're taking this concurrently with Orgo, or after it. It will be a bit time consuming to write the reports, but if you follow the instructions strictly, you'll do well. Details, details, details. Also, you'll learn a lot of cool techniques, so take this if you want to do any sort of lab work.",
    "It's chill, take it.",
    "Orgo lab is SO MUCH MORE AWESOME than gen chem lab!!! If you're taking this class you're probably a chem major or a premed or a MBB major, in which case you either completely enjoy the subject or you can't stand it, but if you're in the latter group, this class is still well-organized and not so much of a pain as people can make lab classes out to be. Keep your chin up and enjoy being able to play scientist and have really fun conversations with your lab mates and work together and work efficiently and be on top of your shit while you're in lab, but most importantly PICK DAN AS YOUR TA he's super duper awesome.",
    "A requirement for pre-meds but you learn a lot. Make sure to pay attention to what you're actually doing during experiments or it'll bite you in the butt during the final (speaking from experience).",
    "I doubt that many people want to take 222L for fun, but honestly this course is not bad in the slightest. Workload is very light (only one full lab report and several partial ones, along with short prelab assignments), but the course is very informative and teaches the techniques well.",
    "Your typical lab class. Weekly experiments, a few lab reports, and a not-too-bad multiple choice final at the end of the semester.",
    "Well-structured course that makes it easy for anyone to get started with organic chemistry labs. The post-lab assignments can be slightly frustrating since there is significant emphasis on format and on details. Still, it has been a positive and informative experience on the whole.",
    "It's a lot more fun than gen chem lab.",
    "One of the best labs I've ever taken. Very well structured and organized. Workload is much less than gen chem lab - you're usually out of the lab by 3 or 3.30pm every day. Dr DiMeglio and the TAs are great - all really nice and helpful. Excellent introduction to techniques in the organic lab.",
    "As someone who usually hates lab courses, I didn't hate this course. It makes orgo lab a painless experience. The experiments really augmented my understanding of the material, and typically they didn't take up the whole lab time (I spent on average probably 2.5 hours in the lab every week out of the 4.5). Be warned - this course has weekly experimental plans (1-2 hours each), 3 lab reports (5-8 hours each), and a straightforward final exam. It's about the same amount of work as a regular yale course (as indicated by the reviews), so don't let the 0.5 credit fool you when planning out your workload for the year.",
    "Yes. Not only is it required for a lot of majors and for premed, it is really helpful to take the lab while taking organic chemistry. Some of the concepts align and it is useful having hand on experience with some of the concepts learned in class.",
    "If you're taking lab, you probably have to take lab. It's a ton of busy work and assignments are graded in the most nit-picky ways, so brace yourself.",
    "A class that meets once a week for 2-3 hours, depending on how fast you work on the lab for that week. You learn a good amount of lab techniques, and professor DiMeglio is an awesome professor who's eager to answer any questions you might have during the lab or outside it. Definitely recommend in conjunction with an orgo class, but you could take this after and still be in a good spot, I think.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHEM 222L to another student. It made me like chem lab again after a not as positive experience in CHEM 117L.",
    "Standard organic lab, useful for any student who is looking at chemistry or research, but not an incredibly fun or enriching course.",
    "I enjoyed this course.",
    "I mean, it's orgo lab so you probably know the deal.",
    "A decent introduction to laboratory techniques, this class should not be hard for anyone interested in chemistry that has a decent grasp\/is awake during organic lecture. The most serious problem with this class is the variable and unfair grading that occurs with TFs. I unfortunately had a terrible TF and had an unfavorable experience where my grades were not reflective of my work. There are clear formatting guidelines that are published that I think are fair and a good framework, but, again, it all boils down to if your TF follows them. On the other hand, professor DiMeglio is great. Any problems with TFs can be ameliorated by talking to her. As long as you know what you are talking about and approach her humbly asking for her help, I have experience\/heard of nothing but good results. Grading: fair; Workload: low to moderate (expect a little more time spent on formatting than desirable); Knowledge: good widespread exposure to important concepts. -He who shall not be named",
    "So much easier than Gen Chem lab. Just do it, it's really not that bad. We were often out in 2 hours.",
    "I took CHEM 222L in concordance with CHEM 220. The actual labs are fun, the grading definitely depends on your TA.",
    "Orgo lab is 100000% better than gen chem lab. Dr. DiMeglio is absolutely wonderful and the experiments actually relate to what you learn in lecture. Also, no prelab quizzes or weekly lab reports, which is always a plus.",
    "Fun, but not a class Id recommend.",
    "I would recommend CHEM222L to another student who needs to take organic chemistry lab as a requisite course. It has a relaxed atmosphere in the lab (labs never took the full 4 hour slot), but also requires a lot of work on the post-lab assignments.",
    "I would recommend the class to those who are interested in organic chemistry. Even if it isn't used towards credit for a major, it's still a good way to learn the chemical techniques commonly used in research. Very rewarding class, but also quite difficult.",
    "Chem 222L is an easy course, as long as you follow the directions given in the course packet. The concepts are easy to understand and if you have any difficulties, the teaching assistant and professor are always there to help. Do remember, however, that the easiness of this course does not indicate the easiness of the lecture course. Overall, I loved Chem 222L, and I loved learning about chemistry in that class.",
    "Not a high pressure class at all, I would recommend it for the experience.",
    "Chem 222L is an excellent organic lab course. You get to work on your own on your own experiments at your own pace. The experiments you perform are really cool, and you're not wasting your time like gen chem doing basic, rudimentary tasks. You actually get to synthesize chemicals from other compounds, and applying a bunch of lab techniques. I actually looked forward to lab each day I had it.",
    "It's a lot of fun. Post Lab's are kinda tricky however.",
    "Intro to Orgo Lab was a great lab to take. They allot four hours to the class but you'll only stay the whole time maybe once; if you're reasonably efficient and careful, most labs will take you four hours max. Grading varies by TF some are lenient, others will make you cry. But you shouldn't worry since the curve is based on each individual TF. Also, the wok outside of class isn't too much. The EPs get annoying because they're time-consuming but they aren't hard. The reports and the final are manageable too.",
    "CHEM 222L is a very basic introduction to organic chemistry in the lab -- it takes the time in the beginning to teach some simple lab methods and how to use typical orgo lab equipment. None of the lab projects\/experiments are particularly challenging, but some of the post lab assignment questions are more detail-oriented and can take some more time answering. Overall, however, the course isn't very time-consuming, as long as you don't procrastinate until the night before to prepare, which can be very tempting to do.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 222 to another student. If a student has to fulfill a chemistry lab requirement, this is an excellent lab with which to do so. This course helps those new to laboratory techniques and also teaches many of the techniques used in real working labs while working with organic substances.",
    "Fun class, would recommend. Grading can be really irritating when you understand everything but lose points for dumb reasons, but I think it all works out in the end.",
    "not very enjoyable",
    "CHEM 222L allows students to conduct practical chemistry research skills such as vacuum filtration and TLC. In terms of workload, it is not exactly 1 credit's worth of work, but it also should be slightly more than just half a credit, because of the great amount of work required in preparing lab reports. This varies from student to student--I personally had to work a very long time to get all the formatting and nuances of questions correct in postlabs and EPs.",
    "A chill lab course. You are not by any means graded on yield, so it's a very low-stress course. Experimental plans and lab write-ups take a good amount of time, but that's a reality for any lab course. Probably one of the chillest lab courses out there.",
    "CHEM 222L, I think, is a pretty good class to start college laboratory classes. The courseload level is okay, especially since there is only one class per week. However, one must be ready to do plenty of preparatory work before a class, slightly different from usual classes that have more after-class work.",
    "Chem 222L is a great lab course that is a must take. One will learn how to carefully read instructions and synthesize information from various sources to compile a professional lab report. This course will prepare students well for another semester of Organic Chemistry Lab.",
    "Good class to take for interested students who are self-motivated enough to learn about the labs themselves despite the grading being very much based on formatting.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because it's required. It could certainly be worse.",
    "As far as my experience with labs goes, I would recommend this lab over all the Gen Chem and Chem 118 labs. If you're new to college labs in general things might be a little hard in the beginning, especially since grading tends to make a big emphasis on small particulars of format, but overall all you have are short weekly pre-experiment write-ups (mostly just procedure) and there is only one full lab report in the entire semester. The labs are interesting, and the TFs and Professor DiMeglio are always open for questions.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 222L to any student interested in gaining a hands-on experience performing different experiments pertaining to Organic Chemistry and in learning about the different techniques that can be applied to research in the subject.",
    "Only take this if you have to. That being said, it is much better than Gen-Chem Lab.",
    "Chem 222L is a fine course, but it can be a lot work at times for a half-credit course. The experimental procedures get repetitive and annoying to write while the post-labs take a long time to write. The exam is only annoying because they give you all these practice questions--some of which are unclear--and expect you to go ask your TA's for the answers. I do not understand why they can't just post the answers. Overall though, the class isn't too bad for a required class and it really depends on your TA. Professor Dimeglio is very nice, and is great at responding to e-mails.",
    "If you had a bad experience with general chemistry lab and are hesitant about this class, erase those fears. This lab course is a different world from gen chem lab, and well worth it. Dr. DiMeglio is an amazing professor, and actually takes the effort to get to know each student despite the large amount of students in each section. The TA staff is more than just competent, and none of my friends had any complaints about theirs. The labs are not incredibly difficult, and are more focused on learning techniques and chemical background, as opposed to the high-pressure focus on yield that was so standard in general chemistry. Be warned, lab reports in this class, while not as frequent as they were in general chemistry, are a monster of their own, but you'll work up to the level expected by the end of the course.",
    "Organic chemistry lab is fun, simple, and largely intuitive. It provides a nice contrast to lecture in that way. It's much more fun and low-maintenance than general chemistry lab.",
    "Most people take Chem 22L because they have to (either for a major or premed requirements). That being said, chem 222L is WAY more laid back than gen chem lab and actually ends up being pretty fun. Not at all stressful but try not to leave the post labs until the last minute.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is very manageable and fair even with a heavy course schedule.",
    "A standard lab course that reinforces lab skills.",
    "Take it only if you have to, it's a pretty standard lab.",
    "I didn't have to take this class, but I'm glad I did because I feel like I learned a lot about chemistry and I was impressed by the support of the teaching staff in the lab.",
    "MUCH BETTER THAN GEN CHEM LAB! The labs were always interesting and although the lab notes were a bit annoying, there isn't much tedious work.",
    "At times the grading of this lab seemed somewhat skewed, which could be frustrating. The material covered by the course was not very difficult, and focus seemed to be on proper lab-report writing and formatting as well as learning lab techniques.",
    "Pretty good intro orgo lab. Not too much work (relative to gen chem lab), and not too difficult. The reactions didn't really go along with what we were learning in lecture until towards the end of the semester, but the reactions weren't that difficult to understand anyways. If you mess up in front of Prof. DiMeglio, she can be kind of intimidating, but you mainly only interact with your TAs anyways, who are usually laid back and fun to talk to.",
    "Only take if necessary for your major or premed requirements. Does not help with CHEM 220. Would not recommend if this is not required for you.",
    "It's not bad and you probably have to take it.",
    "Organic chemistry lab was possibly the best part of organic chemistry! Lab enhanced the concepts covered in lecture, but it was also fun and low-stress.",
    "If you're taking Organic Chemistry, absolutely take this lab. It puts into practice techniques learned in section and helps the reactions make sense. The PLs are definitely difficult, but they help you to better understand what you actually did in lab.",
    "This lab is the light at the end of the tunnel for students still in general chemistry labs. It's fair, exciting, and interesting, with far less stress than gen chem.",
    "Good course that complements Organic Chemistry; I would suggest it to any student taking organic chemistry (even if not required). Criticism of the course lies in the vastly different grading policies of TA's.",
    "Yeah its a fine lab.",
    "By far, the best chemistry lab at Yale. Dr. DiMeglio is the best.",
    "This lab is very helpful, not too much work, and nice to take in tandem with the Organic Chemistry lecture.",
    "A fine lab course that you have to take in addition to orgo. Just something you gotta do.",
    "Some cool experiments but would definitely not recommend unless required by a major or Premed.",
    "A four-hour long lab session really isn't as bad as it sounds. We got out in 2-3 hours on average. And doing the actual labs was fun! Preparing before and after lab does take quite a long time though. Probably my heaviest courseload.",
    "Chem 222 was better than i expected. I enjoyed it much more than the gen. chem. lab. The labs were shorter and genuinely more interesting. I felt the material was relevant to the lecture class and very interesting.",
    "The lab itself is fun, but the outside work is very stressful because the grading is so particular.",
    "Of the chemistry labs, I would definitely recommend this one. It is very well organized and well taught by instructors who are friendly and helpful.",
    "CHEM 222L Is a introductory course to organic chemical techniques and protein manipulation. I would highly recommend it to peers.",
    "This class isn't bad for a lab at all - it's much less work than the general chemistry lab, and much more relaxed. Dr. Dimeglio is very sweet and walks around asking if you need anything. There are no chairs in the lab, and you are encouraged to work efficiently so you can leave early. You will rarely be there for the full four hours. Unlike some labs, you are not graded on the results you obtain, which really takes the pressure off! Did you get a 10% yield with a ton of impurities? No problem - just make sure you can explain why that happened on the post lab assignment. Give real reasons, though, and explain them - \"human error\" does not count as a reason! The grading can be harsh in a somewhat nitpicky way - on the first couple of EPs and post labs, you will definitely lose some points for minor formatting errors. (For example, make sure you follow the Example EP format, and don't forget the day of the week or anything like that. Refer to the Course Packet and Science Writing for the Organic Lab for formatting guidance). Don't worry if this happens - it's really annoying, but it won't affect your overall grade too much. Don't bother contesting the grade, no matter how trivial it seems, and just remember not to make the same mistake again. The final post lab, IR assignment, and final exam are the vast majority of your grade anyway."
