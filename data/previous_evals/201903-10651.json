   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Although it was a bit annoying to meet everyday, we were able to very effectively cover the material. The textbook and workbook were both useful. Weekly quizzes were helpful for keeping us on top of studying. Weaknesses: There was was seemed to be an excessive amount of homework. I understand (and admittedly somewhat agree with) its usefulness, but at the end of the semester it was difficult to manage. All in all, though, that's a fairly minor complaint and something I wouldn't actually expect to be changed.",
    "This course is very fast paced and allots the same amount of time per concept not matter the difficulty. This makes it very difficult when whizzing through so much. In class, mostly the concepts are taught and then you're left by yourself to summarize them and apply the. This course could be improved by changing the amounts of time the instructors choose to go over things, like subjunctives and clauses. At the beginning of the course there were daily quizzes and daily in-depth homework checks that were tough but encouraged growth in learning; however these stopped and we stopped getting constant feed back. Since you cannot speak in Latin, it is a lot harder to cement concepts, so there is a lot of homework."

    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a language that is challenging but interesting.",
    "Certainly, though from conversations with other students, the instructor you get can make a big difference. So, I suppose, I would recommend the course if Joe (or someone who could do an equally good job) were teaching.",
    "No, Latin is interesting but doesn't have many applications and this course is a lot of work. I would recommend a spoken language.",
    "Only if they have a specific interest in classics or Roman history. The course is enough work to make someone reconsider taking it on a whim."
