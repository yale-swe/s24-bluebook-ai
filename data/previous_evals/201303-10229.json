    "I would summarize it as learning derivatives and their applications as well as touching on integrals. I would recommend this course to another student as it is very comprehensive and the applications are useful.",
    "Equivalent to Calc AB, good intro course if interested in taking higher level math.",
    "A straightforward introductory calc class. Take it if you're interested in gaining a firmer grasp on the basics before moving on to more complicated material."
