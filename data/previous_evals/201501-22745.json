    "If you're taking this class, it might be because you're either premed and taking the new MCAT or because you're a sociology major. Or because you genuinely want to take it. TAKE IT. I think this course is a must-take at Yale for everyone. It obviously goes without saying that health is a fundamental aspect (dare I say \"right\") of citizens in society, and this course helps elucidate the human side to medicine and public health. You'll read and learn about some of those most crucial problems underlying these fields in our society, and how we can tackle these. Also you learn a lot about social networks and how these relate to health outcomes. Professor Christakis has some really interesting research on that. Now, I know you're reading all this for just this tidbit: the workload is low. Skim the readings, go to lecture, ask questions in section if you have any. There are two midterms and a take-home final. Really you get out what you put in.",
    "take it if you are premed. It will definitely change your mind on lots of things and make you think about our current system. The leaders of tomorrow in healthcare should first understand the problems in our society.",
    "Health of the public is an interesting class that covers topics regarding health that one would find relevant to the \"real world\". The Professor is the best lecturer I've had at Yale. I would recommend this course however it is difficult to know where you stand with your grade.",
    "Yes, do! I would start it off CR\/D and then decide if you want to convert it into a letter grade later.",
    "recommend, great way to understand how big medicine isn't everything and public health is essential",
    "Yes, but be aware that they don't mean it when they say they want \"concise\" answers on the midterms. I did very poorly on the first midterm because the directions clearly said to write concise answers and that they weren't expecting us to use all of the space provided. Later in section my TA said something like \"We expect you define all of the terms but we don't tell you that.\" Luckily I was taking it credit\/d\/fail so I was able to make up the points in the next midterm, but it was frustrating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It has been my favorite class at Yale so far. Every lecture is so interesting and talks about topics actually relevant to every student's life at one point or another.",
    "I needed a social science credit to graduate, and this looked neat. It was AWESOME. Professor Christakis is an excellent, excellent lecturer. He cares a lot about the material, and if you do the readings, go to lecture, and think about the ideas presented here, you will too. Spectacular class, would recommend to everyone.",
    "It was a good class to learn about the importance of public health but I think after a while the lessons became a bit repetitive and dull. I would not recommend it to another student",
    "Absolutely, take this class if you are even vaguely interested in medicine, public health, or just societal trends as they relate to our health and well-being. Professor Christakis will challenge your beliefs about how health in society works--supported by research evidence, of course--and brings a dynamic enthusiasm that makes every lecture worth going to in person (even though they are all recorded and posted on his website, in case you ever miss one). He is an extremely accomplished researcher, and until recently a practicing physician, and his experience and expertise shine through in lecture, especially in his insights and criticisms of the medical establishment. At the same time, he loves talking to students (he even remembers people's names in a 173-person lecture!) and is more than open to giving out professional and personal advice if you go to him. Overall, 11\/10 best lecture I've taken in my 4 years at Yale.",
    "This is such a great class. Definitely my favorite this whole semester. Professor Christakis will open your mind up to a whole new way of thinking about the relationship between medicine and health. I learned something new every single class. And even though it's a 75 minute lecture with 200 people, Prof. Christakis welcomes questions at the beginning, middle, and end of each class, and he loves student participation. Seriously, one of the funniest, most thoughtful professors at Yale. Also has a great personal story to share he went to medical school and practiced medicine, then got his Masters in Public Health, and is now doing social network research. If you're interested in sociology or public health at all, take this class! The two midterms and the final paper are not difficult at all. Also, the discussion sections are really helpful, so don't worry if you miss something in lecture.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. It is very relevant and taught very well. I find myself applying and thinking about concepts learned in this class in my life - matters of social capital and social network - and in thinking about the future - public health vs medical care, structure vs agency, etc.",
    "Awesome, interesting class. TAKE IT!",
    "It doesn't matter what major you're in , take this course. It applies to everyone's life.",
    "This class will change the way you think about health and the American medical system! Professor Christakis is an incredibly engaging lecturer. You can put as much or as little as you want into the class (all the lectures as videos were posted online a few days after the class), which can be a good or bad thing. There are some people who tell you that you shouldn't take a course whose videos are online because you could just watch the videos after you graduate...but really, are you going to do that? As a senior I know there are many other amazing opportunities Yale has to offer and it was great to have a class that I could attend 75% of the time and still keep up with the material.",
    "Yes, but proceed with caution. Take it Cr\/D\/F. The amount of time in lecture and the amount of readings is horrendous. NOT EASY. TAKE A DIFFERENT SOCY FOR PRE-MED REQUIREMENTS.",
    "The last lecture for Health of the Public was in the top 3 best lectures I've seen at Yale. Professor Christakis is biased but very knowledgeable, and I learned a lot about sociology which I would have never known otherwise. Midterms are fine (GO OVER THE SAMPLE TESTS WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND MAKE GOOD ANSWERS; THEY WILL MOST LIKELY SHOW UP ON THE ACTUAL TEST AGAIN). The two 7-page essays during reading period were really time-consuming, but this was the only drawback. I am incredibly thankful to this class for opening my eyes and challenging my views on medicine.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course for anyone interested in either sociology or health because it is a very intersectional course that definitely has something for every student.",
    "Great class! Definitely worth it! I took it Credit\/D and it was easy to stay engaged!",
    "A great class for everyone, pre-med or not. The material is engaging and eye opening about the state of health in America and what, aside from medicine, causes that state of health. It's true to its label as a SOCY class- very little in terms of medical jargon and whatnot. I would recommend doing the reading, which is generally pretty manageable but there are a few books that will be 150 or so pages all at once. Christakis is a great lecturer, as well!",
    "Health of the Public is one of those classes that you just must take while at Yale. Professor Christakis is an amazing lecturer and his knowledge is awe-inspiring. The readings are interesting and the exams are very fair.",
    "Take this class. It makes you think and is interesting. Not a lot of work, but everyone does well on the tests, so it actually isn't that easy and make sure to put in some work.",
    "Take this class! Even if you're not pre-med, like me, this class is so interesting and engaging. You don't need to have a bio background because Professor Christakis doesn't use a lot of bio jargon; he makes it a highly approachable and understandable topic. I have finished this class wanting to major in Health and further explore public health issues. Incredible, loved this class, wish I could take it again. Is there a Health of the Public Part 2?",
    "It's a really interesting course that is highly relevant to daily life. Take it.",
    "If you're premed or care about public health at all, you HAVE to take this class. Many things will blow your mind, and if it doesn't blow your mind, at least you'll be aware of it and it'll make you think. You learn about all the factors that REALLY make a difference in public health--and medicine\/doctors are actually not one of those major factors. Grading is pretty fair and workload isn't unmanageable. It's worth taking.",
    "Cool concepts about health policy through a social lens.",
    "Definitely take this class. Presents a great new way to look at the world, and Professor Christakis is an incredible lecturer.",
    "Good material to know, but class can get boring.",
    "Yes! Fantastic course for anyone interested in learning more about the social factors that affect health.",
    "My favorite class this semester. It was an incredible class and would highly recommend for anyone who wants a better understanding, not just of \"public health\", but of some of the most pressing social issues of our time. Amazingggg!!!",
    "Health of the Public is a must-take course at Yale. Professor Christakis was also one of the best professors I've had at Yale. He is incredibly passionate and dynamic in his teachings, and also very eager to help his students. I always looked forward to going to lecture, and this class has gotten me incredibly interested in intersection of sociology and public health. Each lecture was incredibly well-structured, and the assigned readings were very interesting as well, helping in getting a well-rounded idea of each topic and unit. The lectures were rich with research, present-day findings, connections to the larger purpose of the course, and Professor Christakis' enthusiasm. I hope to take another course with Professor Chrstakis - Health of the Public is a must-take at Yale.",
    "Professor Christakis is a very strong lecturer. He is always super engaged, I've never met a teacher who actually asks (and remembers) the names of his students in a class over over 100 people. There are a lot of readings, so stay on top of it. The TAs are helpful, and the class is definitely fair in terms of work and grading.",
    "Great class. Take it if you have a remote interest in sociology, networks, the medical field or public health, or policy. It is alot of work but you get a lot from the class. Take it!",
    "Health of the Public is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It has all the components of an inspiring course: organized, compelling lectures, controversial claims, good readings, paradigm shifts, you name it.",
    "Understanding health from a social science point of view. A twist on what one might think is an individual circumstance.",
    "HLTH 140 was a very interesting class that covers the medical field and society in an interesting and new light. The course was not very work intensive and exams were extremely fair. Sections covered readings in an interesting way.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. I would encourage people to not be discouraged from taking it out of fear of being with a bunch of premeds because the information is important for everyone. I enjoyed every single lecture and I know many other students will as well. It helped me to be secure in changing my major from MCDB to Sociology and I really think it will help others too.",
    "Health 140 was a very interesting approach to relative factors impacting the health of our society. it was good for all students of all backgrounds, both those in science and those more focused on humanities. We looked at a lot of different things and discussed a lot of different ideas. It was really relative to my daily life and I feel I have learned about things that actually impact my daily life. I highly recommend this class!",
    "YES absolutely. And do the readings they are great",
    "Health of the public is a great overview of how our social environment impacts our health. Any person could benefit from this class as it is highly applicable to any field and life in general. It really made me rethink how health is created and maintained in a society. The course was not too heavy of a work load, though the readings could be heavy at times, and you really emerge from the course with a good understanding of the social aspects of health.",
    "Yes, it is a large class but I found this more enjoyable than other stereotypical good classes (like PSYC 100). The sections made it much more personable and the format of the essay tests really catered to my style of learning.",
    "This course was well worth the taking. Though it did not count toward my particular major, the material supplemented my other courses very well and was just interesting.",
    "A popular, but overly estimated course.",
    "Really interesting stuff. Sort of intense because a lot of hardcore premeds in the class so the grades on exams are so inflated but worth taking.",
    "Health of the Public is a good sociology class. Professor Christakis is amazing, and a really great resource. There are two midterms and a final paper, and the readings are mostly interesting.",
    "You need to take this class. It teaches you about public health and medicine in a way that is completely genuine and well-rounded. It challenges your perceptions of medicine.",
    "Absolutely awesome class, would recommend to anyone. Relatively low workload, you learn a lot of interesting stuff, and Christakis is the man. Perfect class to take credit D but not exceedingly hard to do well in if you put in the effort.",
    "Though especially pre-med\/public health students will find the class interesting, I would recommend this class for everyone. The public health material covered is important just to know for the world we live in, and it was definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale. It actually influenced what I want to do with my life.",
    "Definitely take this class! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It truly gives you a new perspective about the healthcare system in America, and health in general. The workload is manageable--readings aren't too long, and there are 2 midterms and a final take-home exam. Professor Christakis is extremely knowledgeable--you'll definitely learn a lot from him.",
    "This class is a must take, hands down. Pre-med or not, it is a sin not taking it before one graduates Yale. I have learned so much interesting things from this course. Christakis is second to none and is by far the best professor I ever had at Yale. He is one of those rare instructors that make Yale's tuition kind of worth it. Then again, all his lectures are posted on his website for the world to see, so maybe I take that last statement back. Anyway, the class is fantastic, easy workload, study his posted lectures before the exams, and you'll thank me for my amazing advice.",
    "Great class, take it",
    "Sociology has been probably my most favorite class at Yale. It has challenged me to think about who I want to be as a doctor. The most important lesson I've learned from this class is that you must go into the profession with a realistic view that you will not be having an impact on overall public health. You are not working on a systems level. Patients won't stop coming. It has been such a privilege to attend Christakis' lectures and I now understand the details of how our environment and other circumstances affect our health. Be prepared to see how healthcare and 'big medicine' do not have as big an effect on improving health as we think. Christakis is an amazing lecturer. Definitely take his class. Although I am skeptical of some of his views\/facts, his lectures will blow you away. They will challenge you to think. He explains things very well and I've learned so much from him this semester. You can also tell that he put in a lot of effort on each of his lectures. His enthusiasm is very apparent, he's approachable and he's funny. His personal anecdotes are also great. He's the package.",
    "This is a must-take! (It's also a great elective or Credit\/D course.)",
    "Do not miss out on an opportunity to take a class with Professor Christakis. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Health of the Public requires student to consider complex intellectual and moral ideas through engaging lectures and (generally) very reasonable amounts of reading. Each lecture as well as the syllabus as whole is extremely well designed and constructs a smooth progression of topics. It provides good introductions to a range of ideas, but also appropriately emphasizes the common threads throughout. The most difficult parts of the class were seeing what the complexities were underneath ideas that seemed, sometimes, very simple and obvious, and their significance. Additionally, I struggled with distinguishing similar concepts from each other, possibly a side effect of the otherwise very helpful emphasis on overall themes. Having lecture slides and videos posted were extremely helpful as a student who regularly attended both lecture and section. Midterm exams questions were very appropriate.",
    "Slightly above intro course into public health \/ \"health of the public\" Two engaging lectures + 1 section weekly w\/ a substantial amount of reading. Can be manageable if done when assigned, rather than in a cram before the midterm. Would recommend, hard to walk away from class feeling like you haven't learned anything.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it offered a non-traditional view of healthcare. Even though I may not have agreed with everything said, I am glad I learned about it. There is not too much work besides the readings and lectures are interesting. If you are remotely interested in medicine or public health, this is a great class that will have you thinking about the topics long after lecture is over.",
    "Health of the Public is a very good introductory sociology course. The information is interesting and it introduces topics that are very important in public health. The ideas are not too complex but it is still fascinating. Definitely do all the readings because it makes the class worth it.",
    "Excellent and interesting course about health",
    "I loved this class, and would highly recommend it. Professor Christakis is a great lecturer, and the course material is fascinating. It definitely changed the way I view health and the methods of improving the health of the public.",
    "I would recommend this class regardless of if you are pre-med or not. I am not a pre-med, and I came in to this class with no knowledge whatsoever of public health, sociology or medicine. I took this class simply because I sat in the first lecture and it was very, very interesting. I think what you learn in this class is worth learning even if it is irrelevant to your major or future profession. This class will drastically change your views on how people's health is determined, on what doctors can and cannot do, and most interestingly, on how social networks can significantly affect your health. I strongly recommend you to go to every single lecture because if you don't you are missing out so much.",
    "SOCY 126 is a good course. I would recommend the course to someone who is interested in the material and wants to take a class from someone who is a leading expert in the field. Beware though, that lectures are a bit boring.",
    "SOCY 126 was one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale! This class completely changed my perspective on medicine and introduced me to the importance of public health. Although there may be a lot of reading, this class is a must-take for everyone interested in health, especially for premeds!",
    "SOCY 126 is a fantastic introductory course. Professor Christakis is an amazing instructor; he has extensive experience in both medicine and sociology, and frequently talked about his research or personal anecdotes working in hospice. The readings, which are sociology publications in leading magazines, are also very interesting. The workload is completely manageable (lots of reading, two midterms, one take home final comprised of two 7 page essays). Definitely one of my favorite Yale courses.",
    "For a class required for many students, it was actually enjoyable. Christakis made lecture interesting. Your TA is important: a bad discussion section can hamper your ability to understand certain concepts, but the class isn't so unbelievably difficult that it should be a problem. Midterms can go either really well or really poorly. Final \"take home exam\" was two papers.",
    "Great lecture class. Christakis is a boss, and this is his arena. It's not difficult to get an A if you're willing to put in some work (especially for the final) but otherwise, the rest of the class\/stuff you need to know for the midterms is pretty straightforward and intuitive. Made me interested in something I didn't know I would be into, so there's that! A really cool way of looking at the world.",
    "Great course, but it's a huge lecture. Material was very interesting, will most likely change your perspective on medicine & healthcare. Sometimes it was challenging to stay engaged since it's in SSS 114 and videos of the lectures were always posted online.",
    "the best best best thing in the world. TAKE IT",
    "I would definitely recommend Health of the Public to any student, in any major, interested in anything at all. Health of the Public provides us with very valuable information that you wouldn't learn anywhere else. Eye-opening course on the role of society on health.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would completely recommend HLTH 140 to a fellow student. Although it would be especially interesting to anyone with a science or public background, I think this is an invaluable class to everyone in any discipline. It is a great class to learn about the state of the healthcare system and the relationship between health and livelihood.",
    "yes best class ever",
    "Health of the Public is a really engaging class and I would recommend it to anyone at Yale that wants an introduction to public health. The readings were so interesting and the lectures were really engaging.",
    "Health of the Public is a really great 5th class; it's not a lot of work, but you learn a bunch of really interesting things about public health, society, and more - Christakis is a really talented lecturer, and knows it - so he's engaging, but sometimes annoying to sit in class with. It's very much not a lot of work, the midterms are really straightforward. The final was a bit of an odd assignment, but overall not a ton of work, and learned some really interesting things.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I would summarize it as learning about health in society from many different perspectives, learning about the determinants of health, and touching on policies that affect the well-being of so many. I consider that this is one of the Yale courses every student should take, and I recommend it to all regardless of interests or course of study.",
    "This class is absolutely phenomenal! This course is a survey of issues in public health from a sociological perspective. You cover everything from the demographic health transition and the determinants of good health to the role of income, inequality, race, religion and social networks on health. The workload is manageable This course is also intended to encourage students interested in the health sciences to rethink their understanding of the role of healthcare providers on the health of the public. It is a transformative course for anyone who thinks that being a doctor is the only way to improve the health of others. It has definitely transformed my understanding of public health and social justice more generally. I honestly would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of your major or pre-professional track. If you've ever been mildly interested in public health or sociology, this is definitely worth shopping, at the very least!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Health of the Public! Such a great class-- I had no prior experience in health studies and learned a ton about issues that are so important for everyone to know about in society: networks and how they impact people's lives, relationship between socioeconomic status and health, the government's role in the field of health. Super accessible class and Professor Christakis is the best!",
    "You should definitely take this class. All of the lectures are fascinating, workload is not too bad, and the tests are very fair.",
    "Highly recommended! My favorite class at Yale to date. A must take for anyone interested in healthcare and health policy. Important for premeds! It completely changed my perspective on medicine and public health. Doing the readings really makes a difference.",
    "Take this course. Christakis is a god.",
    "Take this class! It's eye-opening!",
    "A really interesting course that is accessible to those who may not be interested in medicine as a career.",
    "Take this class. I shopped the course on a whim, not because I was interested in public health or sociology, but because the reviews on CourseTable were good. Trust the reviews. Take this class. I understand why this class is so highly recommend for premeds: it reinvents how you think about medicine and health in general in a really humbling, mind-boggling, and productive way. As a non-premed, I also found this class inspiring and foundational: it expands, complicates, and reinvents your understanding of what public health entails. I came into this class with no background (and limited interest) in both health and sociology, and Im now considering a career and a major in those fields, respectively. The work load is manageable and the curve is generous, if youre worried about that stuff. Try not to fall behind on readings, but the material is pretty well-incorporated into lecture, so you can survive the midterms without reading every word. More importantly, though: youll want to come to lecture. Professor Christakis is brilliant, well-spoken, and thoughtful, and his lectures feel like TED Talks Id often leave class feeling energized and inspired, and I regularly catch myself thinking about things I learned in class. Christakis also does a great job of building a warm, participatory, engaging classroom environment in spite of the large class size, and so although videos of the lectures are posted online, I never missed lecture. Take this class."
