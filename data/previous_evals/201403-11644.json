   "comments": [
    "Great course. Sometimes overloaded with readings that tend to be repetitive, but in the end provided a very comprehensive look at the intersection of law and public health. A baseline assessment of students' knowledge of government\/law would be helpful to make sure the course starts off at the right pace\/level.",
    "Wonderful course! You learn exactly what you think you are going to learn: the fundamentals of public health law. The readings are very good and the syllabus is extremely well-structured. However, sometimes the lectures became a little overwhelming because there was too much material. I really enjoyed the group discussions such as the debate on Jacobsen v. Mass. which really solidified and reinforced the principles.",
    "Overall this course is hard but very useful. This course provides great framework of law and US's political system. It would be great if the teacher can provide us more guidance on reading materials.",
    "This course offers a fantastic look at the nexus of law and public health. Its strengths are the passion of the instructor, the structure of the course, and the lectures on basic legal concepts.",
    "I think that the course was a great introduction to public health law. The strengths of the class was all the topics covered. Another strength of the course was the student presentations related to relevant public health law topics.",
    "I found this course was great!! I didn't know anything about law before taking this class, and I learned so much about it, and specially its application to public health. I really liked reading the different cases and discussing them in class. One of the things I enjoyed the most was hearing the cases online as suggested by our teacher. The readings of the books of Goodman and Gostin were great, and followed the discussion we had in class. I also really liked the final paper, in which we got to choose a public health topic and apply a legal toolbox to the chosen public health issue. It was great to have this experience, and I fully encourage other people to take this course! The instructor is amazing!",
    "Simply incredible",
    "There is a steep learning curve for those not acquainted with law. However, the class finds ways to engage all students and the professor is responsive to student feedback.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course and the fact that it was so heavily based on discussion. Shelley did a great job of incorporating everyone in the class. I thought that the final project was a great idea because it really did tie in a lot of the material from the entire semester and really forced us to go back and understand it completely.",
    "I thought that this course was fantastic. I thought that the assignments were all great; I learned a ton! However, there are definitely some things that I would alter to make it more effective. First, I would do more of an intro. to basic legal terms and legal research. There is definitely a learning curve here, and I think that class\/assignments would move much more quickly if students had a better background in this area. I would also split up the infectious disease case assignment into 2 assignments (it was really really long)-although definitely don't get rid of it!! I would also split the class into 2 so that the first day during the week would introduce the material, and then the second day could be devoted to case studies. Finally, I would structure the final project so that each week a section was due (based on the topic being covered) given that the final assignment almost seemed insurmountable at the end of the semester.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. Please see my response to question 7 for my evaluation of the professor, but in terms of the overall assessment of the course: I think that the material was overall excellent. The most important topics were addressed in a comprehensive and understandable way. Suggestions for improvement: I thought that there could have been more of an introduction to US government, because some of us in the class didn't know much about US government or the constitution which made it hard to truly grasp the other topics of the course. Also, I think that the professor should involve the readings more in class; sometimes I felt that we would do the readings and then we wouldn't really address them in class.",
    "Areas of improvement: Reduce the legalese.",
    "This class was excellent. There was a lot of material but the professor was constantly readjusting based on student feedback. I like the idea of choosing a project at the beginning of the semester and thinking of applications for the final paper each week instead of choosing midway through the semester. Debates and case studies were fantastic ways to explore dense subjects but some of the assignments were a bit too long, although Dr Geballe parsed that down as the semester progressed. An optional lecture on reading legal cases would save a lot of time in the long run.",
    "A little tough for those of us with not very extensive backgrounds in law, but really good information",
    "weaknesses: TOO MUCH READING, even though it was all interesting and not all required, there was just too much it was overwhelming. strengths: she is the most thorough professor i have ever had, as well as being one of the most kind and genuinely interested in her students. she knows so much about law, current events, and defending vulnerable people, and she is very passionate about her work"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Great instructor. Always looking for feedback and ways to improve the course throughout the semester. Very receptive to students' feedback. Very impressive amount of feedback and comments on assignments - makes the assignments feel worth the effort because she actually reads and responds to them. At the beginning of the course, there was some discrepancy in understanding our baseline knowledge of the law, but she has plans to fix that next semester.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is WONDERFUL! She's such a nice person and she's extremely knowledgable.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Excellent instructor, great resource, and very intelligent and well read as a professor for the course.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0She is the best teacher in YSPH that I met so far. She cares about students so much, not only just about this class, but about the person. She is very thoughtful that she held office hour every Wednesday afternoon to make sure everyone's on the same page.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Excellent instructor! Expertly able to link legal concepts and public health.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley provided students with wonderful feedback on every assignment. She was also very helpful and easy to discuss assignments and tasks with.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0She is very responsive to feedback and truly cares about giving her students a great education! A wonderful teacher!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0SHe was fantastic- very responsive to student feedback",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley has been one of the greatest teachers I have had during graduate school. She was always available to respond all of our questions, both in class and out of class, giving us her written feedback in every paper we turned in, which is something I seldomly saw in other classes. She was very dedicated in her course, and that was reflected in her lectures. She was open to changing the methodology of the course, accomodating all the students, and was always open to suggestions of how to make the class better. She always made sure we understood the concepts passed in the lecture, making the law understandable to all of us!! Shelley is not only a great instructor, but also a great person, and it was an honor to be her student.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0so personable and stimulating, you can tell she loves to teach!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0One of the best professors I've ever had.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley has been very considerate of the students, especially with assignment times.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0A wonderful person; very responsive to student feedback and makes an effort to engage all students in discussion.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0She did a great job teaching this class. It was comprehensive, understandable, yet challenging at the same time.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0A great teacher who was sensitive to students needs.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is amazing! She is brilliant and super receptive to students. She was constantly asking for feedback and changing the course accordingly. She provides very thorough feedback on everything and I applaud her for covering so much material in so few classes. I just cannot say enough about how fantastic she is.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Pros: I greatly enjoyed taking the course from Shelley. Shelley cares a LOT that students understand the material and I loved that she took so long preparing those cheat sheets about topics such as US government. I really liked the way the class was structured and how the topics built on one another. She really put a lot of thought into the way each topic was presented and that allowed us to get a lot out of the material. Cons: Although the slides were really detailed and thorough, sometimes they were TOO detailed which meant that she had to go super quickly through them and I didn't really absorb what she was trying to teach us. In the first two class sessions, Shelley had a great way of posing questions to the class as she lectured, which was really engaging -- but I felt that future lectures were more talking AT us, which was less engaging. Also, I think it would have been better if she had started class promptly at 10am every class; that would encourage people not to be late.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an excellent teacher. I just think she needs to find ways to reduce the legalese in the course so that non-law students are not overwhelmed.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Dr Geballe is fantastic. She is responsive to suggestions, clear with material delivery, and encouraging of her students. She asked each student for their background and actually directly incorporated those experiences into lectures.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Incredibly knowledgable and supportive. Thank you Shelley!",

   "comments": [
    "Would absolutely recommend to other students. Learned an incredible amount. Every public health professional should understand the power of the law in public health issues.",
    "Absolutely wonderful course! A lot of work, but take it if you want to learn about how to use the law to advance public health objectives.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "Would recommend this course wholeheartedly to any student interested in public health!",
    "I would summarize this course as an absolutely necessary course for students studying Public Health, because you learn important tools and knowledge on the legal basis on different essential public health issues. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it is essential for Public Health professionals to have legal knowledge on the subject, and because the instructor is one of the best professors they will have in graduate school.",
    "great course, i learned a lot, and would highly recommend it to anyone",
    "Difficult but extremely fascinating and lots of learning.",
    "This course covers different ways of using the law to affect public health. It may be more helpful for those who have a basic background in constitutional law\/other legal experience.",
    "Take only if you envision law being an important aspect of your public health practice",
    "This course is a lot. There is a lot to know and a lot to learn. I would only recommend it for students who are serious about wanting to learn the material. However, I think it would serve as a great requirement for health policy students (being on myself) since there were not that many policy students in the class. While it was really really interesting to get the perspective of many concentrations, I think that is something that all policy students should and would benefit from.",
    "I highly recommend Public Health Law. We are all students who will have careers in public health, and the law is EXTREMELY important to essentially every aspect of public health (the ACA, the work that state and local health departments do, epidemiological surveillance, creating laws that promote public health, etc). The course is a broad overview of the MANY different ways that public health is affected by law. Shelley is extremely sensitive to the needs of the students and wants to make sure you understand everything. The only downside of the course was that when I took the course in Fall 2014 it was only the first time she had taught it and so there were a few kinks, such as an assignment that took WAY too long, but I am sure Shelley will fix those things the next time around. Highly recommend!",
    "Summary: There is a temptation to think this is a course about the laws of public health. Though it is, it is more about how the law can be used to impact public health delivery, which is more compelling perspective. The course sits at the intersection of public health and law and would be a rewarding experience to anyone.",
    "This class was one of my favorites at YSPH. I highly recommend it.",
    "YES! lots of work but very worth it. helped me understand a lot about how PH change is made"
