   "comments": [
    "Question 14: I would have liked more reading material focused on conservation issues or perhaps even a separate course that focuses on conservation - the material focused on this topic seemed lacking.",
    "The readings for this course were very helpful although quite dense and often too much. I think two readings per week would have been more manageable than three. The lectures were quite unhelpful to me. Professor Carpenter read her lecture notes straight from a paper, and read them so fast it was impossible for me to take coherent notes. It was also hard for me to learn because I was so focused on writing notes on what she said. It would have been really helpful if she had had something to reference after each lecture like a copy of her lecture notes or a summary of them, or a powerpoint or something. At the end of the course I tried to borrow notes from other classmates and their notes were as fragmented and often incomprehensible as mine. Professor Carpenter also tended to go off topic a lot, which was distracting and made following the actual class material difficult at times.",
    "A good course; a little theory-heavy and at times obscure but worthwhile overall.",
    "Professor Carpenter did an excellent job preparing the course and designing a comprehensive curriculum.",
    "Question 10Lectures and readings, along with class discussions as well as clearly enriched by the instructor have provided a deep understanding of the course topics to students. This combination has prepared students to write the required final paper thesis that students have submitted at the end of the course completion."

    "The best aspects of this course were the discussions - some of them - with classmates about the topics we were examining. I also got a lot out of meeting with Matthew outside of class. He was very patient and good at explaining things.",
    "The in-class discussions were very helpful for thinking about applications of the reading material. The final paper was also helpful for this.",

    "Provoked students to think more about the broader context of conservation and development projects; why they're being done, who's benefitting, who's not, etc.",

    "The readings prepared a solid foundation for class discussion and an excellent starting off point for further research.",
    "The readings were really great and really invaluable for my interests. I really enjoyed them and the thesis sentences were really useful to refer to while writing the final paper. I loved the flexibility of the final paper and Carol was useful in helping me find a framing that was useful to explore my own research.",
    "Writing a final paper thesis on a topic dealing with both environmental and social aspects, and class discussions on comparative analyses led by students were the best aspects of this course."

   "comments": [
    "I felt like I would have liked lectures that reached beyond the scope of weekly readings, and less about the authors more about the topics at hand",
    "More conservation articles and topics",
    "As I mentioned above, the lectures that Professor Carpenter gave were quite challenging to follow. Her lecture style of just reading off a piece of paper was not very engaging and she read so fast it was hard to keep up \/ absorb everything she said. I felt the pace of the course was just too fast for someone without abackground in social sciences and thinkers like Foucault. I also felt that the thesis statement exercises were not very helpful - as I often felt that summarizing each reading into one sentence was too difficult. Is there another way to make sure people understand the readings? I don't know but I would consider other options.",
    "I would like to see the paper requirement restructured a bit to motivate gradual progress throughout the semester. While I felt my knowledge and analytical skills gradually progressed, having to apply all of it at once to one topic was challenging. I could easily see all the authors' ideas in various parts of my chosen project for my final paper, but the challenge was in assessing what my strongest argument might be. This request could be facilitated by requiring an additional statement about the projects, sometime between the October and November breaks.",
    "The pace of the class seemed a little slow.The readings selected seemed a little advanced for an introductory class.",
    "Would have liked more discussion of how concepts can be applied practically, not just discussed theoretically.",
    "Class discussions could have used more focus and spent more time with the authors' arguments.",
    "The class lectures were pretty good, but could sometimes be a bit dry.While it was useful getting a primer on Foucault's ideas, sometimes it would have been nice to branch out from him a bit more.",
    "The aspect of this course that needs Improvement is the use of the course website. Sometimes students were confused with the right space to post comparative analyses and the thesis sentences."

Really enjoyed his lecture.",

    "Instructor: Matthew Baird Archer \u00a0Matthew was good. Both he and Professor Carpenter seemed to have fairly limited office hours, which was challenging at times. I think that because Matthew seemed to have a good understanding of the themes discussed in the course, it might have been nice to have him translate some of Professor Carpenter's lectures in class since she was so hard to follow. That would have made the course a lot better - although it's not his fault that was needed.",
    "Instructor: Matthew Baird Archer \u00a0The TA made himself very available and accessible to students. Would have liked more of his perspective on the material and concepts we were discussing, maybe more help in clarifying them.",

    "This course is less relevant to what I am studying now at Yale and more relevant to the work that I will be doing when I graduate (international conservation& development work). It was important to think about these programs critically and to question their effectiveness and whether they are necessary at all or doing what they aim to be doing. These themes taught in the course were very interesting and have certainly given me the vocabulary to critically assess programs which I plan to work with in the future.",
    "The course has enabled me think about development programs, their design and implementation in a different way.",
    "As someone interested in anthropological ideas and social issues around conservation and development, the course readings were a great base for me to have moving forward, and a great positioning in the ideas being discussed currently in the sector.",
    "This course fitted well into my academic and professional programs. Coming from a conservation and sustainable development professional background, this course provided me with a fundamental understanding of conservation and development dynamics of partners and stakeholders at local, national and international levels, deepening all aspects involved in implementing sustainable development and conservation projects by analyzing case studies related to this field throughout different periods and spaces. In addition, this course has prepared me to analyze and suggest clear questions and topics for my research project involving indigenous an local communities with protected and non-protected areas in central Africa."
