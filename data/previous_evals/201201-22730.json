   "comments": [
    "The class is based on the idea of the \"con man\" in literature and history in Western culture, and it's a fun experience, even for someone with limited knowledge of German or literary analysis. The workload is extremely light: three short (3-5 p.) papers throughout the semester, in addition to a 10-page final paper. Kirk and our TF Nadine are very kind, understanding, and smart people; they want you to succeed and will help you with anything you need throughout the semester. Although discussion can get off-topic at times (depending on who's in the class), it's a really laid-back and pleasant atmosphere for someone that's interested in the con man figure.",
    "Definitely take this class. It met just once a week, Thurs 3:30-5:20, and every minute was worth it. Literature was all very interesting, and reading was not overwhelming. Conversation was always flowing.",
    "Fakes, Frauds and Counterfeits is a solid course overall. The concept of the con man is interesting to explore and analyze in literature, although sometimes the common themes become too common among the different characters week after week. The syllabus is very good, as Kirk chooses each work carefully. Kirk and Nadine are both accommodating to students' needs and Kirk leads class discussion very well. The workload is average for a Yale course. The readings are definitely on the long side some weeks, but most of the time they are incredibly reasonable. The workload of the class is divided between reading, 3 short essays (3-5 pages), and a final paper of 10-15 pages. I would recommend the course to students looking for a seminarthat is not exceptionally demanding, but rather rewarding.",
    "Fakes is a really interesting class. Most of the readings are interesting and produce great discussions. The workload is extremely reasonable, with only a few pages assigned many of the weeks. Professor Wetters is really interesting, and runs the discussion well. A nice course if you're interested in the subject.",
    "A very complicated class. Many of the ideas are quite difficult, and the syllabus is very challenging. It moves between various ideas about confidence games: including the actual confidence game, ideas about trickery, and then also confidence games as it relates to theories of fiction. I do think some more work is needed to smooth out the transitions between these various ideas, particularly that they should work toward some conclusion instead of tracing back on themselves.Professor Wetters is a wonderfully kind-hearted professor. His system for papers is just perfect. Some of his 'introductions' or 'lectures' are quite complex, but so are the texts, so it's a difficult line to walk. I do think (at times) the discussion of the seminar could lead to something more substantial at the end.",
    "I would recommend this course if your excited about engaging in tough philosophical questions about authorship- or if you're amused by frauds!"
