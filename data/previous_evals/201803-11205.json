    "Knowledge of German!",
    "I developed a working knowledge of written and spoken German! Through interactions with Frau Sippel, I also learned about elements of German culture and history.",
    "Learned tons of vocabulary (around 100 words per week) and basic German grammar, including all four cases (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive). Practiced speaking and listening every day in class.",
    "Ability to understand, write, and speak in German at a basic level.",
    "This course teaches you all the basics of German quickly. You will learn all the cases and all the major way to form verbs by the end. You will also a good bit about German culture too which is fun.",
    "I gained knowledge in German which was very useful to my own research. Through the class and from the excellent help of the instructor, my German has significantly improved and I have also gained very interesting insights into the way German culture and language work.",
    "I learned the basics of German grammar and speech and a great deal of vocabulary. We were also exposed to a good amount of German culture.",
    "Speaking, reading, and writing skills in German."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course was 1. the commitment of the other students to learning the language together and even more 2. the instruction. The instructor struck a fine balance between organized progress through linguistic concepts and letting us ask questions and learn new concepts at our own pace and according to our interest. This was perhaps the most skillfully taught language course I've ever taken. The only weaknesses of the course were the homeworks and textbook, I thought. When using the Connect homework system it was often as difficult to figure out what was being asked as to answer the questions properly, with bizarre answer formats that had to be carefully attended to in order to avoid missing every question. Connect often got in the way of the concepts and vocabulary the homeworks were trying to test. The book was less bad, but it also sometimes required us to remember facts about its fictional characters in order to engage with the material, which I found to be a nuisance. I want to learn German and have no interest in Monika, Albert, Heidi, etc. The book also did not seem fully calibrated in terms of when it introduced vocabulary, often calling out easy words with footnotes or vocabulary while using difficult words not found in the vocabulary lists.",
    "The class is really well-planned and structured. Overall I think each assignment was important to learning German.",
    "Strengths are Frau Sippel! She is organized, compassionate, and altogether a very skilled educator. I felt as though her positivity was crucial in making each day as productive as it could possibly be. Having a two hour language course every morning can be quite grueling, but Frau Sippel's strengths as an educator and as a person made it a pleasure each and every time.",
    "The McGraw Hill homework sometimes has problems with submissions",
    "The strength is the variety of grammar and vocabulary we learn in the course. There are also many opportunities to help practice speaking. Perhaps a change could be not to follow every exercise in the textbook so exactly and rather due more of a variety of activities, perhaps ones that have to do with engaging topics like culture or history.",
    "This course was an excellent way to quickly excel at German. The best part of this (and I assume this more than anything determines the experience of the course) was our professor: Frau SIppel. I cannot imagine a more engaged teacher that encourages students to want to come into class at 9:30 everyday to learn about German grammar. She does a fantastic job balancing textbook activities with her own activities or grammar explanations. The class is also great because it is immersive from day one (she only speaks in German), but a good job acclimating students to this.",
    "I wish we had done more reading of texts.",
    "I think it is a very good intensive programme. It is excellently structured.",
    "The course teaches you a lot of German in a semester. Looking back at my learning process, I would have liked to start by learning more of the basic grammar before beginning the vocabulary. This is largely due to the way the textbook is structured, and perhaps a future course would consider following a different text. (The textbook, while entertaining in its own way, has a ton of vocabulary that needs further differentiation and explication. Some of the vocabulary is quite useless for a beginner.) On the other hand, German is a difficult language, and the course was arranged in a way, in its content and its assessments, to ease you slowly into the jungle. I wish that there was more emphasis on speaking.",
    "Lots of opportunities to practice in class and in the online assignments. Lots of good feedback from instructor."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. If the student desires to learn German as rapidly as possible this is a very good course.",
    "I would recommend it to someone whos not trying to fulfill their language requirement, but just wants to learn German for academic or personal reasons. First of all, getting to class everyday at 9:25am at Watson requires discipline, and gets progressively harder as the weather gets colder. Second, the pace of the class is fastwhich is what you would expect for an intensive course. This means you are immersed in German for two hours everyday and learn so so much! I think its a great way to kick start the language learning process.",
    "100% yes. I think that it is a very rewarding experience to learn another language, and the best way to do so is through an intensive course such as this one. Further, German is a fascinating language and Frau Sippel is an excellent teacher.",
    "This class is fantastic! Frau Sippel is one of my favorite all-time teachers at Yale. Learning a language requires daily practice, and taking intensive German is a fun way to do that.",
    "Definitely, it is exciting to feel yourself improving faster in an intensive language course.",
    "Definitely, if you want to learn German this is without a doubt the way to do it quickly and effectively. The 9:30-11:15 slot seems like a lot to handle everyday, but it moves by quickly once the semester starts moving. And of course, if Frau Sippel is teaching this course, do not hesitate for a second if you are interested in learning this culturally rich language.",
    "Yes I would if you want to learn German quickly and are willing to put in the work.",
    "It is an excellent intensive programme. If you have the academic time, it would perhaps be inevitably more advantageous to go through the 110, 120 route but this intensive programme is excellent in its own right.",
    "Take this course over the ordinary L1 course. You will be more satisfied with your progress and will move faster with better classmates.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who is serious about learning German. I grew increasingly confident in my speaking, reading, and writing abilities throughout the semester. The schedule may seem daunting, but was actually very manageable and rewarding."
