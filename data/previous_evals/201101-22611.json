   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it because it's a good way to get 1.5 credits and fulfill your language requirement.",
    "French 140 is terrific intermediate\/advanced course. Compared to 130, we learned much more French culture and history, to supplement grammar lessons. The books we read were fascinating, enjoyable and rewarding, and the films are movies I plan to watch again this summer. We also studied French history in WWII rather extensively, with several films and one of the books.Definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this class if you wish to improve grammar skills.",
    "This is a better class than the L3 course. By the end of the semester you will be doing research in French and learning a ton about French history and culture during the occupation. If you do your work and participate in class, you are guaranteed to become more proficient in speaking which is such a satisfying experience.I had an epiphany moment while writing one of my journals when I finally began to understand what it means to THINK in French rather than thinking in English and turning it into French.",
    "Most of it is reading through novels and short stories, with an emphasis on WWII in France at the end of the semester. You watch some really good movies (with subtitles!) and classes are mostly discussion based on the books. Also do a fair amount of grammar. Homework is a LOT of reading, and grammar\/listening worksheets from the course book. I had to get my L credits done, and it did the job. Glad I took it, don't think I'm going to continue with French classes though (they are very time consuming and meet everyday).",
    "I recommend this course because it will reinforce what you have learned in L3. You will also read more in this course- but the stories are interesting and more challenging!",
    "Yes because you learn more important grammar than French 3 and finishing the books is really rewarding. They are great to read.",
    "I would recommend this class but only after making sure that our teacher will be good.",
    "Yes, improves your written french tremendously and gives you a glimpse into french culture."
