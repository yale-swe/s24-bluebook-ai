    "This is a great survey of some beautiful writings. You will also develop a better sense of the continuities throughout the Christian tradition, which is helpful regardless of your personal beliefs. The readings are dense and long, but it's really satisfying once you've finished to reflect on the amount of primary material you've understood.",
    "Great course, I highly recommend it!",
    "YES! If you took DS, it's pretty similar but a much lower workload and stress, so that you have the freedom to get out as much as you put in. Whether you are Catholic or not (I'm not), this class contains really important ideas and thinkers that all college students should probably be exposed to. Christian and Catholic thought has so profoundly shaped Western culture, that some familiarity with it is essential. Plus, the two professors are really amazing people and approachable, and even though it's a lecture, they make it feel like a seminar.",
    "Everyone should take this course to have a better understanding of the religious roots of much of the Western intellectual tradition.",
    "Catholic Intellectual History is a great class to take, regardless of who you think you are right now. jk. But if you are a seeker of truths and humanity and reason, look no further for the perfect class to get your intellectual-spiritual self all riled up. It's a fairly straightforward history class, but it'll make you feel things if you let it. (Or if you just like some religious history, good biographies, and some poetic philosophy you'll still very much enjoy it.) The profs are great, it's not very difficult, and tripartite things are cool. Honestly though, take it. It was always one of those classes I had as extras on the shopping list but didn't get to it til senior year. Wish I had earlier. Don't let that be you. Definitely third best class I've taken at Yale, by far.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in history of Christianity, specifically Catholicism. Both professors are amazing, resourceful, and caring. The class is never dull, the guest lectures amazing, and the work is manageable. The readings are doable and interesting. The work is not too hard, just two papers and two midterm.",
    "A survey of Catholic legends and philosophers from Christ's time to the present taught by two caring, professional, and knowledgeable professors, I would highly recommend this class to all Yalies, regardless of their religious background. CIT was an excellent course, and I am extremely glad I took it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about Christianity. The readings, though sometimes long, cover a wide breadth of authors and were at different times intellectually challenging, inspiring, confusing, and humorous. The professors have an entertaining dynamic and bring in some excellent guest lecturers from all sorts of people.",
    "In CIT, you do a survey of the whole of Catholic ideas from the Gospel until present. Note that this is not a history of Catholic politics or the Church's associated states, but a journey through ideas and theology. You will read all the major Catholic thinkers, and compare and contrast their different approaches to understanding the topics most core to Christianity. I would recommend this course to any student interested in religion, philosophy, art, or literature. As someone who is not Catholic, I still found this course interesting and very enjoyable, and found that it really helped me rethink my perspective on some topics.",
    "Excellent survey course of the Catholic tradition. A good mix from the \"center\" of the canon and some interesting readings from the periphery, as well. Both Professors Mazzotta and Eire are great people and teachers. Would heartily recommend to others.",
    "The course gave an overview of the catholic intellectual tradition without simply skimming the surface. The class got an in-depth perspective from primary sources that spanned several centuries."
