   "comments": [
    "I liked 230, but I loved this class. The material was a lot more nuanced, and relevant to my interests; the other students were great, and a joy to get to know; I felt like I had gotten the hang of the policy briefs, and was able to write about things I was really interested in, etc. Be aware that there's a heavy emphasis on class presentations - I felt like I didn't learn too much from hearing others present, but I learned SO MUCH from having to present myself. Over the course of the semester, I became much more confident about my presentation skills, and I'm ultimately very grateful for that. Professor Skolnik is quirky but lovable; he really cares about his students, and goes out of his way to be accessible to them. All-around, a great upper-level global health class.",
    "Good class to take if you are a Global Health Fellow or mildly interested in public health. Really lets you know if you are cut out for the field or not!",
    "This is a great class! You learn so much about eradication campaigns, health systems around the world, and inequities in health systems. The disease section was the most exciting, and while health systems are not nearly as exciting, it is important to know howthey work and how they differ between countries. You also learn a lot about presenting, which is an invaluable skill. Don't worry if you get nervous speaking- it is a small group and a great way to gain confidence. The policy briefs (3, 6 pages each) are straightforward, and you will have to give 2-3 5 minute presentations over the semester. Not much work, you learn a lot, and its fun! Professor Skolnik is a professor not to miss- he has many connections and is incredibly willing to put you in touch with people for global health internships etc. Take it!!",
    "Absolutely take it if you have any interest in global health. The course really teaches you how to think critically about global health, which is a must if you are thinking about pursuing it as a career.",
    "The course explored three broad themes: (1) disease eradication campaigns, (2) health care systems, and (3) inequity in health care. The course couples class discussion with targeted readings. I would highly recommend this course to any student considering being even tangentially involved in Global Health or global aid.",
    "I would definitely recommend HLTH 330 to another student, as it is one of my favorite classes ever. The work is not too heavy, and after taking HLTH 230, the essays are straightforward. I loved Professor Skolnik (after having him for HLTH 230), and enjoyed going further into global health. If you are at all interested in global health, I would definitely suggest taking this course!",
    "I would absolutely take the class. It was one of my favorites. Only 3 policy briefs and class participation - which you shouldn't feel pressure for because even though he just calls on you it is no big deal if you don't know. I learned more than I ever thought I would - and things actually relevent to real life as well.",
    "I really loved this class. It is exactly what you would expect if HLTH 230 was shrunk into a seminar. The material covered (eradication campaigns, health systems and equality) are interesting and the class discussions are fun. At times the class can be heavy on reading, but overall the workload is not bad at all. If you are interested in global health or just looking for a fun class, take this one.",
    "This class is an excellent transition from HLTH 230, and I thought a great class to take before Strategic Thinking in Global Health. I would recommend this class to all students who wish to study global health issues in an intimate environment with a focus on developing presentation, evaluation, and problem solving skills. You will learn from not only Professor Skolnik but also your fellow classmates. This class makes you even more excited to tackle the greatest challenges facing the global health community and gives you the tools to contribute to the discussion in an informed way.",
    "If you ever have the opportunity, take this class! It is a decent pile of work, but yo do not want to miss the opportunity of working with professor Skolnik.",
    "The content is great and Skolnik is a great resource if you get along with him. If you don't, you can kiss your grade and prospects of getting a good internship opportunity out of him goodbye.",
    "It's very different from HLTH 230. In this class, only students primarily talk and give presentations or defend a country\/health system. You have to do some reading before class for sure and the essays are not as structured as that of HLTH 230. Thus, if you did well in HLTH 230 essays, don't expect that you have got the formula down for HLTH 330 essays. There is no formula for them as such and the structure for each essay keeps changing.",
    "There is a fair amount of work and reading, and there is alot of public speaking in the class. It's good practice and learning how to think in a pressure situation is a wonderful skill."
