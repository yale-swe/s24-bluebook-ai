    "spanish",
    "I developed a solid understanding of basic Spanish grammar and vocabulary, as well as the ability to communicate for longer periods of time in the language, using more sophisticated grammatical constructions.",
    "I really learned a ton of Spanish vocabulary, how to construct simple sentences, how to read and grasp what I am reading, and how to talk in Spanish. It was by far my most challenging class this semester.",
    "Having not taken a beginner language class since I was young, this class reminded me how much dedication is needed to learn a new language. I learned how to be more diligent and regular with my studying and homework habits. I also learned how to speak basic Spanish.",
    "I learned basic Spanish.",
    "I gained beginning Spanish skills such as basic grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.",
    "I learned a lot about Spanish culture while being able to speak comfortable with others. This course made me confident in not only my reading and writing abilities, but also my listening and speaking ones. It made learning a new language accesible despite the challenges. Overall, I felt proficient in Spanish after I left the class.",
    "I developed the basic elementary concepts of the Spanish language.",
    "Lots of learning in this class, I learned how to speak more in spanish"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "So many strengths! The only suggestion I have is to expose students to different accents before exams.",
    "The course gave a good overview of a lot of basic grammar and provided a good range of vocabulary. The regular tests initially seemed like a negative part of the course, but they were short and manageable which helped break up the work over the semester and helped me process the information I had learned. Some parts of the course move slightly too quickly, such as some of the later grammatical ideas which are relatively complex.",
    "i think it is good as is",
    "A lot of material is covered, but Professor Alexandrov dedicated enough time to each topic so it didn't feel as if we skimmed over anything. However, I could have benefitted from a greater emphasis on speaking for extended periods of time before the oral exam.",
    "I think more practice with writing could help. For example beginning with simple sentences in class so that it will be easier to not make mistakes or forget words in writing compositions.",
    "The strengths of this class are its incredible teaching instruction, the high level of organization regarding homework and tests, the lack of a final exam, and the many evaluations which each counted for a small percentage of the final grade.",
    "Strengths - meeting everyday is helpful for language courses because it forces us to have homework everyday and practice our Spanish everyday. Weaknesses - the course moves very fast.",
    "The strengths include the activities set up to help you learn, the flow of the classes and the teaching abilities of the professors. The main weakness was that some of the homework was too difficult for beginning Spanish speakers to try and to do. It was nearly impossible to read an entire short story in Spanish and then to get tested on it was hard and upsetting. The audio exercises spoke ridiculously fast and would only give you one attempts. The class is great, but sadly, the homework is what really detracts from the course at times.",
    "I thought the class was great!",
    "strengths of the course: teacher was unbelievable"

    "If you're interested in foreign languages, definitely take this course. Everyone should learn Spanish -- especially with Professor Alexandrov!",
    "Yes, if you want to learn a useful language but don't want an overload of homework, this is the class for you.",
    "Yes - I would definitely take L1 Spanish, it seems like a lot of work having homework due every day but it's really very bearable.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who truly wants to learn Spanish because you truly learn a lot and go at a pretty fast pace. This is the class to take for intro Spanish.",
    "YES. I was so nervous about taking L1 Spanish after not having taken a basic language class for a long time. But this class is wonderful. Prof. Alexandrov is a fantastic teacher (one of the best I've had) and she really, really cares about the well-being and progress of all of her students. The class has a lot of little, small evaluations which is good because they keep you on track with studying and none of them count too heavily towards your final grade. Great class, amazing teacher - would highly recommend.",
    "Yes!",
    "I think the course was extremely helpful in learning Spanish. I recommend the class because it drastically improved my abilities, but make sure to take a teacher that you would like because it makes a difference.",
    "I absolutely loved this class and Spanish has never been my favorite subject!",
    "Sybil Alexandrov is an amazing, fair teacher"
