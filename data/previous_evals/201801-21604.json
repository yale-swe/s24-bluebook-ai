    "I learned different biochemical and biophysical approaches and how to use them experimentally. The information learned in this course will be beneficial during my thesis research.",
    "I learned a lot about biochemical and biophysical techniques.",
    "I gained greater understandings of a lot of biochemical and biophysical techniques, and practical tips on how to properly use those techniques in context.",
    "I developed a comprehensive understanding of several lab techniques having to do with biochemistry and biophysics, as well as the appropriate situations in which to use these techniques.",
    "How to plan thoughtful biochemical experiments, learn the basics about different techniques that I may use in my thesis project, and the pros\/cons of various techniques.",
    "I learned a lot of new techniques that can be applicable to my research which was especially helpful because I joined my thesis lab part-way through the semester and have now been brainstorming techniques I can use.",

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: having lectures by those who perform the techniques so questions about applications can be answered. Weaknesses: lecturers not knowing others topics and overlapping.",
    "In some of the sessions such as Cryo-EM and crystallography, the lecturer didn't take into consideration of our limited knowledge about these two technologies and went through the lectures very quickly.",
    "One strength was definitely how the last instructor showed us the machines. I wished that more of the other professors did that as well. But time constraints probably prevented this from happening.",
    "It was nice that have people who specialize in the particular topic come and teach the lectures.",
    "The strengths of the class are the information imparted. The weaknesses are the administration of the course, specifically the homework assigned. Students often time are not given advanced notice of the assignments, especially from the faculty not in charge of the class. The course could be improved by a detailed syllabus with deadlines and all of the homework associated with the course.",
    "Strengths: application of different methods Weakness: too much technique background which are hard to understand",
    "The course offers different topics to explore; however, the relevance and applicability of this course to my PhD project is virtually non-existent. So far this has been the least relevant course I have taken so far in my academic career which includes my undergraduate, post-bac, masters and PhD studies. I think this course SHOULD NOT BE a REQUIRED class but instead an ELECTIVE, as many students struggle to find the connection between the topics covered in this class and their research interests.",
    "The course should be designed more to allow understanding of how biochemical\/biophysical analysis is done logistically, not just theoretically\/hypothetically.",
    "Professor Pollard is a great teacher and knows his field well. Some of the guest lecturers were obviously great scientists, bot not always great teachers. Given the lack of biochem\/physics some of the class has, the ability of the instructor to teach was critical to the success of the lecture.",
    "The strength is that it introduces us with different techniques which will be incorporated in research. However, I think some topics need to be covered in more depth rather than one or two lectures. Also, it would be nice if there was office hour for students so that they can ask questions outside of class.",
    "I think that the description of how different techniques work and how they can be applied to specific kinds of problems, what techniques can and cannot do, was really useful. The weakness is the same weakness I've seen in every course that relies on many guest lecturers, which is that some of the lecturers spoke well to the purpose of the course, and others gave such surface level dives into a technique that it didn't impart much useful information. Naming many versions of a technique and saying that they exist is much less meaningful than taking a more in depth approach to how one might use a specific example of the technique, and then pointing us to a resource that has more versions.",
    "The greatest weakness of this course is the final paper assignment. While having students write a grant proposal can be very useful practice for their PhD, the restrictions of this assignment do not allow for good critical thinking and experimental design.",
    "The structure of the class makes sense, and I enjoyed breaking up lecture time with discussion. I also found the peer review of my final project proposal to be very helpful. Some of the lectures were less useful than others. For instance, the microscopy and kinetics lectures made me feel like I could go to lab and know which controls I needed, which machines to use, and how to prep the sample. Other lectures, (mostly the cryo-EM and Cytof lectures) taught me a lot about the theory behind the system and less about how to actually implement the system.",
    "Strengths - The most useful lectures were binding kinetics, cryo EM, crystallography, microscopy, and mass spec. The most useful assignment was the final paper. Weaknesses - There were too many homework assignments given that this was a graduate level course. More than one assignment a week felt like a distraction from my lab work. I would've preferred a bi-weekly problem set and that the paper discussions didn't require a turned in assignment. Also some lectures were too focused on that professor's research rather than general principles.",
    "I think that some of the lectures by certain professors were not as well organized or thought out. Dr. Pollard's lectures were especially good and he had a great grasp on what he wanted to do with his time in the classroom which was especially helpful. His homework assignments were also very helpful and helped to make sure I understood the information necessary. Dr. Reinisch's were also excellent! Some other assignments were much more basic or did not provide a great deal of insight. I thought it was difficult that the assignments were not really graded on any sort of scale, so I did not know where I stood in terms of grades in the class going into the final paper at all and am unsure what my grade will be, especially given that I'm not 100% sure how the final proposals will be evaluated.",
    "I didn't seem very useful to my field of study, and the methods were outdated. I think it should be an elective.",
    "Strengths: help students learn some useful biophysics method and encourage them to think in a biophysics way. Weakness: it should not be a core course. Should be a elective course"

    "Perhaps. If they think that they'll be doing a lot of biochemistry then yes. Otherwise, they may be better served learning that on their own.",
    "Definitely! I think I gained a good deal in terms of information from the course that would be widely applicable to many research projects in the biological sciences.",
    "I would recommend it to someone looking to develop some understanding of quantitative methods for their biochemistry Ph.D., but not for most MCGD students."
