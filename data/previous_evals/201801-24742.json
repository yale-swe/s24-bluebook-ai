   "comments": [
    "Overview of history and theory of education, through an intensely critical lens.",
    "I learned a lot about educational institutions and their shortcomings, content of which I'd never learned about before really.",
    "A critical eye to modern education.",
    "A history of educational institutions with an emphasis on the modern research university, configured through a critical lens.",
    "I gained greater insight into the intricacies of education and various education methods and paradigms over the course of history. It has led me to reflect more critically on my own educational experiences.",
    "I learned a lot about education history and theory, and that knowledge forms a very insightful foundation for recognizing and understanding current problems and complexities of education systems.",
    "I learned about the way in which education theory does not always meet practice. I learned how to critique the education system of meritocracy while being part of it. I also learned how to read several viewpoints on a particular subject related to education, and how to create an opinion from these sometimes diverging viewpoints. I also worked on making an original syllabus, and how to critique someone else's syllabus. I feel that I was able to begin to comprehend the immense complexity that exists within the educational system that we often don't unravel.",
    "This course offered the unique opportunity to discuss critically the educational system we are in and that brought us to Yale. I developed valuable insight about how history informs the present and efforts to change the future in education."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Seminar discussion could be hit or miss, depending on how the class reacted to a particular week's readings. I suggest reformatting some discussions so that they are more than ~90 minutes of back and forth between the students and the instructor some other political science seminars use \"lead discussants\" for each reading, which would do this course good. Otherwise, a phenomenal course!",
    "The assignments were so great because we got to be creative, while also being intellectually challenged, and the creativity aspect is something I've missed all my time at Yale. Professor Levy-Eichel did a good job of trying to engage everyone in discussion.",
    "STRENGTHS: vibrant texts, engaging discussions, a teacher who's passionate about his subject. WEAKNESSES: sometimes we focused so intensely on critique that we didn't discuss how that critique might be implemented how the flaws of the system might be practically addressed. I'm all for a bit of rebellion, but revolution requires material change.",
    "I thought that the course explored facets of education that aren't frequently covered in other courses. I also found the assignments really intriguing and different from other coursework. Professor Levy-Eichel also frequently played devil's advocate which I felt encouraged me to reflect more critically upon my own preconceptions of the course material. In terms of weaknesses, I think it would have been beneficial to have had more guidelines on assignments and more consistent feedback throughout the course. Oftentimes I felt it was difficult to really know what to expect or how how I was performing. Also, I wish that the oral exam had been more geared towards critical reflection on course material and less towards minor details in the readings.",
    "The readings and class discussions were a definite strength. The readings were very interesting and provided varying perspectives. They simulated engaging class discussions. This was definitely my favorite part of the class. The interactive group projects were also very fun to organize and sit through. One CLEAR weakness was all the required printing! I wasted so much paper, ink, and time printing the readings. Some weeks we would print 100+ pages of readings. Towards the end of the semester the professor allowed us to use laptops but that was way too late. We shouldve been allowed to use laptops from the start.",
    "Strengths of this course are that the professor is extremely knowledgeable and approachable, and keeps class interesting with a very sarcastic sense of humor. Another strength is that the readings are mostly very interesting and conducive to good discussion. A weakness is that the grading is rather slow.",
    "One great strength of the course was how our professor let us ask questions and talk to one another rather than dominating classes. An assignment of the class was to teach the other students in the class about a particular subject within the readings. I felt like I could take the content of our readings into my own hands in this way. I also felt that the times that class deviated from the topic of the day, the discussions would still often be fruitful. I loved this class.",
    "The class discussions were the best part about this course. Professor Levy-Eichel asks great questions, and all classes were lively as a result. The assignments in this course (the syllabus project, the syllabus critique, the final oral exam) were all very heavy, and expectations for all of them were generally unclear. I appreciated the freedom, but would have liked some guidance."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, to anyone interested in education from a policy, theory or history perspective.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in history, philosophy, and most importantly, education, then this course is for you!",
    "Yes, this is a great meta-analysis of education, and can be a great place to work through and analyze your own ideas for education.",
    "Yes, with caveats. The assigned reading is full of fire, so it's no trouble to finish. The discussions are always interesting, so the seminar breezes by. The only major assignment is to write your own syllabus for a made-up class, which is fun. If you're a big fan of institutions, you might have less fun than I did, but I think it's always useful to approach the powers that shape us through a critical lens.",
    "I would recommend this course as the material and the way it was presented were both really captivating. However, I think that there are definitely improvements that could be made in terms of course organization and feedback. Hopefully those changes are made in future iterations of the course.",
    "Yes! This is a very cool course covering a wide range of education issues. Its a great course for everyone, even if youre not in the educational studies program (which many people were not).",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in education history and theory.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I think that it's taught in a way that isn't really traditional to Yale, in that a lot of the emphasis is truly placed on students' creativity and originality. I learned how to think outside the framework of how I had previously internalized the educational system and this was really valuable for me, even outside the context of the class.",
    "Other students should definitely take this course. Studying the historical narrative that got us to where we are now in education is invaluable, especially through a critical lens. This class has the potential to change how students think about their current and next steps in their educations."
