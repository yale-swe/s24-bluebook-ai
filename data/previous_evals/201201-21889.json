    "The course offers a nice introduction to archaeological practice, including excavation, analysis, and reporting.",
    "The continuation of the previous semester's archaeological dig. This is where you analyze what you have uncovered and compose your chapter report. It is a good way to find out how archaeology is performed and a good learning experience. The instructor and TF are very helpful if you are having trouble. Workload is low. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in archaeology or is looking for an easier social science credit.",
    "I'm pretty sure this class isn't being offered again, but just in case it is, I would recommend it if you are in serious need of less work so you have time to do something else. I'm glad I took the class because it gave me time to discover extra-curriculars I love, but I don't think I learned much from the class."
