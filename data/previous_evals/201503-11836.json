    "Take this class if you're interested in philosophy and\/or social issues. Tim is really nice and provides helpful, constructive feedback on your writing.",
    "I would summarize it as a class that explores the limits of equality and analyzes equality more than discussing how certain systems can be adjusted in order for equality to become more abundant. I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in understanding what the words \"right\" and \"equality\" even mean.",
    "This a great class to take for a freshman writing credit, and the subject is very interesting and topical in current events. The class never became boring due to the extensive nature of the subject, and the class discussion was engaging.",
    "If you are worried about your writing skills this is a great class to take.",
    "The best english 114 class you could take. With an awesome teacher and interesting coursework as well.",
    "Yes I would recommend the class if you are interested in \"inequality\" in general and how people interpreted it throughout the ages. It focuses on the problems with the concept and what things make it hard to address. That's why it's called \"the trouble with equality\" The best aspect of the class was that we looked at very contemporary sources and studied Black Lives Matter. We even veered off course and took a week to discuss inequality in terms of the 2015 racial movement at Yale. The readings are all kind of long, but it's only hard to get through them when they're from a long time ago--the contemporary ones are interesting and easy to get through.",
