    "Familiarity with modern Arabic literature, a few news articles",
    "I learned a lot about prominent authors in the Arab world. We specifically covered Choukris work thoroughly.",
    "My understanding of Arab culture improved through an exploration of literature. I was exposed to new ideas and vocabulary.",
    "Reading Arabic literary texts",
    "Skills in analyzing Arabic literature, exposure to a wide range of styles and themes in Arabic literature",
    "Saw a lot of Arabic literature, giving an insight to this different manner of literary writing.",
    "Learned to piece together some very difficult MSA texts.",
    "It was interesting to learn more about the variety of literature in Arabic and the beauty of it. However, the material was generally too difficult for me, and I didn't understand the stories we read even after spending hours translating words. I would have developed more knowledge and insight if it were more suited to students who had finished the L4 level.",
    "My reading and writing got so much better, I'm so grateful! Other Arabic classes I took before were very speaking focused, so this helped me round out my skills."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: engaging, ow-stress, nice introduction to modern Arabic literature Weaknesses: didn't practice much speaking or learn much new vocabulary, didn't really practice the practical skills of using a language",
    "Very interesting course content with a focus on important literary work",
    "Professor Elbousty is very passionate and cares about his students. The TA was also very helpful. I would have liked more emphasis on speaking in class. Also I would have also liked more vocabulary acquisition\/ lists of vocabulary for reading passages. Some of the texts were also too elevated for our Arabic level (meaning there was too much google translate involved which didnt actually help us learn). Maybe starting with simpler passages would be helpful.",
    "Professor Elbousty is extremely passionate and that is a huge strength. I also liked the pacing of the class. One thing that may Ive been helpful was rather than switching texts every week, having some sort of continuity. I understand the way that it was structured allowed for exploration of different authors, however I think for the sake of vocabulary, etc reading one or Just a few texts would be beneficial.",
    "Super advanced",
    "I wish there was more of a focus on speaking\/conversation and a more systematic way to learn the vocab used in the texts we were reading. I also wish we had greater opportunities to practice the grammatical concepts learned in L3 and L4 Arabic.",
    "Getting an insight into Arabic literature is eye opening to something I had not really considered before. Need more media Arabic to build vocabulary regarding day to day topics.",
    "This class would be a lot stronger if students were taught about the literary tools, sentence structure, and more advanced vocabulary used in arabic literature either before reading pieces, during, or even after. Without it, the reading became very mechanic, and students often forgot much of the material once we had moved on to a new text.",
    "Elbousty is extremely friendly and cares about your success. He also has really cool TAs that are helpful. The biggest weakness is that the stories are too advanced for the class's level, and it makes learning new vocabulary overwhelming. Also it would be nice to review some grammar on occasion.",
    "The strength of this course is that the instructor is very kind and enthusiastic about the subject. Also, the instructor is specifically dedicated to promoting a way of teaching Arabic that doesn't play into stereotypes of Arabs or politicize Arabic, but instead explores Arab culture and diversity and social critiques. However, the major weakness of this course is that it was taught at a level completely inappropriate for the students. Even the native speaker students in our class had a hard time keeping up. At the beginning of the course, I spent hours translating nearly every single word of the texts we were reading, using Google Translate, but by the end of it, still couldn't understand what the story was trying to say. Reading literature and conducting literary analysis in English for native speakers is difficult--doing it in Arabic, after only 2 years of classes in very basic vocabulary and grammar, makes it nearly impossible for us to understand complex literature and poetry that contains vocabulary that is too high level for me even in English, and nuances that even native speakers struggle with. After a month or so in, I felt extremely demotivated to continue, and stopped reading the texts for homework, as I wasn't getting anything out of it. When you're using Google Translate to translate over 100 words per story, that are all extremely high-level and nuanced and don't repeat in any of the following stories that we read, it's extremely difficult to learn anything. Our teacher didn't provide us ways to memorize the words or to remember them, but kept giving us too-high-level texts. I wanted to be challenged, but the texts were so challenging that they didn't provide a way to grow, but were only demotivating. I could only begin to understand the basic storyline after being in class and having our teacher lecture us on it; thus, I stopped trying to do the homework and grew demotivated. Unfortunately, I think most people in class felt this way--the class was at a level that was inappropriate for all of us. Furthermore, this class also didn't provide a way to improve writing, as we were meant to be writing weekly journals, but didn't get feedback on our writing until the very end of class, which meant that if we were making mistakes, we didn't know about it until 3 months in. Mostly, the teacher would praise us on our writing, even though I think most of us were very confused about the content, and this praise didn't help, as it didn't provide a way to grow or learn. Furthermore, the class also did not provide a way to improve speaking, as the material we were speaking was very difficult and complex literary analysis that was past the ability of most of the class, and so the professor ended up speaking most of the class, even sometimes cutting off students who were trying to struggle through speaking. A way to improve this could be to have class-wide debates or discussions, and actually let students speak more. Also, the professor would speak for large segments of the class in English, or would mix Arabic and English, leading to bad habits in the students and letting students speak in English instead of struggling through in Arabic and actually learning how to communicate. Overall, this class had extremely difficult material, but was a very low intellectual challenge, as most of the class felt demotivated after the first few weeks to actually do the readings, and we weren't pushed to actually improve our Arabic. I actually felt like my Arabic abilities decreased. While I think the main idea of teaching Arabic in a way that emphasizes culture and society should be kept, as it is very problematic that Arabic is politicized the way it is in America, the end goal of the class should always be student improvement in Arabic. Most of my classmates and I felt very demotivated and learned little in this class, despite having entered excited and enthusiastic about Arabic.This class should be completely restructured and reevaluated.",
    "I LOOOVE Elbousty's focus on literature. It opens up the Arab world in a way that the usual focus on politics\/war\/terrorism cannot. I wish I could take this class forever, and I wish L2-L4 showed us excerpts from literature as well. I found myself having to Google translate 85% of words, one by one, in most texts. (Maybe this is because I just didn't know enough Arabic to take the class!) Every language class I've taken in the past actually banned Google translate because translation is not super conducive to language learning. I feel like I spent a lot of time just mechanically translating and writing down new words with no real way to remember them. It would be great to have an official list of ~20 words a week taken from the texts that we would have to use in class and homework a lot, to really get them into our brains."

    "Do it if you want to complete L5 and to work with the incredibly kind, accommodating and knowledgable professors, but don't expect to feel that your Arabic improves immensely",
    "I would recommend Professor Elbousty as an instructor, but not this particular course (with its current formatting).",
    "Yes, if you would like to continue learning Arabic!",
    "This class is great if you are interested in Arabic literature, Prof. Elbousty is incredibly knowledgable and passionate about the subject matter and it is a great experience to be taught by him - however the class is taught very differently than the lower level classes and as such I don't think it is a great class to take if you want to focus on grammar and conversation.",
    "If includes a larger proportion of media arabic.",
    "Yes if you are interested in continuing to learn Arabic.",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student, for the reasons stated above in Question 3. I no longer feel motivated to take another Arabic course at this university, given the experience I had in this class. This class didn't improve our Arabic skills, and actually made me feel like my Arabic got worse.",
    "Yes, if Jonas is teaching! The workload is very manageable, for an Arabic class."
