   "comments": [
    "You will learn advanced Japanese, but you will not be forced to memorize anything. This class is what you make out of it. 9am was rough at times, but totally worth it. This class really isn't too much work.",
    "Yes, if you want to practice advanced oral Japanese.",
    "Yes!! This was the first semester of this course ever, so I imagine that it will develop and change in the future. Furthermore, this was a rather unique semester since the majority of the course were native speakers. This semester, everyone in the class was fluent (again, majority native speakers, and others were people who completed 5th year and THEN did even more advanced study abroad, so it was essentially native and\/or 7th year + level), and most classes were filled with random discussions on topics we chose together with Hiroe sensei. We just talked about everything ranging from the decline of musical taste in the modern world to nuclear policy. Other than that we watched documentaries and wrote a lot (about 1 or 2 essays a week, from 2-4 pages). What made this class more valuable this year was the unique composition of the class and the strength of this year's students, and I'm not sure how likely it is for this to occur again in the future. Nevertheless, the class is fun and rewarding regardless, and for a light workload. Hiroe sensei is incredible and a honor to learn from, so take this class!",
    "Great practice of spoken professional Japanese and not too much work. Highly recommended especially if you want to work in Japan.",
    "Take it! Much less reading-based than other upper-level Japanese classes. There was still, however, quite a bit of writing. This was usually a kansobun, reflections on whatever subject we had covered in class discussion\/exercise. The more innovative components--international skype sessions, out-of-class interview--worked wonderfully."
