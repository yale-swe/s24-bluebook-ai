   "comments": [
    "Take it for sure if you're an environmental studies major regardless of your interest in forestry specifically. Wonderful especially for students not well-versed in political\/IR theory. I was very inspired and the class has changed my interests in a very exciting way.",
    "Low workload and you learn some interesting stuff if you're interested in forestry specifically (the class should be called global forest governance, not global environmental governance...). The lectures are pretty disorganized though and I personally found it frustrating having to write papers in political science. (Like, for every single paper paper the authors don't tell you their conclusions in the abstract so you'll have to read their full paper. Then, you read through 30 pages of blah blah and in the end you're told that there's no actual results but that more research should be done on the topic...)",
    "yes. The theory was eye opening. But be warned that this should be called global FORESTRY governance",
    "Good course but extremely disorganized. I wish it focused more on the theory. By the end of the course I was really tired of all the acronyms associated with forest governance and I think if I hear \"causal logic\" one more time I might vomit. Cashore's a really nice guy and clearly knows his stuff, but his expectations were never clear. Our TA Chelsea completely saved the day and deserves a raise. Overall, learned a lot but wouldn't really recommend the course unless it were completely restructured.",
    "Take it for a good overview of environmental governance, but if you're an undergrad be prepared be surrounded by FES students who are very knowledgable in the field.",
    "I would only recommend it if you are very interested in governance specifically related to forestry. Also, I would only take it if you are ok with spontaneity in terms of assignments and the class's organization.",
    "Great class if you are interested in global environmental governance. Mainly focuses on forestry, however the policies and governance covered pertains to all environmental issues. You walk out of every class with a thorough and deep understanding of environmental governance on the global scale, and how governments and institutions work together from the local to the national, to the global levels."
