   "comments": [
    "510 is sort of survey course on various methods from detecting signals that arise in biological settings. There is a strong emphasis on imaging, and you will have to do very minimal math. Broad concepts are emphasized; at the end of the semester you are better suited to understand, on a basic level, a much wider range of research that may have seemed foreign to you before. You are equipped with basic knowledge of how biological measurements can be made. These concepts apply to many disparate fields, this course gives you a lot of bang for your buck... so to speak.",
    "I will cover basics of MR, fluorescence and PET. Yes, I recommend to anyone who is interested in these topics.",
    "A required class with a lot of information that is not that difficult. I would recommend it.",
    "This is an involved survey class of imaging methods with an emphasis on MRI. It has a manageable work load and if you are interested in imaging, it is worth taking.",
    "ENAS is a course that suffers from trying to cover to much and not having a succinct aim. Unfortunately for most of the students taking the course it is a required course, however, I would not recommend it to students who have other options. Overall there is great room for improvement and potential in the material that is shrouded by the convoluted way the course is arranged and run.",
    "ENAS 510 is an introductory course in Biomedical Imaging. The physical principles and some details of the major techniques used in Imaging and Biosensing (MRI, MRS, PET, Fluorescence and FRET), are provided. It is recommended to all the students who are using imaging techniques or spectroscopy in their research.",
    "Yes. It is helpful.",
    "Course with various speakers that teaches about multiple imaging modalities.",
    "I don't feel that I exited this class with a semester's worth of knowledge gained.",
    "Broad overview of bioimaging topics. Helpful professors and homework topics. Also, the TA Christina was very helpful.",
    "This course is an overview of many of the fundamental bioimaging and biosensing modalities that make up the imaging field in biomedical engineering. This is an important course because it shows the potential and capabilities of medical imaging with regard to biomedical engineering research. I would recommend this course to incoming students as it serves as a general overview of the imaging and sensing capabilities."

   "comments": [
    "Helps build Basics \/ fundamental of popular imaging techniques and principles.",
    "I feel that it would deepen my knowledge a lot if I was interested in imaging. However, I am interested in tissue engineering. The professors were good however and I learned a lot.",
    "I don't really have an interest in imaging, so this did not really help me in anyway.",
    "I don't think the course really contributed at all to my planned dissertation\/research.",
    "It helps me have a glimpse at the novel bioimaging equipments.",
    "It helped me to learn about a broad spectrum of various imaging modalities and will be very helpful in my future research and academic pursuits.",
    "Gave me better insight into the use of imaging applications for the area of my research. Overall, helpful course.",
    "This course broadened my understanding of the topics covered, and showed the potential for supplementing dissertation research and study. Although it may not pertain directly to my dissertation research, the course showed that the facilities at Yale have many possibilities for contributing to research."
