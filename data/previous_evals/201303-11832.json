   "comments": [
    "Intro to Black and White Photography is a wonderful class, though I am biased because I want to study photo at Yale. You will learn how to use a manual film camera to take photos, then develop them and print them. Making physical photos is incredibly rewarding. You make prints in the darkroom and you often run into your other classmates. Printing together in the darkroom is awesome--sharing this time and looking at each other's photos makes the class become very close and bonded.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student so long as he or she is very willing to put in time commitment and actually care about growing as an artist\/photographer. Though it is an astoundingly fun and transformative course, you have to work hard to see such growth.",
    "Take it! Lisa is wonderful, if you have her, and if you have an interest in photography, the work doesn't seem like work, even though it is time consuming.",
    "If you are interested in Black and White Photography, take this class, you'll learn everything you need to in an intro class. Also, don't take it if your class schedule is already very time-consuming, you need to spend a lot of time on this class.",
    "It's a great class that makes you think more about photography. It requires that you work hard to get good outcomes from your prints and photos.",
    "An awesome class, I highly recommend it to anyone whether you know anything about photography or not. It is awesome to work in the darkroom and the professor is great. It is technique intensive so you can still take it even if you have never shot a film camera before. Lots of work but so worth it.",
    "Art 136 01 is a very very intense course. This is not a gut or an easy art credit. You will spend countless hours in the darkroom and become frustrated and maybe even a few emotional breakdowns. But you will improve so much in your photography. I did not know anything about photography coming into the course and now I am dedicated to becoming a photographer, majoring in art, and am obsessed with photography. Even if you do not want to become a photographer, the course teaches you how to see the worldin a different way and will change how you think about the world and relationships. I would recommend this course very highly.",
    "Take the class, because there is such excitement, meditation, and power in having a camera in your hands; for a semester (and beyond), you're given the responsibility of taking four corners and cropping out little segments of your world for everyone else to see.This class isn't easy--it's time consuming and the critiques can be tough. If this is far beyond your comfort zone, take it Cr\/D. You're expected to spend 10 hours outside of class on your work, but it's entirely worth it, I think, as both an introduction to photography and an introduction to a new way of seeing.A note: if you're new to photography and seek mentorship both in terms of technique and artistry, you have to seek it on your own. Talk to your classmates, your TF, and your teacher, because you don't want to go on shooting, developing, and printing terrible shots. Indeed, feedback is limited beyond the three critiques, unless you take the initiative to seek it.",
    "Intro Photo BW is a great course for all of those interested in film photography. It starts from the very basics, not going over basic photographic techniques until quite late. Those with previous experience may find the first half of the semester quite slow but it gets better towards the end.",
    "I would recommend the class. I learned a lot about photography as an art form; I came away from the class with a new way of seeing the world.",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale, in my experience. It will teach you so much about not only photography but looking at the world as a whole. I'd recommend it to anyone who can see. It's certainly not easy, but every bit of work is worth it!"
