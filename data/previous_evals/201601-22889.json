   "comments": [
    "Terrific! If you want to learn qual research, definitely take it!",
    "Above. I would certainly recommend 505 to another student. I think it is an essential item for any political science student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The field project is extremely helpful...I don't think there is a substitute for this kind of hands-on project. Even though I don't plan to extend my project beyond this class, I learned some very helpful lessons.",
    "I believe this course is good at offering you the very basic techniques of field research and planning, but there is not much in-class group discussion of general problema that everyone has. I think the strength of this class is that it really does make sure we are informed of the different ways to partake in and analyze qualitative research. However, it's biggest weakness may be that it was not used as a necessary space to troubleshoot people's issues with the qualitative field research process. I would still suggest this course to anyone with the hopes that the course allows for more free discussion of general setbacks that people have.",
    "I would summarize the course as an unmatched opportunity to learn the ins and outs of field research. The balance between methods instruction and hands-on experiential learning is ideal insofar as students have the opportunity to actually carry out a project without the many risks of a trial by fire approach. I would absolutely recommend the course to any PhD student in political science, sociology, anthro, etc. interested in qualitative and\/or mixed-methods research. I would likewise recommend the course to quantitatively-oriented researchers interested in better engaging with non-quantitative work."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with my first opportunity to conduct qualitative field research, try my hand at interviewing and participant observation, and grasp the way ethnographic evidence is used to make an argument.",
    "As above, the hands-on learning is extremely valuable and gives me confidence about conducting an ethnographic project for my dissertation in the future.",
    "This class, especially with the addition of a few students from non-political science backgrounds, deepened my knowledge in social sciences as and field research as tools for exposing nuanced truths. While I first thought that these nuanced truths prove useless in the change of policies, I am now aware that intentional and good qualitative research can support quantitative findings or identify issues that quantitative studies tend to miss. This course definitely improved my comfort with performing interviews and planning field research. I believe this will serve me well as I progress in my research over the next few years.",
    "This course is an essential introduction to field research in the social sciences. Almost every political science major should take this course, not only to learn how to conduct research using field methods such as relational interviews, elite interviews, and participant observation, but also to see how knowledge is produced from these methods. In an age where an unprecedented wealth of knowledge can be accessed from the computer, most students neglect the value of learning from the field and the subjects they are studying. Being able to glean knowledge from events on the ground and understand how people in the field interpret their circumstances is crucial to answering questions in political science. This is why I think it was a must-take for my own growth as a scholar."
