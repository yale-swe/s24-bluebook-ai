   "comments": [
    "Definitely much less work than other undergraduate biology courses. After the first two p-sets, you realize that you don't have to pay attention in lecture. If you find 2-3 partners to do the p-sets with, you should be golden. I spent 3-4 hours every other week, and 1-2 hours on the weeks in between. No final exam.",
    "Definitely gives you a way to think about genetic approaches to biological questions, but don't think that this will necessarily give you the knowledge of basic genetics if you don't already know it. It lurks in the background, but is not taught explicitly. Carefully consider whether this course or MCDB genetics is the right one for you.",
    "A good class for upperclassmen in MBB or MCDB: take this class if you want to listen to interesting people talk, read some important papers, and understand different research methods. The class is not difficult (no tests), but does require some creativity to do the take-home questions and persistence in reading and understanding papers. I think this is a decent class, most appropriate for undergraduates considering research careers and who already have some biology research experience. In summary, it's an okay class: not too hard, not too easy, not exceptionally interesting, but not too dull either.",
    "Great if you need a light course. Also, there is no final which was very nice. I have no idea what grade I'm going to get- the grading seems very arbitrary. We'll see I guess.",
    "I would recommend the class as it is less work than the Undergraduate genetics course and it also is more useful.",
    "Great upper-level MB&B course! Take this!!!",
    "It is an interesting class that allows you to learn without any pressure from an examination. However, it advertises that no background in genetics is required, but you would get much more out of the course if you have a good basis in genetics going in.",
    "If you are an MB&B major and need an elective, this is the class for you. It is fun, easy, and you will learn a lot. Definitely take it.",
    "A good, fun, interesting class to take. Take it with some friends and the problem sets will become more fun to do. Manageable work load, as long as you don't wait until the last minute.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in research and need an easy class to add to your load.",
    "This is a pretty easy course if you're looking for an upper-level MCDB elective. You have to write about seven one-page responses to scientific papers that are graded really easily, as well as do six take-home questions on which you're encouraged to collaborate with other students. I'm not sure how much I learned\/retained, but I enjoyed the light workload. It's a great course if you're going to be busy applying to medical school and going on interviews.",
    "Chill upper-level MCDB course-- you will be thanking yourself for taking this over Immunobio or another exam-based course many times throughout the semester. Definitely must less stressful. You might not retain as much, but you do learn a lot from lectures if you're willing to apply yourself and the homework really does help you synthesize everything presented in lecture and obtain a deeper understanding. It's also really helpful to be able to work in a study group to review and discuss answers so plan to take the course with friends or find a group early on if you can.",
    "It's an ok class.",
    "It's a good course to take to learn about genetics from a more experimental point of view. We focused on designing genetic screens and other techniques, rather than focusing on the specific details of mitosis, etc. Since there's no midterm or final, it's low stress, but you'llhave no idea what your grade will be.",
    "This course gives an excellent instruction on the basic techniques of designing a genetics experiment, with an emphasis on recently introduced technologies. All the lectures were quite enlightening, though the location of the class at the medical school was not entirely ideal. The workload is certainly manageable, though the level varies wildly from week to week. Having a group with which to review the take home questions assigned (six assignments of 1-2 single-spaced pages) and the assigned journal articles is helpful."
