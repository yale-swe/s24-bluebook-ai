    "I learned more about the First Amendment and how to think through the ethics of First Am cases.",

    "I learned a lot about the paradigm through which one may view law and think through complicated legal issues. I also learned a lot about the First Amendment and the surprisingly vast range of situations and considerations to which it applies.",
    "An understanding of the basic jurisprudence of first amendment issues in the US system, with a focus on Connecticut case law. Mostly focused on the nuances of ethical dilemmas and decisions within this context.",
    "I learned how to more critically think about the first amendment in today's world, especially as it pertains to social media and the internet. I also learned how to discuss case law flexibly, with an eye towards the doctrine itself, but also the individuals who created it.",
    "We covered historical issues of free speech in Supreme Court cases, and discussed theoretical definitions of speech as they pertain to more modern forms of speech and censorship (i.e. internet, social media, etc.)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths were the discussions, materials\/readings, and of course, Prof. Goodrow. At times, it would have been helpful if Karen had directed the conversation more so that we didn't get sidetracked.",
    "course material was great, course discussions depends heavily on the students and sometimes got significantly off topic (it was fun, just sometimes didn't learn the most). you don't have to read the readings but you get a lot out of them.",
    "I loved the speculation and thoughtfulness of the course, and it was fun to think through tough legal issues. That said, sometimes the conversations turned to pure speculation, without being rooted in text or law, which made it difficult to parse through what was valid and what was bs. I think that it would be beneficial if Karen talked a little more, but I also respect that she wanted students to lead. Overall a great course and thought experiment, and every conversation was engaging and fascinating.",
    "Great course! Manageable work and Karen is amazing!",
    "Strengths: - Professor Goodrow is an amazing teacher and human being. Her story and her humor is inspiring and each class inspires you to try harder for the next. - Material is never dry and builds on itself - The class environment is very collaborative and relaxed. Super conducive for learning Weaknesses: - The class could have a little bit more structure...i.e having someone present some of the readings at the beginning of the class",
    "The course was, as a whole, well organized. The syllabus was clear with respect to the structure of the course, which naturally built upon itself as it went on. The exams were similarly good metrics for assessing strength of comprehension while leaving room for creative interpretations."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! I learned a lot and had a great time. Karen makes coming to class fun.",
    "yes, if you are into first amendment issues, also it is not a high stress environment",
    "Absolutely, Karen is fantastic, the material is interesting and the conversations are a lot of fun.",
    "Yes - Judge Goodrow is an excellent professor. Class discussion is interesting and readings, for the most part, are interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes! A fantastic course that teaches about the legal aspects of interesting first amendment cases and asks us to consider the ethical aspects in more depth than I have done with other courses.",
    "This course was an utter disappointment. Professor Goodrow is an extraordinary person, however she is a weak discussion leader who has difficulty guiding the conversations to their full pedagogical potential. Maybe it was because our class did not jive well together, but the way Professor Goodrow allowed students to ramble on about issues that are in no way relevant to the First Amendment made class an academic free-for-all. Perhaps the best part of the course were the readings themselves, and if you actually do them (aka invest the time to understanding them at a decently profound level), you will walk away with a decent foundation of First Amendment law. Having said that, at this point I would recommend the class only to those who can tolerate circular discussions, and only to those who are patient enough to sit through unrelated rambling. There is so much potential in this course, and I do believe that Professor Goodrow can be a good fit, however she needs to give her style of class leadership a serious makeover.",
    "Yes! Judge Karen is the chillest professor you will have at Yale, super approachable and her classroom discussions are the most open and laid back from any class I have ever taken at Yale",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would! This is a great 5th class, as it's not a ton of work (midterm and final paper). There's a lot of reading, but you go over it in class and most discussion revolves around personal interpretations of ethics, not so much the actual legal text. Karen is super fun to hang out with and talk to, and the late time of the class really makes it feel like a fun book club more than a laborious task. Take this class if you can get in!"
