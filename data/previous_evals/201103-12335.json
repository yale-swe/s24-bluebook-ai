    "Yes, take it! It will change your life. Well, not really but it will change the way you look at typography especially at a book. Alice is great, the assignments really explore the extent of what type can do.",
    "If you have even the smallest interest in typography, this class is amazing. You gain a breadth of knowledge and considerable know-how with typesetting and the likes. It was a great mix of practical knowledge and creative advancement. It's certainly a fair amount of work - and it can be overwhelming when the projects overlap, as they usually do - but again, so worth it. Anyone would be lucky to study with Alice.",
    "Harry is cool. At first kind of intimidating and seemed aloof, but turned out to be awesome and really helpful.",
    "Yes, though it is a fair amount of work, it is a useful basic course that can be applied to much more than graphic design.",
    "I would summarize the course as a challenging but very worthwhile class. You learn a lot about how to use typography versus other graphic elements to communicate ideas. The finished products are impressive -- the course sharpens your ability to look at things very precisely and to deal with technical issues like printing, cutting, finding paper...etc. to finish a project. So, I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in typography and are willing to do the work involved in the class."
