    "It's a lot of relatively simple work. You have to do work everyday, although it depends on the professor whether the homework is due every day or once a week. One ~150-200 word essay every week (obviously less the first couple of weeks)",
    "I would recommend this class and section to another student as I felt I learned all that I could given the time we had. You will learn all the foundations of the language and be confident enough to speak Italian openly by the time the course ends.",
    "Very difficult if you've never really had to actually learn a language, but totally worth it.",
    "Great intro to Italian. The work can build up if you don't constantly do the workbook assignments\/compositions, but it's really not all that bad. Try to take it with Siobhan if possible - she's a great teacher and really cool when you get to know her.",
    "As long as you keep up with the workbook and set aside time to review the new concepts, the class is fairly straightforward and really enjoyable."
