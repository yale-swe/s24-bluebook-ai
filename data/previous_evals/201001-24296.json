   "comments": [
    "CHNS 171 was overall a very strong course, that provided a good chance both to learn Classical Chinese and to read important works of Chinese philosophy and literature in their original form. That said, it could certainly have been better organized - a week by week syllabus, for instance, would have been nice.Wang Laoshi is hilarious - taking classes with her is a lot of fun.",
    "I would only recommend it if they are interested in the material. Classical Chinese can be arcane and at times seems impractical.",
    "I really liked the course.Strengths: The second part of the course is good in that it gives you a good sampling of some of the Chinese cannon, reading excerpts from a bunch of different really famousworks. The teacher also helps students to learn about the original meanings of individual characters to explain how the modern usage is derived. This is helpful for learners of the language in figuring out what terms mean when you encounter them. Because the course is discussed in modern vernacular, the student's speaking skills will also be improved.Weaknesses: We did not go over as much material as I would have wanted. Speaking skill seemed to be emphasized over reading skill. I would have preferred to be able to read more things and develop that skill more.Also, sometimes we would spend too long on a single piece of work going over seemingly useless cultural details. I think culture should be eschewed for the opportunity to learn more grammar.",
    "YES YES YES! Take it especially if Wang Laoshi is teaching it again! And take it only if it is taught in CHINESE. This class is usually taught in English though. I was lucky enough to take it with Wang Laoshi - as the class was conducted entirely in Chinese: reading, interpreting, and analyzing wenyan words and phrases in modern Chinese is so different than doing so in English. I would not have taken this class if it's taught in English.",
    "If you're interested in Chinese literature, history, or culture, you should definitely take this course. The readings we did in this course were a great introduction into the great works of Ancient China (Si Shu Wu Jing and the major schools philosophy) and other famous cultural tales. After two semesters I was able to read much more difficult Chinese literature such as Liang Qi Chao's Xin Min Shuo."
