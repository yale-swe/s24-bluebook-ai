    "I bet that a lot of the people reading this are doing Spanish L3 for the language requirement (as I did). I find language really boring and it is easily the subject I dislike the most. Taking Spanish 130 with Sebastin really helped negate this constant want to sleep in class. If you can, take the class with Sebastin.",
    "Quite a bit of work. Do the homework in advance, it helps",
    "Highly recommendable for anyone looking to fulfill the language requirement or for improving one's Spanish.",
    "It is a reasonable intermediate class if you are interested in continuing Spanish\/fulfilling language requirement.",
    "Only took this bc it's a graduation requirement, but good as could be",
    "Don't know",
    "I think the Spanish 130 02 class was enjoyable and helped my Spanish speaking a lot. I think I would recommend it with Sebastin because he is very high-energy and connected with his students."
