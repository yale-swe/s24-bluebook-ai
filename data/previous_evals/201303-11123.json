   "comments": [
    "Very interesting choice of readings- I am a senior political science major and have not read most of the authors on Capitalism and Ethics' reading list up until this semester with professor Latham.",
    "huge discrepancy depending on the students",
    "Absolutely! This is a great class to examine capitalism and general ethics. You learn so much about the development of philosophical thought over the ages and it really gets you to examine capitalism and socialism.",
    "I'd totally recommend it. Pretty easy seminar with a great professor!",
    "An interesting class. I enjoyed the particular philosophers that we read, it was interesting to see how each philosopher played off others. The class was nicely structured and I learned a lot!",
    "Yes definitely take it with Latham!",
    "If you're interested in some history of economic thought, take it. This course goes through the perspectives of some of the greats. Papers are a good chance to compare ideas, and I enjoyed discussions outside of class which were sparked by ideas in class.",
    "This was among my favorite classes at Yale. I've always been interested in the topic of capitalism and ethics, and this was the perfect seminar for that. Professor Latham chose a great selection of readings and offered deep insights into each author. He's a very knowledgeable and interesting professor. I left each class feeling like I had learned so much, which was refreshing for EPE seminars. The class was not theoretical at all, and very based in practical reality. Unfortunately, a big downside was that class discussion was slow and boring because participation wasn't included in the grade. Workload is pretty light outside of readings, which are enjoyable and not tedious anyway.",
    "The readings are super interesting and foundational, the kind of stuff that makes you think big thoughts about society and modernity and capitalism and art and human virtue and postgrad life and on and on and on but assigning (\/requesting\/reading instead of the actual readings) more focused extracts could be more productive. Latham is the kind of smart and sardonic but friendly and approachable guy who makes you immediately think \"cool dad\". His ability to spin gold out of the flax provided by some students is truly admirable. He's also great with extensions which you'll need since lets be real you'll most likely start the 7 page midterm paper as many hours before the deadline as the paper is long. However, the fall 2013 session had zero participation credit so half the class were seniors who didn't do the reading and spent all class online shopping. But the low quality of students the examination requirements and general premise of the class (lets be real again, every person majoring in plsc who likes taking about \"society\" and \"the economy\" but isn't more focused than that or particularly academic will try and take this class) is problematic. If you're in that group you might get away with your usual MO and get a B+\/A-, if you're not you will likely be slightly bored in discussion but still crush the papers."
