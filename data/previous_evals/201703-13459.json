   "comments": [
    "Lecture slides: 1. Too long 2. Too many words 3. Are not coherent with lecture 4. Too many graphs that do not show enough information or background 5. Scattered and unorganized 6. You mentioned to us in our presentations we need size 24 font and should include key ideas Lectures: 1. You normally have issues with timing( you seem to rush students when you ask them questions) 2. Not enough discussion throughout the groups 3. Breakout groups do not allow for the best use of time Assignments: 1. Way too many assignments which explains the slow turnover rate 2. Case study is always a final project, so allow us to take the whole semester to work on this 3. For the weeks we have assignments, you should not have a reading reflection due 4. Your feedback is always helpful but you do not have to provide feedback for the reading reflection since it is not a right or wrong answer, it is what we REFLECT on 5. Shorter assignments should not be right or wrong answers The class was great and we all learned a lot but the class needs some serious improvement on structure and your goals for the class. It seems like you have great intentions but maybe reflecting on what worked in the past with successful classes and structure could guide you. I feel like as a student we expect challenge but not the type of challenge that is masked by busy work.",
    "Strengths: Really interesting topics, an enormous amount of subject matter condensed into one semester, I learned a lot, very organized material, super interesting projects (debate, case study, presentations, and writing assignments). The class itself was extremely interesting and there were a lot of different types of assignments and ways of participating that made the class easy for many different learning styles. --The grading was a little harsh and there was so much reading every week. Sometimes it felt like I was treading water to keep afloat in the class amongst all of my other classes and commitments so I had a hard time fully reflecting on the material outside of the class.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I found it to be both challenging and informative. I think that the in-class discussions forced me to think about the issues with a different perspective. However, I did find most of the discussions to be somewhat superficial. Many of the issues and possible solutions discussed in the course have pros and cons. I found that we typically only discussed the pros. In a course that was supposed to be so heavily policy focused I think it is important to discuss both sides of the issue.",
    "Excellent course. Great interactive lectures that sparked interesting discussions. Student projects and presentation topics were very interesting.",
    "I think that this course was good in that it introduced me to the sources of information that are at my disposal to understand the effects of climate change. This includes the IPCC reports and the National Climate Assessment. I think that this course needs to do a much better job of giving students technical skills in addressing climate change. Let's talk more about the specifics of climate change activities and the science behind them instead of glossing over them.",
    "Strengths: - Readings - Class discussions - Break-out sessions Weaknesses: - Some lessons felt like the topics addressed were merely alternate forms of previously engaged topics (rehashing) - Uncertainty about the assessment structure (very specifically it felt like case study should've been at end, the final synthesis of all we'd learnt applied to a real life example)",
    "This was one of my absolute favorite courses at YSPH! I thought it was a great mix of lectures, reading, and discussion.",
    "The strengths of the course were principally, the instructor, coherent and challenging assignments, and stimulating readings. Regarding weaknesses, I would say that I did not feel quite engaged with the debate because the participation is limited. I would rather prefer to have a policy brief roundtable with stakeholders trying to analyse pros and cons of a public health policy.",
    "The course give an overall introduction to all public health aspects that related to climate change. The individual presentations are really informative. The overall workload is greater compared to other courses.",
    "This course serves as a great introduction to a breadth of topics at the intersection of climate change and public health. The instructor's knowledge and passion are strengths, as are most of the assignment types (especially the fun debate and case study). The lecture slides are clear and comprehensive. The weaknesses are the first and second open writing assignments, because the expectations weren't always clear. The weekly reflections were usually helpful, but the highly structured ones in the middle of the term weren't. So I am glad those changed back to Ope ended format.",
    "This course has been hands down the best in my three semesters at YSPH. The content is well distributed and thorough, the combination of readings and discussions, reading responses, and assignments is well balanced and effective for learning.",
    "This class does a great job providing the foundational information on climate change and health. It is a lot of smaller different types of assignments, so you have lots of opportunities to show your abilities. Dr. Dubrow is a hard grader, but it is because he wants students to learn. The class is very discussion based, so you need to do the reading."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Speaking and presentation skills need practice",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow is passionate, open-minded, eager, and excited about the subject that he teaches. He is kind and very considerate of our time and opinions. He is flexible in that he offers extensions when we really need them and takes the time we have for an assignment into consideration when he grades our work. He is very open to changing things in his class that we suggest, such as the reading reflections. It is obvious he really cares about his class; he will often mention something we wrote in our reading reflection in class so you can tell that he read them. He also posts comments on all of our reading reflections, which I appreciate. He gives really great feedback and makes class really fun and interesting. He also looks for outside resources to help us, like when he had us meet with the librarian. When he wants to change something in the syllabus, he consults us first. He treats us like adults. I would even go so far as to say he is the best professor that I've had at Yale and his passion is so apparent that it evokes that same passion to the class. He truly wants his students to succeed, is open to critique and suggestions, and makes this subject really fun to learn about. He is an organized professor and always comes to class prepared. He is so knowledgeable about the subject but also really wants to learn from us. On the other side of the token, he is a harsh grader. He has very high expectations for his students. The grading can be a little intense.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow did a very good job instructing this course. He was sensitive to student requests. He has also been the only professor to read my essays in such detail. He provided detailed feedback in a way that I have yet to experience at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Excellent instructor. Holds students to high standards and inspires them to meet those standards. Interesting project ideas and is always willing to hear feedback and suggestions from students. I really appreciated his consideration for our workloads and the timeline of project assignments.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0The instruction was good, but I felt like I did not learn that much from lectures because all the slides were put online and I was not expected to really retain any of the information from class lectures. Looking back I can see that the point was really on crafting a written argument. I think that this is a useful skill to have and I am glad I took the course for that reason.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Dr. Dubrow was incredibly responsive to student feedback and input. He is a great lecturer and clearly put a lot of thought into the course. I also really appreciated the amount of time and energy Dr. Dubrow put into his comments on our written assignments.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Doctor Dubrow is one of the best professors that I had during my whole stay at Yale. He is very dedicated to all his students, very concern for our correct understanding of the concepts and its application. He also encourages constant improvement i.e. clear and useful feedback on ALL of our assignments, peer reviewed literature search skills. Also brought material very relevant to the course, and for our professional and personal development i.e. thanksgiving speech from a First American Nation leader",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Doctor Dubrow is a great instructor in leading us to think about the relationship between climate change and public health. there are lots of interesting topics to discuss in his class and you won't get bored.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow is very passionate and knowledgeable as an instructor. He will make time for you in office hours or otherwise. He prepares his lectures and the course reading with lots of thought, but is still open to student feedback along the way. Only weakness is that sometimes it's hard to read his mind about assignment expectations. It also felt sometimes like there were 'right' answers to the opeds, so that was kinda stressful. Thanks for a great class overall.",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0Professor Dubrow is truly amazing! His instruction is clear and thorough, his organization meticulous, his passion for the topic contagious - overall a complete joy to learn from!",
    "Instructor: Robert Dubrow \u00a0I think Dr. Dubrow is the best professor at YSPH! I have never met a professor who cares more about their students and takes time to give detailed feedback on every assignment and always wants their input and suggestions."

    "I would but I would warn them that this class is filled with an absurd amount of work. I would recommend this second semester for 2nd years and not to PHD students.",
    "The intersection of climate change and public health. YES i would recommend - the class is extremely important and interesting. I learned so much",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking to learn more about how climate change impacts human and environmental health.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students",
    "A great primer on the science behind climate change and the accompanying public health challenges. Additionally, the course provided room for interesting discussions of policy-related challenges.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I would strongly recommend this course if your career path is related to the intersection of health and climate change. The concepts are applicable in many local and international contexts. A solid way to invest your graduate credits, take the most of it.",
    "If you're looking for a broad but comprehensive overview of climate change and health issues, this is the class for you! Prepare to read a lot, learn a lot, discuss a lot, and think a lot (often in new ways)! Start early on your writing assignments, and meet with Prof. Dubrow!",
    "TAKE IT! It will give you such a broad knowledge of a topic that is arguably the single greatest challenge in public health, it is a great class, and you want it in your life.",
    "This course should be a required part of the YSPH curriculum. Climate change is such a huge public health threat and Dr. Dubrow does a great job providing the foundations for this topic. I would HIGHLY suggest taking this class."
