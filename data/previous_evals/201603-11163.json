    "This course is very organized in the sense that every single day is planned. I think that this is both a strength and a weakness. While a rigid structure keeps the class on schedule, it doesn't allow extra time for topics that are more difficult for the class.",
    "The course is a pretty standard language course which uses a good textbook. The class meets every day, which is helpful for a language. Could be improved with more situational dialogue practice, for ex: what to do when ordering at a restaurant, casual conversation with strangers, etc."

Not too much work, but class everyday wears on you of course. Italian's a good language for anyone to complete their language requirement.",
    "Sure, it is not much different from L1 and L2 anyway",
    "I think that if you are interested in Italian it is a good class to take!",
    "Yes, it is a necessary building block to progressing in the study of Italian, a beautiful language."
