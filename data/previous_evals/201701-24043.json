    "I gained a deeper understanding of a variety of psychological problems as well as their cultural contexts and flaws in current methods used to evaluate them.",
    "I literally only learned how to read the DSM5.",
    "Learned about various etiologies, treatments, and criteria for various mental disorders",
    "Understanding of mental disorders!",
    "I learned the basics of psychopathology. This included diagnostic criterion for certain disorders like mood disorders, personalities disorders, and schizophrenia.",
    "learned about psychopathy",
    "I learned a lot about abnormal psychologysome of the information was covered when I took Intro to Psychology (110) last year, but this really focused on the topics that I found most interesting in the intro psych course and expanded on them in detail. I was really impressed by the amount of material that the instructor covered over the course, while still keeping the workload very manageable.",
    "This course was very useful in expanding one's knowledge of the human mind, in the particular context of mental disorders. I didn't realize how complex the human mind is and how many different ways it could be affected. You come out of this course feeling like you have a better idea of how the human mind can become ill but also treated.",
    "I learned so much about psychological disorders and their criteria in the DSM 5. It was a good intro class for non psych majors to learn a little bit about a lot of different disorders.",
    "honestly, I did not learn a lot in this class. After taking more advanced classes in this field, I only took this to fulfill my social core requirement. If you're into surface level understanding of psychopathology, this is the course for you. Prof. Joormann is very nice though, so that's a plus.",
    "I learned about various mental disorders and afflictions in an organized way. The information was completely covered on the powerpoints so it is easy to follow along and study.",

    "how to diagnose personality disorders",
    "You will learn a lot about mental disorders. Take it.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot about how mental illnesses are diagnosed and treated while also learning where we as a society can improve in these areas. I liked that we got to learn about the history of mental illness and its treatments, and also that we got to see different cultural perspectives on the same illnesses that we classify in different ways.",
    "Learned a lot about abnormal psychology, but unsure of what skills I learned that would transfer over to another course.",
    "I learned about the biological, cognitive, and psychological causes, risk factors, and treatments for many different psychopathologies. I learned how different mental illnesses were related, and how treatment and perception of mental illness has evolved over time.",
    "I learned how to think critically about modern articles.",
    "I'm very grateful to this course because it really altered my view of abnormal psychology. It not only helped be able to identify symptoms and diagnoses, but also scientific etiology behind certain disorders.",

    "I learned a lot about different mental health disorders and the treatments that come along with them.",
    "The knowledge I learned in this course - about understanding, diagnosing, and treating mental disorders - is very relevant and applicable. I think pretty much everyone can relate on some level to the information being taught.",
    "Learned about the range of psych disorders and contention surrounding their classification.",
    "Learned about different mental disorders.",
    "This course did a great job of building a strong foundation for students in abnormal psychology. I really enjoyed the pace of this course and thought Professor Joorman did an excellent job balancing very in-depth topics with an overview of disorders.",

    "You learn a lot about the symptoms and etiology about disorders which was really interesting to learn about.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved this course! I am taking an abnormal psych course focusing on China over the summer as I want to keep learning about psychological issues. The lectures were engaging, the professor and TAs were super approachable and the text book was interesting. I liked the practice problems we were given in class.",
    "Lectures and readings were repetitive, although material was interesting, and the prof had well organized lectures",
    "The class is extremely dry. It's basically just a list of psychological disorders. It would be significantly more interesting and engaging if something like mock evaluations or something was added.",
    "Very interesting material and pretty easy. But lecture is hard to sit theough",
    "Dry lectures, but what can you expect with a 300-student class? You can also not attend lectures and do well, but probably you should go to class. Overall, a decent class, well-organized, but might be a bit boring if you're not very interested in the materials.",
    "I found this was a solid introductory psychology course.",
    "semi engaging and low workload",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the fact that expectations for what we need to do and learn over the course of the semester are very clearly laid out, and the questions covered on exams were consistent with the material covered in both the lectures and the textbooks. I never felt that I was lost during this course, because if I didn't catch something in the book, I could refer to lecture notes, and vice versa. I don't think this course had any weaknesses, though I would have loved to have delved even deeper into the material!",
    "strength: very relevant material well organized and follows the textbook students kept engaged through multiple mediums (slides, video, clickers, etc.) weaknesses: not much engagement with TAs A lot of material (class focuses on breadth not depth)",
    "The lectures are fairly boring; if you read the textbook, you really don't need to go, as it was essentially a rehash of the material.",
    "There was a lot of information, and the lectures are very long, so for the tests it was difficult to study that amount of information. However, it did help that the final was not cumulative. It would have been nice to maybe have a participation grade (with the clickers), and maybe have the tests worth slightly less (together they were 80% of the grade), or the reading responses and paper to be worth slightly more- just so that your final grade isn't mostly based on the 2 tests.",
    "Strengths: Review sessions were helpful, movie paper was fun. Weaknesses: The class is really easy. Lectures could be substituted by reviewing the slides and not even reading the book. There is a huge mix of psych majors and people just hunting for guts, which makes the level of engagement suffer considerably.",
    "The information is all available on the PowerPoints on the canvas site. The reading responses are straightforward and interesting.",
    "A lot information just thrown at you in an unimpressive lecture style. During the lecture she seems to just read off the slides--really no reason to go to lecture.",
    "The class lectures were very boring. I thought the material itself was extremely interesting but the way it was formatted was very dull and made it hard to concentrate in class. We had basically the same layout every class which made it hard to get excited about the fascinating material and often times Professor Joormann went a little too crazy on the fronts and when she used yellow or bright green it was difficult to read the screen. It would have been more helpful if she would have gone through each disorder a little slower. It might have helped to have shorter classes as well.",
    "I didn't like that they were filming the class",
    "Class makes the course seem very easy but then we got to the midterm and it was noticeably more difficult than what we had learnd previously",
    "It felt like I was just memorizing a bunch of disorders. Which I was.",
    "strengths: gives you a lot of information and makes you think about a couple underlying themes (i.e. what does abnormal mean? how does abnormal behavior arise from \"normal\" behavior?). good use of videos and other media. weaknesses: often gave a peak into the biological part, but then concluded \"but this is very complicated and not well understood\".",
    "Strengths: The information presented is very easy to understand, even though it can seem like some difficult material - I give Jutta a LOT of credit for being able to do that. Additionally, the readings each week were actually fairly engaging, which I really can't say about most of my other classes. Weaknesses: I did feel that the lectures could be pretty dry at times, and found myself spacing out a bit each day.",
    "For a lecture class with few hundred students, I think Professor Joorman did a good job of establishing interactive activities with the use of clickers. The guest lecturers always brought something interesting and I think the course was well organized.",
    "Great introductory course that manages to balance breadth and depth of the disorders. I've come away feeling like I really understand each disorder we've covered, despite the fact that we learned a new one almost every single class.",
    "I loved this course; I thought the lectures were really interesting with many great examples and videos. The book was also very clear and entertaining, although the chapters were really long, so I sometimes fell behind with the reading. The exams were very fair, and I really enjoyed doing the reading responses, they made me think about the issues in ways that I hadn't before. Also, receiving feedback on every single reading response was really helpful.",
    "I enjoyed all of the readings and learned a lot in the process of writing reading responses.",
    "The lectures were interesting but also dry at times since they were mostly repetitive in terms of format but with a different disorder each time. I ultimately don't mind because it was an organized way to teach the information and helped better ingrain it, but it would be nice to maybe include more videos or something to help spice lecture up. The exams were very fair -- I used to wish that there were three exams instead of two, but they were fairly graded and the information wasn't too much to study at one time, so it was actually okay only having two. The movie assignment was also very fun, and similar things should be incorporated if possible! I also loved reading responses based on Ted Talks, and even the articles were interesting -- great content overall!",
    "Readings were fascinating, assessments were not engaging, lectures weren't penetrating at all.",
    "This class is essentially a survey course that touches briefly upon the symptoms and treatment of disorders. More critical thinking about the connections and similar underlying factors of causal would make the course more engaging",
    "could have gone more in depth with some material",
    "Because it is a survey course, it can be difficult to spend the time talking about all of the disorders in as much detail as they need. Despite this, the course does a great job touching on many topics and focusing in on very important or developed disorders so you get a good look at what we know as a field.",
    "A great course; the only weakness is its massive size",
    "Strengths: Interesting content, not too much work Weaknesses: The paper seems like a useless assignment",
    "Its strength is the diversity of disorders covered, because we were able to learn about many types of disorders. One way it can be improved is improvement of the powerpoint slides. Sometimes, the slides would be solely information from the DSM-5, which became repetitive at times.",
    "The course was strong in how Joormann relayed the major themes of the course. Overall it was a great class, low stress with a manageable workload. A weakness would probably be the TAs. They were not very helpful or accessible.",
    "The class was well taught and relatively relaxed. However, it involved a lot of information. You'll have to memorize about 350 pages of information for each midterm. Some people like this, and some don't. I personally would have preferred if the class was less wrote.",
    "Detailed slides.",
    "The course has a low workload with weekly reading responses on super interesting, relevant and short articles\/TedTalks. I really enjoyed the breadth and depth of the course.",
    "The subject matter was interesting but the teaching was not good. A different professor should teach this class; I would suggest Dr. Paul Bloom.",
    "The course material was fascinating but lecture could be dry sometimes. Grading was very fair.",
    "It was a nice class because the material was interesting and the work load was not too heavy, but lecture was often pretty boring and repetitive.",
    "I felt it provided a nice overview of the varying disorders and helped peel back the layers more on how different abnormalities are classified (or not classified).",
    "One of the strengths of this course was that it was extremely interesting. Prof. Joorman kept it entertaining with videos and the interactive questions. One weakness was that I thought sometimes it was unclear what the take-home points were.",
    "The course did a good job covering a wide range of topics. It implemented different forms of media very well.",
    "The course was engaging however the numerous lecture slides made it difficult to stay focused the entire lecture.",
    "strengths: interesting content, Professor Joormann is always looking for ways to help students be more engaged with the course. I know I was a bit irritated that students didn't show up for lecture half of the time \/ some people would talk during the lecture, but Professor Joormann did what she could with what she had. I think she also did a great job of emphasizing the complexity of abnormal psych. It is difficult to teach a course in which the methods of diagnosis and such are constantly developing. weaknesses: It was hard to sit through some lectures...which I understand because its difficult to make lectures about such serious topics \"fun.\" And doing so might take away from the seriousness of abnormal psych. I would want more opportunities to engage with the material...I am hesitant to say create discussion sections cause I know that will be a hassle to coordinate and they aren't always conducive to learning...but other than that I'm not sure how else to improve this.",
    "Prof. Joormann is a good lecturer and she makes a lot of effort to explain to us all the concepts in detail.",
    "very basic level of abnormal disorders, so not as interesting as anticipated, but very easy to get a good grade",
    "The material is pretty interesting but all of the lectures are quite boring. Course could definitely be improved by spicing up the lectures.",
    "Great intro course for anyone who is looking to learn more about the subject. Perfect amount of work in my opinion.",
    "Very simple lecture\/test format. Interesting information. I don't see any way to improve without changing the nature of the course.",
    "Lectures were a little dry because the information presented in lecture was in as much detail as the book, making it seem like I could just read the book instead of attending lecture and understand things better. Reading responses were straightforward and articles were interesting but assignments were not worth a lot. The final paper had to do with a movie or book and criteria was clear based on the rubric. Exams were pretty difficult - I studied a lot for them and didn't do well, which was sad because they were 80% of my final grade. I put a lot of work into this class but it was not reflected in my final grade.",
    "I loved this course and thought it was a really engaging lecture.",
    "As someone who does not study psychology taking an intro-level psych course, it would have been much more interesting to focus less on things like Neurobiology and more on things like case studies, which I think I would be better able to retain and use in life after the course is over.",
    "The material of the course was very interesting and very applicable to my own life. However, the class structured as a \"gut\" course, so many of the other students in the class do not take the class seriously.",
    "Loved the weekly reading responses because the articles were so interesting. Lectures were way too long and at a hard time of the day to stay focused. Content was very valuable I think.",
    "The course was a great survey class; I learned a lot about a range of different disorders. However, I think that the material was presented in a relatively un-engaging way. The course was an exact copy of the textbook, and I would have preferred hearing a little bit more about patient experiences and a little less about the DSM V requirements.",
    "This class is great! Jutta is a really great person and a great lecturer, she knows her stuff really well. The class is kind of inherently easy, because it's like basic psychology. It's not that deep fam. Don't think this class could be improved. The reading response articles\/videos were always really quality and helped us to better understand the disorders in a real world setting. The movie\/book assignment was really good for that as well.",
    "I think this class certainly does what it sets out to do. As an introductory lecture, it gives you a general knowledge base in the area and hits on some of the best known and most common psychopathologies. While there were some disorders I was disappointed not to cover (such as the dissociative disorders), I do not think that a fault that can be remedied in this class format. A major strength of the class is Professor Jutta Joormann overall. She is friendly, engaging, and very knowledgeable, and she really does make sure to include videos and examples from her experience that add to your understanding of the material.",
    "The course is very straightforward and the material is easy to learn. If you enjoy sticking to the same learning format, it's great, but some students might like switching things up a little bit. It was cool to see videos of the different disorders.",
    "A great strength of this course is that the material is itself inherently really interesting, and the textbook does an incredible job of being informative while entertaining--you honestly could never go to lecture and just read the textbook and do as well if not better. Despite the inherently interesting nature of the material, the course is taught in a pretty dull and uninteresting way--the professor (who is incredibly sweet and caring) is not the most engaging (she just reads off the slides a lot without offering lots of other insight) and thus going to class wasn't really necessary. More videos, anecdotes, etc. would have made the class more interesting.",
    "I think this course great. I really enjoyed the format of the lectures."

    "Take this course! It is not too difficult but you will learn a lot. Professor Joormann is wonderful and really nice and helpful.",
    "It's a gut- interesting, but nonetheless a gut. If I showed up to lecture three times in a year that's saying a lot.",
    "Yes! Interesting material; prof Joormann is a great lecturer and obviously cares about the subject.",
    "Easy and interesting",
    "I would recommend this course if they are interested in psychopathology and I think that this is a solid introductory psychology course.",
    "yes- easy class, don't buy the textbook you will never need it",
    "Yes, absolutely! Professor Joormann is absolutely lovely and a fantastic lecturer, and the material covered in the lecture is really interesting! The material in the textbook was very engaging and fun to read. Abnormal Psychology is an absolutely amazing course!",
    "YES! very relevant information for anyone, but particularly a college student. It is important to understand abnormal psychology in the age of mental disorders.",
    "it was a really interesting class that did not require too much work outside of the classroom but was still engaging and demanding.",
    "Take it as an easy 5th class; you really don't need to go to lecture if you do the reading, and then for exams just look over the slides to see what was focused on. Nothing phenomenal.",
    "Take this course! The class was easy, but at the same time the topics we covered were extremely interesting and relevant to today's society.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to psych and non psych majors because I found it so interesting to learn about these disorders.",
    "Unless they restructure this class to make it a lot more difficult, which is difficult to do since abnormal psychology is such a huge field of study, this class will continue to only provide a surface-level understanding of psychopathology.",
    "Professor Joormann is a very awkward, boring lecturer. The material is very interesting, but she delivers it poorly. She says \"um\" probably every other word, and just kind of read off the slides. Once a student asked a question about some material on a slide and she just said \"I don't know.\" It wasn't ambiguous either - she said something like \"children with autism will exhibit pronoun reversal\" and a student raised their hand and asked what pronoun reversal was and she just \"um, I don't know actually.\" That really put me off. The reading responses are graded strangely harshly - the prompt is very vague and you don't get that great of feedback for how to get full credit. Once I got 1\/2 for my response being a sentence or two too long, the TA even said the content was great it was just a few lines too long. Really annoying.",
    "I would recommend the course if the student is interested in mental disorders because it is interesting, informative and straightforward.",
    "Yes but be prepared for a dry lecture that is often too long.",
    "Yes, this is a great way to learn about many of the mental disorders that we, as Americans, are exposed to in our everyday lives as well as through different media outlets. As one that is not a psych major, it's basic enough for everyone to understand the causes, symptoms and treatment of every disease.",
    "Yes it is a good follow-up to other psych courses",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it was extremely interesting material that I truly appreciated. Also, it made me more aware of those around me and the struggles they could be undergoing and how they suffer from those struggles.",
    "I didn't go to a single class and I did fine. The textbook is really dry and hard to read, but overall interesting material.",
    "Yeah, it's a very easy course. You just need to memorize stuff.",
    "A nice introduction to AbPsych. A bit easy if you have a psych background - my recommendation is to just go straight to 190.",
    "very low workload class, and interesting material. beware the exams tend to be graded more harshly because everyone does so well.",
    "yes! super interesting. jutta isn't hte most engaging and tbh i didnt really go to class that much but the workload is super easy and she posts lecture slides so u dont have to go to lecture but its interesting. only 2 midterms which were failry easy. a lot of memorization but not hard. one paper of 5 pages on a omvie that was so easy to write like a book report. 10\/10 would reocmment.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about different mental disorders while also learning about the stigmas surrounding them. The course may not be the most in terms of workload, but it does challenge preconceived notions about mental disorders and their manifestations.",
    "It's a great gutyou learn a lot by putting in minimal effort. Just take it.",
    "This is a somewhat easy course if you either attend lecture and pay attention OR read the textbook as you go through. Also, if you have an interest in clinical psychology, this is a good foundation as to how mental disorders are classified, which is a good information base for future courses.",
    "If you are interested in clinical psychology\/psychiatry\/medicine, take this course.",
    "Yeah, pretty easy yet interesting. As I said, a great intro level class. Would be a good 5th course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student; I came in with no psychology background, and I was able to pick up all the material and I thought it was fascinating. The lectures are great, the tests are fair, and it isn't a ton of work but I got so much out of it.",
    "Absolutely, Professor Joormann is great.",
    "If you're interested in learning about the different abnormal disorders and what cause them\/how to treat them, definitely take this course. It changed the way I think about disorders even though the lectures were dry because they covered different disorders in the same format every time. They were also the same as the textbook, which is nice because I never read the textbook and only attended lecture\/took good notes to study from with the ppts before exams and did well. The exams themselves were fair and easy if you studied. A great and easy course to take, especially if you credit D it. It was interesting enough so I think it would be worthwhile to take. The reading responses were so chill and always on interesting\/short readings or fun to watch Ted Talks. There are two non-cumulative exams, reading responses, and a paper, which was based on either a book or a movie, and was actually really easy and fun to write. Good, easy class.",
    "everyone should take this. Its not too intense and it provides a lot of important information about mental disorders. Educating yourself is the first step to reducing stigma!!",
    "I would not; not a very penetrating survey of abnormal psychology. Just needs to be formatted around more interesting material rather than very basic overviews.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, it's a total gut, and is actually pretty interesting too.",
    "I would recommend this course as a 5th credit - easy weekly responses, one 5-page paper, a midterm, and a final. The exams are easy and follow the textbooks exactly. It's not the most riveting course, but the subject-matter is interesting and the workload is entirely managable",
    "Good class, material can be interesting. Textbook reading definitely isn't necessary. Reading responses and the paper are easy. Don't get blindsided by the midterm and final, you do need to have gone to lecture (and looked at the slides). Pretty easy class overall.",
    "will teach basic abnormal psych concepts, not a time commitment",
    "If you're looking for a broad overview of different disorders and are okay with sometimes memorizing lots of facts, take the course. The course does try to cover everything from anxiety to addiction, so don't take it if you want to focus in on a specific disorder.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! It's a great introduction to psychiatric disorders!",
    "An easy and interesting course that can be taken as a 5th class for those who are non-psych majors. If you're a psych major, take this as gut because you won't gain much from it.",
    "This course was a great introduction to abnormal psychology and various disorders. Some of the classes were completely new topics, while others were things most of us had seen before in other classes. However, the workload is very manageable, and the videos\/notes can be very interesting.",
    "Take this as a 5th class. It is so interesting, you have to study hard for the midterm and the final but that's essentially all you have to do.",
    "This class has an inaccurate reputation in my opinion. It's not a ton of work, but it's not easy. The midterms are really hard. The paper is graded leniently, but if 80% of your grade depends on 2 hard tests, then it's by no means an easy A. The class involved a ton of memorization and overall psychology knowledge. As a result, I feel that I learned a lot. However, it's not an easy class. Also, the class is very well taught. Prof. Joormann is super nice and really cares. Ask her questions and she'll be super helpful.",
    "Yes, great interesting class.",
    "Absolutely take this class. You get a much deeper, empathetic, and scientific understanding of a whole range of mental disorders, many of which your peers suffer from. Taught in a clear, concise way. Workload was one reading response per week, one short paper, and an in-class midterm and final (during the last week of classes). Super interesting material.",
    "Great introductory course to deviant behavior. Loved the material. Pretty easy class if you go to lecture and learn the material.",
    "While the subject matter is important, one could learn the material simply by reading a textbook.",
    "Yeah. It's a great 5th class",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone unfamiliar with abnormal psychology with an interest in learning about the array of different disorders.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as it is a very interesting class with a manageable workload.",
    "Yes, interesting and low workload.",
    "Yes I definitely would.",
    "Yes! Super interesting and not stressful.",
    "Definitely! This course had one of the highest learning:work ratios of any class I have taken.",
    "The course was engaging and iinstructive. It was an extremely interesting course that I would definitely take again",
    "Yes--find ways to engage with the material outside of the lecture: reach out to Prof Joormann and your TA, go to review sessions",
    "Yes. This class is very practical for us college students since it can make us aware of something that we actually suffer from or someone around us suffers from.",
    "I would recommend to non-psych majors interested in the most basic level of psychology. Easy easy easy to do well in and hardly any work.",
    "If you're looking for an easy A, definitely take this class. If you pay slight attention in class, you can go into the exams cold and still do well. A lot of the questions asked on the exams are common sense. Also a very easy credit d if you want to put no effort in. Weekly reading responses, two non-cumulative in class exams, and one paper reviewing a book or movie. Class is kind of boring but material is interesting. Doing the textbook readings are not necessary.",
    "Take this!! Jutta is great and some really interesting topics are covered. Just study from the textbook along with the slides for midterms and you'll be okay.",
    "If the subject interested them, yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to students because the topic itself is intriguing. However, the structure of this course needs work. Lectures are dry and cover most of the info you could gather by just doing the readings. Tests are worth 80% of your grade (midterm and final each worth 40%) so keep that in mind and don't bomb them like me. Final paper and reading assignments are straightforward and don't take much time. Course was not very engaging but I did learn a lot about the topic.",
    "Yes! I definitely learned a lot and it is very interesting material.",
    "Material was very easy to digest, but the tests were a little out there. It's pretty much just learning the DSM-V but then some of the multiple choice questions are just a shot in the dark.",
    "A very low-stress class in which you learn and think about some pretty important topics. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the subject. However, you should expect other students in your class who are merely taking the class as a gut.",
    "I think if they want to major in Psych I would, but otherwise, I would not.",
    "If you are interested in abnormal psych, this course provides good information on disorders. However, it isn't very engagingly presented. That being said, if you're like for an interesting gut, this may be the course for you.",
    "Yes definitely! As a gut, for fun, to learn about psych, to prepare for the MCAT This class is great. Jutta is a really great person and a great lecturer, she knows her stuff really well. The class is kind of inherently easy, because it's like basic psychology. It's not that deep fam. The reading response articles\/videos were always really quality and helped us to better understand the disorders in a real world setting. The movie\/book assignment was really good for that as well.",
    "If you are interested in the material, take this class, regardless of your major. It is helpful to anyone who knows someone dealing with mental illness (which is everyone), and it is not a lot of work at all. Even as a junior CogSci major who has taken a ton of psych classes already, I learned something new in every class. Lecture can be slow or dull at times, but overall, Professor Joormann does a really good job of making it engaging, and the material is helpful and highly relevant for any Yale student. Work wise, you'll have a short, free-form \"reading response\" every week based on a relevant newspaper Op-Ed or TED talk, two fairly easy exams, and a short paper (basically a 5 page reading response) about a mental-illness related book or movie. It's definitely a manageable workload and not hard to do well.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in mental health work and research. Some people might find it too straightforward and boring, but I really enjoyed the material.",
    "It's a very straightforward lecture course, I would recommend it to someone who needs an easy and interesting social science credit. There is some overlap with the content of other psychology courses, like intro psych.",
    "It's an interesting course because of its material, very easy and has a llght course load. That said, you could learn the same amount of material (if not more) and be more entertained and engaged if you just read the textbook. In my opinion, it's not really worth 1 Yale credit if you're thinking about taking other classes. It's an easy and interesting class though!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I was an interesting and engaging course.",
    "This is a great class and fairly easy to get a good grade in if you put in enough work."
