    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0Awet was incredibly supportive, responsive, thorough, and attentive. She made every attempt to address my questions until we were both satisfied I understood the answer. She was never less than fully present and available. The were times when she might err on being *too* accommodating benefit of the discussion. At these moments she would catch herself and quickly get back on course.",
    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0Incredible TF. Very passionate about the subject matter and helpful to me, the student. Did a great job of facilitating conversation in section and translating Professor Hare's instructions for papers and assignments which could be... vague. Sometimes let section discussions get a bit wide and rambley, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Showed great poise in leading sections.",
    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0Awet was good at identifying and clarifying the main points we needed out of readings and was good at leading class discussion overall. While the examples and references to various pieces of art were helpful, they sometimes felt disjointed. Given that the section only had 50 minutes to talk it seemed hard to fit them in sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0Awet was a wonderful TF. She brings all of herself to her work. She is always going the extra mile, to supplement the lectures with additional material, and always following up with specific questions. In this, her only weakness might be an overenthusiastic drive to try to direct\/arrange the conversation a little too much, rather than let it grow more organically with open questions and dialogue. But this is really no critique. She is passionate and so engaged. It has been a real delight to be in section with her. She will make an absolutely fantastic professor (if that is indeed her ultimate goal).",
    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0The TF was enthusiastic and extremely helpful with clarifying subjects addressed in class. She provided detailed comments on work and was very encouraging.",
    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0She was very down to earth and communicated the material well. She did not allow her own proficiency in the material to prevent the students from approaching it more tepidly and her own insights complemented the lectures such that any of my own questions or concerns were either resolved or clarified.",
    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0Very caring and thoughtful.",
    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0Awet did a great job of tackling such a broad range of material in the time allotted. She was great at encouraging everyone to participate in discussion, but oftentimes she did not focus directly on the texts of the class.",
    "Instructor: Awet Iassu Andemicael \u00a0Excellent attention to students and clear love for teaching and care for all of us! Came up with great ideas for class discussions and was good at generating conversation. Very helpful in talking about papers and assignments. Very knowledgeable about the material and humble. As a point of improvement, I think the sections would have been better if our time was more strictly organized and prompts for the discussions were a little more clearly linked to the reading. Sometimes the class discussion questions were good, but they were too open so conversation stalled."
