    "I really enjoy this course material, but would have succeeded more in learning if there had been a bit more structure to the lectures or if we could have had some more discussion-style classes.",
    "Field trips were helpful to be able to see some of the things we discussed in class in person. I wish there was more time for such field trips, though field trips inevitably detract from he amount of class time that can be devoted to other material.",
    "David did not have enough content to use the entire class time. Most of the time, we started the course a half hour to 45min late because time was just wasted on small talk. Usually class ended early because David had to leave to catch his train. I did not feel like I got my money's worth taking this course.",
    "Mr. David Kooris is passionate in teaching. He has very interesting stories to tell and serves as a source of inspiration for us. The materials he teach are interesting but need more organization. His field trips are very useful and provide an eye opening experience for extracurricular learning. Since the class is taught after his regular, very busy work hour, he reasonably can get tired sometimes and, given the lack of student response, he may go on talking about a point for too long so that it lowers students' attention. I suggest that in the future, three changes can be made: 1. Change the seating from rows to circles to stimulate discussion and focus attention (move the tables aside and have only chairs). 2. Encourage weekly presentation of readings in the form of discussion and activity. 3. Modify PowerPoint slides to tie into the readings and to develop presentation script that revolves tightly around the points in the slide so as to minimize tangential information that may reduce student attention and include specific anecdotes to stimulate student interests.",

    "As an undergraduate, it was lovely to have the perspective of a professional in the real world. Often times, I feel the things i learn as an undergrad are fruity and unhelpful or inapplicable to life, but I certainly did not feel that with this course. I also really enjoyed each lecture, the readings and learned a lot!",
    "Discussion and field trips added depth to our conversations.",
    "It was great to learn from David's real-life experiences as a professional in the field. I enjoyed being able to learn concepts as well as hear about his daily life to understand how the field actually operates.",
    "Professor Kooris's experience in the field is fascinating to hear about",
    "Great to learn about planning from a practitioner.",
    "Learning about other students' final paper topics.",
    "Hearing about the challenges of urban planning in the real world. Also, the field trips were great.",
    "I really enjoyed writing the final paper which gave me the freedoms to explore the topic of my interest. I now have a reasonably in depth understanding of my topic. Mr. Kooris has also been very generous in connecting students to his attachs to facilitate their research. I am very happy to have taken his class. It is more than an introduction to a broad range of planning topics; it is a place to be inspired by his stories and him as the example.",
    "The professional insights were very valuable, particularly as a compliment to some of the more theoretical urban courses.",
    "I really enjoyed having lectures with David, it was helpful to have his first-hand insight regarding real-life applications in the planning sector. I liked that the final paper was open-ended and allowed us to explore a topic of our choice.",

    "A reduction in readings. Or a brief summary of each reading below in the syllabus so that students can be more selective in which they choose to read.",

    "The structure of the lectures can be improved by incorporating more diversity in teaching style and in student participation. Similarly, I would have appreciated assignments slightly more rigorous.",
    "I think it would great if part of the class were reserved for discussion of the readings.",
    "The lectures need to be more engaging and fill the entirety of the class. Not end early because there's not enough to talk about.",
    "Perhaps more accessibility of the professor.",
    "The course meandered a lot, which was actually beneficial for those of us who already had a background in urban studies and wanted to think about specific cases; but this might not have been easiest for other students. The assignments weren't the most challenging.",
    "I wish that we had more guest speakers come in to talk to us about different subjects. It would have helped to get a different perspective from other cities\/planners.",

It's a great experience to learn from a professional in the field though. David's personal anecdotes were very engaging.",
    "This course is better for students who don't have an architectural background. It is less interesting for architecture students.",
    "It is a great course that will teach you a lot about the professional field of urban planning and the politics of urban planning.",
    "Come with specific questions for every class on the topic to fuel the discussion. It's a very interesting class, but it needs to be paired with more practical courses afterwards. Sitting in class for three hours a week absorbing professional knowledge needs to be complimented with design projects that test the theory we learn."
