    "Shimi is a fantastic, caring, thorough professor. There's a lot of material, which can make it hard to follow without a chemistry background, but he tries hard to make it accessible to everyone and makes himself available for a lot of extra help and office hours.",
    "One of the best professors I ever had. Very challenging material and the professor went way above and beyond anything that most professors do to make sure we all understood everything. Lots of office hours. Lots of assessment and feedback. Very clear notes to help us review material.",
    "The course was very dense with information and moved quickly. This sometimes meant not all concepts were clear or easy to grasp orally, especially for those without a chemistry background, but Shimi does an excellent job of assisting with that by providing written notes and outlines for each class that really help fill in the blanks.",
    "This class was my favorite at FES so far (in 1 year).",
    "-Great course, Shimi makes himself very available and accessible to students by holding biweekly office hours\/problem set sessions. Most professors would just have the TA's do these sessions with students, but Shimi really takes a hands on approach and wants students to understand the material. He goes above and beyond most professors - holds a session at the beginning of the term for students who do not have background in organic chemistry, and is very responsive, always happy to explain concepts, make time, etc.-overall very impressed with teaching and the material.",
    "Any student working on water MUST take this class. Otherwise, it is an excellent course to anyone interested in pollution and fate of those pollutants especially organic one.Shimi is an excellent instructor even non chem-lovers would love the class",
    "I loved this class. I have no intention on working with anything that we talked about, but I really, truly loved this class, and looked forward to it every week (maybe except the week where we had evening make up sessions - but then I looked forward to Modern Pizza! Thanks again!)This class opened up the previously mysterious world of organic chemistry to me. I will probably never take a full o-chem class, but this class was perfect because it combined the basic principles I'll need for any other engagement with organic chemistry, with an extremely interesting subject matter, and lots of applications to real problems.I think this is a unique class - advanced yet open to beginners, fast paced and challenging, but with a very kind and understanding and EXTREMELY well organized instructor, and it's fun!",
    "This course is excellent. It fills a very important need in the curriculum: science course, chemistry, both pure and applied science, portions are most likely considered advanced."

    "Real science! And really interesting to learn the history of various chemical interactions with society, like Exxon Valdez and the GM PCB spill.",
    "The instructor explained everything carefully and made sure everyone was following especially when it came to the more difficult concepts. He was well organized and covered interesting material.",
    "Learning how these things work in the natural environment.",
    "Learning lots of very complicated scientific information in a clear, concise, straightforward manner. Learning how to apply this science to relevant environmental issues and situations.",
    "The extensive knowledge of the instructor about the topic, and his patience with us.",
    "The problem sets! Essential to understanding the concepts taught in class. Shimi is a great teacher.",
    "-professor-problem sets - actually makes you learn the material without getting behind, having weekly problem sets keeps students on tracks, lets the material solidify, etc",
    "Shimi is a wonderful professor and an absolute joy to take a class from! I loved this course and the topics we covered were really interesting.",
    "I felt that I left this class with a good understanding of basic organic chemistry and was given a clear overview of some of the more persistent pollutants. I learned far more in this class than I have in many others at FES.",
    "Puts real life events (pollutants transfer& transformation and their effect on us) in to perspective",
    "The instructor. Shimi is great and one of a few professors at FES who makes himself available to students to an amazing degree. I don't know what other professor here hold open drop-in office hours, twice a week, plus multiple review sessions, and a model building session. And a chemistry review session. That's the kind of thing that most professors make their TA do, but we learned to much more from him that way. I was amazed that Shimi continued to show up to most of his office hours, and all of his classes and review sessions, even when his father was in hospital at the end of the semester. Unheard of.He also has seemingly never-ending patience for answering the exact same question about the problem set over and over again during office hours, and is very good at explaining complex matters simply. He also has thefacility to make some of the most obscure tidbits interesting. The only part of the class where I had a hard time paying attention was the part on sampling and data analysis - but then that's just very dry.I really liked the resources provided for the class - a very good mix of textbook, general articles, primary literature, and of course the class notes - INVALUABLE.One of our little group of non-chemistry people in the class told me that she ended up having to answer all the questions that came up in her risk assessment class at Public Health about octane ratings, fractional distillation, the formation of petroleum, and what the problem with MTBE is - no one else knew the right answer, so she ended up speaking up every time, even though she is very quiet usually. Then the professor asked her if she had a chemistry background - anything but, but after learning about these things in this class, she knew enough and was confident enough to answer all these questions without reviewing notes or preparing. She was very proud. And I've lost count of how many basic questions I've been fielding about oil spill clean up - I feel very very well educated after taking this class, and I sincerely hope that other students have a chance to take this class next year- I've been recommending it to everyone, whether they're interested in this subject matter or not... I'm not really, and I loved it.",
    "Shimi. He's the best teacher I had at FES. The topic is also incredibly interesting, the work is useful and interesting. It was the hardest class I took at FES, but I was more motivated to work hard for this class then any other.",
    "The organization of the material. It was very easy to understand what we were covering and how it fit into the overall organization of the course."

    "I wish we had talked a little more about policy, how TMDLs and other regulations are set, a bit more on toxicology, and chemical interactions. But I don't know when we would have had time for these things.",
    "I don't think it needs improvement.",
    "I'm not sure Shimi was able to cover all the material he would have liked to due to a discrepancy between the start time listed for graduates and undergraduates. This could be addressed so that both may continue to take the course.It also would have been nice to spend a bit more time on the applications of organic pollutants: i.e. consequences of pesticide use, health risks etc. though the intro we had was very helpful.",
    "May be a more useful textbook. I don't know if it exists. Shimi said he would need to write one.",
    "Perhaps one additional lab\/field trip to help visualize pollutant compartmentalization.",
    "The field trip wasn't the best, but that was still fine. Overall, a wonderful class!",
    "Nothing really, although I would recommend not have problem sets due the same week of tests.",
    "It would be nice to have the historical background and numbers on the impact to say people so when someone is talking of policy one can talk with authority on not just the effects but also eg of impacts",
    "Hm - the problem sets were really helpful in understanding the material, and I'm very happy they ended eventually, but I think they might have actually been really helpful to have for the final weeks as well - less quantitative, more qualitative of course, or some analysis of degradation pathways and toxicity of some of the pollutants we discussed?",
    "It's got to be incredibly difficult to decide what stays and what goes in terms of material covered in this course, but the amount of material covered makes it difficult to achieve mastery with it.",
    "Leave more time for the material at the end of the semester--the discussion of classes of pollutants. Also I would like to have spent more time on remediation."

    "FES has very classes that speak to environmental justice concerns, this class is directly relevant and very useful to anyone looking at the environmental consequences of our actions and how to work towards more sustainable communities. This helped me to understand the chemical processes at work behind the issues communities deal with in their daily lives.",

    "It doesn't really - but I felt that I needed to know something about organic chemistry before graduating from FES, and also needed to know how to understand what I read in the newspaper. I think the analytical framework presented in this class - how to describe a pollutant, what characterizes it, how to deal with it, how to think about legislation and the next generation of pollutants - was a really useful thing to learn, no matter what the topic was.",

    "I took Biogeochemistry last semester, and had two Aha-moments - Gabe pointed to the entire last section of the spreadsheet of major components of the biogeochemical cycle, heavy metals, and other pollutants, and said, take Shimi's class if you want to know about these. Then, one of our field trips took us to the Pfizer clean up site, where I realized that I understood nothing of what they were talking about - I didn't have the slightest idea of how organic pollutants were created and dealt with and what the problem with them was, and what those names even meant. Now, after taking this class, I have a very useful basic framework to store information in, which helps me understand the world around me much better. I can easily retrieve information and research new topics within organic pollutants, because this class provided a framework and a basic understanding of organic chemistry, applied to pollution. It's one of the most useful classes I've ever taken, because it's a self-contained unit.",
    "interest in topic and wanted to improve my chemistry knowledge.",
    "I am interested in site remediation so this class is about as relevant to that topic as any offered at FES. I wanted to learn about how pollutants move in the environment and what risks they pose."
