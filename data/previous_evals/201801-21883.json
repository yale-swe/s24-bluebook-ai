    "I learned standards of ethics in clinical practice, such as how to navigate scenarios where ethical boundaries are unclear. I also learned critical insights about how my identity can and does affect my work and instances where that is appropriate and instances where I will need to regulate those feelings. Furthermore, I gained insight on how diversity affects the client therapist relationship.",
    "I learned so much about delivering psychotherapy from a culturally humble standpoint as well as how to be an ethical clinician.",
    "This course covered an incredibly extensive amount of material! I learned a lot about ethical guidelines, working with clients from diverse backgrounds (e.g. ethnic, religious, sexual, gender, etc.), as well as professional relationships with supervisors, and consulting practices.",
    "This class encouraged me to both grow in my ability of how to approach different aspects of an individuals' identity within a clinical setting and to reflect on my own identity. This was powerful for me both intellectually and personally. I feel better prepared to engage in this aspect of clinical practice and have a strong foundation through this class to continue to build upon!"

    "I really enjoyed the discussion format of class and how deeply we were able to delve into our material.",
    "I really enjoyed all of the readings and thought that the class was structured well to facilitate student engagement, particularly in a class that has material that could be very lecture-heavy.",
    "This was my favorite course I have taken so far at Yale. The readings and class discussion were incredibly interesting, and I learned a lot about a wide range of very important topics. I particularly loved the diversity aspect of the course- I think Mary did an excellent job selecting readings, and I thought that everybody took class discussions very seriously and that the conversation was honest and important. I think that this course will help me become a better clinician, and has helped me think about how to recognize individual factors that are essential to honor when providing high quality therapy. As an added bonus, it has made me more aware of how I interact with others on a day to day basis.",
    "Strengths: readings and discussions!"

    "Yes! I have only positive things to say abut this course. Even though the reading was a lot some weeks, I think every single article was extremely important and helpful.",
    "Yes! This course was a powerful overview of important aspects of ethics and diversity in clinical practice, as well as a human in every day life. I deeply appreciated this experience."
