   "comments": [
    "The seminar style gives students the opportunity to practice speaking and Professor Titus and the TAs are always willing to help. However, sometimes the course moves very quickly and we learn things we never really practice.",
    "I think that the tests are often poorly written and it could be improved by having the practice tests follow the same format as the actual tests so that way the format doesn't throw us off and we can focus on grammar and vocabulary and the like.",
    "This course is incredibly well-taught and geared towards intensive learning. While concepts are difficult to teach, I feel Julia is quite good at explaining most of them.",
    "The class is very engaging and informative and I cannot thing of anything negative about the class.",
    "I like how the class was so small, so we had ample opportunity to ask questions. This made learning a lot easier. I think the course could be improved by giving the students a bit more conversational practice during class time."

    "If you're interested in learning an interesting language and really being able to speak and understand it, definitely take this course",
    "Yes! Russian is so much fun and even though its hard finally being able to write and speak is extremely satisfying.",
    "I would definitely recommend Russian to any Yale student, as the department is so fantastic. The classes are small and you really get to know the professors of this critical language.",
    "I will only recommend the class to someone interested in the Russian language as the challenges will only be appreciated by people determined to learn the language.",
    "I would recommend it. The Slavic department here is great, and you really learn a lot from this class. All of the knowledge builds on past knowledge, so you are alqays reviewing old material."
