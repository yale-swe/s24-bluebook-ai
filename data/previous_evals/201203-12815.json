    "please take this course: the topics are relevant and dynamic and professor sleeper is an incredible man who loves this class and these topics beyond explanation. it is inspiring to take a course from someone so passionate about his topic, and an experience that everyone should be afforded.",
    "Sleeper is a cool dude, with lots of interesting things to say about journalism, the media and political philosophy (also the fate of the contemporary liberal arts education, but that's neither here nor there). That being said, this class is a pretty standard seminar, which means that each day is definitely influenced by the combination of personalities in it. Sometimes everything is fun and exciting, and sometimes, when everyone in class is clearly tired and apathetic from cramming for midterms and interviews, it is awful and boring. If you are interested in the theory behind journalism and the public sphere, though, this class is worth its rough patches for a well-curated syllabus and interesting assignments that will change the way (or reinforce the way) you view public discourse and the media. Also, there are some cool guest speakers, too.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a challenging, but manageable workload. There is a lot of reading, but it is worth it. There is an in-class presentation, responses on the classesv2 forum, an in-class midterm, and a take-home final. All hard, but worthwhile. Sleeper is super cool!",
    "There are few moments I count as watershed moments at my time at Yale, and taking this course has been one of them. I say this because for probably the only time thus far, I found at Yale a course and a professor that thrived of challenging student's moral and intellectual foundations. And I don't mean challenge is the manner that say, a course on Political Philosophy challenges your academic foundations; Sleeper had the sole aim of making you understand the world around you better. I can't recall another class where I enjoyed ~90% of all the readings. This course will change your understanding of the world around you - its the kind of course people come to Yale to take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a student who is willing to really learn in a way that isn't typical of most classes here; it's not just about doing the reading and regurgitating the authors' thoughts; it's about engaging with the readings, and seeing how they challenge or support your own opinions. This class is not just about hearing yourself speak, or just listening to others, but by reconciling many diverse opinions with one's own.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class. Professor Sleeper is amazing. There is a manageable amount of reading, interesting discussion and fascinating guest speakers.",
    "PLSC 412 hits on a lot of really important issues, like corporate speech, the future of news media, nationalism,globalization, etc. While this sounds disjointed, the course actually flows pretty well, and while not all readings are obviously related to each other, that isn't necessarily a downside. There are definitely general themes throughout the course, and I think the second half of the course is particularly interesting, as it starts to talk about issues that are obviously relevant today (e.g. corporate ownership of news media stations) in a way that most other courses won't dissect.The readings are super manageable (they never took me more than one or two hours each week, and often much less, which is really great for a seminar) and are pretty well selected. He provides some of his own published commentary on some of the pieces, but it isn't required (though helpful to read to better understand his opinions about topics). Professor Sleeper also brings in some interesting guests, and they are always more than happy to answer questions and jump into the discussion as well, and I think they really enriched the course.Professor Sleeper is attentive to students, and I know that he was always really good about setting up office hours with students. He was always willing to meet with me and talk about pretty much anything, and our conversations weren't limited to just the readings. He is honestly really interested in each student's thoughts on the readings and themes discussed in class, and while he makes his own opinions and biases obvious, it's not a downside: he's still open to other viewpoints and sometimes takes positions other than his own to challenge people and play devil's advocate, which moves discussion along.In terms of grading, as long as you are trying hard to engage the material, demonstrate that you're trying to tackle the dilemmas\/issues he poses in class, and are thoughtful about the readings, you should do fine. Professor Sleeper really just wants you to engage the material in the class (and rightfully so, since that's really the only way you'll get a lot from the class).One last note: I'mnot sure what the description of the course will read in the blue book, but the course is based upon Professor Sleeper's conception of the public sphere and civic republicanism. I know it said in the description for my semester that the course will cover the Middle East, Asia, and Europe, but the course was pretty much solely US-focused for the most part (which I don't think is a bad thing and I think actually focused our course, but the only time we talked about other countries was in the context of globalization and nationalism, and we used them as quick examples rather than in-depth case studies - just a note so you know what to expect).",
    "I would certainly recommend it.",
    "Do it if you are a liberal and want to feel good about journalism.",
    "I would if they're interested in philosophy or the theory behind the public sphere in America. If they're interested in more concrete stuff (or are actually looking for a class on journalism), I would not recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in politics.",
    "I would highly recommend this course not just to students interestedin journalism, but to anyone interested in learning about the modern interplay between journalism, democracy, capitalism, and nationalism. Though this may seem broad, the readings and Professor Sleeper\u00e2\u0080\u0094an excellent and caring instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0094keep things focussed in a way that makes the class and discussions accessible and enlightening."
