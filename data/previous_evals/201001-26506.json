   "comments": [
    "Very interesting class on Indigenous Politics. It was kind of philosophically oriented for the first half. More taught from the perspective of Native Tribes than the traditional native studies classes that just trace US court cases etc.",
    "The course is basically Native American politics, and it is very good. There is a lot of freedom on the topic of the paper. The readings are interesting for the most part. The workload isn't too bad and the discussions are very laid back. I would recommend it, especially if you aren't too knowledgeable about the situation in Indian America.",
    "Its provides a general overview of the history and current issues facing Indigenous individuals and communities today. It's a course you can take even if you have no background in Native American studies. I learned a lot. I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the issues it addresses. We talked about sovereinty, blood quantum issues, change and continuity, tribal governments, the education system, dysfunction on the reservations, and gaming, along with other things.",
    "Maybe. I would say the following:-the workload is manageable (5-6 page midterm; 15-20 page final)-Professor Orr is a great guy--very understanding and has an interesting perspective.-i think that he is a lenient grader.BUT:-the book and course packet combo is unnecessarily super expensive. (don't buy the books\/course packet..just use the copy in the library)-discussions were often boring and some of the readings were dense and dull",
    "Amazing course!TAKE IT!NOW!It is a fascinating class, the instructor is one of the coolest people ever!"
