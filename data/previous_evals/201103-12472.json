   "comments": [
    "Yes , this is a very helpful class. Of course, the problem sets are often harder than examples discussed in class but they can be managed with study groups or going to sections that few people utilize.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Its a great non lecture intro class. The material is not horrendous and the grading is very fair if not kind.",
    "Math 112 is an intro Calc class, similar to one that many people took in high school, but some of the test questions are more difficult. I would recommend this class to others.",
    "Easy. Never interesting, but it's not a problem if you have to take it. just study for the midterms and the final for a couple of hours.",
    "If you can avoid it do it. Its not very hard until you get to exams. The practice exams are supposed to help you get ready, but they don't. The actual exams are very difficult and the concepts are applied in much more complicated ways than are taught.If you have to...take Wells. He speaks intelligible English.",
    "Good overview of the basic concepts of single-variable calculus! I would recommend this class to everyone who hasn't taken calculus in high school and is interested in majoring in economics!",
    "There are better ways to fulfill a QR requirement. Don't take it if you hate math or if you, like me, love algebra but hate calc. It does not give you the time to take everything in or the practice one needs to fully understand calc and solve problems on your own. I would recommend 120 to people who already know a bit of calc. It is a much better taught course.",
    "I had to take this to fulfill a requirement, i would try to avoid it if given the option, the tests were ridiculously difficult, the teachers didn't adequately prepare you for the tests. they wrote the tests and made them not reflective of the material taught in class.",
    "If you have never taken calculus before, I feel sorry for you. Almost everyone in this class has, and the math teaching here is, to put it nicely, not very detailed. You can use the textbook or learn some other way. No Yale math class is too easy, so take your pick. This class is basically a harder version of Calculus AB. Andrew Wells was a nice person and you can understand him (which is not the case for many teachers), but I wonder if there were better teachers. I wish this class was taught by actual professors.",
    "Take it only if you need to.",
    "I would suggest taking this class if you like math and have never taken in before, or if you have to.",
    "I would summarize Mathematics 112 06 to a fellow student as an excellent way to learn the first semester of single variable calculus. It is clear, thorough, and comprehensive, and gives one a good understanding of theorems and reasoning behind the principles of calculus, as well as good practice in problems and applications.",
    "Good class to take, even if you have prior calculous knowledge. Wells is a great teacher.",
    "It is a lot of work and the final is hard. If you like math it is a great course, but if you are taking it because you think you should take a math course I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Not the best math course, but fine if you need it or want it.",
    "I would summarize this class as a great class, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. You will learn a lot, you will learn all of the basics of calculus, and it will give you a fantastic platform and base of knowledge for you to continue your studies further into mathematics.",
    "I probably would not recommend this class to other students because it is simple calculus but the class was very confusing.",
    "I do not recommend taking this class unless it is necessary."
