   "comments": [
    "I mean, Professor Padmanabhan is great. But this class is too fast for people who haven't been exposed to the topics it covers before and too slow for those who have. I'm not really sure what the target audience is, but I sort of think physics majors should just take the time to take vector calc, linear algebra, and differential equations as complete classes.",
    "I went from Math 120 to this. Definitely manageable. Padmanabhan moved a little faster than I would like, but he is always available for office hours. The Shankar textbook is great. Padmanabhan also has this great grading system that basically allows you to drop midterms if you do better on the corresponding sections final. I recommend this course.",
    "Difficult but doable with only Multivariable. A great review or crashcourse in advanced math topics for Physics.",
    "This was a very hard class that covered a very wide spread of material but it was truly enjoyable. I would recommend it to people looking for a math course.",
    "I'd recommend taking 301 along with 401, instead of a year after like I did. The class moves quickly, and even if you've taken Math 120\/222 the corresponding sections of this course will not be walks in parks (unless 120\/222 were super easy for you).",
    "This class is an EXTERMELY FAST introduction to a variety of mathematical topics, starting with single variable calculus and ending with ordinary differential equations. There are weekly psets (10 questions), two midterms and a final exam. I would not recommend this course if (1) you have not taken linear algebra and differential equations before (multivariable calculus is not enough), and if (2) apart from the regular course time, you sometimes need some extra time back in your room or in the library to understand what you've seen in class. If (1) and (2) are not applicable to you, then you will be fine and you will enjoy the course, since it will just be a review of what you have previously learned (but in this case, what is the point of being in a class that doesn't teach you anything new?). Now, if you feel identified with (1) or (2), you will struggle a lot and you will probably be miserable for the entire semester. You will find the problem sets long and hard, and the exams extremely difficult. If you do not satisfy (1), you will also find yourself out of place when you realize that the majority of your classmates already have a very strong math and physics background (most of the people in my classtook the highest math and physics introductory sequences during their freshman year). Overall, even if the professor tries to be nice and holds Office Hours the week before the exams, I think this class should not be offered at Yale: either you suffer and die, or you get bored and do not learn anything new.",
    "Take it if you haven't done linear or diff eq. I was looking for more diff eq information so the math class would have been better, and apparently easier too",
    "Don't take this class unless you're looking for a review of all the math (multivariable, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations) that you've taken already or you're in for a semester full of cramming. For me, it felt like way too much material in too little time, and I had already taken multivariable and linear algebra. The complex analysis will most likely be a new topic for most of you, but don't worry, it isn't too bad. Pay close attention to the first section of the class (single-variable calc, series, multi-variable calc) because the first midterm was more difficult than the second one. The tests were pretty fair, but I must say that I found a great disparity between the lectures and the homework: I would understand almost everything said in class, but then oftentimes the homework would have problems of significantly higher difficulty than the ones covered in class. Reading Shankar's book, the one assigned for this class, took care of this problem most of the time, but I've heard from others that the book didn't help them at all. Anyway, the problem sets were undoubtedly the hardest part of this class which is a good thing; once you understood the problem sets, you were essentially set for the exam. My biggest grievance about the class has nothing to do at all with Nikhil; he is a pretty good lecturer, and is definitely always on your side with regards to grading, and assigning problem sets and exams, and always willing to help you understand the material (the only complaint I have is that he didn'tpost solutions to the practice final!). The grievance is that it's just, again, too much material to learn in too little time.",
    "Phys 301 is an accelerated run-through of many of the mathematical techniques\/areas useful in physics work. If you do not already have a background in at least 2 of the main areas (multivariable\/vector calculus; complex plane integration; linear algebra; differential equations), then this course would be recommended. The professor is wonderful, and the P-Sets not too difficult, but difficult enough to reinforce the main concepts. One difficulty was that the source textbook is quite terse, and extra practice problems could be hard to come by, which made studying for exams difficult. Nonetheless, the exams were fair, and primarily based off homework-styled problems. While there were a few examples of physics-based problems in the course, the focus was on solidifying the mathematics itself. No doubt, though, the applications can be seen in the higher-level physics courses.",
    "Physics 301 is a very fast-paced course, but it is quite manageable if you are already familiar with 1-2 of the subjects included. Professor Padmanabhan is great, and he will go the extra mile to help you learn the material. Take advantage of the review sessions the night before each midterm. They really help. I would recommend this class if you're prepared to put in the time to learn material you aren't already familiar with.",
    "I took 301 because I was told that Physics department offerings are quite good once one gets past the introductory level. I am now a believer. This class, though challenging and not without its flaws, was an absolute pleasure to take. Nikhil is a very dedicated professor, though be prepared to keep up with the accelerated pace of the class. Homework assignments were of reasonable length and quite enlightening. Exams were challenging and designed to teach you even more material\u00e2\u0080\u0094an interesting approach to otherwise mechanical assessments. Individually, here is my opinion on the units: multivariate calculus and complex analysis were well done, but linear algebra and differential equations felt extremely rushed. Alas, this is the nature of a class whose goal is to replace 2 or 3 semesters' worth of math classes. The text is hit-or-miss, woefully unclear in certain sections but good in others. Office hours are your friend.",
    "Physics 301 is a great course, as long as you know what to expect. It aims to cover a wide variety of topics in a relatively short time period, thus it is best suited for students who have already covered most of the topics and just want a brief review. It should not be used as a substitute for appropriate courses in the math department, but rather as a stopgap measure to ensure a basic understanding of several ideas followed later by a full-fledged course.",
    "Would NOT recommend it. Can get a better math background for physics by taking the relevant math classes.",
    "It'll be a difficult semester -- this course crams in many topics, and problem sets are regular and challenging. However, this will be extremely useful for 400+ level physics classes -- even if you have taken linear algebra or differential equations, this will be a valuable course for building and honing your mathematical skills in the context of physics. Professor Padmanabhan is very organized and communicative.PS Go to class: the textbook is terrible (sorry, Shankar) and learning from it is very difficult.",
    "I took this class as a Junior and it was a useful review of key mathematical tools. I learned enough that it didn't feel like a complete review, too. It would have been considerably more difficult as a freshman or sophomore with fewer math classes under my belt, but I do wish I had taken it sooner because the math in this course would have been very useful in other physics classes.The workload was roughly 6-8 hours a night for me, likely somewhat more for someone with less math experience. Questions on the tests are occasionally tricky but never unfair. There's no curve, but you can consider that a good thing because his expectations are very reasonable."
