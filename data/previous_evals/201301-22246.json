    "Absolutely. Everyone should take this class. The work and readings are both manageable and fascinating. The discussions are really interesting.",

I found it interesting, although towards the end it got a little bit dry.I took this class as a non-architecture major freshman and did not feel too overwhelmed, so prior knowledge is not really necessary."
