   "comments": [
    "A very interesting course that went in depth on aerodynamics. Prof de la Mora was able to focus on every student; I think this course benefits a lot from being such a small lecture. My suggestion would be to slow down with some of the most difficult calculations, seeing as we had an abundance of time for review and I found myself very lost at times, such as during integral BL calculations.",
    "This course was small, which meant you were forced to learn the material quickly and be engaged. It would have been helpful to have a more structured idea of what would be covered each day."

    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Aerospace engineering or Aerodynamics as it relates to airfoil design."
