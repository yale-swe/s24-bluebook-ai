   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in exploring the field of macroeconomics, and economics in general, and wants an interesting review of its main mechanisms. Take the seminar over the lecture, and take Alonso's class! She is a good teacher and a very nice person, always available to help her students.",
    "I had never taken any macro before and I thought it gave me a solid base!",
    "Good basic econ course if that's what you need for your major. It's not the most exciting, so if you're looking to just fulfill a So credit in an interesting way, not sure this is how I would do it. However, it's important material and Professor Alonso does a good job in being slow and making sure you understand it. Workload is really manageable (weekly psets, 1 midterm, 1 final).",
    "Highly recommended. Much easier to pay attention than in the lecture and better teacher-student interaction.",
    "The econ seminar was a good class, definitely better than Schiller's lecture from what I heard. It also offers the chance for much more personal learning, and Professor Alonso is very helpful with office hours. I would recommend the seminar unless the lecturer is someone who has very good reviews.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class with Professor Alonso. It would be better to study introductory macroeconomics independently. If you do have to take it, like I did, just stick to the book and go to her office hours when you have questions on the Pset."
