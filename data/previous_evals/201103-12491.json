   "comments": [
    "This is the big, ugly knacker\u0092s yard through which all aspiring math-ponies must pass before they can galavant across the lush, verdant meadows of upper-level math offerings.",
    "I would not recommend this course i found that the material was not super difficult but that the class is very challenging to do well in because of the way its structured and the fact that a lot of people in it have already taken the class in high school so the curve is difficult.",
    "More difficult concepts later in the semester, but easy to coast between exams if you're a self-learner\/good at math.",
    "It is a good one. Not too difficult. It goes slowly enough. You don't need to read the book to do well.",
    "It's a pretty standard multivariable calculus class. If it'll be useful for you in the future (if you'll be taking upper level physics, math, or economics classes), then take it. The teaching is ok but the textbook is pretty clear.",
    "I really enjoyed Math 120. You learn all of the major concepts in multivariable calculus, and you get a lot of practice and the exams are not bad either. I think anyone with AP calculus (AB or BC) will do really well in the class. I really recommend Do's section. He is a GREAT instructor; he's clear, writes things on the board, is helpful, etc. I recommend shopping sections to find what works best (Do's was a good section but at the unholy hour of 9 am!)",
    "I love math, and so would of course recommend this as long as the student knew what they were getting into, mainly a much harder math course than what is found in high school.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, but only if you have a pretty solid background in math.",
    "Math 120 is an introduction into multivariable calculus. I would not take thisclass if you haven't taken BC Calculus or an equivalent, because the vast majority of it is integrals. Also, it would help to know a little about vectors because they do not go give you hard vector problems, but if you don't understand vectors it will be hard to learn it for the first time the way they teach them. Don't get fooled by how easy the first half may seem. It does get a lot harder. It is crucial that you understand the concepts that they are talking about or else you will get very confused as how to approach any problem. Overall, a hard class to get an A in, but a good class to take if you are interested in the sciences.",
    "If you are looking for an easy QR look else were. But If you are looking to learn math for a major, this is a good course. The final was hard but the P-sets were not that difficult.",
    "Math 120 is a good \"next step\" for students looking to further their calculus after single variable calculus in high school. The class can teach many different theorems and applications that can be used in many other subjects, especially Physics. However, the course is very fast paced, and it is easy to get lost in all the different material being taught. Students taking this class must be wary of falling behinds, because many of the topics rely on knowledge of prior topics."
