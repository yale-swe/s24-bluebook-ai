    "This is an excellent course with fascinating readings. The final paper writing experience is also incredibly useful, involving what will probably be the most formative paper-writing experience that you will have before your senior essay. You should definitely pre-register for this class and take it if you get in.",
    "I'd recommend it if you already are interested in\/knowledgeable about the period. There isn't a great deal of effort to catch people up on the historical events\/controversies of the period (aka there is a lot of assumed knowledge). It's not hard to fill in the blanks, but it makes reading the documents and coming up with a paper topic difficult. Also, the draft of the paper comes up REALLY quickly--be prepared to be writing a full draft of a 20 page paper right on the heels of midterms....",
    "Take the class, period. In order to get in, pre register as soon as you can.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this to anyone interested in the time period from 1770-1820. Be sure that you'd be okay with reading Hamilton and Jefferson's letters, because that's ALL you read, except for the biographies you read for the first two weeks. But as long as you know that that's what you're in for, it's really a great class. Professor Freeman perks everyone else up, even at 9:20 in the morning, and she really knows almost everything you'd ever want to know about the early national American period. The early time made it harder to sit through class occasionally, but no seminar could ever keep you fully engaged all the time in a 9:20 time slot--this class did as well as any possibly could at that. Also, if this class isn't taught in the morning next time, this won't even be a factor. Try to get an early start on the term paper, because a rough draft is due a week before Thanksgiving (not sure what the equivalent time would be in the spring semester) so that she can get the drafts back in time to be able to meet with everyone before break. It sneaks up on you really quickly, but you'll be glad to have a draft done (if you write something close to a full draft) when you get back from break and have to deal with end-of-semester work. The prospectus was due three weeks before the draft, so you only had two weeks to write the draft once you got back the prospectus and found out if your paper was doable\u0096\u0096that's the one issue I would like to see fixed. But Professor Freeman line edits your drafts; she really cares about making sure you get the learning experience you should get out of this class, and it shows every week.",
    "If you get in..take it. Yes, the subject matter is awesome: you come to know two titans of US History as men. But Professor Freeman makes the class. At Yale, you will never...NEVER...have a such a world class historian care about your personal progress as a historian to such an extent as Professor Freeman does. She involves herself with your paper and line edits your draft. It's the academic equivalent of getting golf lessons from Tiger Woods.",
    "The reading is based entirely on the writings of Hamilton and Jefferson, divided up into different parts of their ideologies and lives in general. It's hard to read at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is quite enjoyable because they were such better writers back then.",
    "Freeman is the best professor I have ever had at Yale. I highly recommend any and ALL of her classes. But I especially recommend this seminar. Her stories are so witty, the assigned readings are so interesting, and the class discussion is always insightful. Also, she will word for word edit and comment on your writing, so you WILL learn so much from the class. You will also really get to know Freeman over the semester, and while she is so modest, she is also SO accomplished in her field,",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "The Age of Hamilton and Jefferson is one of the best seminars Yale has to offer. Professor Freeman is one of the most accessible professors out there. She never refrains from offering tough but valued criticism on research, lending support amidst the stress of writing a term paper, or general humor as she sets about work providing script for the Hamilton Grange Museum in New York City. Her syllabus is structured exactly by the model of the history senior thesis. By term's end, you will walk away with a comprehensive understanding of early America, a quality term paper, and a sense of accomplishment as a young historian. Be prepared, however, to work harder than you have ever worked before on a term paper. Professor Freeman has incredibly high expectations, and she expects a scholarly product at term's end.",
    "Take this class! This is thestrongest junior history seminar for its devotion to primary sources and attention to the writing process. All praise rests on Professor Freeman. Not only is she one of the top early American history scholars, but she also brings a commitment to this class that is unparalleled in the History Department and Yale College. She makes the writings of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton come alive in class with her great personality and passion for history. She also provided the most supportive and constructive essay comments I have ever received from a professor. Every seminar meeting was a delight, and never before have I been in a class so engaged with the material and professor. This was one of my most fulfilling experiences at Yale!",
    "This is my first junior seminar, and it was a wonderful choice. Probably the best preparation for the senior essay because of the highly structured, time-intensive research and writing process with PLENTY of guidance, from broad topic to prospectus to rough draft (including line by line revisions from the professor) to the final draft (and further feedback). A great sense of camaraderie within the section, and many funny, memorable moments. Be aware that sometimes the weekly reading will become secondary to your writing (especially when you end up scanning through some of the longer reports by Hamilton), but Prof Freeman does not mind when the entire class needs to discuss writing questions and concerns. A good deal of work, but very rewarding."
