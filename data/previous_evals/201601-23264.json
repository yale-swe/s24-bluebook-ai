    "Such an excellent class; you should definitely take it if you are at all interested in the material! For some background, the class this year was composed of 6 different modules, each with two labs. The first three modules were centered around fluorescence and bright field microscopy, and the last three were focused on solid state synthesis and materials analysis such as SEM and XRD. The two halves of the course were very much separated, and it is possible in future years that the two might be integrated more or might become two entirely separate courses. (This is the first year the course was offered.) The microscopy portion was incredibly well thought out; it was clear that the professor put in a lot of effort into designing the labs, and they all worked! We got to build our own bright field and fluorescent microscopes and use these to conduct single molecule fluorescence microscopy on quantum dots. Also, we built our own optical trap and actually used it to measure the torque produced by bacterial flagella. The second half of the course involved synthesizing graphene oxide, depositing nanoparticles on the graphene oxide, and synthesizing a lanthanum\/terbium fluorescent material as well as conducting IR, SEM, XRD, and fluorimeter analyses on these materials. Overall I thought it was a great class, and definitely a good one to take if you are interested in either of these areas and have taken pchem already. The more previous exposure you have had to materials chemistry and biophysical chemistry, the more you will get out of this class. The workload is very light; the main assignment is a 3-page lab report every two weeks.",
    "This course is an excellent advanced lab option for chemistry majors, as well as a great elective for non-majors. The optics section of the course is definitely harder, but really interesting and interactive. Lab sections are very small so you feel very close with your lab partners, and the TAs were excellent. Materials was much easier and rooted more in synthesis and analysis. This was the first year it was offered, so things were a bit rough around the edges at times, but I know the professors are working to fix that and integrate the two sections of the course more. I would definitely recommend this course, though be warned that the optics section is a lot more work than materials.",
    "This class is basically two separate classes; one class is on biophysics, and is really interesting and teaches a lot about the underlying physics of some spectroscopy techniques involving microscopes, while the second class is a materials science class, and is a much more traditional chemistry class in the setup of the lab. The second half of the class, the materials science portion, suffers from a lower level of effort than the first, and I felt like I didn't learn nearly as much in this half. Overall, I would recommend this class, but note that it feels like two disjointed classes.",
    "This was a great choice. Take it if at all interested in spectroscopy or material sciences. this is the only lab of its kind in Chemistry.",
    "BB: The best lab class at Yale. Take this, no matter who you are. Material touches on chemistry, physics, and biology. Material- Strong introduction to optics. I have worked in 2 optics labs throughout my research career and it was this class that finally taught me how to think about optics. I do not think there is a higher compliment I could give. Fairly deep understanding of the physics\/mathematics behind optical phenomenon also provided through interactions with Prof. Ziad Ganim. Also having worked for sometime in materials chemistry, I think that Prof. Hailiang Wang was the first person to convince me that materials chemistry is not (well, at least not all) BS. There is a lot of empiricism that creeps into complex systems, but lab questions focused on developing a deep understanding of the complex processes of materials. Also, graphene is just badass. Overall, I think this class did the best thing an undergraduate course can do. It taught me how to think about these fields. Techniques learned include XRD, SEM-EDS, Fluorimetry, Super-Resolution Microscopy, and hopefully FRET next year with even more in development. Grades- Lab reports were super chill. Three pages 11-point font (without figures). This is actually slight more than it sounds like. I would recommend writing the introduction and methods section the first weekend and the results\/discussion the second. Optics labs were far heavier on data processing and analysis than were materials labs. Nice grading as well, as I experienced it at least. Professors- Both Professor Ganim and Wang were great. Would 100% take any class they are teaching. Both are extremely patient and give great answers to questions. They have both clearly thought deeply about the subject matter and about the course in general. Professor Ganim is the only professor to have ever tired me out with my own questions.",
    "Absolutely, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's incredibly fun, inspiring, eye-opening, useful, and definitely manageable even if you are not acquainted with most of the things in the syllabus. If you like the idea of being right at the center where the most cutting-edge topics and techniques of various fields of science clash together in a fabulous big bang, look no further.",
    "In short, this class is awesome. Definitely take it. The modules are all really interesting. In the optics section, we built our own microscopes and learned how they work. We did super-resolution microscopy to pinpoint the location of particles with better accuracy than should be possible with a light microscope. We grab microscopic beads and move them around using the momentum applied by a powerful laser - how cool is that? In the materials chemistry section, we synthesized materials of the future - like sheets of graphene oxide a few atoms thick. The greatest strength of the class, however, is the dynamic between students and professors\/TFs. In most courses, the professors and students, in some sense, are on opposite sides: the professors create challenges (such as exams) that the students must individually overcome. In this class, it felt like the students, professors and TFs were all working together to solve a common problem. The professors are both amazing, especially Prof. Ganim. He's one of the most dedicated professors I've ever had at Yale - on the same level as Prof. Ellman in organic chemistry. He works incredibly hard to prepare his modules, and on top of that, he'll spend hours with you outside of class if you want to talk about chemistry (even if it's not directly relevant to the course material). Prof. Wang also did a very good job - his lectures were interesting, and his modules went very smoothly. You don't really need to know anything going into this class. I didn't really know anything beyond gen chem, and I didn't know it that well either. Most people didn't know anything about optics. You use MATLAB a bit for the optics part, but I didn't know that either. I was fine, and you will be too. The class isn't too easy - don't be fooled by the \"3 page maximum lab reports.\" Lab reports are only due twice a week, but 3 pages single spaced 11 point font isn't insignificant - especially since that doesn't include figures. The data analysis for the optics figures can take quite a while. However, it's not too bad. The reports are actually kind of fun, and from what I've heard, it's certainly not nearly as bad as pchem lab. I suggest talking to friends about the reports, it may help you out a bit. The class is probably going to be even better next year than it was this year! The optics and materials chemistry sections weren't really integrated this time, but next year they will be (for example, you'll likely synthesize quantum dots and then observe them with a microscope you build). Once again, I can't really recommend it more highly - take it!"
