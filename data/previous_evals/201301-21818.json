    "This class is a workshop to help you get ready to write your senior essay. Throughout the term you write various drafts of your essay proposal, and then the proposal is the final product of the term.",
    "If you're a Junior WGSS major, you will take this course in the spring of your junior year. This course is designed to help you think about the senior essay requirement and begin working on your own. I think your experience of this class is largely determined by the professor teaching it at the time. Professor Fischel is great so expect an amazing class if you're taking it with him. This is also a good chance to get to know other people in your major, who are almost always wonderful people, so take advantage of that and hang out with them!"
