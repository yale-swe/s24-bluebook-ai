    "The syllabus was full of fascinating books that I would have never heard of it not for this course. I really liked that Prof. Caplan related all the material to events and movements occurring throughout the world during the years they were written. I also liked that instead of having students do 15 minute presentations, which are usually boring, Prof. Caplan met with students to craft informative presentations that facilitated group discussion."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course (although unfortunately, Prof. Caplan is a visiting professor). You learn a ton about literature you would never have otherwise heard of, and Prof. Caplan relates everything we read to greater social and political movements. Prof. Caplan takes a lot of time to help students he looks at early essay ideas and meets with students one-on-one to discuss their work and the literature. The workload is real but reasonable. You will learn so much!"
