   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it, very worthwhile, but only if you have an interest in the region, otherwise you're not going to get much out of it.",
    "This class was extremely interesting. I definitely recommend taking it, especially if you have never taken a history class on South East Asia. I took it after taking many European and Transatlantic courses and thought it filed many of the gaps that had been missed. Its a great world credit worth taking.",
    "Good overview of Southeast Asia from an expert.",
    "Take Kiernan's course! You will learn so much about southeast Asia. Professor Kiernan is an expert on this part of the world, especially on Cambodia and Vietnam. The workload is very manageable: just two short papers, a term paper, and a midterm exam.",
    "This class is an introduction to the history of Southeast Asia, usually starting from the colonial period (pre-1900) and going close to the present day on a country-by-country basis. As a history major, I originally shopped it for a ROW credit, and it ended up being the best ROW class I've taken. The TA this year, ShawnaKim, was especially great. And the format of having a midterm and papers rather than a final exam was really nice come finals period.",
    "a traditional, straightforward, no messing around lecture which presents the basic facts of Southeast Asian history. Kiernan is a methodical, not always extremely charismatic, but very clear and extremely nice lecture who presents interesting ideas and problems in class.for people seeking Rest-of-the-worlds: Southeast Asia is incredibly interesting! I wasn't expecting it. But I really am happy to be familiar with the region.",
    "This course is necessary knowledge. Kiernan is very approachable and the foremost expert in his field. He's very receptive to student ideas, so go to office hours ifyou can. My only complaint is that I wish it had a more thematic and less of a chronological approach."
