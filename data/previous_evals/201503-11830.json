   "comments": [
    "English 114 was probably my favorite class of the semester. My writing improved tremendously and I feel as if I have a solid grasp on college-level writing now. The bulk of the work came from the four papers that we had to write for the course. Heather will be really nice about assigning them, making them due right before the start of special breaks\/weekends (October break, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Reading Period) so that you can have a life outside of the course! The topics related to childhood were really interesting and fun to research and learn about. I appreciated the fact that the assigned readings were short and did not take time away from the writing that we had to do. you're going to take ENGL 114, definitely take it with Heather Klemann if you can get into her section!",
    "English 114 Childhood Self and Society is a class a student should take if they are interested in gaining skills for their writing as a student at Yale while also learning and reading about extremely interesting course material about childhood. Overall, I would recommend this class and this professor!!",
    "Intro level course for college level writting",
    "Tough class but very fulfilling.",
    "This class is both rewarding and time consuming.",
    "Really helps writer clarify ideas and arguments in a paper.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you wish to improve your writing skills. The workload can be a little much, but it is definitely worth the improvements you will make in the long run.",
    "Yes, absolutely. ENGL 114 with Professor Klemann is truly a worthwhile class, as your reading and your writing improve tremendously.",
    "Yes! I think that everyone can benefit from this course. It is a really enjoyable class and a great way to help one improve their writing skills."
