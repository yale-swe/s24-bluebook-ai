    "I learned better writing through improved sentences and argument styles. It's already showing in my work for other classes (though I did just use a semi-colon, eeek!). I really appreciated learning to read more thoughtfully. I had felt alienated by literary criticism in undergraduate and high school courses, and WTW helped me appreciate a more practical type of analysis.",
    "I learned how to write clearly. This class revolutionized the way I approach writing now. I learned how to write prose.",
    "I learnt a great deal about how to write well, and with my own voice. I learnt how to think more clearly when I write, and to start with ideas, not with just with words. I learnt to listen to rhythm and to look for logic in my sentences.",
    "Writing, reading, and communication",
    "I gained a new confidence in my writing and understanding of sentence structure. I also gained exposure to new environmental literature. I also gained insights into how to write essays and some of the pitfalls that I've fallen into over the years.",
    "-I am a more confident writer (I feel that I can trust my own voice) -I now find writing more enjoyable -The quality of my writing improved significantly - clearer sentences, the ability to form clear arguments, descriptive language.",
    "I learned a lot to improve my writing skills, great repetition in practicing writing.",
    "How to observe, notice, and think creatively. How to have the authority to write about any topic. How to translate the skills of excellent, clear prose into academic writing.",
    "Attention to detail, minimalism, and analyzing each individual sentence on its own.",
    "Complete re-wiring of my writing abilities. I become a much more aware, stronger, critical writer. This class reminds us that good writing is a task in observation.",
    "So much! Wow, this course was truly amazing. I can only say that the knowledge, skills, and insights I gained from this course are how to be a better writer.",
    "I learned a new way of approaching writing -- including formulating sentences in your head, keeping sentences simple, getting to the heart of what you're trying to say, and putting yourself in the shoes of your reader. I also liked the emphasis on personal experience and observation as ways to validate claims. (As opposed to always needing to cite a source)."

    "I felt worse about my writing as the semester went on, contrary to my expectations. Maybe a before-and-after exercise would have helped with that, e.g. revise one of your first three assignments as a final project.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Thank you for so much thoughtful feedback and dedication to the course. I couldn't go to office hours very much because it seemed there was always a line. When I only had a half-hour between other courses, I couldn't wait through a 45-minute line. I would have appreciated some appointment-only office hours (maybe one day a week, facilitated by a simple Google Doc, with the rule that someone who doesn't show up in the first 5 minutes of a meeting loses their spot). Alternately, maybe you could open up one day a month that prioritizes people who haven't been at all (or have been only once, if it's later in the semester). I also would have liked midterm grades. It would have been helpful to know if I was on track for average\/good\/bad grades.",
    "The strength of the course is that you have the opportunity to write about any--and I mean any--topic that you choose every week. This allows you to explore your writing skills under many different topics--both personal and professional. One weakness of the course is that there is not a lot of direction about what to write about. It was useful when the instructor guided us to write about \"what we saw\" or told us to \"speak out\" through our writing.",
    "The strength of the class is the personal feedback that you get, and the chance to talk to Verlyn one-on-one in his office hours. The weakness of the class is that there is little incentive to revisit past-pieces of writing that you have already submitted and to think more deeply about the feedback you have received.",
    "We are supposed to write every week on the topics we are interested in. Every essay we wrote was commented by the instructor in great detail. The writing-feedback loop is a very effective mode of learning.",
    "The strengths of the course were in the instruction and the repetition of writing 500 words week after week. An improvement would be to compile all the written pieces from the semester and revise one of them from the beginning. This would show individuals the progress they've made and how to finish a piece or at least get close to finishing.",
    "-Strengths: The class format is very effective, students feel comfortable expressing their thoughts, the professor transmits a real joy for writing & language.",
    "The course structure was boring - we did the exact same thing every class. There was a lot of free form ask questions to the teacher. Varying the way that information is give to student will allow students with different forms of learning all be able to participate. This course had a lot of a few people asking questions and many other people were completely quiet and disengaged. I would say over half the class was on their computers doing totally irrelevant stuff during each class.",
    "Excellent course, in structure and delivery and community.",
    "Possibly more structured and focused on specific different things each course.",
    "The informality of this course allows all students to feel open and welcome. I like how Verlyn made sure to not allow any external pressure (i.e. grades, final papers) become a part of this class. This is a writing course for people that want to be good writers.",
    "The strength of the course is embedded in the structure of the course: weekly assignments and the different exercises that we did in class. That being said, the flow of class time became a bit redundant at the end of the semester. I would have liked for some new exercises to have been introduced. Perhaps it would be fun if students brought in one sentence each week that they really liked (or didn't like)...something from a piece they had read for a different class. I'm not sure. A little more variability in class exercises might have made the class more \"fresh.\" At times, I thought that the comments on papers weren't detailed enough. Often I felt that I would have liked more advice on the overall structuring of the piece. However, Verlyn doesn't often give that level of feedback. I think there are two reasons for that: (1) It takes more time and he has a lot of papers to edit, and (2) he is more focused on individual sentences than how the whole piece holds together.",
    "I think there could have been more instruction and guidance on the pieces. While I liked that we could determine our topic, it would have helped to break down writing suggestions and try on a few at a time. For instance, for the first three papers you could mandate 5-10 word sentences. The following paper could be an op-ed piece, etc. Essentially, a unifying theme among papers."

   "comments": [
    "Only take this class if you are willing to be patient with yourself as you work to become a better writer. This class is about unlearning all of the anxieties that you might have accumulated through academic writing. It takes time to learn how to relax and write.",
    "I will strongly recommend this course to the ones looking for a general-purpose, high quality training in English writing.",
    "This class has weekly assignments (which can be time consuming) but does not have a final exam.",
    "I recommend this course.",
    "This is a great way to improve your writing - you must be very self motivated and take the time to go to office hours every week.",
    "This class will change your life. Take it if you possibly can. And go to office hours every week-- that's where the real learning takes place.",
    "Good class for writing every week.",
    "This class is for any and all levels of writing. Whether you have been writing seriously for years and just trying to improve, take this course. Your writing will be immensely improved.",
    "Take the course. Be open to critique. I found the course to be a nice break from other courses where the workload is overloaded at the end of the semester. It's nice that each week the amount of work is about the same. Verlyn also does a great job building up the confidence of students. He is a great teacher for someone who has writer's block (although he would argue that writer's block is actually just a misnomer and that there is a different problem at work), for someone who doesn't enjoy writing, or for academic writers -- many of whom write poorly. Finally, this course is focused on writing at the sentence-level. Prospective students should be aware of this. This is not the type of course where you will develop one long piece over the course of the semester. I think that is a really GOOD thing. Verlyn convinced me that we all need to return to the task of making good sentences.",
    "How much you put into the pieces is how much you will get out. Really be aware of your thoughts during the writing process."
