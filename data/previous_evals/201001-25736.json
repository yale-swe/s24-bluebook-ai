    "I wouldn't recommend it because the teachers are all so bad. If you have a good foundation and utilize the TA's you can get by.",
    "Take it if you have to! Material was covered better than the 120 class I was in earlier in the semester, but it's still just dry calculus.",
    "if you have calculus requirement, you have to do it.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you absolutely have to take it or if you have taken calc BC in high school.",
    "Don't take it, unless your over-confident in your math abilities.",
    "I would recommend it if it is required, but otherwise not.",
    "Do take it if you want to master calculus",
    "i would recommend it. it is a very straightforward class. as long as you go to class and do the homework, you'll do fine.",
    "Mathematics 115 should only be taken if its a prerequisite for a different class that you want to take.",
    "Awful awful way to teach a class. Basically doing a bunch of example questions and hope that we understand the material. Where is the core understanding of calculus in general? Where is the discussion of why this is fundamental to our lives? Why do we have to tirelessly solve and solve all the time without knowing why we are solving them? Did the mathematics department at Yale forget why we must know the limits to series? I want to know and yet there was no one to answer my question. How is this relevant to our\/my future and how is this material going to help to understand the world a little bit better? Where are the lessons? It is buried too far beneath all the example questions that we lost the meaning\/reason we must find the volume of a function rotating around x-axis. Why is this important to understand the world? Nobody from the department has yet to tell me a good answer.",
    "If you have to take it then, you have to take it. The professors are great but its a math course a Yale and that being said it is hard and the profs don't do a great job of teaching it. Get a tutor early on."
