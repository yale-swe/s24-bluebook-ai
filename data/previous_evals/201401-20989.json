   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend thus course for anyone looking for a biology lab course. This is definitely the best one offered. You learn so much and get to use tools you may never have the chance to use again.",
    "If you are reading this, then good for you, because MCDB hasn't decided to cancel this class after all. This class is amazing, and you should definitely take it. I was a second semester senior scared of this class being too much work with my research, but it is definitely manageable and well worth the investment. You actually learn something that will stick with you in this class, and you will actually use your brain and discover awesome stuff. This was my best science class at Yale despite the work (they really should make it 1 credit), and I really doubt you will regret taking it.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to anyone who has the ability to take it. The object oriented focus kept you interested. Unlike other lab classes it was easy to come in an put extra time and you became closer with your classmates and professor."
