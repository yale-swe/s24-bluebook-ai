    "I would definitely recommend it, just because I feel as though Econ is one of those courses that every Yale student should take, but you really have to be self-motivated to do well in the course unless you've taken Econ in high school.",
    "Take it if you wanna know stuff about econ! But just not with this professor.",
    "An interesting subject, but terribly executed.",
    "Take it Credit\/D if you can.",
    "good class to get under the belt",
    "The classic Intro Micro. Not the best class that Yale has to offer, but a class that is necessary and useful if you want to explore economics. The workload was completely manageable, the lectures were blandly interesting, and the grading curve was remarkably lenient. Take this if you must - this is a class neither to dread nor to love.",
    "As far as an introduction to microeconomics goes, it's not a terrible one. You learn a lot if you're willing to put in the effort. That said, the class doesn't always adequately prepare you for the homework, which is what you should be learning from primarily, especially if you're trying to study for the midterm\/final. Section is helpful if you have a good TA, but be prepared to put in some work if you want to do well.The grading isn't terrible -- being able to drop two psets is great.",
    "A good overview, but overall the class was too fast paced and too broad. I would suggest taking an econ seminar rather than the larger lecture class.",
    "I would recommend the class; however, take it either in the fall or under another professor. Professor Weese is clearly extremely intelligent, but for a more thorough explanation of the material, I would probably look elsewhere. The course is very interesting though.",
    "Yes. If you plan to do anything even tangentially related it will likely be useful and if you don't, you can probably stand to review basic reasoning skills in a low impact way",
    "it takes a lot of motivation to actually go to class and the lectures are mostly boringthe concepts are useful",
    "A crash course in rational behavior modeling for individual players in an economy (individuals and firms). Its a course anyone should take, if only to understand the principles involved. Be prepared for a little quantitive deduction, thought.",
    "It's not super easy also not spec hard. Make sure you don't mess yourself pup on the midterm, however, because that will affect you.",
    "yes. very good introductory course...a little slow at the beginning but gets a lot more interesting later on",
    "yeah since its a prerequisite\/required coures for several majors",
    "Yes, because it is a great subject and extremely useful.",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "A course that covers the basics of economics. Don't take this unless you need to - Professor Weese's lecture information does not correspond to problem sets or exams. Sections are by far the most helpful part of the course.",
    "Cattle drive.",
    "This is a pretty standard intro econ class! The professor is great and pretty funny. I would recommend it!",
    "It's a solid class. Take it if you want to do things in Economics: it's necessary. Other than that, it's okay.",
    "The class is straightforward and not particularly difficult. I would mostly recommend it if you want to learn a basic amount of economics, but aren't a major in the field. It may not seem so interesting at times, although some topics towards the end of the class such as competition among a small number of firms were more interesting. They try to teach it without calculus, but I think if you know differential calculus, the concepts are easier to understand in that context.",
    "Yes, its a good course that lets you see if you like Econ or not. But if you can take with another professor.",
    "Alright class. Pretty easy.",
    "I would recommend this class to gain a basic understanding of elementary economic principles. The class makes a lot of economic behavior a bit clearer.",
    "Don't take it if you can help it. If you're an Econ major... good luck.",
    "Required intro course economics. Take it if you're legitimately interested in learning about basic theory behind economics or wish to go into deeper economic topics.",
    "Good course to test the waters. It could be made much more interesting, but it's tough in a lecture setting. I would definitely recommend going for the seminar because I've heard good reviews about the teachers and the overall learning experience. It's an intro course so I wouldn't worry too much if you don't get into the seminar. The concepts have real world connections and there is so much more to learn so it is intriguing to me.",
    "Learn how to draw graphs and do algebra to describe overly simplified versions of real-world phenomena.It's stunningly dull.Not worth your time. If you haven't taken an econ course before and just want to see what the field is like (like me), you will leave feeling disappointed, frustrated, and completely uninterested in taking any future courses. Of course, this stuff is a requirement for global affairs folk, so if you need it you might as well suck it up and get it over with. Still, I've never attended a course with less intellectual value. I have learned basically nothing and will study for the test by memorizing patterns of graph-drawing.Lecture is worthless. No need to buy the book. Problem sets are easy. The final and midterm merit somewhat serious study.It's crap.",
    "Yes b\/c it is an important topic but the class was boring.",
    "If you must, do it. Looking for a QR? Go elsewhere. this is just grunt work with no purpose",
    "Econ 115 is a class that many students at Yale take, but it is not an easy one. A lot of the class is teaching yourself the material, and the book is not even that helpful. Section was the only helpful resource this semester.",
    "Hard, a mess, and only take if you WANT to be an econ major.",
    "Standard intro micro econ big lecture class. That said, this was possibly the worst run course that I've taken at Yale. My TA was great and Professor Weese was alright, but everything else was designed to avoid learning on the part of the students. The 9am lecture (combined with Weese's lecturing style, both dull and spending too much time on review)resulted in a very low attendance rate. The slides are posted online but most of the information covered is not on them. The book assigned for the course is neither well written nor directly reflective of the material for class, so try to borrow the book from friends in the micro seminar (much better and more succinct). The only practical material left to study with for the midterm and final are the old tests, but because this was Weese's first time teaching the class the former professor's tests are not very accurate predictors of the actual tests. Fortunately the curve is very generous, so even if nobody really learned much that isn't reflected in the grads. Just land in the top 40% of the class and you'll be fine regardless of actual grade.",
    "Look, this class is an enormous intro lecture, and it's pretty poorly organized. If I didn't understand something in lecture or the p-set, I couldn't turn to the book (which is an intermediate micro textbook...) or my TA (who didn't have good English) for answers. You have to struggle in order to get anything out of the class, which is really frustrating. In terms of the material, it's not super interesting or intellectually engaging: you're basically just drawing graphs which show how the market is suppose to work. Maybe the micro seminar for freshman presents thematerial differently, but I found the class tedious, frustrating, and not \"useful\" (in case that's what's drawing you to intro micro).",
    "The material was relatively dull, but Professor Weese made it very engaging. He made the course very relevant (he even assigned an op-ed from YDN). He was also extremely responsive to the feedback we gave, and adjusted the course load and lecture speed accordingly. He puts a lot of thought into the class, and he makes the class fair.",
    "Big intro class. Not great but not horrible either.",
    "solid intro to microecon. A bit heavily weighted on exams though, esp. the final.",
    "i did not enjoy this class at all, all material was dense and does not provide the baseline level of economic understanding most students are seekingprofessor weese seemed really uncomfortable every time he taught. he rushed through and then retaught material, even after a class-wide survey indicated he needed to slow down..",
    "Economics 115 was a good course overall. I took it because I knew nothing about economics, and found myself enjoying the new material and new ways of thinking. The first few weeks of lecture were very rushed, but Professor Weese brought it to a more reasonable pace after asking students to evaluate the course. The problem sets often had very little to do with what we focused on in lecture, which was frustrating. Having only 1 midterm, a final, and problem sets that were graded for completion made the course very manageable, even during a very credit-heavy semester.",
    "It's a basic intro course. Nothing special, but not bad.",
    "It's decent, workload is not bad and the tests are not really hard. Get you basic understanding of microeconomics.",
    "Not too much work, one problem set a week. Good QR course, not much societal insight ensues",
    "Don't do it unless you have to. It's misery.",
    "Microeconomics is a big lecture course. Like always. Thus, you may be tempted to slack off. I personally think that if you do go to allthe lectures and actively engage the sections, then this course can turn out to be a very rewarding one. At the end of the day, the course gets its job done regardless. It gives you a general introduction to microeconomics.",
    "I may have known a little too much math to take this course, but it's worthwhile for a person wanting to know the theory behind how our economy works.",
    "I would only recommend it if you definitely have to take it for a major requirement.",
    "Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed Econ 115. I had heard lots of terrible things about it before, but I thought Professor Weese did an excellent job of designing the lectures and problem sets. The content of Econ 115 is pretty standard across the years, but it makes a huge difference who your professor is, and how he teaches the material. The stuff Weese covers in lecture is always directly relevant to exams and psets (with the exception of a few strange questions in the latter) - I wouldn't say that he teaches to the test, but he's certainly not the sort to ramble about far-removed case studies\/concepts without covering the basics first. Which is SO important in intro econ, because the material isn't very intuitive. But it's really very manageable if you attend lectures faithfully (and stay awake) and put some effort into the psets. Also the curve this semester was amazing.",
    "ECON 115 was a good class, and I'm glad I took it. I think I learned a lot of concepts that are useful for understanding how the world works.",
    "If I could have, I would have taken this class as a seminar. It's easy to get lost in the large lecture if you miss classes or stop attending section. If you attend section and\/or read most of the textbook assignments, you should be fine though. The topics covered in this class were really interesting and Weese is really good at highlighting real-world examples of things. However, the problem sets and exams often contain some convoluted questions, but luckily everything is graded on a pretty significant curve.",
    "Really boring class, but not too much work. Take only if you want to get to higher economics classes but haven't had any econ experience. You have to do well on the final because that's basically your grade.",
    "Econ 115 is a class to get through, rather than to delight in. Basic microeconomics is not terribly interesting, but is necessary to get on to macro and more interesting subjects. This course will give you a pretty good idea of the fundamentals of the market, which is good to have as so many people today are completely ignorant of it. The math required is also at a middle-school level. You don't need to attend lecture or section; I attended neither and did well.",
    "not unless you have an interest in economics. dont just take it to take it",
    "It is what it is. You'll stop going to class soon, especially if it's at 9 AM. MAke sure you do the reading if you don't go to lecture and attend section, those are helpful.",
    "Don't take with Weese. The material is fine and pretty much is the standard introduction to Microeconomics, just don't take the class with Weese.",
    "If you are dead set on being an economics major, I recommend you take it because you pretty much have to.If not, please take another class and enjoy your life.",
    "This is a course that could be interesting and not too difficult, but if Eric Weese is teaching it, I have little hope in it being coordinated, coherent, or fulfilling.",
    "Alot of new concepts tha need time to digest.",
    "I really hated this class. It may have to do with me being a humanities person and not liking lectures\/economics, but as an intro course this was taught horribly. Things were explained in a confusing manner (unless you went to office hours--the TFs were extremely helpful), and I ended up having to reteach myself everything right before the final\/midterm. Finding a more interesting lecturer would be a huge improvement. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have to take it.",
    "This was easily the worst class I've taken at Yale. Painfully dull, difficult to muddle through, all in all a wholly unpleasant experience. If you're taking it for a QR and no other reason (my situation) do yourself a favor and look for a REAL class.",
    "An introduction to some microeconomic principles with a hard curve.",
    "I took this class to fulfill a QR credit. I\u0092d taken AP Micro and Macro in high school and enjoyed economics. I figured this would be an easy class. There is definitely more algebra in this course than in an AP class. The first half of the semester (up to the midterm) was very easy if you\u0092ve already taken AP economics, focusing on perfect competition. The latter half focuses on market imperfections and the theory gets slightly deeper.The problem sets aren\u0092t too difficult in the beginning but I didn\u0092t pay too close attention in class and I depended on TAs and economic tutors to do the problems. The p-sets are not more than 7 or 8 questions and shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to do if you understand the material. The p-sets are graded mostly on completion so as long as you do them, you should be fine. I would recommend against just copying other people\u0092s p-sets though. Or if you do, make sure you understand the answers when the TAs put them online. Although each individual concept is not that hard to understand, it will become overwhelming if you try to study it all the night before the midterm or final.A significant part of the class did not attend lecture (and likely did not attend section either) by the end of the semester. It was definitely a struggle to get up for an hour and fifteen minute long 9 AM lecture every Tuesday and Thursday. If you never attended lecture except to hand in p-sets, I would say you\u0092d be fine as long as you put in a little effort to visit a TA section every week and go through the powerpoint slides yourself.I definitely struggled when studying for the final because I put other classes ahead of this one.I really only spent one full day studying for it and I think I did well enough on it. It helps to do well on the midterm, which was a lot more straightforward in my mind. That way, you can balance out your grade on the final when you\u0092re exhausted and already stressed about all your other classes. Keep in mind that the curve in my class was huge. I believe above 70% on the midterm was A-\/A range and above 50% was at least a B-. It\u0092s a nice curve but it goes to show that most people do poorly in this class.I didn\u0092t particularly enjoy this class because it was not a very stimulating lecture. I would say only take this if you have to for your major.",
    "Not if Weese is teaching it. I know people who've taken it other semesters and had better experiences, but with Professor Weese it was a poorly taught mess of a class. Steer clear.",
    "I would recommend doing the seminars.",
    "Only if it is a prereq.",
    "It's a prerequisite for many classes so take it. Not the most interesting but it's required information.",
    "The class is a giant lecture on only mildly interesting material. Professor Weese did a good job of making it seem interesting and the TA's were very useful whenever I needed help. The workload is pretty light, and problem sets took about 1-2 hours per week. Overall I would recommend this class.",
    "Take it with another professor and save yourself so much trouble.",
    "It's a sucky intro class. Econ probably gets better beyond the intro classes. If you need to take it, you just have to get it through. If you're trying to get a QR, take a different class.",
    "ECON 115 attempts to cover basic microeconomic theory but generally fails in its goals. I would certainly not recommend this to another student unless it is absolutely required for their major because I want to spare them the constant confusion and stress.",
    "This class is basic econ. What do you want? You only have to go to half the lectures because he literally repeats everything, but find a good TA and go to section so that you actually figure stuff out. Also, do old practice exams for the final.",
    "Exactly what you would expect from an Intro Econ course. Take it with Professor Weese if possible-- his lectures are generally engaging and interesting, and easy to follow.",
    "If you want to take this class I would recommend taking it in the fall with a different professor, that being said if you're taking this as an easy QR credit it's not.",
    "Econ 115 is not too hard if you go to class, go to section, and go to office hours. The midterm and the final are quite hard, but there is only one midterm (which is why it's worth 30% of the grade, and the final is 50%!!), and luckily there is a pretty generous curve, or else I would have been toast. It's a useful class to take, and you won't regret it - everyone should know a little about economics! Just go to everything and try hard, and you'll be fine. This not a class you should try to skate through - you'll have a pretty terrible grade to show for it.",
    "take it if you have to, but keep in mind that you'll have to do a lot of work on your own",
    "The course is great for anyone considering a major in economics or even a student who has wants to take a swing at the subject. Eric Weese, however, is not the best.",
    "NOPE HARD WASTE",
    "You should take this course! It is not the most inspiring course ever, but unless you really hate economics, it is good to have at least this background. There are weekly problem sets, but these generally don't take more than two hours to complete.",
    "Let's start with the good. I did not take economics in high school and this was a good introduction to the subject, especially the game theory component of the course. Our class (the professor was Eric Weese) was, I hear, much more difficult than usual, so we got through a lot of interesting game theory like Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. The teacher was very good and moreover had great research opportunities, so if you're interested in that by all means go for it. Also, this class got me much more interested in economics as a whole and I started reading more literature.The bad: if you are at all competent in math (read: know calculus) this class will be infuriating. There will be extremely clear opportunities to use calculus which will be purposely ignored. There are horror stories from the class before mine (the easier one) where a TA flat-out refused to acknowledge that marginal something is the derivative of something. I guess my friends and I did not get some sort of memo saying that the math-literate should take one of the intermediate classes instead of intro. Please please please do not take this class if you know calculus. It is actually harder, psychologically and computationally, not to use it. Do not do that to yourself. This class isn't even required for the econ major. If you know math and your intention is to get an easy A, however, you're found the right course. All of the material is learnable in less than one week. Just make sure to find one of the harder seasons, ideally with Weese, that way you'll have an advantage.",
    "Economics is a useful and relevant topic that everyone should have at least some knowledge of. This course went over the main concepts of microeconomics. I would recommend this course, but not necessarily when taught by this instructor.",
    "Good course but I had a terrible professor make sure you take it with a better one.",
    "It's Econ. You demand, Yale supplies...",
    "Boring, bad professor, some unfair test questions.",
    "Econ 115 is a basic introduction to micro. It does not use calculus at all, but if you know calculus, you get a tiny tiny bit of an advantage (very very tiny). It is pretty helpful to go to the lectures, but I know a lot of people who didn't and were totally fine. It is definitely to your advantage to keep up with the work. There's one problem set a week, one midterm, and one final. Make sure that you aren't too concerned with doing well on the problem sets, but are more focused on understanding the concepts. Go to the problem sessions every week! And get help from a TA, rather than only your friends (who of course can be pretty helpful as well). I don't mind lectures, and the curve is easier, but I know a lot of people who would have rather been in a seminar. Decide what's right for you.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in trying econ\/getting a QR. Solid course.",
    "A pretty solid intro micro class. Though the seminars are supposed to be better, Weese was a pretty good teacher I thought who gave some interesting lectures. And the lecture is infinitely more relaxing than the seminar. You still learn the same theory, but you have a nicer curve. If you're willing to put in the time, take the seminar, but otherwise take the lecture as a fun, interesting, and pretty easy class.",
    "In Economics 115 you learn the basics of microeconomics. There are weekly problem sets, one midterm, and a final exam. The lectures are not extremely helpful. Students have to spend a lot of time reading the book to understand the material. It is also helpful to go to the weekly discussion sections. I would recommend Economics 115 if you are interested in economics.",
    "Take it if you need it (unless its at 9 am !)",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student if the professor is Weese. Even if the professor is different, I would urge students to take this course only if it is a requirement for a major.",
    "Take it if you need it as a prerequisite, it will be useful.",
    "Exactly what you expect Intro Econ to be.",
    "I would summarize the course as a basic foundation for microeconomics. And would recommend it highly to other students.",
    "I would not recommend you take ECON 115 unless you plan to use it as a requirement. There are better credits out there, and unless you genuinely plan to use this class in some way, I would not take it.",
    "It really depends on whether you want to learn econ or not. If you do, take it - because it's a good course for introductory economics, but also because you really don't have much of a choice otherwise. If you don't or aren't sure, at least take it credit\/d\/fail, see how you feel about the material, and maybe switch to a letter grade. I thought the material got so much more interesting after the midterm.",
    "I would recommend it as a basic introductory course. Take the lecture if you want a general knowledge of economics, however if you plan to major in Econ take a seminar.",
    "Nice intro. Really hard final.",
    "I was okay with econ. I would recommend it if you think you might need it for your major, or if you just think that a rudimentary understanding if economics might be helpful in life, which was my goal for the course and now I think I might major in it. Econ is fine, the lectures were helpful to me, but others found them unnecessary (or just too early in the morning). I learned a lot, for sure.",
    "It's a prereq for a lot of things, so if you have to take it take it. It certainly won't be the best course of your life and expect to have to figure out a lot of the work on your own as lecture isn't particularly helpful.",
    "Introductory Microeconomics is a good foundation for the study of Economics. The course material is really interesting. However, the lectures were pretty boring sometimes and not really engaging, even though that might have to do with the nature of the course and the size of the class. The workload is really not that much - it usually takes 1-2 hours a week. Overall, I would recommend this class to another students: whether you just need to fulfill the QR requirement or are genuinely interested in Economics, Introductory Microeconomics really provides you with a new way of thinking and of looking at the world.",
    "Yes, great way to learn about the economy",
    "Intro Micro isn't terribly. It just won't be the most fun you have in a class. Actually it sort of sucks. Lectures are boring, and a lot of the TFs are hit or miss. But in the end it's only a midterm, a final, and problem sets. And there will be a lot people in the lecture to work together with.",
    "Depends on the professor to be honest.",
    "Don't take this class if you actually want to understand something about how economics really works. This class is very theoretical, and basically prepares you for higher level economics courses, but teaches you nothing of immediate value. Beware: it may sound nice that 40% of people get As, but that is almost entirely A-s. I've heard a rumor that the econ department purposely makes this class dry so that fewer people go into the major; based on my experience in this class, I'd believe it.",
    "A straightforward intro class to economics. Boring, but worthwhile if you're headed in this direction. Prof. Weese has a ways to go as a professor. Not fun but you're probably not taking this class for the fun of it anyhow.",
    "Econ 115 is great if you are interested in Economics at all. There isn't a ton of work, but the exams are hard and you have to take them seriously. Going to class and section seems optional, but it really isn't. Go to class, go to section, take it seriously, and you will be fine.",
    "Good intro course if you haven't taken micro",
    "Standard intro course that takes no more than 2-3 hours a week if you just focus on and look ath te slides and use those to answer the psets with friends.",
    "I do not recommend this course to a student, unless ECON 115 is a requirement of your major. Try to get into the seminar or take it with a professor other than Eric Weese.",
    "Econ 115 was a good intro class that was not too much work but was challenging in terms of concepts taught.",
    "Maths used = very very very little. Gets a bit annoying really...",
    "Not difficult course, but not easy. You must keep up with the work and pay attention in class and then it's fairly manageable. Workload is not bad, just a problem set every week that isn't extremely difficult, and office hours are always helpful to complete those. Professor Weese was knowledgeable about the subject and taught well, however, at some points he went a little bit too fast for me to fully understand the material. Some of the problem sets were a little vague, but I enjoyed the fact that he tried to incorporate microeconomics into real life scenarios and things in the news. Good professor overall.",
    "A really rough class for little reason. Lectures are not helpful and the book answers little questions. You have to search for someone\/something to teach you.",
    "http:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/economics\/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011\/index.htm",
    "This course is awful. Do not take it unless you need it as a requirement towards your major. Do not take it for the So\/QR credit - there are much better courses for that. The material is uninteresting, the problem sets are often unrelated to the material covered in lecture (go to TA office hours for the psets), and the knowledge you learn in the course is completely inapplicable to real life, save for the small part about interest rates. Overall, don't take it unless you need to take it for your major. Otherwise, find another course and you'll be happier. :)",
    "If youre good at math and like Lectures.l",
    "You need it for your major, so take it. Otherwise, don't.",
    "Sucks, would not recommend. A lot of people take the course though, so maybe the curve is pretty decent. Real boring.",
    "Econ 115 is a good introduction to the basics of economics. The early morning lectures can be a pain to attend. Professor Weese is a good teacher, though his choice of test problems can be a bit idiosyncratic.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a low workload social science credit. It is also one of the more practical courses I have taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 115 for another student. It is very important in terms of understanding the basics of economics, a field that is so relevant to our everyday lives. I thought the material was interesting and there are plenty of office hour time slots to discuss these concepts with the TA's to get even more out of the class.",
    "I would only recommend Economics 115 to another student if you are required to take it. Many students come in thinking that this course will help them understand daily talk about the economy, but I don't think you really need to take this course to understand that. It does clarify certain things, but it is not worth it to take this course for that sole reason.",
    "It's an interesting, useful class that is also difficult and challenging. It's definitely worth it if you have any interest in economics or if you need an interesting QR or SO credit.",
    "No, I would not recommend this unless you are really interested in economics or have to fulfill this requirement. I took the course thinking that it would give me practical knowledge, but I haven't really learned anything useful. Eric Weese is not a good teacher. Don't take this unless you have to.",
    "This is a good intro course for anyone who wants to learn more about econ. The workload's manageable, although most comes down to the midterm and final.",
    "If you are just looking to get basic economics skills and fulfill a QR, find a different QR credit, as the intro micro course at Yale is taught at an intermediate level. If you intend to possibly become an economics major like me, then you don't have a choice.",
    "A solid and well organized, if sometimes bland, intro to fundamental concepts in microecon",
    "Try to get into a seminar in Intro Micro if you can, cause if you are new to Econ you might get lost in the large lecture and the vast material. However, Professor Weese was a good lecturer and honestly put a sincere effort to help the students understand the material, though some of his efforts might have gone to waste given the large class size.",
    "This class is unique in that you can think of it in either terms of quantitative analysis or qualitative analysis. If you are trying to understand things quantitatively than you might be frustrated at the simplicity and the convoluted explanations. Overall this course is not too difficult and you learn a new way of thinking about issues.",
    "No. The material is fine, but perhaps with a professor other than Eric Weese."
