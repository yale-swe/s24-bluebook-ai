    "I would definitely recommend this to another Yale student, art major or not. Most of this class consisted of non-art majors and I think that that definitely helped provide a different perspective. There are long hours in the shop so definitely get prepared for that but overall, you get to learn a really cool skill and make two amazing sculptures that you present in class. Brent is very helpful in terms of getting started and working out logistical and conceptual problems. It's not difficult and it's a lot of fun, I definitely recommend this.",
    "Really wonderful course that will challenge the way you think, especially if you come from a more STEM-like field. Not too much time outside of class, and the time spent was very worthwhile.",
    "Learn new skills and expand your creative process with metal!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes i will recommend it. It was great that it was not simply about making illustration of art, but actually doing art by exploring with hands.",
    "good class on a technical level, lots of attention to the practical aspects, on a fine art\/theoretical level less impressive"
