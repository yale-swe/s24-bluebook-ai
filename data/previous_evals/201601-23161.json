   "comments": [
    "The material is wonderful and the class trips to Beinecke and the YUAG are very cool. That said, this is not the most dynamic class--little to no discussion even though it is a seminar size.",
    "Book illustrations are the ideal way to study art and literature at the same time! Furthermore, this class features the exciting opportunity to imagine how racial tensions and political challenges can be represented in an emotionally evocative and oftentimes beautiful way. The syllabus has a wonderful selection of materials that all students should take a look at. The material, from Harlem Renaissance to more contemporary works like those in the comic genre, was all incredibly exciting. And many of the primary materials are accessible in Beinecke collections, promising the potential for exciting research projects."
