    "It is way too difficult (for some people). Keep that in mind.",
    "In this course, you'll explore many models of consumer and firm behavior. It seems like that for some, particularly the mathematically inclined, the course is rather light, while people with less of an aptitude for math found the work to be a struggle. Conceptually, the course does not really go beyond introductory microeconomics; rather, the extensions were mostly mathematical. Still, the methods of formulating and solving these models are valuable to learn for any prospective Econ major. However, it was annoying to be stuck in hours of algebra during a few of the problem sets, where no real learning took place. The last few problem sets were more painful, so beware if you already have tons of midterms\/papers scheduled in weeks 9-12 of the semester.",
    "This was an extremely difficult course. The problem sets were grueling and the math often got extremely messy. That said, this is a requirement for economics majors, and it's a well organized classes. The problem sets were well designed, as was the general lay-out of the course. Samuelson was a decent lecturer but a very nice guy to speak to in person.",
    "I'd liken this to Orgo. Take it in the spring if you want an easier curve.",
    "One of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. Do not buy the textbook, it's worthless. You basically do problem sets with your only aid being lecture slides, which aren't that useful. Be prepared to spend hours simplifying complicated algebra and not learning much that can help you understand economics. Do not take this course. Economics majors and others who are required to take this class should demand a better course than this.",
    "intro micro + calculus.repeat.",
    "Only take it if you're an econ major. The material is dry, and the concepts are not that much different from intro micro.",
    "Econ 121 is really a study of mathematical models of econ. If you're expecting to learn about the economy, and learn about economics, this really isn't the course for that. In this class, you set up a lot of models and do a lot of math to show certain economic phenomenas that you've already learned in intro econ. If you are considering this class as a Freshman, I would strongly discourage it unless you think your econ and math back ground is truly exceptional. I had been placed into this class with my AP scores from Econ and Math, but I found myself ill-prepared to take this course. This class is a lot of work, and it really consumed my semester.",
    "it's a necessary econ course. not much else to say.",
    "only if you need it for your major",
    "Take it if you're planning to go into something related to econ. If you're just looking to expand your general knowledge, take something else- this course is basically just intro micro with more math- there's practically no new concepts. That being said, if you are an econ major, you'll have a much deeper understanding of the stuff you've learned in intro micro by the end of the course. Prof. Samuelson was an okay lecturer but his notes were amazing- I've never even opened the textbook because his notes were so comprehensive and clear. The class isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be- the most math you'll do is partial derivatives, and if you took the intro seminars you'll breeze through it. Easiest class I had all semester (but I'm an Econ Math major, so take that how you will)",
    "It's required for the major. Seriously consider your major before taking this class because I think it has little value outside of strictly academic-economic pursuits. Even if you want to go work on Wall st., when will you need to calculate general equilibrium?",
    "A really great introduction (even though it's 'intermediate,' it really is an introduction) into what microeconomics is. Not every lecture is thrilling, but the combination of lectures and homework gives you great skills to at least know what questions to ask when analyzing any number of situations.",
    "Take it if it's in your major. Definitely better than the seminar.",
    "A must-take for econ major. problem sets are not that bad.",
    "Samuelson is a good professor, and the class is pretty hard but not terrible. Towards the end is when it gets the toughest.",
    "Very early class. You may need to alter your sleep schedule.",
    "I recommend it if you are an econ major and it's required. I don't think the material was incredibly interesting but it wasn't mind-numbingly boring either. If you take intermediate micros, definitely take it with Samuelson. He explains concepts really clearly in lecture and is also helpful during office hours.",
    "It's basically the math behind econ. If you know math well, you'll do fine in this class.",
    "Tough class. Don't take it unless you are majoring in it.",
    "I would have liked to do a lot more application during class. I felt that we studied the theory fine and I would understand what was going on, and then I would look at the problem set and be very confused. The book was only tangentially related to the class, so I couldn't do practice problems there, and the ta sections were humorously unhelpful. I found myself latching onto other students in the class to go over problem sets, which often led to them explaining nearly everything to me. The tests were pretty fair and graded kindly. Basically, I think that Larry Samuelson is a good enough teacher and the material is interesting enough for this to have made a really exciting class. What it was instead was a course with boring classes that you didn't really need to go to, difficult problems sets that were hard to understand and hard to complete--especially if you wanted to do them on your own, and a course where I am walking away not really understanding what I was supposed to learn--and not really caring about the subject anymore. Also, it's at 9 in the morning, so you won't be able to stay awake.",
    "The P sets take awhile, but it's not bad at all. Just put in time each weekend.",
    "It's difficult, but manageable. I don't see why you would take this if you weren't an Econ, EPE, Global Affairs Major, but in any case it will provide you with a good theoretical background (lots of algebra proofs of concepts you learned in Intro Micro).You don't need to know multivariable. He teaches you it. This is a well taught course, take it with Samuelson.",
    "This class is no joke. It is really hard and involves a lot of studying and time on the problem sets. You are probably not just taking this class for fun, but to fulfill a major requirement.So just sweat it out. Take in the information, and you will be done with probably the hardest course in economics.",
    "This is actually a great economics class, and although it is early in the morning, Larry makes the material interesting and you will learn a lot.",
    "If you're at all interested in economics, take the class. It's really rewarding; at the end of the semester, you'll realize that you've learned quite a lot.",
    "Good course to learn what drives firms and consumers to make decisions.",
    "Take it if it's your major requirement, or if you really like math. I think I have learnt more about math than about econ in this class.",
    "Take this if you're an econ major. Avoid the class if you're not. The professor does a decent job during lectures. The final exam was ridiculously hard. I felt betrayed.",
    "Standard intermediate econ course at Yale.",
    "You will get absolutely nothing out of this class. This class is everything you learned in intro micro again but this time the math side. You learn almost nothing new about economics so if you are not an econ major, do not take this class it will be a waste of your time.",
    "Problem sets are challenging. The midterms and finals have easier questions. Take this if it is required, or if your interested in this sort of thing...",
    "I think that while the course is strong and the professor is fairly good, the level of difficulty on the psets is unjustifiably hard and is not reflected in the exams. Also I think that the instructor should make it explicit that the textbook is not mandatory as I did not use it but spent $90 purchasing it!",
    "This course is basically all basic calculus. If you can do calculus it will be very easy. If not, don't take.",
    "Very math intensive. The focus is on the math rather than the economic concepts underlying the math. Problem sets get really tedious toward the end of the semester. However, I would say I had an overall positive experience in the class and I definitely feel I know more about economics after taking the class.",
    "I would only recommend this to someone who absolutely wants to major in economics. If the student is not sure, I would tell them to take another course. This course if very difficult and is a huge time commitment to a non-major.",
    "Definitely take the class. The math isn't difficult at all and as long as you know the concepts, you'll do well on exams.",
    "This course is not easy. Take it if you are seriously interested in economics. If your math is not great, maybe reconsider.",
    "I recommend it to all Econ majors, especially sophomores.",
    "Math intensive, gets more difficult at the end. Be prepared.",
    "If you have to take intermediate micro and don't want to take a more theory and math based theory class, take this class. It is a well taught class, though we don't really go into much detail about how the theories came to be and how they can be proved",
    "Yes, if you are an econ major student because this course is a requirement and can make you understand better about economic concepts.",
    "Econ 121 is a tricky course, but overall I found it very satisfying, because it lets you explore concepts that were introduced in intro micro in much greater depth. If you have to take the course, take it with Professor Samuelson!! He is incredibly intelligent, and has a gift for communicating clearly and explaining difficult concepts well. If you put a lot of effort into the problem sets, attend class and are lucky enough to get as great a teacher as professor Samuelson, the course isn't nearly as bad as it's made out to be by many econ majors.",
    "If you're reading this, you're probably an econ major who has to take this course. Save yourself the trouble and take it in the spring instead. Intermediate micro in the fall with Samuelson is painful. Problem sets may seem easy in the beginning, but by the end, they will take up a ridiculous amount of time, and even after all that effort, you won't be able to tell how you did. Though Samuelson's a decent lecturer, class was at 9 in the morning, and many people didn't bother going. Section was minimally helpful though it definitely depends on which TA you get. But again, take it in the spring.",
    "Most take this course because of a major requirement but honestly this is a very rewarding class past the introductory that most should take in order to get a firm grasp on the tools and perspectives economist use and have to evaluate and look at the specific industries.",
    "It looks at the concepts from intro micro and goes in depth with math concepts like Lagrangian multipliers. By the end, the greatest takeaway is the way the class makes you think and approach problems, but to accomplish this, it takes a great deal of often tedious work. If you're not a fan of this kind of course (with tedious work and long problem sets), I wouldn't take the class. If you're an econ major, I'll say that Samuelson was a great professor to take it with.",
    "Although there is a myth that intermediate micro is really hard, don't believe it. Especially the first parts of the course (until the first midterm) is very straightforward, and you only need to know some calculus, and Prof Samuelson goes over it. Also your TAs go over the math before you start the econ, so you should be all set. I thought intermediate micro was much better than intro micro, because everything was math based, and once you get the math, it's much easier to understand than conceptual micro. It will be challenging towards the end, but any course at Yale is challenging. Don't be afraid to take this course.",
    "On the whole, ECON 121 was a great experience. Through the application of mathematics (nothing too difficult; you'll be fine with MATH 112\/115), I gained a muchdeeper appreciation of microeconomic theory. Although Dr. Samuelson is a great lecturer (and overall great guy), I found that attending lecture was somewhat unnecessary for completing homework problems and test questions, which tend to be much more practical. BUT GO TO SECTION and if you can, get Dongkyu for your TA (hands down best TA I've had at Yale). Section proves invaluable for completing homework assignments. Homework is reasonably challenging; tests vary widely in difficulty. But the overall curve is pretty good (I hope) so I wouldn't stress too much about the grade.",
    "It's a good class and Samuelson is a good teacher, but the problem sets can be very tedious and annoying",
    "Do not take this class if you have not done intro to microeconomics",
    "I would summarize it as a follow up to Intro Micro, that is well taught by Samuelson and actually fairly interesting. Definitely not as bad as most people make it out to be. I would only recommend it though if its a course that you have to take for the major.",
    "Only if you're an econ major.",
    "Yes, I will recommend it, very hard, but rewarding. Make sure you know all the knowledge before you come in, I did the IB, and micro in IB was very different, and I had to pick up some new concepts.",
    "If you're not an econ or EP&E major, I don't really see the point to taking this. BUT, if you are in a major where you have to take some sort of intermediate micro, I'd recommend this one with Professor Samuelson. This is where you learn to think like an economist, and I think it's absolutely essential to either of these majors. Professor Samuelson does an excellent job of explaining concepts that will come in handy. The course is difficult, but not the monster it's made out to be by some. Also, know that the problem sets will take up all day Sunday.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Professor Samuelson tries very hard and he is a good professor, but the course material is simply dry at best. Go to the lectures, find a good TA, and shut your eyes, this is one that you'll just have to grind your way through.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Nope, not unless you have to for the econ major.",
    "Its hard, only take it if its for the major",
    "This class should only be taken by those who are serious about the econ major. Others should steer clear of it.",
    "This class is a good class. I liked it better than intro micro, because it takes all of the concepts learned in intro micro and applies calculus to them, which makes them much easier to manage.",
    "Definitely take it if you have even just a little interest in microeconomics, and take it with Professor Samuelson. He is extremely friendly, approachable and helpful, and he tries to explain everything pretty clearly during class. The exams are pretty fair and curve is good. The course focuses much on mathematics. Some homework problem sets are a bit lengthy but they really do show applications of some of the most important ideas and concepts discussed in class, and they will be helpful for solving a lot of similar problems. For TA, definitely get Byounggun Park if you can, or at least get to know him if you don\u0092t get him. Awesome teaching, awesome materials prepared for each section, very friendly and patient and really cares about students.He wrote his own slides for each section, and also prepared his own solutions to those practice exams that do not have answer keys. Overall, I\u0092d definitely recommend this class to anyone thinking of taking intermediate microeconomics."
