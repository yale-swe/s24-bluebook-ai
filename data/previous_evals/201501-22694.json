   "comments": [
    "Great class especially if you are Jewish. You learn a lot about Jewish identity through the lens of Jewish thinkers throughout history. Eli is a great lecturer, but he is very disorganized, so watch out. Also, your grade is concentrated in very few assignment which can end up being pretty stressful.",
    "This is a terrible course, which is a real shame. Only Professor Stern could make such interesting material unenjoyable. He did not care about the class at all and was extremely unorganized. Besides canceling the class numerous times, he would ask students what the syllabus said, and it was clear he put no time or effort into the class. He is extremely unorganized and event sent us our final 2.5 hours late, saying he had \"jetlag.\" It's a travesty that he is a teacher at Yale.",
    "This course would be the ideal course to audit. However, Professor Stern did not allow auditing my semester. Basically, though, the lectures are amazing. I learned so much and was always engaged. The assignments, however, were something of a trudge. They felt a little more like busy work than something I was actually learning and growing from.",
    "This is an interesting class, but just know that Professor Stern is crazy--and he sometimes doesn't show up to class, or isn't organized, etc. I would recommend taking it Credit D just because he is an unusually hard grader considering he gives little instruction about assignments. If taken Credit D it isn't hard--definitely interesting.",
    "A cool class to learn about Jewish thought",
    "Great class, best professor at Yale. You have to like philosophy a little bit and be willing to do the readings. Stern is amazing he really cares about his students, a true educator. He doesnt dumb things down he makes you feel like a real person. He is really kind and just an admirable person.",
    "A very interesting course that introduces the basic trends and evolutions in Jewish culture, religious organization, and philosophical thought in Europe (both Eastern and Western) from the 16th to the 20th centuries. A bit disorganized, but it's a small and participatory-style lecture, so that wasn't a big problem. Shop the class, you'll either love Professor Stern's style or not."
