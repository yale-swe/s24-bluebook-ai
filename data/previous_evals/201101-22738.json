    "If you're serious about writing, do this. It's almost totally structureless, but learning to write for volume in that kind of environment is extremely useful. Particularly if you're thinking about becoming a professional writer, do this to get a taste of what that might entail (and good luck).",
    "Do it.",
    "I would of course recommend it. You're a creative writing concentrator and a playwright. One thing: Try to get your minimum page requirement set at 85, not 100, and you'll work harder on a more manageable amount of material. No other senior project requires 100+ pages in a year, much less a semester, and anyone who says that one page of play is worth less than one page of a novel is underrating good playwriting and the difficulty of the process when it's done well. Ask for a change in minimums, and if that doesn't happen, still take it \u0097\u00a0unless you're feel like you would fit better with Deb Margolin. She's more abstract or something - the word on the street."
