   "comments": [
    "This is a juxtaposition of different readings on American Indian history, but it's not a comprehensive overview of that history. It can be confusing coming into it without much background. Take the course if you want to focus a lot on a research paper.",
    "I loved this course so much. Professor Blackhawk is one of those amazing professors whose amazing scholarly work will inspire your own. The course becomes a mini-community of people dedicated to learning really important, inspiring, and interesting material.",
    "Writing Tribal Histories is a history research seminar class. As with most seminars, the quality of the class and the engagement during the semester is based largely on the students taking the course. The more students are willing to do the reading, research throughly into topics and questions, and discuss various portions of the course the more enjoyable class time will be. Professor Blackhawk is very knowledgable on the material covered in the course, but often times that knowledge has to be coaxed out of him by way of questions and inquiries. The work load is not too heavy, but it is important to keep up with the reading. One vita part of the course is the final research paper. The topic is incredibly broad and you will probably be able to relate most anything you can think of to it. But once you have your topic, begin doing your research ASAP. It's hard to recover from falling behind on that portion. I would recommend this to students who are looking to learn more about historical research and discussing that research in a seminar setting.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, if nothing else for the material. Nothing feels more urgent or important to me than engaging with histories our country has been trying to systematically erase for centuries, and this course stands in refreshing opposition to the colonialist narratives we still hear even sometimes at Yale. The course moved at a reasonable pace and was very discussion-oriented, which I enjoy. Many of the students were native and therefore offered really amazing insight from various cultural perspectives. A few of the reading assignments definitely fell flat (you just cannot convince me to enjoy reading an entire book about treaties) but the duller texts were balanced out by material that felt more interesting and relevant to writing contemporary tribal histories. Overall I'd say yes, definitely take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for any person who is interested in Native American history, especially in portrayals of Native American history or in researching and writing onsome aspect of it. Professor Blackhawk is a great and very knowledgeable professor. He's very accessible and helpful with the final research project. Also, the seminar setting is great for discussion on the really interesting assigned readings and for working on a final project. If any of this appeals to you and you have the chance, take this class!",
    "This is an excellent research class that worked more like an independent study than an intensive history course on Native American tribal history. I really enjoyed this research aspect of the class. The final paper is long but Professor Blackhawk is extremely supportive and sets up the class so the research for each student is completed thoroughly and thoughtfully.",
    "This class places you on the forefront of Native academia. Our trip to Montreal and a nearby Mohawk community was fundamentally perspective-altering. The class is engaging, tightly-knit, intellectually demanding, and unsurprisingly subversive. The research we were encouraged to do was empowering. Take this class. If you dare."
