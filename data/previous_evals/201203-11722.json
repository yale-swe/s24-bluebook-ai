   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's well worth it",
    "Some lectures are more engaging than others- it is not as much of a seminar discussion as a lecture with various student presentations. The class, however, does not have any exams, so it allows for more enjoyment of the material and less stressing about understanding all the computations. The essays are a great introduction to writing and researching for freshman, and I learned a lot. I would recommend this class.",
    "If you're not the best writer and looking for a WR credit, you should definitely consider this class. A 10 pg. paper for the midterm and a 20 pg. final paper is definitely manageable if you plan in advance. Other than the papers this class is virtually no work, and you really get out of it what you want.",
    "If you're already interested in the subject, go for it. If you're not, it probably won't change your mind. It isn't a lot of work most of the time, so if you want a low-workload class this is a good one for that. I really liked it, but I know many who didn't. If you're prepared to be very proactive, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "Worst class I took all semester. Not a seminar in any sense of the word. A lecture but longer by 30 minutes. Wasn't so much bad as it was uninspiring, dull, and disappointing. Professor Parker, no doubt a very intelligent man, just read to us from packets for the entire class. By the end of the semester he knew one name out of 18 students. If you're looking for dynamic discussion about the scientific and social implications of nuclear weapons, radiation, and cosmology then look elsewhere. The only redeeming factor is the writing credit. Not worth it in my opinion. There are much better freshman seminars with WR. It looks like Parker will be leaving next year though.",
    "This course gave me a lot to think about and provided me with a lot of background knowledge to use in later research. It was not a very heavy workload except for the 20-page final paper, but was overall an enjoyable class.",
    "Physics 095 teaches main concepts of physics and some advanced topics on radiation. I definitely recommend this course to other students because of its excellent course material and its awesome professor. You will learn a lot from Professor Parker's teaching style. It is an amazing course that any student will be lucky to take.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Each session was extremely tedious and boring and failed to engage the class, despite being a seminar. The workload is very light but you would be better off taking a different class."
