   "comments": [
    "Animal Models was a very interesting course and a real eye-opener to some of the most prevalent clinical disorders and progress of current research projects. It is a very worthwhile and interesting class--truly inspiring. I HIGHLY recommend this course to other students.",
    "If you're a non-science person looking for a science credit I have one piece of advice: Turn. Back. Now. Unless you already know of or are comfortable with spending hours learning about the brain and the processes that govern how it works, step away from this course and never look back. To be fair, understanding the way most of the animal models worked, and the experiments used to test them was not incredibly difficult, but learning the neurobiology involved was pretty much ridiculous. And the tests... oh the tests... get ready to have your tush handed to you, cause the tests made me want to cry in a corner (and I did just that - several times in fact). Basically, this course is not for those of us who are not gifted in science, and I wish someone couldhave told me this before I signed up. Sigh.. farewell my beloved GPA.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are very interested in the material and are interested in pursuing a career in neuropharmacology or psychology. Be prepared to be tested on random, specific details mentioned in lecture that don't really seem relevant to the course. Also, the lack of a textbook makes lecture attendance very important.",
    "NO!",
    "Good, accessible, informative account of psychiatry's responses to the most prevalent mental disorders.",
    "Take if you like science, know some biology. If you want a gut science, this is not it!",
    "If you really like the brain (that means you can name every single part of it right now) then take this class. Otherwise, your in for a doozy. Interesting material though in terms of the disorders learned about, but it's really science-y and tests are detail specific.",
    "This is a very good class, but it is not easy for somebody who is just looking for a science credit. It requires a lot of background in neuroscience and the tests are very specific and hard. The material is absolutely wonderful, it is so interesting and I learned so much, but I definitely had to put a LOT of time and effort in this class.",
    "The tests were difficult. The material was hard to understand in lecture sometime so it was very important to read over his notes before each test.",
    "i would definitely recommend it, it's a good sc and\/or psych credit, the material is interesting and there isn't too much work, the prof. is very nice and easy to talk to",
    "Yes. Definitely take it if you want a not-too-complicated view of psyc.",
    "NOT a gut class.",
    "You learn very interesting, relevant things,but it's definitely not a gut class, so if you are looking for an easy science, this is not the class for you. However, if you have some basic knowledge of biology, are interested in how the brain works and current medical research, and are willing to cram pretty intensely for class, you'll probably like the class. I feel like I learned things in this class that will stick with me a long time.",
    "Not a gut. Only take it if the subject interests you. It did interest me, and I still had trouble paying attention in lecture.",
    "It's a class about things that can wrong with the brain. I would recommend it simply because it's really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is not a gut science class, but you will leave feeling like you learned something. Professor Donegan is very soft-spoken, but if you are interested in the material, you will realize that he is extremely well-informed and an eloquent speaker. The class is really enjoyable and not too much work.",
    "Very difficult material for a non-psych major, do NOT take this class for an easy Sc credit.",
    "Great class if you're even remotely interested in learning how those disorders work. I am not a science person and I was kinda scared but it worked out well and I am sooo glad I took thiscourse. Now I better understand how the brain works and I even got a test-taking technique from that class that I applied in the final and it worked! It's simply a very very interesting Science class because you don't really go into the boring science stuff that much and the boring stuff you do go through, you quickly understand WHY it's important you go through it: it's important to be able to understand how the disorder works! I would really recommend this class although you should be careful because the tests are not easy.",
    "This class was extremely boring some days and really interesting during others. It requires a lot of rote memorization of the names of drugs and neurotransmitters, which is something as a Psych major I wasn't used to. The tests were not the easiest, but the curve can be generous. Make sure you have an interest in abnormal psych. I took abnormal pysch the year before and found that it helped out a lot with understanding the disorders. Only take this course if you really, really, really need to.",
    "Do it if you find memorizing easy and need an easy A-\/A. Of course, you still have to study and memorize, but that's all you really need to do.",
    "Fine class for a science credit. It's more or less acourse on the scientific method as applied to medical treatments of diseases, but the tests are mainly centered on memorizing terms and concepts. The class is also very much a lecture in the classical sense - the professor goes through a list of loosely outlined remarks in succession until the end of class.",
    "take it if you are genuinely interested in the material\/are a psychology major.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is sciency, but not too heavy on the science. I learned a lot about drugs and mental illnesses. The professor's lecture style is rather dry, so if you aren't interesting in the material, you may get bored. If you are interesting in the material, though, he is very knowledgeable and the lectures are all very structured.",
    "Professor Donegan is very boring and is very difficult to listen to. I would not recommend this course!!!! It is very specific information presented in a very overly-complicated and dull manner.",
    "It's a good class. Mind you, there isn't really an organization that makes sense, so it can be confusing when studying for the test, but in general it's a good class. Professor Donegan is always willing to meet with you outside of class and is always prompt with his e-mails, which makes it really easy and convenient to ask questions at any time.",
    "This class reviews various experiments that have been done with animals to model clinical disorders, and goes over the disorders themselves as well. They're pretty fascinating. I would definitely recommend the course to another student. Though they should know that there's a lot of studying involved."
