    "To my mind, this course had two goals: 1) offer a history of the development of American silent cinema from 1895 to 1920; and 2) present a survey of historiographical possibilities through several \"case studies\" (employing narratology\/formalism, Foucauldian cultural analysis, race studies, gender studies, etc).A student of film should take this course, not only to understand the initial development of the medium, but also to become aware of the various critical approaches employed in the field."

   "comments": [
    "This course offered me a wide range of critical and analytical tools that I can use to approach the study of film. My understanding of the current state of American early film scholarship, and by extension of film studies generally, has been improved tremendously by this course. This is also the first course for which I've had to delve into old newspaper collections on microfilm, and I'm very grateful for the experience. Since I intend at the moment to research the influence of developing communication technologies on literary style in the earlytwentieth century, this course may contribute greatly to my dissertation."
