   "comments": [
    "The Rae lectures were great. The Zannoni lectures, not so much. It's a surprisingly detailed overview of Capitalism, and quite unlike other Economics classes you might take.",
    "This is a great class. Very interesting lectures, pretty good readings and excellent professors. Assignments are interesting and not too tough.",
    "The class was pretty unstructured and it was hard to tell what assignments were coming up and how you were doing. Not much work (1 open note midterm, 1 open note final, and 2 short memos) and no sections. Doug Rae is great and really cares about his students. Class is very much a survey course so it's pretty straightforward, and I would recommend it as a manageable 5th or interesting intro into capitalism",
    "Highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes. Excellent class!",
    "Take this class! Rae is an incredible lecturer, the material is interesting and applicable and the grading isn't difficult (2 memos, and an open note midterm and final) and the exams were completely manageable so long you go to lecture.",
    "First half with Doug was great. Second half with Paulo felt like a huge letdown.",
    "Take it!! Cool class but be careful of the very loose structure!",
    "The course looks at the growth of capitalism through various lenses such as money, credit, voluntarism, and historical bills of account. I would not recommend this course to anyone unless you are taking it credit D - the grading is too arbitrary and the professor doesnt support students.",
    "Good class that's well taught for the first half. Professor Rae is a fantastic lecturer, and the workload is more than manageable. Professor Zannoni is a difficult lecturer to follow and his slides are impenetrable, but he's clearly very knowledgeable, and there are lessons to be learned from his experience. I'd say take it if you're at all interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "It's a relaxed lectured about the basics of capitalism. I would recommend it if you want to learn more about the broad concepts and mechanisms that make the wheel function. It might seem a bit obvious if you are already in tune with broader themes of capitalism.",
    "Definitely worth taking. Great if you want to know more about general business principles.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student",
    "Absolutely! A great class and gives a good taste of what management school is like.",
    "I took this class as a light fifth credit during senior spring. Grading is easy and the class is not too much work. There are two memos to write from four, a midterm and a final, all of which were really straight forward. Take it!",
    "I recommend this course for a business school experience. Over view of major developments in capitalism.",
    "It was just an okay class, as an easy lecture. It doesn't provide an in-depth look at capitalism at all, so if you're looking for that then this class is not for you. The material only covers \"what is capitalism\", reiterating things that we already know simply by looking around us. The class is full of interesting, but irrelevant stories\/facts. At least it was really easy with a very light courseload, and readings are basically optional. The professors are cool too!",
    "Yes, the chance to take class in the awesome new building, cool lectures, great readings."
