   "comments": [
    "Yes. The course is manageable and generally enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend to other students",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to a student who is already slightly familiar with Spanish and is interested in improving his or her Spanish comprehension and speaking skills. I had not taken Spanish since high school before this class and I came out feeling as though my Spanish had improved immensely. Profesora Reymundi is great, but I hear she is a strict grader.",
    "Spanish 130 03 is a great section if you've been placed into L3 Spanish. Professor Reymundi is the head of all the L3 sections and is an excellent, clear Spanish instructor. The work load is more than other classes because it is every day, but that is to be expected from a language class. I would recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Teaches you how to speak fluently in spanish, and you learn how to speak about relevant things. Professor Reymundi is awesome, very understandable and very approachable. I loved this course, and Professor Reymundi was one of my favorite teachers this semester!",
    "Take it. It's vital to your fluency. You may not leave the class speaking the best, but you'll certainly understand so much better and begin to feel more confident in your skills.",
    "Review of L1 and L2 grammatical structures, with more difficult reading and writing along with a bunch of new vocabulary. Basically strengthening the skills learned in L1-2.",
    "i mean you're either taking it cuz you love spanish or to fulfill requirements. if for some reason you are in between - dont take it.",
    "It is generally a redundant class despite learning something new here or there. It is more about repeating L1 and L2 and polishing grammar than anything else."
