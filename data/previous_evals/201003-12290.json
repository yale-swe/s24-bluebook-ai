   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the class. The workload is by no means unmanageable (although this won't be your slacker class; there are weekly graded homeworks and quizzes). If you're interested in taking a class that doesn't require you to learn an accent or speak to foreigners, or if (like me) you're looking to learn a deliciously systematic and logical dead language, this class will be great fun. Besides, if you take it with Beasley, you'll probably get a good grade because his grading is really lenient.",
    "Latin 110 is a really interesting course. Yet, if you are just taking this as a language requirement I would not recommend it since it is way more work than other language courses and the class is very fast paced.",
    "It is an intensive course and should only be taken by people serious about learning Latin. This is not a good way to easily fulfill a language requirement.",
    "A hard class i would recommend this if you have a real interest in the subject.",
    "Good intro latin course",
    "I hear that the department may split Latin into slow and fast paced for next year, in which case you can choose whichever you're most comfortable with. But as is, this is a very tough language course.",
    "I would recommend the class, though I would add that it is a very very intense class, that the material is heavy, that the book goes very fast, and no one or anything can stop the weekly quizzes. So, provided you are ready for Latin boot-camp, you will get a lot out of this class. It's not easy, even though it's a language class, which sometimes have the reputation of being on the light side. There is a lot of memorization and repetition and trying to remember what noun is what declension and how to form pluperfect subjunctive and so on. There is nightly homework and weekly graded homework. The teaching fellows are a lot of fun and will try to make the process as painless as possible, but requirements are requirements. So, if you want to write like a Roman, be prepared to sweat like one.",
    "I would suggest this but not to take it if Tom Beasley is your teacher.",
    "This class was very good. You learn a lot of Latin grammar in a very short amount of time."
