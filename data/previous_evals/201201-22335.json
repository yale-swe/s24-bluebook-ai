    "Take this course! It is the perfect class for a history or english major. Writing a biography is probably some of the most difficult type of writing you could ever learn to master. Reading through twelve different ones and writing a short autobiography will make you not only a better historical or biographical writer but a better one on the whole.",
    "shop the people, not the class.",
    "This class is wonderful. It might not deserve all the hype it gets as being an incredibly amazing intellectual experience, but it is definitely up there with the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Gaddis is smart, focused, and dedicated. The reading list is so much fun: books you would want to read anyway, maybe with the exception of a 650 page biography of Khrushchev. You never really know what's going to happen in seminar: the author of the book you read that week might show up, or Professor Gaddis might win a Pulitzer Prize, necessitating a Claire's Cake party, complete with toasting. The best part is definitely the semester-long project of writing a biography based on primary research, usually done in the Beinecke or Sterling M&A. Students pick the coolest, coolest people, and the process of writing the biography is immensely rewarding, both for the skills training and the questions it makes you ask. In short, definitely take this class.",
    "If you get into this class, absolutely take it. It is a lot of reading, and the final biography can seem like a handful, but it is so worth it for the one-on-one experience with Gaddis. This course doesn't really feel like a history class, as much as a literature course taught by a history professor. The biographies read are all over the map, but the seminar discussion is always interesting, and Gaddis is full of fun surprises (Bush's ghostwriter the week we read Decision Points, recordings of Isaiah Berlin interviews when we read his biography). Gaddis truly is one of those iconic professors whose presence is such an experience - he has a wealth of stories and knowledge. You will absolutely be engaged in seminar and glad you took the class.",
    "If you manage to get into the class, take it. Gaddis just one a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of George Kennan. Need I say more?",
    "I recommend this course only to students who are mature enough not to care what a superstar professor thinks of them.",
    "YES. IF YOU CAN GET IN, TAKE IT. Don't be scared of the biography. It is a lot of fun and really what you make of it.",
    "Start early on your paper!",
    "It's like a book club with John Gaddis. It is a wonderful course and I would recommend it to anyone interests in writing and people.",
    "Great course. Great books. Great professor. Definitely take this if you can. Also the final project is actually a ton of fun.",
    "You read a biography a week for the semester, all the while researching and writing a biography of your own, on a subject of your choosing. It's one of Yale's great classes. Absolutely recommended. Not only is Gaddis an eminent historian and brilliant scholar, he cares about his students and wants you to succeed. Take it.",
