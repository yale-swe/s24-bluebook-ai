    "Actually very impressed with American studies for how well they do the year long thesis! I thought the seminar was great, if only for Najwa and the communal energy.",
    "I would recommend doing a senior project only if you are confident with the medium of your project, whether it be directing a play or even just having good reading and research skills. Your year will be very difficult if you are not confident working in the medium and\/or if you haven't previously engaged with the content.",
    "The intensive senior project is a rare and incredible experience, especially within the American Studies department. The encouragement you receive from the department to pursue your passions is unparalleled. It is one of the best parts of the major for sure. Definitely do it, and choose something you love--you'll never regret the skills you build and having a meaningful final product!"
