    "Take it if you are really keen on improving your Chinese. It'll improve your writing, reading, speaking, and listening. It's quite a lot of work, but there are clear expectations, and you'll get the hang of it after the first few weeks.",
    "This course requires quite a bit of effort on the part of the student. However, the return is substantial. My reading and writing skills have improved significantly over the course of the semester. There is less emphasis on speaking and listening (which is natural since this is heritage level), but I feel that I have improved a lot in these areas too. The content and vocab covered is very relevant to modern Chinese society. It is definitely useful for anyone interested in working in or visiting China. I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to improve their Chinese."
