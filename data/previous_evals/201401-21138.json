    "HIGHLY recommend if you're interesting in practicing your Italian and learning new vocabulary.",
    "This class is your reward for sticking through L1-4. Obviously this was due to Prof.ssa Chiodo's individual style, but the whole semester was centered around the topic of food and its relationship with culture, language, and identity. Which meant that we spent just as much time cooking and eating (living what we were learning) as we did in the classroom discussing our brief readings. Top notch class. I now know how to make pasta from scratch, pesto, risotto, and minestrone, among other things.",
    "Although I did not improve very much in terms of learning how to speak the Italian language, I would absolutely recommend this course to any student taking Italian. This is one of the best and most useful classes I have taken at Yale. Professoressa Chiodo's addition to the course, by making it a course with a focus on food, absolutely rocked. Beyond being an Italian language\/culture class, I found it to be an opportunity to learn what a joy cooking is and how wonderful the Italian culinary arts are. I brought home the skills and have been cooking Italian food with my mother, which is something I never knew or expected I even wanted to do. The class exposed me to many different ways of looking at food, but I think just giving students the chance to cook, and especially eat, the Italian food we prepared was a unique and inspiring twist on what would have been an ordinary course."
