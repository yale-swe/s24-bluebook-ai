   "comments": [
    "Reasonably good class; Semmel won't put you to sleep and a lot of interesting events happened in this period, especially if you like history of social and political movements. The course often felt strangely unthematic, though: I learned a lot of things in this class, but it's not totally clear to me that I have a greatly improved picture of, well, 19th-Century Britain. I can talk a lot about political unrest though!",
    "THIS WAS A GREAT COURSE! Semmel is a really good lecturer and I thoroughly enjoyed the material, though the first half of the course was definitely more interesting than the second half. However, he was pretty disorganized administratively at the beginning of the semester, as we didn't know for two weeks when sections would meet, which totally messed up my schedule when he finally announced them. Make sure you hassle him about section times as early as possible so you don't get messed up. Still, I highly recommend this course!",
    "If it sounds interesting, take it. The papers are non-traditional, so they require very little research, which eliminates a ton of time you would normally spend writing one. Also, the reading is only primary sources, but its not very much.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Take it. You will learn a lot.",
    "The way in which the lectures are structured make it hard to understand the course. I found myself constantly checking and re-checking dates, because nothing is taught chronologically. If you do well with themes, you'll probably be okay.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially history majors interested in politics. A lot of what we talked about was relevant to or led into today's politics.",
    "Prof. Semmel was a good lecturer and the course was pretty interesting. Course makes little reference to the British Empire, so don't take this course if that's what you're looking for. I would have appreciated secondary source readings. Prof. Semmel insisted that his lectures were the textbook, but there's no way you can get sufficient background information from 50 minute lectures twice a week.",
    "I seriously recommend this course for anyone interested in history or Britain, or anyone just looking for an entertaining lecture. It is like reading a great book on Britain's past.",
    "It's a good overview of Britain in the long 19th century. It's well organized and easy to follow; it's not that difficult. Prepare to be really bored though, because it feels like you learn about the exact same (pretty insignificant) topics every class. Do the reading and go to section, not because they're essential to doing wellin the course (they're not), but because they're the only things that will keep you feeling like you're actually learning new ideas in the last month of the course.",
    "Take 19th-Century Britain whether you're a history major or a non-humanities major looking for a humanities credit. The material is extremely interesting - the 1800s for Britain was a tumultuous time. The readings are very well-selected and never overwhelming. Semmel is a fantastic lecturer that holds your attention for the entire fifty minutes. Both the midterm and final were very fair and allowed one to show what he or she had learned. The papers were different than most history papers but very fun to write and not impossible to get a good grade on, if you're willing to put in some effort. Take it! I knew nothing about Britain going in and now I want to learn more.",
    "Must take for history majors. Very specific area of interest, but I wasn't even that interested in that period going in and I loved it.",
    "I would definitely recommend 19th Century Britain to another student. I thought the material was really interesting (although it got a little boring towards the end of the semester), and Semmel is a great lecturer. This is a really good class.",
    "TAKE IT. Its not much work, but you learn a lot about an awesome country\/society in an incredibly fascinating period of time. The readings are really interesting, Semmel is a great lecturer, and the papers are fun to write. This is an all-around great history class. I am so glad that I took it, and felt that way every time I came to lecture and section.Make sure you do all the readings--though they are all primary sources, they are not very intensive, and they add a lot to the course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Semmel provided a very engaging and insightful look into the political and social happenings of the \"Long 19th Century\" (1780-1914). The workload is very manageable: two papers (one 5-pager, one 8-pager), a midterm, and a final. The readings were anywhere between 10 pages to 80 pages a week, but they were always primary sources and always incredibly interesting.",
    "I had mixed feelings about the course and am not sure if I would recommend it. On the one hand, it was a very good introduction to many important aspects of Britain's political and imperial history, which are very important to understand. But as the course went on, it began to focus more and more on the social history of Britain in the nineteenth century, which was not as interesting and is not as important aspolitical\/international dynamics. I would encourage shopping the course and examining its syllabus carefully, but I can't give it a ringing endorsement. My sense is that most people in the class probably enjoyed it more than I did. And Professor Semmel was a very good teacher and lecturer, despite my complaints."
