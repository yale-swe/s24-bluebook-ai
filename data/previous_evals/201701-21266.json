    "This course gives a better understanding of the Chinese language than the previous level. This semester went deeper into grammar, speaking, and fluency. Like last semester, you develop your speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills.",
    "My knowledge of Chinese grammar grew through writing, reading, listening and speaking practice. I developed the ability to hold a simple conversation in Chinese."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very effective at making Chinese understandable and usable. After only 2 semesters I know enough Chinese to be studying abroad in China, and am able to have conversations in Chinese with friends. The teaching method, while at times overwhelming, is very effective. At times the course was very overwhelming, and the pace was so fast that it sometimes felt like you didn't have enough time to really grasp the grammar or characters.",
    "A strength of the course is that the instructors rotated around sections, exposing students to different teaching styles, dialects\/accents, and cultural contexts. A weakness of the course is that due to language barrier, sometimes the instructors could not explain grammar rules very thoroughly and students had to learn it based on repeated practice alone."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course! The teachers are all absolutely wonderful and committed to helping you grow. The environment is supportive and you really do learn a lot.",
    "If you are currently in L1 than you have no choice, you must take L2. However, if you were placed into L2 and are considering continuing with Chinese, then I highly recommend taking it at Yale. The professors are some of my favorite instructors on campus and the course will definitely develop your language skills. The main focus of the class is on speaking and listening, which will drastically improve over the semester. The course is a lot of work (about the same as L1 for anybody that already took that), but in the end all of the time and effort were worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. After just two semesters of taking Chinese at Yale, I have learned enough to hold casual conversations with native speakers. Also, the class is organized in such a way that provides a structured pattern, further facilitating quick learning."
