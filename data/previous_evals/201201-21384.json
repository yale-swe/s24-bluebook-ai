   "comments": [
    "If you are a chemistry major, you are making a mistake if you don't take at least one course with Nilay. This class was an excellent crash-course in NMR interpretation (1H and 13C), with an in-depth look at X-Ray crystallography and cursory glances at other topics. This course was a fair bit of work but it was front-loaded (we were totally finished with grades a week and a half before lecture even ended).",
    "A course where one learns about practical interpretation of instrumental techniques which is valuable as there is no other course where one gets a concentration on this valuable skill (note in bioinorganic you do this too but there is little overlap in techniques).",
    "CHEM 450 is a course that covers common techniques for analysis of inorganic compounds. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone starting (or planning) to do research.",
    "A useful course that your grad students will be happy you're taking, almost no matter what kind of chemistry you do, since time is spent primarily on NMR and X-Ray crystallography, which are useful almost no matter what kind of chemistry you practice at Yale."
