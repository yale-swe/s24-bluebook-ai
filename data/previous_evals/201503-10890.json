   "comments": [
    "Great introduction to Heidegger's Being and Time. Provides the tools to understand Heidegger's philosophical framework in order to raise further questions both about his philosophy, and what is at stake in the book. I would definitely recommend it to any student who is looking to have a profound understanding of the concepts, and who wants a focused encounter with the text.",
    "It's a course that allows you to spend the necessary time with Being and Time. I would recommend it to all students interested in comparative literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Really understanding Being and Time requires a lot of work, and it is best done by dedicating an entire semester to it. And once you do, you will see how this book can be truly life changing. This is one of the most rigorous existentialist books ever written, and if you take its insights seriously, it can inform a more authentic way of existing in the world. it is also a crucial work in the history of philosophy; no philosophy major should graduate without first being exposed to Heidegger."

   "comments": [
    "Heidegger's thought is crucial for my work.",
    "As you read Being and Time alongside your readings for other classes, it is astonishing to see how Heidegger's theories appear to underpin so much of literary criticism, even if he is an unnamed interlocutor or inspiration in these texts. The course was therefore very useful in allowing me to come to terms with the lineages of different critical theories."
