    "This is a must take class for students interested in pursuing physics, biophysics, geophysics, astrophysics, mathematics and mechanical engineering. Problem sets ranged from 2-10 hours (with most problem sets falling in the 5-7 hour range), and the midterm was difficult, but not as hard as what it has been in previous years (I think the average was a 17\/25 or something like that, with a standard deviation of approximately 3). One of the best things about this class is that it created a very strong community. I definitely got closer to a lot of people in the class, and some of my good friends at Yale are peers from this class. Lectures can get pretty mathematical, but if you understand calculus and linear algebra, you should be fine. I would strongly recommend taking ENAS194 or differential equations in the math department concurrently or before this class, as there's a lot of overlap with oscillations. Students who hadn't done differential equations found some problem set questions more difficult than they should have been. Taking this class instead of 401 was the best decision I've made at Yale.",
    "I took this course after taking Physics 180\/181 and found it very difficult. It's not impossible to do if you put in the work, but if this is your situation, be aware that nearly everyone else in the class has a much more sophisticated physics background than you so it is going to be a struggle. That said, Skiba was wonderful and I made some of my closest friends in this class. Very cool problems!",
    "First of all if you have the opportunity to take this class by all means do. Skiba is an absolute genius and an incredible expositor. There are times when he loses what's going on in derivations, but he quickly catches himself and otherwise everything moves at a very quick pace without notes (!) and is able to answer virtually any question off the top of his head. If you took math 230 with Hadari, you know what I'm talking about. If not rest assured that you are getting the real deal. At no point in time was this class not the highlight of my semester (and I took complex analysis, which is pretty beautiful). Particularly mind blowing moments: proving Noether's theorem, deriving a formula to solve literally any system using Hamiltonians and Poisson brackets (conservative forces only, but still awesome) in one step, all of chaos, and a particularly cool deviation of the fact that the speed of light is the same in all reference frames. This class will make you a better person. The end.",
    "PHYS410 is undoubtedly a step up from Freshman Physics (I took 260\/1 in Freshman Year). That being said, if you are committed you will learn so much physics. Skiba is really an outstanding Professor, I cannot praise him enough. He is very approachable, honest, and clearly a great thinker. If you are coming from Physics 200, do not be put off taking this class. There were quite a few students from 200 in our class who did very well. The exams are challenging, and no matter how much you revise, you will have to think on the spot (in some cases quite deeply) to solve the exams. That being said, Skiba is a very fair marker, and as long as your thought processes are coherent, you will do well. Some of the Psets are very long (10 hours plus), but they really prepare you. The amount of physics I learnt in 410 is really phenomenal. I do not know how good my final grade is, but to be honest, my advancement in physics has been such that I do not much care. A fine, fine class. If you are uncomfortable with any concepts, see Skiba in his office hours; he is extremely helpful. Classical mechanics can be a dry concept, but Skiba really made it more than bearable, enjoyable even. I believe that Skiba's workload is less than Stone's. With Skiba, it was not so much the number of topics we covered (which incidentally was very large), but the level of thinking you had to employ to understand what you are dealing with. A step up, and a wonderful entry into advanced university physics.",
    "It's a fantastic class. The problem sets are very challenging, but in a good way, and the exams were extremely difficult (but Professor Skiba accounts for that when he's grading). Professor Skiba is one of the best professors I've had at Yale--he's funny and engaging, and lecture is really interesting as a result.",
    "Overall I would recommend Physics 410, because the material is fascinating and you get an in-depth look at mechanics with very little repetition from intro physics. Skiba is great, and the lectures are fun and engaging.Be forewarned though, the problem sets are very long and on the order of 15+ hours at times, and the midterm and final were very hard in the sense that they were applications into a type of problem you may have never practiced on problem sets.The final was 5 questions and 2-3 of the questions were very abstract and difficult applications, which made for a stressful test (This is in contrast to Physics 260, for example, where the exams contain similar problems as the problem sets and the examples in lecture).But overall, the class was well-worth it, and you come out having learned a lot more physics, but it is easily a \"Much Greater\" workload class.",
    "If you're willing to put in the work, yes. Problem sets took on average 7-10 hours, and the exams were difficult but fair. Really tests your love for physics. I'm glad I took it even though I struggled at some points along the way.",
    "410 was a lot of work and very challenging, but a good confidence-builder. It felt like the first 'serious' physics class I've taken at Yale and I thought it is good there is a challenging classical mechanics course taught. The material is mostly very interesting. Most of the techniques are a grind, and you'll find yourself slogging through algebra most of the time. This is a BIG step up from 260\/261; I was very grateful to have done 230\/231 the previous semester since it gave me the confidence and experience to tackle a course as demanding as 410. Be prepared to put in a lot of effort.Professor Skiba was very charismatic, friendly, and full of energy. He really engaged with the class, which is rare and is really excellent. I was super impressed by the energy he brought to the class. He is also brilliant and churned through perturbations and algebra at a terrifying pace. I liked that he insisted students ask questions; though our class often didn't ask as many as he wanted us to, it was a great environment to ask questions if you had them, which is so important since often I worry I will make a fool of myself by asking poorly-considered questions.That said, I take slight issue with Professor Skiba's general teaching style. He seems to like to use the class time to introduce concepts and churn through very unpleasant problems. The fact that he spent so much time on hideous algebra sometimes detracted from the education; it would have been better if he worried more about explaining concepts in depth and not getting bogged down in terrible algebra. However, that's not to say that examples aren't crucial; it's just that it sometimes felt that too much time was spent on completely unilluminating algebra. Overall, though, Professor Skiba was great.",
    "If you are looking at this class, you probably need to take it. It is doable. It will just take a lot of work.",
    "The class was very difficult, but I learned a ton. The most important thing you learn is Lagrangian mechanics, which is super useful for describing the motion of complicated systems and anyone going into physics or engineering should understand it.",
    "There once was a fella from Yale,Who as an instructor could not fail.The man was Skiba,A name without rhymes,And his class into joyous wonder did sail.Skiba was a profoundly excellent instructor for a course that in less capable hands would have seemed more a grab bag of Physics topics. He readily conveyed the intuition behind some non-intuitive concepts, and in this respect the class was incredibly fascinating.",
    "If you want a rigorous and worthwhile foundation in mechanics, take this course (especially if Professor Skiba is teaching). We studied both very foundational and interesting topics while covering a large amount of material (almost the entirety of John Taylor's Classical Mechanics book). Problem sets do often take a while, and both the midterm and the final were incredibly difficult. However, even in such a case I'm still glad I chose to take the course.",
    "If you're an intensive physics major, you're definitely taking this class, and while you should be prepared for a significant time investment, it's a very worthwhile class. Skiba is the best professor I've ever had, and made the class a thousand times better. If you're deciding between 401 and 410, 410 goes in significantly more depth and deals with much more challenging problems. I'm not sure how the time commitment varies.",
    "Avoid.",
    "It is difficult, but don't be afraid to take it! It's a wonderful class and physics 200 and 260 are both great preparation.",
    "Sometimes in this class I was lost. Sometimes in this class I had an \"aha!\" or \"eureka!\" moment. More often I had \"hmm...that's interesting...\" moments. I was exposed to a lot of topics about which I now have a better, but not complete, understanding.Problem sets take a lot of time, yes. Attempt them alone and then finish them in groups. That will help you learn and also help you save time.",
    "Best class I've ever taken at Yale. I can't decide which I loved more: Witold Skiba or the material. Skiba is funny, witty, extremely intelligent and very lucid. The course material was very dense and challenging, but with Skiba it all became beautiful. I never thought I'd ever find Taylor expansions, linear algebra, perturbation theory or differential equations this enjoyable. Now I understand physics on a very fundamental level - there was so much I didn't know or care about in Lagrangian mechanics or relativity before. Warning: this is reputed to be a difficult class, so make sure you're mentally prepared for long and painful psets and very, very brutal exams (especially the final). It is essential that you have a good grasp of linear algebra and differential equations.",
    "A good continuation of PHYS 260. The psets were tough and could take a long time (anywhere from ~12-20 hours) and the exams were really difficult, but Prof. Skiba is brilliant and wonderful. Take this just to have a class with him!",
    "Take it if you like physics or dynamical applications of math, it's a great course based on a great text.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you're interested in physics. It's not easy (the midterm and final are somewhat difficult), but you will learn a lot. Professor Skiba is wonderful. If you took Physics 260, you even already have the textbook (Taylor).",
    "Once in a while you stumble upon a class that is so fulfilling that the satisfaction of understanding the material is worth working exceptionally hard to overcome the difficulty of the workload. This is one of the those classes. The problem sets for this class take 8 or so hours a week, but the struggle required to do them brings everyone closer together. Working in groups is almost a must. Also, Skiba is a boss and keeps lectures low pressure and fun. Great class if you are willing to put in some serious effort.",
    "This is likely the kind of class that will leave you convinced one way or another if physics is for you. I had a lot of fun=I'm a physics major. I gave up on the second problem set=I've got some thinking to do. Professor Skiba is wonderful, and while the p sets are very hard especially towards the end they are the kind of problems that you feel really good about overcoming. I loved the class.",
    "PHYS410 is a rigorous exploration of advanced classical mechanics, and you will learn a lot from the course. Only take it if you are willing to put in over 8 hours for every problem set, but it is very rewarding if you put in the time.",
    "Yes! Take it! Wonderful class. Lots of collaboration with other students will help you succeed. It's difficult though, and psets take 10-15 hours a week. Be prepared.",
    "If you want to be an intensive physics major, you have to take this course. Otherwise, if you had any trouble in intro physics, be wary of this course. It is not like 260, where you can study all the material and perform well. It requires a deep and practiced understanding of classical mechanics.",
    "Definitely take if you're interested in physics. The homeworks can be time consuming, from 10 to 15 hours working alone or somewhat less working in a group or during TA sessions. Skiba makes the lectures interesting, and all topics are only covered for one or two weeks, so the material never gets stale. This does, of course, mean there's a lot to know by exam time, and the exams can be a little rough if you're not quick on your feet. Just move quickly, and as long as you know the material, generous partial credit and the curve will help you out.",
    "Physics 410 is an amazing course. But, be warned: it is one of the most work intensive courses I have ever taken. While I have developed an understanding of classical mechanics that many of my friends who took Phys 401 seem to have not, the cost was 10-15 hours a week of very difficult, require-a-study-group homework and very hard, class-average-was-a-D tests. Coming from Physics 200 and 201 was challenging, as we had not been presented some of the material that Physics 260\/261 was presented, and which was used heavily in the class. Ultimately, I would recommend the course, but know that your social life will revolve around Physics problem sets.",
    "Physics 410 was good. It was much more interesting and manageable than 260, probably due to the professor."
