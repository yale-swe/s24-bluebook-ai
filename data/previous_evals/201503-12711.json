   "comments": [
    "A great class. Take it with Shankar. Although the difficulty level is not quite consistent throughout the semester, the material is interesting and you will learn a lot of physics.",
    "Take it instead of 200 or 260. It is similar but with more mathematical detail so if you want a bit more in depth then those, start at 401. I did and am happy I did.",
    "not if you haven't taken a previous mechanical class before",
    "I definitely recommend this to anyone who like me, is not majoring in physics, but is looking for a good rigorous introduction to classical physics.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 401 to physics majors or people who are strong in mathematics. As a physics major, this is a very enjoyable class. The workload is very manageable, 1 pset per week, 1 midterm, 1 final, Shankar's lectures are very interesting and make sense, and the material just keeps getting better and better (compared to PHYS 200, for example). Very enjoyable.",
    "Take the class if you are not intensive physics major - it is definitely for people who are either behind the curve, or just physics is not their major.",
    "401 is good if you are good at math. The tests are not easy and the curve is usually brutal, because many math majors take this course. It's a good alternative to PHYS 200 for the mathematically inclined.",
    "This is good for a required class. A bit more in depth than classical mechanics, but probably you don't need to take it if you don't have to.",
    "Great course! Prof Shankar is very clear in class. You can do well without struggling too much on your own. Prof Shankar also tries to encourage students to speak up. He's a great lecturer and a great person to learn from. From the perspective of a math major, the class is not too hard even if you have not taken another physics course at Yale. (I took Physics A level in high school). Definitely shop it!",
    "This is a very good course. Shankar is a very good lecturer, and is exceptionally clear, even when going through difficult topics. It covers the material quickly, but fairly well. As a result, you shouldn't take this unless you have a fairly strong math or physics background (it helps to have seen some of the material before). But if you have a decent background, even if you haven't done the prereqs, this course still may be good for you. In general, Shankar emphasizes more that students have a good intuitive understanding of the basics of a concept, as opposed to being very good at solving complex problems. The homeworks are on the short side, but it's easy to get stuck in the algebra. The tests are on the easy side, and very fair.",
    "I really would. Anyone interested in physics. Physics 180 really didn't give me a sense of the power of physics, this was a much greater class to show me the potential of the field.",
    "Shankar is INCREDIBLE. He's hilarious, but also very knowledgeable about the subject. He will take pains to make sure you really understand the material, and you will learn so much about mechanics by the end of this course. The workload is very reasonable, not much more than 200 or 181, and lends itself to you having enough time to really work through the problems instead of rushing to get them all done on time. I'd recommend this course for sure.",
    "A great class in terms of teaching and material. Shankar is great, hands down. Really knows his stuff, really encourages students to participate (and is pretty into cold calling students, which always keeps you on your toes), and makes the material understandable. The exams (midterm and final) were very different than the practice ones we were given, so watch out for that. The actual exams were longer and much more difficult than the practice. Overall, would recommend, but definitely better for those with a physics background."
