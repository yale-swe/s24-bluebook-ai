    "would highly recommend",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking it, it's a totally unique educational experience.",
    "A thirteen week long trip covering completely different fields, from physics to economics to education to art. Each week, we watched videos, did readings, and came into class discussed a totally different topic. Adam Glick often completely disagrees with the readings and videos, and was anything but shy about showing his opinions. This class is about arguing, and not for the faint of heart- the two papers aren't a big focus of the class, and the video is a nice way to synthesize what you learned in the term- but the core of the class are the discussions in class that turn into heated debates and spill over each week into dinner. I looked forward to class every week, and Wednesday at 3:30 until I emerged from dinner around three hours later, I never knew what he had in store for us, but I knew it'd be carefully conceived, well-argued, and make me think about the world around me, and my place in it, in a different way. This class is incredible, and unlike anything I have ever taken (or will likely take)- if you're lucky enough to have the opportunity to take GBI, absolutely do so.",
    "Yes. This is the class. If you're fed up with seminars being shallow, slow, and boring, it's time for you to apply to GBI. Every week is an existential crisis, and you'll go home with a lot of thinking to do. Even (especially?) if you're a more QR-oriented person, you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "I've already recommended it to all of my friends as \"a crazy class about absolutely everything.\"",
    "GBI is the best class I've taken at Yale. I was pressed to challenge every assumption I had of life and I was encouraged to speak before I had formed a thought. These skills are crucial. I highly recommend this class if it is offered again. Adam truly invests himself in your learning and does a great job exposing the class to a host of topics.",
    "Take this class, take this class, take this class; also, I forgot to mention: TAKE THIS CLASS. This class has been the most transformative class of my educational career. The workload is more than manageable and every class offers a new perspective on life. The professors are great and extremely helpful. You only have to write two papers throughout the year (no exams). Great Big Ideas is life-changing and a must-take class at Yale.",
    "This course is a survey of some of the most important academic fields in existence. For each field of study, students discuss the crucial issues at play and learn to expand their understanding of various topics to make connections and identify themes across disciplines.",
    "I literally refuse to repeat what you will have already heard. All I will add is that the hype is real and is well deserved. Take this class if you want to learn how to think.",
    "GBI is a course about everything. If you're interested in anything, and lucky enough to get passed the application process, you should spend the two hours each Wednesday in class, as well as the hours watching the lectures and reading the notes Adam prepares. Do it.",
    "Absolutely (see above)",
    "Absolutely take this course if you get in.There are about 200 students who apply each semester, but with persistence you might be able to get in. I applied four times before I earned my spot.The classes are on Wednesday evening but I looked forward to it every week. Best class I had this semester and 2nd overall during my 3 years at Yale.adam challenges you to think better and live a better life by examining what is not seen. Talking to adam and forming relationships with all the other students in GBI was worth the pain of watching my argument being taking apart multiple times in one session. It was a learning and growing experience.I do not regret one moment of this class. If I could I would retake it, because each time is different.",
    "Yes. Take it if you are interested in discussing things you don't really know everything about. Take it if you want to explore new topics. Take it if you like trying to connect things or stepping back to see another viewpoint. Take it if you want to find a small group of people who you are okay shouting at but also okay being wrong with. If you take it, definitely be engaged, you'll get just so much out of it if you are!",
    "This was the best class I've taken at Yale by far. The Subjects were fascinating, the discussions were open-ended, the readings were interesting and clearly chosen carefully for us, and most of the learning was from other students, as should be in a seminar. All that was orchestrated by Adam and Prof. Christakis, both incredible teachers and fascinating individuals.",
    "A great place to talk about some of the worlds most important issues in many different disciplines. Highly recommend it",
    "This is a one of a kind class! Teachers are genuinely interested in their students' success and progress. I especially liked that Adam Glick gave comprehensive feedback on the papers that I wrote in this class. Take this class. It will make you view things and thoughts from a totally different perspective."
