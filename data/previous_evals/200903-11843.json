    "Figure Drawing is a great class, I definitely recommend it, but I had it with Sam Messer, and he is one of my favorite teachers at Yale, he's just as incredible teacher.",
    "Definitely recommend, especially if you like drawing the human form. I started out sort of \"stuck\" drawing in one mode, and by the end of the semester I was comfortable challenging myself to draw in different styles and different ways.",
    "Sam's approach to drawing courses is incredibly laid back - which has many downsides. There's less of an urgency to make anything, really, and he doesnt seem to care particularly, himself. If you want to have a relaxed drawing class with a model every day, take it. If you want something that pushes you, dont.",
    "This is an awesome course if you take it with Sam Messer. Pretty straightforward: drawing naked people, using different mediums. Enjoy! (Not too much work either.)"
