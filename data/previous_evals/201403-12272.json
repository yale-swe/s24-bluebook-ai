    "Good class to take if you want to better your Portuguese",
    "L3 Portuguese is a solid class -- it's what you would expect after a year of beginner's Portuguese. You review a lot of grammar from L2 and do some speaking, writing, etc",
    "L3 Portuguese is a decent review of older grammar concepts, and an excellent way to perfect your speaking and reading skills. Make sure you shop around to find a professor whose dialect you can understand and who teaches and interacts with the class in a way you find productive.",
    "A review and expansion of what you have learned in L1 and L2 portuguese.",
    "If you are at this point and can still go abroad, do it. Try and avoid this class if you can. It is the most frustrating class I have taken at Yale because of the poor structure and the lack of interest from Marta. If you can take it with someone other than Marta do so. You do not learn anything new in this class, yet you are tested on random Portuguese aspects. Go abroad!"
