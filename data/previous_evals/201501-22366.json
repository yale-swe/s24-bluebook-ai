    "I mean.. you have to take ITAL 120 to get credit for ITAL 110. Take happily!",
    "The L2 material is sometimes more confusing than the L1 material, but there is also less of it.",
    "If you take this class, try to take it with Kyle Skinner. Honestly that's what made the class worth it for me.",
    "Penso che la seconda semestre d'Italiano sia un po' come vecchio vino - necessita che tu sii paziente e aspettare un lungo tempo per diventare un'oratore buono della lingua italiana. Mi piace il vino d'Italia e i cibi d'Italia. Necessiti pi ragioni per studiare l'italiano? No. Andiamo... berremo il vino d'italia e mangeremo i panini e spaghetti d'italia e avremo una buona volta.",
    "Kyle is the absolute best! Take it with him if you can. L2 is also less work than L1.",
    "Ital 120 is an amazing class! I would highly recommend it",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to someone who has taken 110, but I would recommend Italian in general to any student. It is a beautiful language and all the Italian instructors I have met are fun, caring, and passionate about Italian.",
    "Take Italian!! It's a beautiful language, and the Italian department at yale is super cool.",
    "Best class ever. Take it.",
    "Great way to learn Italian.",
    "If you're considering taking L2 Italian, you probably took L1. L2 is more of the same, with slightly less material and a more relaxed learning pace.",
    "It's a good course and you get to practice your conversational skills more than l1",
    "Italian is such a fun language! The culture is, in my opinion, the best among the romance languages. Highly recommend Italian to anyone looking for a language to study!!!"
