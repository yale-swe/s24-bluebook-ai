    "take at least one art class before you graduate. with will, you first focus on particular skills, like line drawing and value drawing, and then in the end of the semester you get to draw models. the homework helps develop particular skills that you then put altogether by the end of the semester",
    "There might be better basic drawing classes, but this one was good.",
    "Definitely recommend!!!",
    "I'd recommend it if you have a serious interest in art and in improving your technique. We only had one assignment a week, but as the weeks progress, you start investing more time to show progress and grow as an artist.",
    "Hope that you get an instructor whose style you jive with, otherwise you will be bored out of your skull and\/or hate them. It's basically show up and draw, so it's pretty chill. Prof Villalongo is a pretty chill guy. Just put in effort though, this is not really a gut. I was thinking of being an art major but now I really don't want to be one (Yale art is really very fine-artsy, and I just want to be an illustrator). I didn't really learn anything from this, the best thing I can say about it was that once or twice I did some stuff that was more unusual for me but it felt contrived.",
    "your mom",
    "As each Art 114 course is a different experience, Prof. Villalongo made the course creatively demanding. Though it was at times work intensive, this class is really what you make of it. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone considering a creative field of study or work, as it builds upon basic tools of drawing and then culminates by helping you develop basic tools of creative expression."
