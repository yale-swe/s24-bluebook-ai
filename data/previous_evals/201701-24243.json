    "I developed an understanding of introductory electricity and magnetism.",
    "While taking PHYS 181, I gained a better understanding of electric and magnetic fields. We covered the conceptual basis and also studied circuits (capacitors, resistors, emf). In terms of laws, we covered Gauss' Law, Lenz's Laws, Ampere's Law and Maxwell's and Faraday's equations. I really liked this class from the conceptual point of view. I took physics four years ago in high school and I generally found this course clear, although I wish we had had more time to spend on certain aspects, like circuits with emf. The class is a mix of students who have already taken Physics in high school and others who have not done as much advanced physics in high school or have done it through other sciences, such as chemistry. Prof. Steinacker is very enthusiastic about the material and always welcoming of questions, so she tries to make it as comfortable for students to ask questions in a large lecture class. Don't be afraid to ask! She will always address your question.",
    "As a result of taking this class, I learned about the fundamental principles governing Electricity and Magnetism. Physics can be quite beautiful at times, and this class really brought out that beauty.",
    "I learned a lot of physics and realized that E+M is not my favorite thing in the world",
    "I greatly expanded my knowledge in the area of electricity and magnetism. I came in having taken Physics C; however, I didn't quite understand the concepts that well. In particular, magnetism was difficult for me to comprehend. This course cleared it up for me, and I feel like I walked away actually learning a lot.",
    "I learned a lot more about physics and how to solve problems through calculus.",
    "I learned the electricity and magnetism side of introductory physics.",
    "This course taught me the basic principles of electricity and magnetism. There was great emphasis on conceptual thinking and analytical skills when solving complex circuit problems.",
    "a lot of e&m concepts",
    "In this course we learned the fundamentals of electrostatics and magnetism. We learned how to solve complex problems and how to apply certain concepts to real life situation. We also attempted to get an intuitive feeling about the physics of things we couldn't see with the naked eye.",
    "By taking this course, not only did I gain a fundamental grasp of physics concepts, but I also learned how to problem solve, think analytically and creatively.",
    "This course taught me many important physics concepts and how to apply them to practical applications.",
    "We obtained a thorough background in the theory and practical applications of classical physics.",
    "I learned basic physics of electricity and magnetism. I feel like my main takeaway will be more intuition with problem solving and calculus, however.",
    "I learned how to apply calculus to physics while learning more about a subject that I briefly touched upon in high school (electromagnetism).",
    "I learned new knowledge about electricity and magnetism, broadly speaking. We covered static charges, electric fields, voltage, capacitance, current, resistance, current density, circuits (including RC), dielectrics, dipoles, magnetic fields, Biot-Savart, Ampere, power, motion in a magnetic field, Hall Effect, induction, electromagnetic waves, and Maxwell. I became a better problem solver in physics through this class. As the class wrapped up, I developed much more insight into the unifying principles that govern both electricity and magnetism, which was really cool.",
    "Understanding of e and m",
    "I learned the historical and conceptual basis of electricity and magnetism. I learned useful problem solving techniques.",
    "My problem solving skills greatly improved along with my understanding of electromagnetism",
    "I learned the fundamentals of electromagnetism--very helpful going forward in my academic science career.",
    "In this class, we covered electric forces, electricity, circuits, magnetism, and more. The material was very interesting and relevant to everyday life!",
    "circuits mechanics review magnetism integration and calculus in physics",
    "This class provided an introductory background to many electricity and magnetism topics in physics. I developed skills that helped me derive general formulas for certain situations that could be applied to a number of physics problems.",
    "Learned basics of electricity and magnetism, problem solving.",
    "Phys181 taught me how to work really really hard. However, the hard work was never lonely. I went to office hours 3-4 times a week and worked with the same group of kids for hours each day. For me, this class was incredibly difficult--but one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Collaborating with others, now more than ever, is a skill of paramount importance, and this class teaches you exactly how to do that.",
    "Great class, takes some work but has so much support to help you figure things out.",
    "I learned about electric fields and the behavior of charges, as well as magnetism."

   "comments": [
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course and felt its greatest asset is the professor--Professor Steinacker and her dedication and genuine excitement about the subject showed and made all the difference.",
    "I had taken physics about four years ago in high school and I also took PHYS 180 with Prof. Steinacker. I think she is one of the most dedicated professors I have ever seen. She is very organized, ALWAYS uploads lecture notes on Canvas and holds an incredible amount of office hours, about four hours every day for four days of the week. I am amazed at her ability and willingness to spend so much time answering our questions. During lecture, too, she always makes time for students to ask questions. For the amount of material we had to cover, I think Prof. Steinacker really did a great work. I wish we had spent more time on examples, especially working with circuits (emf and capacitors), but we had to move on to cover other material. I also generally wish we had gone at a bit of a slower pace, especially with circuits, but it is also true many people in the class have taken physics in high school and the material was most probably not new for them. One of the biggest strengths of this class is the professor's dedication and the amount of time she spends in office hours. Office hours helped me ask questions and Prof. Steinacker also gave me feedback on the two exams.",
    "I thought this class was very good! It moved at a reasonable pace, but if you stayed on top of things, it wasn't too bad. The exams were reasonable, and the p-sets were doable if you went to office hours and had a friend with whom to work.",
    "The professor is fantastic. It is really well designed for student engagement and learning. I do not like the way Prof. Stienacker runs office hours, but other than that it is a good course",
    "The course does a good job of teaching E&M, but it moves at a very slow pace and so does not cover optics and the later E&M topics.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was the organization of topics that made everything fall into place. A great weakness of this course was the slow grading of problem sets and lack of feedback on them. By the final exam half of the problem sets still had not been graded.",
    "tests were so hard and psets were so long",
    "Steinacker was very available in this course, she was always there when the students needed her, it was up to them to follow up if they didn't understand the material. The lectures were sometimes too fast but there was always an opportunity to make sure you understood.",
    "I think this course is a phenomenal one and is challenging but rewarding if you put the time in. I think it is paced at the perfect rate; it keeps you on your toes but is never so fast that you feel lost. If I had one objection, it would be how long the problem sets take. However, that being said, I think the problems on these homework assignments were crucial for my understanding and really helped solidify the material in a way that just sitting in the lecture could not.",
    "The lectures given in this course were very comprehensive and made understanding the material easier. The problems provided in this course supplemented the material very well and helped improve my quantitative reasoning.",
    "Strengths: excellent online notes,extremely nice and understanding Professor, far more reasonable workload and pset difficulty than PHYS 180 Weaknesses: boring lecture",
    "It's a difficult subject that requires an immense amount of time to understand and execute. Everybody struggled, and although office hours helped with the p-sests, I felt that I spent more time learning how to do that exact problem rather than learning how to correctly apply the concepts in general. As an improvement, I think having p-sets that are mostly\/half easy practice problems (6-10 problems), and then having a few (3) challenging problems would be helpful in making sure that we have the right idea, rather than testing multiple concepts with 8+ complex problems.",
    "Strengths: better taught than PHYS 180, amazing, dedicated professor (Prof. Steinacker), more reasonable workload, and more interesting (in my opinion). Weaknesses: sometimes lectures dragged on. The material can't always be interesting.",
    "Strength - good notes, can catch up even without paying attention in lecture",
    "First and foremost, professor Steinacker is one of the best teachers that I've ever had. The problem sets were also extremely engaging. I think that it was really nice when one of the TAs showed up to office hours towards the end of the year. I think his should be a regular thing.",
    "The homework was really difficult, would have liked to practice more exam-like questions",
    "This class is a very good overview of E&M and one strength of it was the teaching. Professor Steinacker was incredible and made it easy to comprehend each lecture. While the problem sets seemed difficult at times, they were great preparation for the exam and I never felt as if I didn't have the resources necessary to do well in this class. I can't think of any particular weaknesses; the second midterm was very difficult so maybe if that could be adjusted in the future that would be great, but I'm not sure it's fair to call that a weakness of the course.",
    "The biggest strength BY FAR was Professor Steinacker. She was so incredibly dedicated to her large number of students. Course could improve by having TF's be as present as she is in order to keep her from being over worked.",
    "The problem sets are grueling but provide lots of practice. The lecture notes posted online are also very helpful if a student is confused.",
    "I had a hard time paying attention in lecture, however lecture notes were absolutely incredible and always online after the lecture. The psets I think are also unnecessarily hard and long. I am all for being challenged, but for an introductory physics class much of the psets were too challenging.",
    "One strength comes from the fact that Professor Steinacker provided great instruction and resources for students to succeed in problem sets and, often times, exams. Another was the exam schedule, specifically for midterms, that included in-class midterms (as opposed to late night) which condensed material into fewer problems than they would be for long, night-time exams. A weakness was that Professor Steinacker seemed to expect more of her students than they were capable of, whether its through material in math that some have not taken or concepts in physics that are beyond the scope of the course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course, taught by Professor Steinacker, to anyone! As long as you are prepared to put in effort to attend office hours and interact with Professor Steinacker, it will be worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, if taught by Prof. Steinacker. She is VERY DEDICATED and spends a lot of time outside of class answering questions in office hours. She really cares about students understanding the material and in office hours, she goes around to check how everyone is doing. She knows everyone's names and in office hours you can always ask her about conceptual questions or specific exercises. There is a weekly problem set with usually 10 questions, where 2 are optional most of the time. There are two midterms and a final. I would strongly recommend attending office hours instead of emailing Prof. Steinacker, since she spends so much time answering our questions during them. The textbook is good, but I would strongly recommend Prof. Shankar's second volume on electromagnetism and DO READ Steinacker's notes on Canvas. The notes are uploaded after each class.",
    "This course is a fantastic intro to pure E&M and goes more in-depth into E&M than any of the other intro physics courses. The workload isn't too bad, only a weekly pset. The actual math isn't too hard--it helps to know a bit of multivariable calc going into this class, but it's not the end of the world if you don't have any calc background. Prof. Steinacker does have a habit of putting tough, tricky problems on the psets, but they're nothing that a trip to office hours and evening study halls couldn't help you power through. Speaking of Steinacker, she's a FANTASTIC professor who volunteers an insane amount of her time outside of lecture to making sure everyone understands the material. If you have the chance, please take it with her. It's hard to believe it was only her first year teaching! Whether you're taking it for your major, for pre-med requirements, or just for fun, you'll learn a ton of useful information in 181. It's well-taught with Steinacker and definitely worth taking!",
    "Not a gut SC by any means, but if you're interested in Physics, this course is quite good. Prof. Steinacker is amazing!",
    "If you have to take E+M, take this course. Otherwise, avoid taking physics courses in general",
    "I think this is a really interesting course to take. If you have any prior knowledge of E&M and want clarification on certain topics, definitely take this. If you are majoring in engineering and you took Physics C, just take 180 and 181. I don't think it's worth it to take the higher 200 and 201 because this course goes into great detail about all the areas pertinent to the field of engineering.",
    "I think it was a pretty good physics class. It was well organized and the professor was helpful.",
    "Yes, if they are a STEM or Pre-med major.",
    "It is a good introduction to electricity and magnetism. I would recommend this over the 170 sequence if you need to take an intro-level physics course.",
    "You probably have to take this class as a prereq. It's a lot of work and I thought it was hard, but that's just because physics in general is hard. Take it with Steinacker if you can. Her psets and exams are hard, but she's super reachable--what other professor has office hours EVERY DAY?",
    "if you have to take it",
    "Professor Steinacker is wonderful and extremely helpful. Take this class if you have to - the grading is lenient and gives you plenty of room to make mistakes and there is abundant help if you need it. Steinacker's energy is infectious and will make you like physics even if you never cared about it.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material is very interesting and there are a lot of cool things one can do with the knowledge.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I came away with such a thorough understanding of the material in a way that few other Yale courses have done. While this class took the majority of my focus, it was one of the most rewarding classes I have taken thus far.",
    "If you have to take Physics 181, I would recommend that you take it with Professor Steinacker. She is a great professor who really cares about her students and is very helpful.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student looking for a challenging but engaging quantitative class.",
    "Yes! I recommend this class to other students. This is a straight-up approach to physics - it's not easy, but it is accessible and clear. Recommended for anyone interested in physics or who needs to take it to fulfill a requirement. If you haven't taken physics in high school, might be a little harder for you, but not impossible.",
    "Take only if you have to, because it's really not much more than a challenging intro physics course (so not interesting or easy, to me). However I will say that though Professor Steinacker is not the world's most engaging lecturer, she is possibly the sweetest professor I've ever had. She went out of her way to make the course more manageable than 180 was, she was extremely lenient when we all bombed the 2nd midterm, and when I missed school for athletics I had no need to get a Dean's excuse. So not my favorite course but it was made considerably less painful than it could've been.",
    "If you don't need to take it, don't unless you credit\/D\/F it. It's interesting but possibly not worth the time, effort, and a blow to your GPA if you're not going to use it.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 181 with Prof. Steinacker if you need to take the introductory physics sequence. She is incredibly kind, thoughtful, and accessible. She puts in a crazy number of hours to making sure you understand the material, and she loves getting to know her students (many of us adore her). The material, psets, and exams are difficult, but Prof. Steinacker is very accommodating. The coursework is on the heavier side but still manageable.",
    "It's physics. Take if you have to",
    "Steinacker is amazing. She really cares about the students and is very open and accessible. I really like the way she taught the course, too. I hadn't taken E&M in high school, so this was my first time learning the material. But she did a good job building up from the fundamentals to create a physical model whose components we could understand. The grading is SUPER lenient (she pretty much said that our best of the 2 midterms could count twice). I also never lost more than like 5 points out of 80 on any of our homeworks (even though I definitely did not deserve such a high score). I really learned a lot in this class, and it might have even been my favorite of the semester.",
    "This is definitely a challenging course, but it was very rewarding. If you have the option take the class with professor Steineckar.",
    "Yes, and take it with Professor Steinacker.",
    "Yes! Good lectures with useful material. The PSETs are long but prepare you very well for the tested material.",
    "It's a good way to get pre-med requirements",
    "Most people who take physics probably have to so I imagine your decision is between staying in 181 or switching to 171. I obviously didn't take 171 so I can't comment on it, but 181 was actually a really good class. It didn't feel like too much work or like concepts were ever too difficult to understand, and I feel like I actually learned some very interesting things throughout the semester. Professor Steinacker was incredible and if she's teaching this class I would absolutely take it. There's a problem set almost every week, but they are only 8 questions, with two additional, optional problems to help with studying for the exams. There are two midterms and a final. The second midterm was quite difficult but grades were adjusted to make it more fair, so it wasn't too bad. I would absolutely take 181. It was a great physics class.",
    "As for the subject, I like physics, so I took it and enjoyed. If you don't like physics, you might not like the material. As for the teaching, however, Prof. Steinacker is literally the nicest most dedicated person I have ever met. I will take any class she teaches at Yale. If nothing else, take this class just to have the privilege of meeting her.",
    "Take it cuz of the instructor!!!",
    "If you are majoring in a STEM field related to physics, definitely take this course. It is very helpful and intensive but very insightful. If you are just looking for a science credit, this course has a lot of work and I would not advise it.",
    "It was actually a great class and really made me think about how what we were learning and how it applied to the world around us. Physics is also just cool.",
    "I would recommend this course, PHYS 181, and the course before it, PHYS 180, to most students who have to take physics for their major requirements. It might be more work than PHYS 200\/201 (notice I used the word 'work'). I would not recommend this course for the average Yalie who doesn't need physics -- it is too much work for a general Sc skill."
