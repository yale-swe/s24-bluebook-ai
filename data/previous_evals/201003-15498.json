    "Don't take it unless you need the prereq. The problem sets are graded pretty harshly, and the exam curves can be rough.",
    "If you're taking Math 120 chances are you need it for a major requirement or pre-med. If you can try to get into Frame's section. Jean's section was okay but obviously not the best. She's good at conveying the material and knows what she's talking about but the class can get really dry and boring sometimes. It's not unusual to see people nodding off in the middle of class. We were in the basement of Becton and it's usually dead quiet save for Jean's voice. Everyone just kind of sits there, half listens, and waits for the class to be over. Not a very engaging class.",
    "It's math. Whether you learn it from the lecture, from the book, or online, it's the same. If you don't like going to lecture, no sweat. Overall the material was pretty straightforward (it gets harder towards the very end of the semester), and exams were pretty easy.",
    "I enjoy math, so I enjoyed the class. But there's no reason to take it unless you need to.",
    "If you are serious about Mathematics, take it. If not, don't.",
    "I had to teach myself a lot of the material.",
    "This is not the best class, but you learn a lot. It helped me in my Physics class and I am glad that I took it. Jean (Chun-Yi) Sun was a good instructor. She sometimes went a little fast when reviewing the material, but if anyone had a question or did not understand the topic, she would stop and explain it until everybody fully understood it. I believe she is one of the better instructors based on the review sessions that I have attended (given by all of the teachers of 120). Overall, if you are interested in this material or have to take it, it is a good class, but if it is not necessary and you don't like math, it is not a good class to take."
