    "I improved my skills in scientific writing and editing my own and others' work. There were useful tips on structure, from structuring an entire piece to a single sentence. Another useful topic was clarity.",
    "Weekly discussions on the structure of scientific papers. Very helpful because the class makes you stop and think about the purpose of each element in scientific writing. Students are from a variety of research areas, so you also learn a lot about the different fields through discussions."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated that the goal of the course was to complement existing writing and on-going work; this made it significantly easier for me to participate.",
    "Strengths: it definitely introduced important concepts and contributed to improving my writing and editing skills. Weaknesses: The class structure didn't lend itself to getting and implementing good feedback. I never got to a point in our writing where we could apply all the editing skills I learned. Recommendations: Have more meetings and spend our time meaningfully. Have more workshopping time for everyone - I have taken other writing classes where we send out our drafts to our classmates beforehand, and then pick 2-3 people to workshop in a class session. Break down the writing sections so that not all of the final paper draft is due at once. Much less time on the grant-writing portion and readings, and more time on writing the paper.",
    "The Schimmel readings were great. It would be helpful if the paper readings were assigned beforehand so students could read them if they chose and focus on the language and structure, not figuring out meaning, during class."

    "Yes! It was incredibly helpful for me to have structured deadlines on the projects I was working on and have a place to receive good, balanced feedback.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone in the ecology research field. This class is also good for students who are currently writing theses or papers."
