    "I recommend this class, although not enthusiastically.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who can handle the workload because you definitely improve a lot in reading and writing Chinese in this class.",
    "CHNS 152 has numerous students who come into Yale reading and speaking nearly at the native level. If you have a strong background, it will come easily for you. But for those in class who took clases from L1->L4\/did Light Fellowships will find the course to be much more challenging. Kang Laoshi has very high expectations, but is supportive - I suggest meeting with him early in the semester to talk about your needs\/backgrounds.",
    "a good way for heritage speakers to finish their language requirement. a fair amount of homework but very well organized so it is spread out evenly. no spikes in workload. pretty fair and easy grading.",
    "Each week there will be a lesson covering a specific topic about Chinese culture. Each lesson consists of a vocabulary list, translations, reading comprehension, and other exercises that culminate in an essay. I would recommend this course because it offers a good balance between reading, speaking, listening, and writing Chinese.",
    "Definitely go for it. The class is a challenge, but overall very worthwhile. I would recommend this class for anyone who is fluent in speaking and proficient in listening, but wants to work on literacy.",
    "Do it for the language requirement or if serious about learning chinese. an interesting class with a lot of workload.",
    "Yes, but there is a large discrepancy in the ability of the speakers in the class. If you were not born in China, you may want to consider taking a different class.Get ready for work everyday and do your essay ahead of time to get it checked by the TA.",
    "Don't take this class expecting a dramatic change in your language skills. This class was relatively easy even though there were a lot of small assignments."
