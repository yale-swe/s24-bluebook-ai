    "Emily Coates is a movement genius. She is one of the kindest professors I've had, and moves with a grace that makes one's jaw drop (which is hardly surprising considering her background, BUT STILL.). If you have a chance to take a class with her, you MUST do it. You'll be glad that you did. The class focuses on movement research, extremely valuable for anyone in the performing arts, but also a hugely under-studied aspect of our selves. This class provides a unique opportunity to get out of the head and into the body, and then to combine them again in the creation of a choreographic work. Professor Coates starts the semester with a seemingly ambitious goal: by the end of the semester you will choreograph a ten-minute dance piece. I thought, \"man, that's going to be SO difficult,\" but Professor Coates taught us enough choreographic techniques and gave us enough artistic freedom to make the project not only easy, but a joy. Well, not easy exactly, but she has removed the limitation of \"I can't do something like that,\" and that permission is enough to make it feel like anything is possible. Don't think that she's an easy grader though: you still have to put the work into creating decent pieces of writing for her.",
    "Amazing course if you want to learn through reading, watching, and most importantly, MOVING! This class got me experiencing dance through multiple lenses. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to break out of the typical sit down and listen style of learning. You'll get so much out of this class!",
    "I enjoyed the class. A great introduction to many different artists and a unique opportunity to create your own work.",
    "if you're considering this course, give it a real chance -- you won't regret it! prof coates is the most caring, patient, and encouraging instructor i've encountered at yale, and she is a dance guru (you'll be learning from the best and yale is so lucky to have her). this course will open your eyes to different languages and traditions of movement, and the coolest part is that prof coates is able to use her network to invite the leading authorities in some of modules we study. we meet in a dance studio and use our bodies in the space in some way each class. this course also integrates writing and communicating to what is learned in class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Just do it and you'll be thankful you did. The class does exactly what it says it will: it surveys the history of dance theater from the 1950s onward, but it does so in a way that is rigorous, fun, and engaging. In this class you get to move your body (yes, you actually dance!) for at least two hours each week and you get to think critically about an art that is often forgotten in the intellectual world. Emily Coates is a goddess and you will not be sorry for taking any class with her.",
    "Good for students with an interest in abstract post-modern dance, and mostly made for students with minimal dance experience. There is a fair amount of work per week for this class, so if you plan to take it as a 5th class, do it credit\/d. Sometimes I felt that it over-intellectualized dance, which was frustrating to say the least. However, you do get to move around a lot, which is not something most classes have to offer, so that's a huge plus.",
    "Yes. If you don't know about dance, this is definitely a new world worth exploring.",
    "A PHENOMENAL CLASS for dancers as well as those with no prior dance experience. Emily is encouraging and gives positive feedback and advice; the whole class setting was very supportive and non-threatening. This is without a doubt THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE! The weekly readings\/viewings and reading responses can take a bit of time, but they are always interesting (if a bit tricky sometimes). This is not only an overview of the history of dance theater, but a crash course in choreography and art appreciation. There was never a dull moment - Emily is a brilliant teacher and an amazing dancer, and our guest teachers and little field trips were great too. You will leave the class with a better appreciation of the beauty around you, better awareness of your body and your location in space, and a deeper sense of the joy of movement. I once considered dropping it because I spent so much time in class, but I'm so glad I didn't. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.",
    "Dance Theater is a survey course of dance techniques from the twentieth century to today. There were multiple guests who led master classes (this was impressive), and the readings that accompany each week provided context to our studio lessons. In-class discussions were also meaningful and interesting. Overall, I recommend this class if one has any interest in learning more about dance!",
    "Absolutely! Everyone should take this course.",
    "TAKE IT! You will see and read about major dance\/theater works, have mind-opening discussions, and finally choreograph your own piece as a final project. Emily is an incredible professor and dancer, and it's worth taking the class for no other reason than to have her as a teacher. Of course, it's also worth it for the phenomenal guest lecturers (some dancers, others professors) she brings in, and the fun exercises in class, and the range of topics discussed. The course description tells the truth about \"no dance experience required;\" there were theater kids, dancers, and novices all in my class, and that diversity made it all the better.",
    "If you're looking for an unusual experience or interested in post\/modern dance, definitely take this class! You'll become much more comfortable in your own skin and with your own movement quality. You don't need any formal dance training, although it certainly helps. But it's a worthwhile experience for anyone! Professor Coates leads really intriguing exercises and workshops. And you get to have some amazing guest classes taught by choreographers and dancers who are leaders in their field. Overall, a really cool and unique course!",
    "A secret gem of Yale. We met twice a week, for two hours each session, and spent part of each class dancing, and part of each class discussing modern dance. Be prepared to do strange(ish) dance exercises. Coming from no dance experience, this class starts off a bit challenging because of adjusting to a new paradigm, but it is still a tremendous amount of fun and you learn a lot."
