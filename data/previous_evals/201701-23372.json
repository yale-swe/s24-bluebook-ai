   "comments": [
    "Excellent course; strengths: very interactive, everyone is very respectful of that fact that topics may touch on sensitive material for some in class. Interactive, but with plenty of time for reflection.",
    "Joan and her expertise is a strength. She is a very kind, approachable, and knowledgable professor who makes an effort to engage her students and promptly respond to feedback. However, I did not feel that the discussion section was helpful or necessary to my learning experience in this class. It was also difficult to keep changing groups every week.",
    "The course provided a nice overview of relationships and the methodology for studying these. I would have loved for more information about the specific methodologies and how to apply this to future research.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot of little things, a few tidbits here and there. It was interesting in that regard. I think the flow of the course could be improved. It felt choppy in that each week we addressed one topic and I struggled to connect the weeks. The weekly assignments were, at times, a bit much.",
    "The information is interesting, but it is not presented well, which makes it harder to pay attention.",
    "I don't like talking about my feelings in class when I know I could be somewhere else learning something with a measure of utility",
    "The topics covered in this course are really interesting and I think many people can relate to the research in a way they may not be able to do with say, infectious disease epidemiology. Talking about how our relationships affect health really hits home and I think I took away a lot of interesting information. However, the weekly sections and assignments are absolutely unnecessary and there's no reason they couldn't be integrated into class time to 1) motivate students to be engaged and attend and 2) save us the 50 minutes of useless regurgitation of an assignment that none of us actually put effort into. I think Joan should realize that the group presentations always end up being split 3 ways, so you have no motivation to read all the articles assigned for the week, let alone read the entire paper you're responsible for since you might only end up having to discuss the methods. Then when you come to section, everyone literally just reads straight from the assignment, and you know that no one is truly listening or caring or paying attention. All comments made in section are meant to achieve the participation grade, or worse, to share some personal anecdote about how \"like, I totally get how social media influences health because, like, one time, someone sent me a mean message on Facebook and it totally made me sad,\" which then makes section into some kind of weird therapy session. Basically, sections are a waste of everyone's time, really forced, and definitely not conducive to a genuine discussion about the literature.",
    "Joan is a great and relatable teacher, but the lectures were a little bit dry.",
    "Course felt like a lot of busy work. Also, I don't feel like I walked away with any increased knowledge in terms of the content learned in class. The assignments were helpful skills but 1) felt forced and unrelated to the class topic and 2) is a skill we're already learning through epi II. Overall, the course felt unnecessary and perhaps for SBS students, the behavior health intervention course should be required instead of this one.",
    "This course provided a lot of interesting\/thought-provoking lessons about social and behaviors influences on health outcomes. Professor Monin shared the most highly regarded research in each topic area and also shared her own insights and experiences to further illustrate the research base for each topic. However, I think it would have been really useful to not only discuss\/critique the research on a particular topic but also discuss what the implications of the research have been over time and how we as policy makers can add to this research base in the most effective way. I thought that the link between research and practice was often missing from the course. Also, I thought the weekly reading assignments became very monotonous and were not very challenging. Perhaps some weeks students could develop a brief lit review, analyze the present implications of the research, and suggest a specific intervention.",
    "I did not find this course to be useful because we focused on specific content that didn't feel relevant to me, despite my interest in the topics. I would have preferred that we focus more on methods\/scales rather than content of papers that were often outdated and problematic (especially with how they talked about race). I think a good way to improve this course would be to let students bring in current news articles of papers to apply topics too, instead of us having to read papers that were either outdated or that discussed the content of the week in a framework that felt irrelevant or problematic. Dr. Monin is very receptive to feedback and really good at navigating productive conversations of critiques of the papers we were reading.",
    "I wish this course focused more on policy and practice and less on nitty-gritty details of methodology. The workload was pretty fair but I found the weekly discussion sections to be completely unnecessary.",
    "I really enjoyed the flexible structure of the class (both lecture and discussion sections). We had ample opportunities to ask questions, bring in other relevant information to the conversation and critique the literature and interventions we were reviewing. It was especially helpful when we watched short videos in class that were related to course topics we were reviewing that week, to help put some of the research and issues in context. I'm not usually a big fan of discussion sections, but I really enjoyed the sections for this class, because we were able to have open conversations about our interests and frustrations with the studies we were reviewing. One thing that could be improved is including more information about the interventions and or policies that were developed from the literature we read. We were often told that we were reading papers because they have been used in the development of (usually problematic) interventions, which I think is a really important exercise, but it would be good to have more explicit connections to these real world policies.",
    "Great course in interpersonal relationships if that is of interest, but I do not think this should be the SBS-required \"SBS\" course. It takes a deeper dive into a specific aspect of SBS for those interested. For those who are required to take this course, and were not as excited to do so, it was a bit painful at times because while we did learn some specific niche new concepts for ideas, otherwise I did not feel like I really learned any large new concepts or technical skills from this course. I would strongly advise for this to be offered as an elective in its current standing, or restructure the course to be more of a survey class of SBS concepts if this is going to continue to be the required course. Structure of class was easy to handle, often requiring very minimal work throughout the week - so this was a good balance to other more rigorous, serious courses from the semester. Did like that the last few classes were tailored to the students desires - I think that the last few weeks there was much more participation from students. Lecture could be improved by removing quizzes and making it more discussion based.",
    "It was unclear what we were meant to gain from this course. It could have been beneficial to focus on really understanding measures as those were present in all the articles we read. Or perhaps with a different focus entirely, but I am simply unsure of the goal of this class."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is a great professor. She's very engaging and flexible while challenging students to connect course information to their experiences. Personally, I think that CDE537 should be the recommended SBS core requirement for the MPH.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She is a very kind, approachable, and knowledgable professor who makes an effort to engage her students and promptly respond to feedback.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Professor Monin was a great! She is clearly excited about the course topic and provided a great classroom space for learning and discussion.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan rocks! She was so knowledgeable on so many different topics and made her class feel like an open space.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She is not the most captivating speaker, so it makes the class hard to get through",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Amazing person and instructor, great sense of humor and also related to material",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is lovely! I loved how excited she got about almost all of the topics. It was also really interesting and inspiring to hear about her own path in public health, from assisting with studies as an undergrad to conducting her own studies now!",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is a nice person, she is not a great professor. My qualms are not with her, she is doing the best she can considering what her expertise is. I would say next time don't talk about your specific experiences in breastfeeding, we don't need to know that. It's not academic. My vision is marred by the fact that I just hated being in that class",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is a wonderful professor. I was impressed with her research and inspired by her passion for care giving in older adults. I do wish the class was structured better, but as an educator she is one of the best.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is great!! Very helpful and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Professor Monin is very intelligent, sweet and thoughtful. I loved hearing about her own research and experiences. However, I thought that lecture often went on tangents and it would have been interesting to learn more about some of the SBS theories as well as rationale for why researchers decide to study certain topics in a particular way. I think it would have been helpful if she gave us a little bit of background about the assigned readings each week (e.g. where the research stands in the field, how it has influenced other research\/interventions, what the overarching strengths\/shortfalls of this research is).",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She was very energetic + flexible in where the class discussions went.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0As I stated above, Dr. Monin is very receptive to feedback and really good at navigating productive conversations of critiques of the papers we were reading. She is very nice and very good mentor.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Professor Monin is a really great, attentive instructor. She did a really great job of showing us what ideas are prominent in the field and providing context for our readings.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan has a wonderful, laid back teaching style that makes her approachable and made it easy to ask questions or raise concerns in class, which is something I am not usually comfortable doing. She did a good job balancing material throughout lectures, especially in weeks when we addressed heavy topics, so that we had a mix of realistic research and hopeful directions for the future. Joan was always open to feedback and frequently sought it out from students. She was also great to talk to in office hours or outside of class, and frequently had good recommendations for reading material to explore my interests in more depth or names of contacts or programs that I should look into. This is a trait I often look for (and see) in the best professors, and she has it.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is absolutely lovely, and a very sweet human being. Sometimes the class did feel like it turned into a personal sharing session, mostly with Joan talking about her own life experiences - which is okay but also maybe not the point of this course. Joan handled questions in class very very well, and was receptive to class feedback and dynamics.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0She is an expert in elderly relationships and caregiving. Perhaps it would be best for her to simply teach an elective course on her area of interest. I did appreciate that at times she worked to incorporate student input, but overall I felt she was defensive of the material and unable to communicate why she was taking the class in a particular direction."

   "comments": [
    "As a non-CDE or SBS student, I would recommend this class in place of CDE505a. Regardless of requirements, though, this class taught me (and solidified) key elements of study critique that will be useful in many applications of my public health coursework. Definitely take Joan's class!",
    "It's aight.",
    "It's a class that shouldn't be required for SBS, but it is... so you have to take it. The class is definitely not worth the MASSIVE amount of money that we pay for our educations at YSPH (seriously, break it down: it's roughly $60K per year for 10 classes per year\/5 classes per semester... you're paying $6,000 for this class.) Joan is a lovely person though, so just take it and get it over with or join the protest to provide better education at YSPH or lower the tuition rate.",
    "This is a nice overview course. I would recommend it to other students interested in the topic.",
    "A broad overview of different relationships and how they impact health. I would recommend it.",
    "It's a lot of fluffy talk about your feelings. Which if that is your area of research and interest and you find value in it... go for it. If you're more of a technical skill driven person who wants to spend their valuable Yale dollars learning a marketable skill, avoid",
    "I would not recommend this course for the above stated reasons. I don't think I've gained any new knowledge or skills from this class that I haven't already learned from other classes.",
    "This course gives a very high-level overview of various social and interpersonal influences on health (e.g. family dynamics, relationship influences, caregiver\/care recipient relationships). I would recommend this course to students who have never taken as SBS class, otherwise it may be too broad of an overview. I thought that the section for this class was very rewarding and thought-provoking and it gave students a chance to critique and question research that has dominated certain topics within this field.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to people unless they have no exposure whatsoever to the topics we discussed.",
    "This course has a lot of potential. I think if the course content was made more relevant to the field of public health instead of the field of psychology then students would be more interested.",
    "I have a vested interest in the content matter of this class, and I was not disappointed. I would recommend this class to anyone who has a serious interest in the material and would like to have a deeper understanding of the research behind how social and interpersonal factors influence our health. Also, Joan is very open to feedback and frequently seeks it out, so I would recommend it even if someone has reservations, just because she is very good at addressing concerns and trying to improve her teaching and the class overall.",
    "If you're in SBS, you'll have to take it as a requirement. If you're interested in interpersonal dynamics, then this would be a great survey course for you. Otherwise take another SBS course if possible in the fall!"
