   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Behind-the-scenes look at the modern American national newsroom.",
    "I learned more about \"inside Washington\". If you want to know what really happens inside the Beltway, this course is for you! Sinderbrand was extremely knowledgable about journalism and its evolution, particularly in recent years. Furthermore, you spend most of the time discussing current events, so if you love to learn the latest on the Trump White House from an insider, this is your class!",
    "Learned about the relationship between journalists and the White House, an especially interesting topic given the current occupant of the Oval Office. Really interesting to think about questions of journalistic responsibility in a more nuanced way -- how should the press respond to a lying president? There's no good answer but this class gives you the tools to think about it in a reasoned way.",
    "I learned a lot about the inside perspective of a newsroom and what goes into many of the news stories we read. Also, I learned a lot about what goes into making a presidential political communications strategy from both professor Sinderbrand and Eric Schultz when he came in as a guest speaker.",
    "We learned about some of the inner workings of the journalism field. The readings were interesting and exposed us to a side of the press we may not have known before.",
    "The course gave me a much better understanding of the media's mentality in covering politics, particularly the President. It also helped me think about the White House's press strategy and the unusual qualities of the Trump administration in this respect. And it asked me to think about the questions that reporters face every day about how to cover difficult stories in the most impartial, responsible way.",
    "This course didn't necessarily answer questions about the relationships and interactions between the media and the president, but it made me ask those important questions and think deeply about them. I learned about the calculus behind both White House communications teams and reporters when approaching a scandal, a campaign, and a policy roll-out and how both institutions are at once dependent on each other and yet at odds with each other. I learned about the norms observed and sometimes shirked by the president and the press and how each has evolved over time.",
    "How to interpret and consume news and the complexities of the press\/presidency relationship",
    "I was surprised at quite how symbiotic the relationship is between Press and President. I was glad to understand (on a level deeper than daily news) the major shifts in this relationship under Trump. I was pleased at our objective treatment of Trump's politics and the emphasis on change and analysis. I learned a lot about the industry of news, the role and self-perception of journalists, the distinctions (ever blurring) between analysis, opinion, reporting and context. Writing the papers helped develop my research skills immensely. The size and detail the papers demanded I consider structure more. The readings were very interesting, especially related to how Trump and how he is changing the Press Office.",
    "We explored the history and progression of the special relationship that exists between the press and the presidency, and how this relationship is slowly being changed by the Current office holder.",
    "I really enjoyed being able to analyze current events in this course as they occurred. The flexibility of the seminars allowed students to learn how to guide the discussions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Perhaps a stronger reading list and more assignments. Otherwise, great discussion seminar.",
    "The papers were too long, particularly the final paper. Standard for Yale classes are 5-7 page midterm paper and 10-12 page final paper. The readings were great. Seminar was always engaging because discussing current events can be super fun. More guest speakers would be amazing! I know many had to cancel given the time of year, but if you could bring more in that'd be great. Also the interactive material (video clips, etc.) were always super fun to watch.",
    "Amazing to have Sinderbrand's perspective -- she's lived the material we're talking about so it's great to hear what she has to say. Work is pretty spiky (sometimes there's no reading, sometimes there's a 15-20 page paper) but as long as you plan for that it's good.",
    "The course material was always engaging and relevant. I especially liked the real-time tracing of the reporting that led to Tom Price's resignation. If we could be better notified when the readings on the syllabus changed, that would improve the course.",
    "This class is a gut.",
    "I think the topics each week could have been more distinct from one another because it sometimes felt like our discussions looped back to things we had already covered - though it is, of course, important to have themes that run through the entirety of the class. I wish there had been a bit more reading assigned, because I think that would have increased the quality of students' participation. I loved having guests in the class and I loved hearing from Prof. Sinderbrand. I also received very clear feedback on my writing.",
    "The strengths of this course are that Professor Sinderbrand knew what she was talking about because she is an editor at the Washington Post, and this allowed us to hear directly from a reporter\/editor; moreover, it gave us access to two great speakers, Eric Schultz and Phil Rucker. I learned a lot from those guest visits, and they were a key part of the class. In addition, the course was extremely timely and was flexible to allow us to talk about current events. I think a little bit more structure would have been helpful for the course and maybe a better set of readings to give students more of a background and foundation for talking about the present day. It would have been helpful to have a stronger framework for the class sometimes it felt like there was no concrete plan for the day. I still enjoyed the class a lot, but I think this would enhance it.",
    "Strengths- very informative, great teacher Weaknesses- only met once a week",
    "I thought the course material was very interesting, and I enjoyed hearing from experts in the field of political journalism. I also really enjoyed the guest lectures. At times; the class discussions felt a bit repetitive, and the lessons didn't feel very conducive to discussion, so I would've like too see the class discussions be a bit more engaging at times.",
    "One great strength of the class was the way we responded to current events in that week. It felt very fresh and included the inside expert eye of an active journalist. I also enjoyed the discussions and think that we broadly addressed all major aspects of the relationship that was possible - no stone was left unturned. I also think that the two papers were very interesting and in the right order. A special mention should go to the guests we had in the class who were utterly amazing and a huge benefit too. One improvement could have been expanding into different styles of learning (it was a 2 hour class) and greater clarity on the paper (perhaps even a deadline for an initial outline which could be checked by the Professor). And I also thought more reading was required on previous Presidential and Press conduct as this was an area most of the class was unfamiliar with. Nonetheless, this was still a very refreshing 2 hour class that always asked interesting questions of us.",
    "The course is very fluid, and adapts to current events and news. While this is good, it can cause some headaches when preparing for class.",
    "I think the strengths and weaknesses of this course are two edges of the same sword; while I very much appreciated how relevant this class was to the ongoing news cycle, at times it felt unstructured."

   "comments": [
    "Anyone interested in modern political journalism, yes.",
    "I would recommend this course. We had guest speakers which make the class fun! The readings aren't important for anything since there aren't any tests and the papers can be written on personal interests\/research, so for what the class is, the readings are excellent, supplemental looks at political journalism. The class is distributed poorly, and the workload is heavy compared to other seminars (midterm 10-12 page paper, final 15-20 page paper) so that's the only downside. Sinderbrand was super nice, knowledgable, and accessible. You spend most of your time discussing current events and beltway politics, so if you want to know what it's like \"inside Washington\", this class is for you!",
    "Absolutely would recommend, especially for those interested in journalism or political science (even if you're not majoring in one of those - it's very accessible).",
    "Absolutely! Professor Sinderbrand is wonderful, insightful, and engaging. Also this class gives us a great look into how journalist professionals are approaching news in the Trump Era, which makes this ever-changing, calamitous world a bit easier to understand.",
    "YES! This class was phenomenal and so much fun. You come to Yale for this kind of class: An exceptional professor who is leading in their field comes and talks to you. One of the only classes where I enjoyed writing the papers (I actually learned something) and class discussion was exciting.",
    "The midterm was 12-15 pages, and the final is 15-20 pages. Those are the only assignments and the prompts and deadlines are given in the syllabus, so you could (theoretically) get them done early. The professor is willing to speak extensively with you about your papers before they're due and even offered to read mine and give feedback. This class is a gut. Take it as a good fifth.",
    "Yes - if you're interested in working in politics or becoming a reporter, this class would be very interesting.",
    "I liked this class a lot, although it is not particularly rigorous and sometimes it could descend into a Trump-bashing session. Professor Sinderbrand is great, and she had great insight to impart given that she currently works as an editor at the Washington Post. She also brought in some really great guests to visit our class, which was invaluable. This was a good class to balance out some other, more demanding, more academic classes; we had great discussions and were able to follow current events, which was a refreshing and unique format for a course. Overall, I would definitely recommend it, mostly for the opportunity to learn from Sinderbrand and hear her talk.",
    "Absolutely",
    "If you're genuinely interested in becoming a journalist or pursuing a federal government career, I think this class is a good platform by which to discuss and explore the various ways the two fields interact and depend on one another. That being said, the discussions were not as engaging as I hoped they would be. If you're looking for a class in which lively discussions and debate are a key component, I would take another course.",
    "I would recommend this to a student if they were interested in journalism. The real-time expertise of the instructor held an extraordinary level of insight. This was not simply about Press and President but also the state of journalism, the challenges ahead and the focus for a new generation.",
    "This course is specially designed with awesome guest speakers from the White House and the media. The professor is very knowledgable and is a professional in the journalism field. Even if you don't want to go into journalism, I would strongly recommend this course. For those of us not in journalism, this is a great course that begins to breakdown how journalists conduct business.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I found it very engaging and the material relevant to my own life and political views.",
    "Yes! There are amazing guest speakers and the material is very engaging."
