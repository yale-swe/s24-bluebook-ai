   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend it, but this is not a class for the faint of heart. Be ready to work.",
    "It is a really good way to get a sense of James' work. If you are willing to read 300 pages a week and write a 25 page paper, it is a lot of fun.",
    "One of the most rigorous and rewarding courses in the department, as far as I can tell.",
    "It's a LOT of reading; be careful what your other classes look like.",
    "Almost every review says this, and I didn't listen to it, but I should have: Only take this class if you know you like Henry James. And I don't mean Turn of the Screw, which is thrilling and fun (and most importantly, short). This is not a class for you to dip your toes in and learn some fascinating ways of looking at Henry James: this is a class in which you are thrown in head-first to some very cold water. That being said, if you're looking for a lot of work and to push yourself, the class is rewarding.",
    "Ruth Yeazell's seminar on Henry James is excellent. The reading gets longer and more labyrinthine every week, but more exciting, too, and if you have the time to read the novels carefully, the course will be well worth your effort. Ruth Yeazell is fantastic. Take it!",
    "As should be obvious when taking a course dedicated to any single author, you must love Henry James to want to take this course, especially when you get to the later works. If you have no experience with him, I recommend reading \"The Beast in the Jungle\" first to get a sense for his style and subject matter. You also have to be prepared to do a lot of reading very quickly, sometimes a 400-page novel for one class session! However, if neither of these caveats perturbs you, then I highly recommend this course. You read most of the major works of one of the English language's greatest novelists and Ruth Yeazell is absolutely wonderful, the ideal seminar leader, who genuinely engages with the points her students make, drawing them into a productive dialogue.",
    "Unless you already love Henry James, I would not recommend this course. It's not going to make you like Henry James. In fact, it may make you hate him. The class was filled with obnoxiously aggressive individuals with extremely narrow and mundane views of literary analysis who made each class a frustrating and tedious experience. I felt that neither the professor, nor the other students really cared about anyone's views but their own. A English senior seminar is supposed to be the culminating experience of studying English at Yale. Henry James hardly fulfilled this role and was extremely disappointing.",
    "Henry James is a rigorous, in-depth look at a fascinating author. As people have said in previous years, be prepared to do a great deal of reading and to do it thoroughly. Be prepared as well for a term spent on a sequence of rather similar works. That said, Prof. Yeazell is brilliant and wonderful, and this term's discussions were among the best in which I have participated at Yale.",
    "Good course. A great overview of Henry James, very much enjoyed the discussion and the reading.",
    "For the James fan in all of you--take it! It's a lot of reading, but you'll truly learn how to read and talk about the Master. Reading James is reading for life. Prof. Yeazell is a seasoned James scholar, one could not ask for a better teacher.",
    "This class was interesting but a lot of work - don't under estimate the reading load, especially if you've never read late James. Professor Yeazell told us in the first session to go and read some of The Golden Bowl before deciding to take it. Do that, because its the longest 600 pages I've ever read (10 pages sometimes took me 30 minutes). You learn a lot about interpretation though - how to work with extremely long novels and tons of supplemental material (letters, notebooks, short stories, prefaces, criticism), how to how to talk about something you haven't read...Professor Yeazell was great. She's incredibly knowledgeable about James and discussion was interesting and fairly focused, even with so much material to get through every class."
