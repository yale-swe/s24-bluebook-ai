    "This class was absolutely transformative for me. It will be a shame if Yale does not continue it with Professor Skolnik retiring.",
    "Yes, if they continue teaching it!",
    "This is probably the last time that Professor Skolnik will teach HLTH 330, but if he comes out of retirement to teach it again, you should definitely take it! This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Fun, meaningful, and I felt like at the end I had really mastered the lessons and material from HLTH 230 in an entirely new way.",
    "Yes I would, but I don't think that it will be offered again because professor Skolnik is leaving. I think format is good, the presentations were good learning experiences, but it would be a different class without professor skolnik"
