    "The course was entirely led by students and several external guest speakers. The instructor spent the bulk of his time coordinating clients\/speakers and offered no insight to students. Though I expected and looked forward to learning from the instructor's past experiences, he did not spend time actually teaching the class and lectured only once (presenting his own work) over the entire duration of the course. All discussions were student led. Much of the instructor's time during class, and particularly during student discussions and presentations, was spent on his phone. The instructor regularly boasted about the value he offers to the school, without actually offering any recognizable value through teaching. Ultimately, and unfortunately, I learned nothing from the instructor himself, a completely lost opportunity.",
    "Professor Mendez clearly put a lot of time and thought into the creation of this class. I found most of the in-class assignments creative, interesting, and insightful, including the simulated negotiation, the evaluation of Kroon Hall from a \"high modernist\" perspective, and the mock presentation to a planning commission. I did not find the blog post assignments to be additive.",
    "I think there are lots of problems with the course\/the way that Michael teaches it. That being said, I still found the course valuable--but the main value for me lay in the readings, especially the ones I ended up doing for our group project, as well as some of the ones before spring break. The major issues: -There's too much work & too much trying to get squeezed into one semester. Is this a fundamental course in EJ & governance or a practicum? Michael wanted it to be both, but that was too much. -Some assigned readings were really valuable; others were vague, too high-level, long-winded, and full of shlock. I'd cut each week's reading in half (from 7 to 3 readings\/week) -Michael tends to micro-manage the learning experience, e.g., insisting on blogging\/reading responses that no one actually reads or responds to. I'd cut some of the structural constraints--reading responses, the case study in WA, etc. to open up room for other work. -I wish we'd gotten started on our final project earlier--and gotten all of our reading done by spring break. Also, expecting students to do all their reading over spring break makes no sense. Hence, cutting the WA case study. -I didn't find the format of student presentations and pseudo-student-led-discussions super valuable, either as a presenter or participant. I.e., I didn't learn very much from that interaction. I mainly learned from reading outside the classroom. -The projects were valuable but immensely frustrating. Too much focus on the presentation\/client management and \"sexiness\" of the learnings, instead of thinking seriously about the issues of each situation. We also received very little guidance from our client, which meant we were fine at the end, but also meant our project was sprawling and, in my opinion, not the highest quality. -The Yale Carbon Charge case study + field trip that day made no sense and had no connection to the course.",
    "Michael has a lot of interesting experience that we could have learned from. Class time was dominated by student presentations and student led conversations. I would have liked to had more discussions and lectures led by him.",
    "So, Michael is really smart and I believe he means well and the content of this course was technically what I was looking for but it was SO OVERWHELMING that it was impossible to really absorb or focus in on any part of it. It really felt like Michael wanted to teach 3 classes, got 1, and decided to just combine them. There was no space to really sit with the material and discuss things because our time was so jam packed with activities\/assignments\/readings\/and client work. I feel sad about it because honestly, I really loved the class for a couple weeks at the beginning and then I just got really overwhelmed and kind of checked out because it was so stressful to try to stay on top of it.",
    "The course work was heavy for this class and at times seemed to be too much. The readings that were assigned were great and I learned a lot from them, yet the need to also do blog posts as reading responses in addition to the student-led discussions and the client work and the research was too much for this class. It did not allow me to fully digest the information from the readings, the research, the in-class exercises and discussions. There must be some time for reflection and digesting of the information. The workload did not allow for that. Professor Mendez did slightly lighten the work load after several students complained that the blog posts were too much, but it was only a small change at a time when the work was already going to be switching to the client-based work anyway. It would have been more beneficial to me as a student to have more discussion and in-class debriefing of the information rather than writing out reading responses each week.",
    "I was initially eager at the opportunity to take this course and believe that Michael is well intentioned. Unfortunately, I think there is just too much packed into this course, and that some of the assignments and activities, especially at the beginning, were not very useful to my learning. I think this course could be just focused on the practicum aspect, since the theory invoked is very superficial. Many times, it felt like being in an undergraduate level course. I did enjoy the guest speakers and felt like that was a highlight of the course. I believe that Michael is very passionate about the material, but the course could benefit immensely from more focus. Also, I think more clarity about final deliverables and methods for the client project earlier on would be helpful.",
    "There could have been a field trip that was based in local city environmental policy. The sustainability field trip was half useful - the self-guided building tour was not that useful."

    "The best aspects of this course were the real-world practical experience working with California-based clients.

The course also provided additional professional networking opportunities.",

This really gave me a good idea of what it may be like to be part of this kind of planning process and the type of issues that come up and what we need to be prepared for in this setting working with community members. I also thought the readings were great, insightful, and helped me learn a great deal about the subject matter (albeit a bit heavy on the work load). The student-led discussions were a nice way to debrief, yet they often got cut short because class time did not allow for the full discussion. It would have been nice to have more time for those.",

   "comments": [
    "I personally find Professor Mendez's personal work incredibly fascinating and I would have liked to have heard him lecture on his research more often. The coursework while incredibly beneficial seemed to be really heavy at times and I found myself focusing more on this one course than the rest of my courses. In the future I would look for ways to reduce reading responses during presentation weeks and while students are completing client-based work.",
    "Beginning with the syllabus, the course should be listed as a 4-credit course to reflect the amount of work assigned. The instructor has an inaccurate idea of the amount of work students put into the course, which amounted to 20-25 hours weekly after midterms. An unreasonable amount of readings were assigned on top of an already over-packed weekly course load, made up of client work (which entailed coordinating client and group meetings, conducting interviews, researching and writing), preparation for student-led discussions, and weekly blog posts. Many in-class assignments were peripheral to the course content and wasted time. For example, we were given 30 minutes to complete an energy audit of two buildings on campus (which took 20 minutes to walk to and from, leaving 10 minutes for the audit with no prior instruction). The instructor than gave us 10 minutes to put together a slide presentation of our energy audit and invited external guests to watch our presentations, only telling the class at the last minute. The entire class felt completely confused about the purpose of the assignment, its relevance to the course, and embarrassed to present rushed and incomplete work to external guests. Many assignments were like this. The instructor did not provide constructive feedback regarding assignments, even when asked directly, and was upset by clarifying questions. He was overbearing and, furthermore, dismissed the professional experience FES students bring to the table. For example, when my group mates and I were independently asked to present our work, the instructor forbid us from doing so, which is not his call to make. Guests were regularly invited to the class, though the content they offered mirrored descriptions of their organizations that could be easily found online. Therefore, little learning came from invited guests. Furthermore, guests were invited to mock presentations during stages of client projects that were far too early for feedback. The instructor planned to continue working on my project following the course. While this could have provided for an excellent partnership and mentoring opportunity, he did not disclose this intention to my group. The instructor aimed to use my work as a basis for his own research, and to edit and publish my work without my knowledge and consent. Left completely in the dark, I felt manipulated and disrespected when I found out that this was the case. Moreover, the instructor made condescending remarks about my client, which I found offensive, inappropriate, and unprofessional. The instructor sent out an excessive amount of emails daily. These emails were hasty, demanding, and rude in tone. This greatly contrasted emails the instructor sent to clients, which were thorough and appreciative. The instructor sent out several news resources to students that were relevant to each client project. Given that FES students are resourceful and read the news daily, especially news related to relevant topics, receiving myriad emails from the instructor with news stories throughout the day, on top of the resources already recommended, was unnecessary and distracting. The instructor gave only one lecture throughout the entirety of the course. That said, the presentation materials and questions posed to the class (in the form of slides) were rife with major spelling errorsfrom \"Environmental\" to \"Forestry.\" In a course that touches so heavily on professionalism, the instructor needs to have someone proofread his slides. Ultimately, I left the class feeling used for my work and completely disappointed by the degree of teaching offered, or lack there of. I left believing the the instructor's aim was entirely self-centered, not reflective of environmental justice values, and focused more on his own professional development and gains through client networking than the student experience at FES.",
    "Professor Mendez sometimes attempted to achieve too much in a class period, and thus rushed through speakers, class discussions, and other (great) material.",
    "The blog posts seemed like busy work (but Michael changed the syllabus and scrapped the last few, which was much appreciated). I would have liked more time for discussion on the readings and maybe less time for all the guest speakers.",
    "Classes are very student-run. Students are responsible for leading discussions and are often presenting around in-class assignments. Disappointing because it means students are teaching themselves the material. In-class assignments were not helpful to my learning. This time could have been much better spent actually engaging with the readings and other real issues.",
    "Discussion section was sometimes not what was expected. The workload was very intense, particularly because of weekly assignments and project.",
    "The structure of the course, expectations of students, time devoted to presentational stuff rather than actual interrogation of the concepts. More concrete examples of environmental injustice and how to prevent them as a manager....",
    "Michael is very focused on pursuing his own goals rather than fostering student growth and learning. This was displayed several times by his lack of compassion for student concerns and the lack of transparency surrounding what he plans to do with our client project work. He also made this clear at the end of the semester when he explicitly stated that the only criteria for how he chooses projects for the course are that they further his own goals. In an environmental justice course the emphasis should be on doing something for the community and the environment. He never once explained that he will be going forward with our work and using it to publish articles. This would have been an opportunity to make us feel that our work is valued and to foster a relationship with Michael. He tends to make assumptions about students effort levels and commitment to the course. He even goes as far as to make assumptions about our attitude towards the course based on facial expressions in class. Many of us do not get much sleep at certain times in the semester, or may be dealing with personal things at home, so an unenthused look may be completely unrelated to the course. Michael also set expectations without making them clear, and then judged groups based on those expectations. I understand the importance of taking initiative, but in graduate school every class is a priority and if something is not required you cannot fault the students for not doing it. If he wants students to put more time into the client project, he should make the course worth more credits and scale back on the blog posts and readings, which he did later in the semester based on student feedback. He should also stop equating this class to real work experience as an excuse for why he is hard on people. A professor should be supportive even when they are trying to push their students and point out what they need to improve. Lastly, our project group was invited to present at a workshop and Michaels only response was that he would not allow us to present unless our project met his standards. Michael could have used this as an opportunity to support us and work with us to make the project as strong as possible, but instead it felt like he was stifling professional growth opportunity and putting us down. At the end of the day Michaels approach to the class left me feeling used for my work and bullied for not being good enough for him.",
    "The class needs to be WAY WAY WAY pared down. Have it be JUST a client course, have fewer readings, no other writing, and give students space during class to really discuss and work on projects. Michael should lecture more because he has a lot to offer!! But then we always had all this other shit to do like case studies and weird exercises and field trips and whatever that just made me feel way over stimulated and unable to focus on anything.",
    "1) Better time management for class exercises, such as the student-led discussions, which I really enjoyed and thought were a nice way to ask questions and reflect on what we had learned in the readings. We often had to cut discussion short because we had spent too much time on the other parts of the class. Since it was only a once-a-week class, this was unfortunate. 2) More realistic expectations of students from the professor. In this practicum, we worked with clients on a project in groups. Yet, the professor did not clearly outline his expectations from the beginning of the semester and made comments in the beginning of the semester that the client work would not be too heavy, which is why he was also giving us a heavy workload of reading and out of class work apart from the client work. Yet, when client work finally started half way through the class, we quickly learned from Professor Mendez and from our clients that indeed we were expected to do quite a bit of work for our clients. 3) a) Better communication between professor and students. Mendez initially told the class that we, the students, would be the main contacts with our client, yet he often contacted the clients about without telling us. This put us in a strange situation with out clients at times and unfortunately made us look unprofessional and disorganized. The professor being in contact with the client is, of course, not a problem in and of itself, but because Mendez did not ever share with us that he would be in constant contact with the client, it surprised us. These kind of miscommunications happened throughout the semester. 3) b) Better communication. This would have to include a clear explanation of expectations for his students and timeline of how the semester will be carried out from the beginning. The professor changed the syllabus several times throughout the semester and this made it difficult to plan work, especially when we were trying to plan work around the very different schedules of each of the members of our groups. 4) More confidence in the students from the professor. It often felt as if the professor was doubting our professionalism and our work ethic and our ability to perform. This was shown in the professor consistently asking to review communication and deliverables we planned to send to the client, showing little trust in our skills. It also was represented in direct communication through email to our group, in which he held certain professional development opportunities over our heads stating that we would not be allowed to take advantage of them if we did not prove ourselves first as competent students. 5) More respect for the students and in general. When I asked questions or asked for clarifications, it felt as if the professor responded in a condescending way that made it difficult to reach out in the future. It also was confusing because he mentioned several times in class that he hoped we would reach out to him if we had any questions and that he was happy to help clarify anything. This type of contradiction made it difficult to understand what the professor wanted and what he was willing to offer to his students. It created an uncomfortable environment. The professor also made some disparaging comments about our client that I felt were disrespectful and also inappropriate for him to mention to us as his students who were working with said client. 6) More consistency with how the professor speaks to students. When the professor introduced us to guest lecturers, clients, etc., he would speak very highly of us and our extensive professional experience before coming to F&ES. Yet, in email and individual communications with his students, he would often mention our lack of professionalism and our inability to meet his expectations and do high level work. This was confusing and frustrating and speaks to why we, as students, felt unsure about his expectations and his general demeanor with students vs. clients.",
    "See above.",
    "The class discussions were good, but would have been improved by more insertion of the professor's experience in the topics.",
    "The course load was more than I had expected or planned for. There could have been more communication about the expectations for the final project before we selected our teams."

    "My group was big and I liked all my groupmates individually, but as a group, it was difficult to structure our processes, manage our workflows, documents, etc. We spent a lot less time discussing the concepts and strategies than we did in formatting, preparing oral presentations, etc. That didn't seem the most valuable use of our time, honestly.",
    "The group work was the most fulfilling and enjoyable part of the class. My teammates were thoughtful in their work and committed to producing a quality product for the client.",
    "Group meetings with the professor should be mandatory. It creates a confusing relationship when some groups meet with the professor based on the nature of their project and develop a good relationship with the professor as a result, while other groups did not have the same need to meet with the professor, yet were chastised because of the different approach to the work. This speaks to the need for group work to be independent, yet also guided by the professor in a professional way.",
    "I really enjoyed working with my group and learned the most from them in the process of working on our client project. It was the other highlight of this course.",
    "I worked with outstanding colleagues who I learned a lot from.",
    "Our group was rather small for the workload- we worked together very well but ultimately the work we needed to produce required a large number of hours outside of class for all of us to meet."

   "comments": [
    "Take the course, but be prepared to work really hard. The course is a lot of work, but it is incredibly enriching and rewarding.",
    "Unfortunately, this is the worst course I've taken at FES. There are other EJ clinics and client-focused courses offered that address similar issues, provide the same opportunities to students, and offer far better instruction. I recommend taking those courses as an alternative.",
    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time on this course, and get a lot out of it!",
    "Be prepared for a pretty heavy workload. Your experience will probably depend a lot on what client project you get. Overall I recommend the course!",
    "Would be careful of what changes will be made to improve course before taking it.",
    "Be prepare to commit to the reading\/writing and project. Meet with the professor as a group and share your comments as early as possible to avoid rushing through everything at the e",
    "I would spend a good chunk of time looking through the syllabus and seeing what the expectations are and asking whether the readings and topics are ones you actually want to look at--and whether any significant structural improvements have been made from this year's version.",
    "I would avoid taking this course unless Michael is able to change his approach and his relationship with students. Its a shame because the projects are very interesting and important and we need more EJ related courses at FES.",
    "I honestly wouldn't recommend it because it's way too much and Michael is not super trusting of students, really controlling, and it was very stressful. It's really unfortunate though because the material in this class is really important and a lot of people should learn about it and it's hard to find material like this in other classes.",
    "Speak with several people who took this course before deciding to take this course to be sure you are prepared for the type of course it is, the workload, and the teaching method of the professor.",
    "Meet with your group regularly (set a designated weekly time if possible) to work on the project.",
    "Make sure you are aware of the course load and plan accordingly. Also make sure you know what is expected in the final presentation and that you are comfortable with it. Also- the readings are great! Make sure you have the time to complete them!"
