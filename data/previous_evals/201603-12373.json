    "This class is enormously helpful for getting your Ancient Greek reading ability into shape, especially because of how often you must switch between dialects and authors.",
    "I learned a lot about Archaic and Hellenistic poetry and I improved my translation skills with an unprecedented speed and depth. I learned how to discuss texts in a seminar context, how to defend a point or an idea that I had about a text and how to appreciate other students' points of view.",
    "I acquired a familiarity with trends in scholarship relevant to each literary genre and authorial figure treated in this class in addition to improving my Greek reading skills to an even greater degree."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: * The amount of texts read * The great amount (and the excellent quality) of feedback received * The discussion rather than a lecture-like mode * Meeting twice a week and having the 'extra hour' included in one of the two standard sessions, rather than meeting a third time in the week for the extra hour. Weaknesses: * Not having choice for the two short papers: I would have preferred knowing that I had to hand in a close-reading and a response paper before the end of the semester and picking myself the article or the text to engage with (of course with instructor's approval first!). * the not-always constructive discussion-mode of all the members of the class. In few occasions, I had the feeling that certain comments in class were more intended to show off knowledge (and prove that \" I know more than you\"), rather than creating a fruitful discussion. Sometimes my impression was that some of the questions made aimed at engaging in a sort of competition not only with peer students, but also with the instructor of the class. I think that this is a department-culture issue, rather than a Greek Survey issue, but in my opinion it is an important point to be made and I am happy to talk more about this in person.",
    "The strengths of a survey class are probably obvious: breadth of coverage and intensity of reading in the original Greek."
