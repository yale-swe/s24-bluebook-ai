    "how social policy is analyzed and how it evolved over time",
    "The course emphasized the development of insights over the memorization of facts or rote practice of skills. First, you will learn how to understand the world of domestic policy as a dynamic system. Second, you will acquire the language to critically and precisely evaluate the successes and failures of competing policy approaches. Third, you will learn how to interpret results from important sociological models of theoretical and practical relevance to policy analysis.",
    "An introduction into the world of formal modeling and policy tools. I learned different and interesting ways to think about social organization and social structures, and it has completely changed the way I see the world.",
    "I developed my understanding of what is Policy and got a great framework for thinking about specific tools of policy but also the overall understanding of this field. It was a great class in developing a way of thinking critically with enough background to have a general understanding.",
    "Different tools of policy, example of these tools, analysis of these tools. However, I still don't really know what sociology is.",
    "Acquiring analytical lens to understand social policy",
    "This course introduced five tools of social policy, which the course was heavily centered around. The first half was historical, where we learned about policy from the New Deal to Post-911 eras. The second half was more formal modeling, including models that Professor Boorman developed or helped develop. Learning about social policy from a sociology perspective was refreshing (as a political science major).",
    "Through this course I learned the basics of policy analysis: Block modeling, social network analysis, and more"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "great content but Prof Boorman just cannot relay information in a digestive way. His teaching style involves lecturing and answering questions but his lectures often don't discuss the topics we need to know for the course. Very convoluted. His emails are too long and convoluted as well. With that being said, Prof Boorman is an extraordinarily talented man and has pioneered much of the course content. It was still a privilege being able to learn from him.",
    "Strengths: Professor Boorman has an exceptional breadth and depth of knowledge and experience in social policy. He can always point to examples in his life to illustrate theoretical lessons. He is generous in issuing memos that mirror his lectures. Weaknesses: The course covers a lot of ground and it isn't until the end that you can appreciate how various topics were connected. The course was too large this year for the seminar room. The grade is 100% based on a final exam (although there is an optional midterm that will be considered if your grade is borderline A- vs. B+, for example), but it's fair and Boorman gives you an example from a previous year for practice.",
    "n\/a",
    "The main weakness of this course is that unless you engage with it and actively follow what is going on it is easy to miss the forest for the trees. This however speaks to the depth of this course because there a ton of valuable trees. There are many great insights and clever ideas but you have to stay engaged and understand how everything fits together. It could be improved by being more explicit during shopping period and highlighting exactly what you are going to gain from this course.",
    "The material is interesting, but lectures can be a bit dry",
    "The course could be improved by the very simple method of outlining what will be talked about in a given lecture. The course emails were helpful in figuring it out, but Professor Boorman generally dove into the lecture without context, making it hard to follow in the moment (in retrospect [read: when cramming] the lectures flowed well). Simply signaling where the lecture is and where the lecture is going would be very helpful. The course itself was fascinating, easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Boorman is an absolute genius, and his expertise is apparent. The course emails were informative, and often he sent his lecture notes to serve as a reference later on.",
    "This course is overly lecture-y and sometimes can get very monotonous. The readings and amount of materials in the course are also numerous and slightly overwhelming."

   "comments": [
    "Beware that the only real grade is a final exam. Lectures are at times confusing and it can be difficult to discern what the main points of the lecture are. Readings can be treated as strictly optional.",
    "Professor Boorman is the smartest human being you will ever meet. If you have the opportunity, take this class just for the chance to listen to him speak twice a week. Wow, what a dude. Also, the material is really interesting and you won't find a course like this anywhere else. The readings are not completely necessary, and some are more interesting than others. Go to class and review and you'll be prepared for the tests.",
    "Yes but you have to attend lectures to keep up.",
    "Please see my strength\/weakness and knowledge\/skills\/insights responses. I would recommend this course if you are: (a) interested in social policy, (b) interested in sociological modeling, and\/or (c) enjoy learning about history.",
    "Yes!! take it credit d though",
    "I think this is one of those courses where if you engage with the material and the professor especially you can learn a lot. There is a ton of knowledge here and so it ends up being on the student to decide what they think is valuable. This class is unique in being a 100% final class but the final is designed so you can think about what you have learned. you have to learn the material but then apply it and think critically. I have gained a lot from this class but because I put my mind to what i found interesting.",
    "Sure. If you're looking for a low work 5th or 6th course, take this credit\/d\/fail.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with a few caveats. First, the entire grade is dependent on a final. There is an \"optional\" midterm, which helps to boost your grade if you do well but does not hurt you if you do poorly. Professor Boorman is probably the smartest person I've ever met this means that he teaches at a level beyond the average person. You might feel like you're lost during the course, but sitting down with the material and talking with other students was very helpful in synthesizing the vast, complex information into manageable parts. This is a must-take for anyone interested in politics and policy analysis."
