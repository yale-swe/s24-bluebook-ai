   "comments": [
    "ARCG 702 applies archaeological approaches to art and iconography while relying heavily upon Panofsky's levels of iconographic interpretation. It engages and challenges students to interpret ancient artworks from a theoretical perspective. I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "This course is an introduction to methods used in the study of art and iconography, with a focus on the Moche and Maya. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in studying the symbolic meanings behind art and materiality, including archaeologists and art historians.",
    "I would summarize this course as it is labeled. The course offers a sweep of archaeological approaches to iconography, with a heavy focus on Moche and Maya iconography studies. I would absolutely recommend this course. I have been promoting all semester, as it was my favorite this year! I was actually disappointed that some archaeology students decided not to take the class, because they could have really benefited from the knowledge! I gained so much insight from the writings and instruction of the course.",
    "Missing out on this course would be a mistake. I think that students in art history would also benefit from this class as it is a much more anthropological approach. Be ready to work hard and read a lot of dense material and thoroughly discuss it in class. Oswaldo will call on you and expect you to have an answer even if it wouldn't be his.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to a student who is interested in art and new world archaeology. This course provides different theories and methods to art and iconography and use New World archaeology as examples."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to better understand and interpret ancient art, a challenging task at times. While this course will not play directly into my dissertation, it will be of enormous help later in my academic career.",
    "This course allowed to consider the various approaches\/interpretations behind the study of iconography. Regarding my research, it has allowed me to consider using the interpretive study of art and hieroglyphs as another approach to understanding past societies.",
    "My field site does not often offer iconographic representations to assess and deconstruct. This class offered me the chance to engage with readings that will allow me to study ancient art in the past that corresponds with current iconographic studies. Thus, while my field site might not have art in the typical sense, I now have part of the toolkit to begin engaging with other art of my area, which will revive my interest in art and visual culture.",
    "This class deepened my knowledge of my discipline, I learned a valuable methodological tool as well as considerable content knowledge in my geographic specialty. I will definitely use this in my dissertation research.",
    "It is very helpful. I am interested in iconographies of Shang Bronze. This course provide a good chance to learn the theories and methods to study them."
