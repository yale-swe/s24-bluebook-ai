    "Research for credit. Pick a project, like it, hope that you have enough data in the end to make it seem like you got something done. Don't worry, in most cases, everyone gets about 1\/5 of the data they were expecting. Still- easy A, if you put in a reasonable amount of work.",
    "I would highly encourage doing research for credit before your senior year. I learned a ton this semester since I spent a fair amount of time in lab, and I have a good idea of where my senior project will go next year. I benefitted from having a great mentor and PI who took the time to answer my questions and teach me as someone still relatively new to research. I cannot say enough great things of my time in the Miller-Jensen lab!",
    "I would recommend.",
    "I would recommend BENG 472 as an excellent course for any student interested in biomedical engineering research. It is a requirement for seniors in the major during the second semester as a means to fulfill the senior project requirement. The course allows for a unique opportunity to conduct meaningful, cutting-edge research and work with renown faculty and researchers.",
