   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it overall if you have any interest in prototyping, engineering, and developing countries.I would hesitate to recommend it because it seems to vary year to year. Last year it was driven by mechanical engineers and this year it was more driven by SOM students. I was hoping that it would be more engineering based but because more of the class was simply not qualified and did not know enough nor seem to want to work on engineering oriented things, it did not turn out as I had hoped.",
    "I would recommend. It is a fabulous challenge and a great way to actually learn.",
    "The first half of the semester is basically background research on the developing world (i.e. Africa). Eventually you identify a geographical region a specific problem to focus on (this year it was electrification in Ghana). The class splits into two teams about halfway through the semester: one team focuses on developing a commercialization plan and the other focuses on making a new product. At the end, there is a big presentation of the new technology and commercialization plan and a big report. This is a really good class if you can stay motivated and are willing to work at it. If Prof. Zinter is still running it, you will get more out than you put in, but you really have to put in a good amount of effort to see any returns. You'll need to be willing to step out of your comfort zone in terms of doing stuff you have never done before (like study electricity, if you're not a tech person; or study marketing if you are a tech person). I guess you really don't have to care deeply about the developing world, but it definitely helps. I really loved this class, but I won't just tell you \"Take it!!!\" because you really have to enjoy this kind of stuff. It's not for everyone.",
    "It really depends. My experience wasn't that great, however, the previous year's evaluation was really good. From my year, I would not recommend this. I just didn't have fun and it didn't meet my expectations at all.",
    "My excitement for the class definitely declined over the semester (unfortunately) and I think that the class will be very different each year depending on the type of project and the group of people that end up taking the class. Overall it was a good learning experience but it could have used more structure.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend it, whether you're on the Comm Team or the Tech Teams... I was on the Comm team, but I think both are super valuable and I maybe wish I had done tech since you didn't need to be abet to understand what was going on in the tech teams.There's few (maybe no) classes like this at Yale but they should be what a course here is about - you're learning so much so quickly ,from your profs, your guest speakers, and your classmates. The output of your work has a direct effect on something tangible (i.e. the product). I would say even if you're not interested in development, it's still a great class to take. More than like DS for example, you learn how to think critically and be a leader ~ which is Yale's mission, right?",
    "This class is interesting, and it's certainly like no other class at Yale. If you take it, be prepared for a lot of ambiguity and a lack of clarity about the project you're going to do and what you should be doing. Also be prepared for an extreme amount of work at the end of the semester, so don't take this class in conjunction with other classes that are work-heavy towards the end of the term. However, you do learn a lot, and you learn a great deal about how difficult it is to solve the problems in poor countries.",
    "Similar to 489, but with a stronger focus on economically viable solutions. The multidisciplinary makeup of the students can be a helpful at times, and a hindrance at others.",
    "An interesting concept, but the class still has kinks. If the professors are able to solidify a clear curriculum and provide more guidance, then the class would be greatly improved.",
    "This was an amazing course. There's nothing else like it. Take it.You get to create something that has potential to change people's lives.It could have been improved by having clearer deadlines from the beginning, more accurate information on the course assumptions and the evolution of groups and research targets so that everyone was at the same page. Even so, the class was amazing.",
    "Don't be fooled by the cool video on the first class or buzz words like \"innovation and interdisciplinary.\" I would not recommend this course for another student. The technical minded students will waste the first three weeks while the \"com team\" learn what an electron is. This is followed by a cursory \"intro to business\" line up of lectures, prior to the actual design of the project. The unique and interdisciplinary talents of the students were not utilized. Instead, non-essential busy work was delegated, leaving the few with applicable skills to do the heavy lifting. Most of the project was slapped together in the final weeks of the course. Highly disorganized and disappointing. A bait and switch. You won't get to do much hands on building. Take the other Mechanical Design course instead.",
    "Take this course. You will have fun, work hard, and have a very meaningful experience.",
    "Yes! Lots of hard work, but also a big reward. It's a messy process by design, but it's worth it because it more accurately reflects real-world experiences (in engineering and otherwise).",
    "This class was a heck of an adrenaline rush. I learned so much. We built a functioning prototype and gave a product launch. It was also a ton of work and I hope it is better organized in future."
