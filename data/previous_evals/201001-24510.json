    "Discussion of the role of opposition in a democracy. A lot of the course is about the relationship between process and outcomes to the democratic model--to what extent does how you made a decision matter to its legitimacy? We also discussed free speech, civil disobedience, and developing democracies.Take it if you're interested in the subject.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would certainly recommend the course to somebody interested in the subject--or to someone with a passing interest in political science.",
    "A solid underclassman seminar. Perhaps a little old hat for those who have taken advanced EP&E classes before, but generally enjoyable, with only two major assignments and 5 short reading responses."
