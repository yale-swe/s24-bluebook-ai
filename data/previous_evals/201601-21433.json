    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL HATE IT.",
    "I think the course will evolve - and Professor Hagglund has a lot of potential to be an amazing instructor, since he knows so much and is able to enhance the individual readings by placing them in philosophical frameworks. I hope the course will improve, perhaps will a modified reading list and more attention to APPLICATIONS and examples. Also, the lecture meetings felt too compartmentalized and the overall narrative of the course was hard to piece together...",
    "Yes, but it gets tedious at times. The readings are really dense, and if you're not taking it for your major it can be hard to get motivated. If you are taking it for a major (I think it's required anyway) it is a really cool course and would totally recommend this over other options.",
    "This course is a survey of different philosophies of literature. In the past, when it was taught by Carol Jacobs, it was much more focused on literary analysis and on the relationship between theory and actual literary interpretation--think Borges and Freud. This was Professor Hgglund's first year teaching this course, and he spent many weeks on ontology. Once we got to actual literary theory, the readings were often quite interesting, but lectures themselves remained really introductory and vague. I don't think I really learned much about how to interpret literature, but I did think in new ways about what it means to be a reader or author. With Professor Hgglund's ontology-focused style of teaching, I'd take the class if you have to for the Literature major requirement--but if not, there are philosophy courses that offer much more rigorous philosophy, and literature courses that offer much more in-depth studies of what it means to be literature. But Professor Hgglund fosters great discussions and seems really nice and passionate--I'm optimistic that the course will improve with time!",
    "Most students who take this are required to do so. Theory is, in my opinion, pretty hard to slough through. That said, it's usually rewarding in the long-run because it's ubiquitous in academia and any thought coming out of academia. Prof. Hagglund's first run of the course was a bit rough, but I expect it to improve a lot in subsequent iterations. The work load in the class was minimal.",
    "If it weren't for my major, I probably wouldn't have taken this class. I'm glad I now have some background on literary theory, but I wish lectures could have been more engaging. It feels very much like a philosophy class. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is not studying something along the lines of English, Literature, or Classics.",
    "Awesome class for anyone interested in Philosophy and Literature",
    "I didn't sign up for a philosophy lecture - I signed up for an *introduction* to theory of literature course - but this course assumed too much prior knowledge. I don't recommend it in its current form with the focus on inserting philosophy without properly covering it. The best part of the course is the part of specific regions of literary criticism - post-colonial, African-American, feminist, queer, etc. - but the rest of the course gets muddled in philosophical discussions about the foundations of the text without diving into the text. Expectations for essays were unclear, though deadlines were flexible. Don't waste your time with this course unless you're a lit major and have to take it to graduate.",
    "ENGL 300 was not very well taught. Prof Hagglnd focused exclusively on Heidegger, which meant that in order to understand the other material in the course, one had to first understand Heidegger. The course title should have been \"Theory of Literature through Heidegger\" based on how it was taught this semester. There was no teaching of how one might use the theories read in class to read literature. Further, expectations were very poorly set, such that it was extremely unclear what a good paper for the class would look like."
