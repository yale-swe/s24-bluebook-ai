    "Take this class if you want to work on political campaigns. It is broad, but it covers quite a bit and does so in a very interesting manner. It is not too much work and I feel like I learned a great deal. It is a very interesting outlook on political campaigns and Hersh is really good.",
    "Very hard class, but interesting, it is a good fifth class to take for Credit.",
    "\"Electionar.\" A very participatory lecture, interesting. Gives you good exposure to political science methods, which are often glossed over in other classes. Manageable workload. Worth it if you put in the time.",
    "This course was informative, but a little dry and fast-paced if you are not interested in the information or do not know anything about it. I came in with little knowledge of an sort of election-related information at all, and although it was ok, I found it hard to participate and often got annoyed with the outspoken political junkies in the course. There is A LOT of reading. Everyone thinks they can do it at the beginning of the semester, but I don't think many people actually finished it each week. It also takes a while to get through because of the method descriptions, etc.",
    "Terrific class that traces how the rules of our elections dictate campaign choices, and how those choices lead to voter outcomes. If you're interested in American Politics, it's a great course.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Hersh is an excellent lecturer who goes at just the right pace, is always engaging, and has also figured out how to make the lecture fairly interactive. The readings are not difficult and give you a lot of practice with reading social science research. The course topics are super diverse, and it could almost serve as an introduction to the political science department (it was the first polisci course I took and I felt like I learned a lot about the field). The workload is fairly easy - two fun papers and a final - however, the grading is fairly rigorous. This is because, even though Hersh is a really good natured guy, he structures his course so as to minimize the amount of bullshit. Plus, Hersh is approachable - going to his office hours was always fun.",
    "It is a great course if you are interested in elections. The first lectures seem a bit boring, but they get very interesting once you pass the \"reading the constitution\" part. The lectures are very very engaging, and the readings not as much but definitely good. There is a weekly blog post about the readings, very easy to do, and two short papers. For one of them you write about how a law affected elections, and for the other you must go to a campaign event (could be hard, but I loved the experience). You can choose to take a final or write a paper. Although the course is about the US, the topics of papers are completely up to you (even if not from the US). It is an enjoyable course, and would definitely recommend any student to take it!",
    "The course is an good introduction to election rules and campaign strategy, although you will not really learn about the actual laws that govern elections. The emphasis is more on features of the American electoral system (such as the incumbency advantage) and how campaigns react to them. I would recommend the course, but be aware that it is certainly not easy. They grade the two papers very critically (almost unnecessarily so) and you will have no idea how to study for the final. Still, it was really interesting and I got a lot out of the content. Also, be prepared for an unnecessary amount of reading.",
    "A snapshot of election law, campaign strategy and various different aspects of US elections. I would absolutely recommend it for the wonderful professor and great course material. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Take it if the syllabus really interests you. Don't if it doesn't.",
    "Great class - Professor Hersh makes this material relevant.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to Political Science majors or anyone with an interest in politics.",
    "No. Juice was not worth the squeeze. All the political junkies were annoying and detracted from the content. Professor was smart, but not particularly approachable. Mehh.",
    "PLSC 229 is a fantastic class if you're interested in American Political Science. Professor Hersh is perfect for the class, and an enjoyable lecturer to listen to. The class covers a lot of material, but gets in depth when appropriate. I recommend it wholeheartedly, for political junkies and anyone who has wondered at all about American elections.",
    "If you are passionate about the topic, take this class. If you find it interesting and have some previous knowledge, take this class. If you have no experience and don't want to take the time to catch yourself up, do not take this class.",
    "Hersh is a good lecturer: informative and usually engaging. The material is pretty self-explanatory \u2014 a wide range of topics relevant to the politics of elections and campaigns. Each week you read a couple of articles, write a short forum post, and take notes in lecture. Two 5 page papers with open prompts and the option to write a research paper instead of taking the final means you can make this course what you want it to be. Solid grounding in campaigns and the rules that govern them; the articles made me consider my assumptions in different ways. Would recommend.",
    "I would recommend the course for anyone interested in learn about elections, but I would warn in advance that it will be very statistically heavy and the learning will focus on election and processes rather than the actual internal functions of campaigns.",
    "I would recommend it to another student if you are a sophomore, who already is interested in a lot of politics and want an excuse to learn it all and learn it well. I think the class was strangely made up of political fanatics and beginners and it was a bit difficult in that sense. So, you need to know already quite a bit about american politics (i.e. for internationals it's more difficult) but not too much that you still learn.",
    "Absolutely if you are interested in the details of our political system.",
    "A cool class if you're interested in thinking about elections, mostly at the federal level. The class is organized around thinking about election rules and how they constrain candidates and thus alter their strategy. We started with the US Constitution and what it says about elections. Next was electoral college, term limits, gerrymandering, messaging. This class is definitely more politics than policy. If that sounds good to you, you'll enjoy it. Readings are pretty thoughtfully chosen, lecture was decent. I definitely feel better prepared to talk and think about the 2016 Presidential election, which is cool.",
    "This class allowed for an in-depth look at many topics that are relevant in political campaigning. I would definitely recommend this class, the professor is amazing and you will learn a ton. The readings can be a bit dense but the TF's do an amazing job of helping you through it. The papers are pretty straightforward and not too hard to do. You have to study a lot for the final but if you're willing to put in the work, definitely go for it!",
    "A good class but be aware, there's no BS'ing the final like 99% of poli sci courses, especially if you weren't there for the class throughout the semester and taking extensive notes. Class will never be cancelled due to the most extreme of weather so don't ask.",
    "It's a really cool class if you're into political campaigns and elections, and want to learn more about how that system works in the real world. Professor Hersh was a great professor who cared about the class and the material. If he does it again, get Christen as your TA. He's awesome, and really helps clarify the difficult stuff. Fun class, and not too much work, especially as a Cr\/D.",
    "Great class. Definitely geared more toward those who have an interest in politics, as some basic knowledge of government will definitely help you coming in (not necessary, however). Lectures are awesome, and Professor Hersh is really engaging and is always inviting participation from the class. Lecture size of around 40 was perfect because it made the class into a sort of hybrid between a lecture and a discussion group. Learned A LOT in this class.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class taught by one of the most engaging and energetic professors I have ever had. The class is a fascinating combination of election law and candidate strategy, and focuses especially on how various election laws (such as campaign finance restrictions, term limits, and voter ID requirements) actually affect the strategy of campaigns. Highlights of the course included our discussion of the Electoral College, primary systems, messaging strategies of candidates, and campaign finance laws. Another highlight was the attention paid to Supreme Court cases such as Citizens United and Baker v. Carr. Professor Hersh is a gifted lecturer and extremely knowledgeable about elections from both legal and political science perspectives. Every class was just the right balance between insightful lecture and student contribution. Professor Hersh even made weekly reading responses feel worthwhile--he read them every week, and would frequently challenge students, in class, on their arguments. This was a fantastic aspect of the course. The reading is mostly political science journal articles and a few court cases. Though some of the reading was technical, Professor Hersh's clear exposition as well as helpful analysis in section helped crystallize the main ideas. And though methodology was sometimes complicated, the broad ideas presented in each paper were fascinating without exception. The workload was typical for a political science lecture, and the assignments were unusually unique and enjoyable. Writing the second paper involved attending a real campaign event, and almost everyone in the class seemed to enjoy their experience tremendously. If you are at all interested in campaign finance reform, voter ID laws, or campaign strategy generally--or you could see yourself advising a political campaign or running for office yourself--take this class. It's a fantastic experience.",
    "Coming in, I thought that this course might not provide me much, already being somewhat well-versed in American electoral politics. However, I did end up learning a lot about the ways that campaigns operate and how election rules play into that. While it was a lecture, Professor Hersh treated the course like a seminar often, requiring short reading response posts and asking a lot of questions in class, seeking student response. The class required little in the way of critical thinking, especially on the exam, and a good deal of memorization. It required a certain \"political-science-y\" mindset at times. That said, Professor Hersh made an effort to be accessible and engaging. A course I'd recommend during an election season, to see the practical effects of the material.",
    "Wonderful and easy going class for anyone who might be interested in elections and how campaigns think.",
    "A straightforward lecture course. Professor Hersh is energetic and insightful. The two essays are interesting to do and fairly painless. I took this course credit\/d and felt I got a lot out of it for fairly minimal input.",
    "A good class-- very interesting especially if you are interested in working on political campaigns. That being said, previous experience with political science classes or campaigns in general is definitely not required.",
    "YES!!!! Take it! Especially if you can take it during an election cycle. Loved this class.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you're interested in campaigns or American politics more broadly. Professor Hersh is a very engaging lecturer, and the readings are very good overall."
