   "comments": [
    "Gained a lot of insight into how I am as a writer -- what I'm good at, what I'm (really) bad at, what I do and don't like. I hadn't had much experience with poetry or really any with drama, so that was cool.",
    "Learned I love drama, fiction is way harder than it seems, and learned about myself along the way!",
    "I've improved my writing and clarified my approach to writing.",
    "I learned about how to approach writing drama, poetry, and short stories. I worked on developing my own voice and practicing different genres through which to express my own voice.",
    "How to draw things out and compartmentalize",
    "This course taught me some skills and tools in creative writing. We read a wide range of various fiction, poetry, and drama works and emulated some of their techniques.",
    "I developed my understanding of a broad range of creative writing: fiction, poetry, and drama. One of the best parts of this course was workshopping the work of the rest of my class which gave me insight into the potential successes and failures of different styles. I also learned a lot about radical revision.",
    "Throughout this semester I have gained a concrete understanding of creative writing techniques, including narrative and character development in fiction and short stories, rhyme and imagery in poems, and dramatic tension and beat structure in drama. I've learned how to critically analyze creative writing and glean techniques for inspiration and argumentative writing",
    "I learned how to analyze what writing techniques authors used to create effective creative writing pieces. I also grew as a writer by writing short stories, play scenes, and poetry.",
    "I learned about different types of poetry and learned how to express myself through different creative writing mediums."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course's breadth was both a strength and a weakness. I was exposed to a lot of different materials, which is great, but of course I would have rather spent two months on each unit rather than one. I felt that we didn't have enough guidance on assignments (\"Write a monologue.\"), which maybe is due to how nebulous different genres are. Also, we focused on modern poetry, which turned out to irk me, so that was a bummer. However, the practice is awesome, and I ended up doing things I wouldn't have normally done (and enjoying them).",
    "More time for all the units!! In reality, the workshops were the weakest\/least-engaging part of the course (which is expected, I realize, and everyone gets their turn and should put in effort to workshop others' pieces, but still). I wish we could have had more time to learn about the genres, because I often felt that I was learning by doing, which I personally don't enjoy. Also, a little more guidance with prompts would have been helpful for me. I felt very lost when I was instructed to write a short story about everything, and the only guidance was to stick to clearly-delineated wants and needs for my characters.",
    "Strengths: Got to explore a variety of genres, guest lectures were great. Weaknesses: sometimes class discussion got stalled in one place; sometimes it felt like insights from the readings could have been made clearer vis a vis how we could improve our own work",
    "The strength is that it gives you a taste of three different genres of creative writing and also gives you a taste of various authors in each genre. The class is fast-paced so it's hard to feel like you've gone in-depth in any of the genres. But, it's a survey course meant to give you an introduction in order to think about what you might want to pursue more in-depth and it accomplishes this.",
    "I really liked the overall structure of the course: the writing, the seminar and the lectures all fit together really well. Perhaps there could have been more frequent (and lower stakes) writing exercises? I think I got the most out of those.",
    "Strengths include an overview of various forms of creative writing. The class allowed you to follow your own style and improve the writing you want to pursue. Weaknesses include a lack of focus in any of the forms of creative writing. The techniques we learned were from what we observed in reading and there seemed to be a lack of structure in that aspect.",
    "The strengths are the workshopping, the readings, and the one-on-one session(s) with the professor. Its greatest weakness may be the fact that each section felt rushed. I was left feeling like the fiction and poetry sections were incomplete. This could possibly be improved by getting rid of the lecture classes every two weeks and replacing them with more seminar sections.",
    "I think this course does a great job with one and one attention between student and professor. Those moments were the most influential for me. I also loved the guest lecturers that we got at the beginning of every unit, which increased our understanding of each mode of creative writing. I feel the only area of improvement would be a larger emphasis on each work we are assigned to read. In my section we rarely discussed any individual piece at length (except maybe 1 or 2 of them) and I think quality discussion over quantity read is more important to glean the important techniques that we should mimic in our own writing.",
    "I loved the seminar setting; it gave you the opportunity to work closely with about fifteen other students and the professor who gave very personalized advice. At the end of each unit (poetry, short stories, and playwriting), students workshopped assignments which helped with figuring out why certain writing was or was not effective. Since the class was an introductory level course, sometimes it was frustrating to not get to delve deeply into one genre. Also sometimes assignments were very vague, which can be a strength or a weakness depending on how much freedom you like with your writing."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course -- the professors are great, we have great guest lectures, you read a bunch of cool stuff, and you (hopefully) write a bunch of cool stuff. What could be better?",
    "Yes! If you want to try creative writing this is a wonderful way to do it. It's really fun trying all the different genres (even the ones you're scared of) and it's nice to have a group of people to grow with as writers",
    "I would if you have no experience in creative writing. It is a good introduction to various genres and can show you where your interests in creative writing are.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great way to try writing creatively in a large number of genres. Professor Andrews is great: very enthusiastic and committed as a teacher.",
    "Nah",
    "This class would be a good class to see what works of creative writing really interest you. If you only enjoy a subset of types we go over in in class, the curriculum is much less enjoyable. Students should expect only a cursory overview of the various writing styles, and additional learning would require going to office hours.",
    "Yes! I would highly recommend this class if you have any interest in creative writing! I learned so much about myself, my peers, and writing in general. It was one of the most fun classes I have ever taken and the work did not feel like work. One thing: be sure to shop and make sure you like your section professor before you commit because I'm sure that this class varies greatly between professors!",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are interested in any form of creative writing (fiction, drama, or poetry). I would only recommend this to people who are serious about pursuing some form of this writing because it is very focused and might only appeal to those who are really serious about it.",
    "I loved this class! I think anyone who is interested in creative writing should take this class; even people who don't typically write can learn something new from this. I've been able to incorporate techniques from this class into scientific writing and journalism, so it's definitely not just for those who enjoy creative writing. Since the class is an introductory level course though, I would not suggest this class to anyone who wants to focus solely on one style of writing. If you know that you only like poetry, or just want to focus on short story writing, then take a class concentrating on that genre because the units fly by very fast. Do not take this class if you're expecting to closely analyze literature for themes\/symbolism\/etc. Primarily, you will analyze creative writing for stylistic\/plot\/character development techniques.",
    "I loved this course. It allowed me to read a plethora of short stories and poems that I would not have read otherwise. It was a lot of fun and I felt that it really pushed me as a writer.",
    "Yes, definitely take it! It's a really great, low pressure introduction to creative writing. You will get out of it what you put into it. It introduces you to a lot of types of writing. You may find something that really speaks to you."
