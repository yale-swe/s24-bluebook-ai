    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in thinking about medieval English literature and the development of the scholarly edifice.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student based on the strengths of the professor, the engaging use of physical objects, and the fascinating theoretical questions raised by the issues of using the material object in the teaching of literary texts.",
    "I would describe it as an intensive introduction to manuscript studies. I would definitely recommend it to another student as a way to think about and work with the materiality of literature.",

   "comments": [
    "I thought the single best component of the class was that it provides a forum in which to interact with Beinecke materials. Now I feel equipped as a scholar to come to grips with unedited, uncatalogued, or otherwise overlooked texts.",
    "I was especially delighted with the opportunity this course gave me to pursue a project aimed at a general audience rather than a specialist one. I relished the opportunity to work with technology, building an online exhibition which I hope will be engaging to scholars of other periods of literature or history but the wider public. Jessica was extremely encouraging and supportive of this project and my trajectory. It really helped me to think about how an esoteric subject such as the study of manuscripts could effectively be conveyed to other audiences.",
    "This course opened my eyes to some of the most essential issues of my research. It helped me to think about the sources that I will use in my dissertation in new ways and also opened new avenues of inquiry and possibilities for future projects."
