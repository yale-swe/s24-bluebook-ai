    "I recommend this course because it focuses on such an important subject.",
    "AMST 133 is an overview of U.S. (the territory) history PRIOR to the permanent settlement of this land by Europeans and of European\/U.S.-tribal interactions DURING and \"AFTER\" colonization. Particular attention is given to the agency of Native American peoples -- in that they were (are) not one, helpless people who have sat idle and in defeat at the advance of European culture and technology. Take the course to find out how various figures and tribes adopted certain European customs\/technologies to advance their tribal cause, and how U.S. and European governments have had to adjust their policies due to Native American agency.Highly recommended for anyone curious of the topic. Need not be a History or AmericanStudies major by any means -- accessible to all. Professor Mt. Pleasant is great, too.",
    "It's a solid class, but it was pretty boring at times. But take it if you need a pre-industrial history credit.",
    "Call me crazy, but this class moved me deeply. I cannot recommend it enough.The material covered in Introduction to American Indian History is insightful, compelling, and vital in the construction of a thorough and honest US history. It provides an important alternative narrative for native history, one that covers a broad, expansive range of the American Indian experience.It may not be the most thrilling history or American Studies class you'll ever take at Yale, but the material you'll cover makes the course an invaluable experience."
