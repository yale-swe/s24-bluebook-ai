    "The material that was newest to me was information about zoning.",

   "comments": [
    "I tend to find that online courses are often less engaging but I really enjoyed the lectures within this class. I thought the videos were a good length and that the content was diverse and covered a great deal of perspectives related to land use and environmental management. I also thought the readings were well selected.",
    "Good survey of the field, but very basic",
    "Materials are very good, content also very good. The only weakness is the lack of interactivity due to the online format of the course but at the same time the content is well suited to an online format. Perhaps creating a \"blog\" or chat room or something could create a bit of interactive discussion.",
    "Strengths: Guest speakers were interesting and enthusiastic.",
    "I think it's great the way it is",
    "The course is too superficial for the topics selected. Some of the lectures were quite long but didn't go into specifics.",
    "I appreciated the video\/online format of the course and opportunity to take it at my own pace.",
    "Strengths - interesting material, well-organized modules. Weaknesses - it felt like this course needed an update, particularly when it addressed issues of social and racial justice. The way that those issues were framed felt out of date, and I would have appreciated a more diverse perspective and solutions-oriented focus to be brought to those modules.",
    "The strength of the course is that it can be conducted on my time. The weakness is that some of the lectures are difficult to follow because the guest lecturers aren't professors and thus accustomed to teaching.",
    "Maybe a written transcript of what was said? I wanted to refer back to lecture material but didn't have time to skip through the lecture to find things.",
    "As an online course, I found this course to be a great introduction to the subject. I was able to watch the videos and complete the final project on my own time."

    "This online course provides a great overview into land use planning and is great for students wanting to understand how environmental policy is shaped by land use planning rules. It is a one credit course and does not have too many assignments though there is quite a bit of reading and videos to watch.",
    "Take it if you just want an intro to the field. A nice taste test.",
    "Make the effort to get the most out of the materials and invest some time despite the fact that this in an online course. Pay attention to the lectures. The materials are good if you pay attention to them.",
    "Even if you are not interested in land use and development, it provides good exposure to topics that will make you a more informed citizen. Makes you question the existing structures, design, and development of your town\/city.",
    "Even though you can work at your own pace, don't wait until the last minute.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student with a general familiarity with the material covered.",
    "It's a good supplement to a full suite of classes.",
    "Take this class if you want a basic introduction to land use planning!",
    "It may have been easier to be more closely engaged in the in-person version of this course held in the Fall. In the online seminar, you don't have opportunities to ask questions of the speaker in real-time.",
    "Good to understand the basics of Land use in the US. Very national focus",
    "If you want an great introduction to Land Use Planning with experts in this field, take this course."
