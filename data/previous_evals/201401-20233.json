    "Math 101 is the best Math class I have ever taken. Please take this class!",
    "MATH 101 is just kind of a broad survey course over the mathematical principles of nature. You talk about visual things (like patterns in seashells) but also historical or theoretical things (i.e.--how ancient civilizations determined the size of the earth, general relativity, etc.) I would recommend it to another student, especially if a technical mathematical background isn't one of their strong suits.",
    "You should take Math 101 if you need a good QR credit and math is not your strongest subject. I would definitely recommend it, it's not a stressful class at all and you feel better about your math skills afterward.",
    "Very very easy QR credit, especially if you're not good at math. All 2 open note tests and one open note final! The psets had about 3 questions and were very doable.",
    "The class is a truly interesting QR credit that isn't that hard if you stay on top of the subjects, and Professor Frame is incredible.",
    "AWESOME CLASS. IF POSSIBLE TAKE IT. YOU WONT REGRET IT.",
    "A math class in which you learn how math can be applied to the natural world\u2014includes fractals, spirals in seashells, curvature of soap films, fourth dimension, speed time graphs, special relativity. If you are not a \u201cmath\u201d or \u201cSTEM\u201d person, but are looking for a great fantastic course that will make you actually enjoy math\u2014this is for sure the course for you! I would 100% recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it, mainly because Michael Frame is an incredible teacher"
