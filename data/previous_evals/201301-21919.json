   "comments": [
    "The lectures are very boring, and the assigned book on the syllabus is Historical Fiction. I would give this class a B.",
    "Yes! Definitely. The American West was an awesome class, full of interesting anecdotes and information. As a student from the West though, I think I was particularly interested from the course material. But I would recommend it to any Yale student interested even remotely in history or American culture",
    "Yes! A great survey course.",
    "Make sure you keep up with the textbook readings or else you won't have a very good idea of what he's talking about in lecture, but good class.",
    "It's an extensive history of the development of the West, mostly focused on photographic history\/evidence.",
    "Absolutely wonderful lectures, a truly interesting course, excellently structured and quite thought-provoking. The use of images was an interesting method, and the use of media was great too. The one problemwas the exams: they only emphasized rote memorization and didn't test much. A pretty basic lecture otherwise: an exam, a midterm, a 10-page paper. The paper was intended to be structured around Beinecke sources, which was cool. Faragher's lectures were outstanding, though a little scripted.",
    "The course is super interesting and worth taking if you are interested in the subject matter. Professor Faragher is wonderful, just be warned, the midterm and finals are complete memory tests and involve memorizing a bunch of images.",
    "This class is thorough and does focus on both western history, art history and literature. Be prepared for memorizing for tests, but you will certainly learn a lot.",
    "Take it. You'll learn about Cowboys and Indians like you never expected to.",
    "The American West is a great intro American Studies course, covering a wide swath of western frontier history, with a very healthy dose of Native American history. It's strengths lie in the visual materials Faragher uses in lecture - his perspective on history, and teaching it through images, is a unique and wonderful experience that I definitely recommend.But be warned that the exams are stress tests, to cram a ton of info into your head and then vomit it out as quickly as possible. Which is a real shame, because it makes you dislike a course that deserves to be liked. Faragher is great, this is a really cool view of history, you'll learn a lot of new things about this country. So overall, I recommend it!",
    "American West was a really interesting survey course of the history of the West, starting with Cortez and ending with the development of Alaska. It's an image-based class, which was sort of new for me, but by the end I really enjoyed it. The first few classes may seem slow, but it picks up. There is a lot of information to know for the midterm and the final, but it is not difficult material to learn. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, whatever your interests are and especially if western identity is something that you wonder about. Basically covers a lot of American history and thinks also about the modern frontier, etc. good books to read, too.",
    "It's decent but a lot of work for a decent grade.",
    "Take this class if you're homesick for the West Coast!! Just know that the professor emphasizes the sufferings of the Native Americans, and by the end of the course you'll feel really guilty and you won't be sure America is a legitimate country any more.",
    "Yes, the american west is such an interesting time period, not too much work.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good American history course that covers an aspect of American history that is not usually delved in a general course.",
    "This is a wonderful course! Lectures are extremely interesting, almost a mix of history and art history. The reading load is reasonable too- as long as you are willing to put in more effort for the exams, I definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "A very interesting take on the development of the American West. The course focuses a lot on images, which is a neat way of studying the history from a slightly different angle. The midterm and final require memorization of images, so if that's not your strong suit consider taking it Credit\/D and letting the interesting stuff just sort of soak in without pressure. Only assignment besides the test was a 10-12 page research paper on basically any topic of your choosing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in American History. Be warned that the midterm and final are very memorization heavy. But if you enjoy learning facts within a larger theoretical context, this class is great! Professor Faragher's use of images is engaging and rewarding. The course is not very difficult, but there is a lot of reading and the tests require a lot of studying. If you are willing to put in the time, you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "I was scared to take this class because previous assessments made it seem like the memorization required was going to be an ungodly task. That turned out to be a huge exaggeration, unless the class was previously insane. You're given ~200 ID's\/images to memorize and a few possible essay questions that will be on the midterm and final. It's a lot easier than it sounds.Only downside is that the class has both a final exam and final paper.Also, for the gamers, no, this class never talks about Red Dead Redemption.",
    "I would definitely recommend American West to anyone interested, but beware: the mid-term and final require a lot of memorization of IDs and images and might be a shock. In my opinion, it was worth it.",
    "No",
    "Yes, I would recommend. The subject matter is interesting if somewhat depressing. You come away with a new awareness for how this country was founded. Note that the lecture very much focuses on pictures and other primary source analysis.",
    "The workload is pretty easy in this class, and reading is about average for an American Studies course. I would say make sure you are truly interested in the subject matter or else you might just end up really disliking this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. The grading was fair and you can get away with not doing the readings if you attend lecture and section. It was a very interesting course that touched on a lot of different history of the American West. If you like that bit of history this course is for you! I am not a history major and thoroughly enjoyed the course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone. This course offers an important historical perspective on the United States that everyone could benefit from, not just history or American Studies majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in learning more about the fascinating history of the American West. It is a VERY broad overview of the history of the west, and Professor Faragher covers a ton of material throughout the semester. The exams are very challenging, but other than that, not a lot of work for the class. It's definitely a Yale classic though, and really is worth taking. Very good course!",
    "A really interesting lecture, take if you want an interdisciplinary view of the west",
    "Recommended, but tests are random and somewhat unrelated"
