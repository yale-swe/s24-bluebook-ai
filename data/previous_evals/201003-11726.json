    "This was an excellent class and provided a unique perspective.",
    "In depth analysis of several diseases instead of general overview of all vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. I can honestly say I learned alot about the ecology of such diseases. weaknesses of the course were due to a slight lack of organization in the schedule of the course. Debates and assignments were poorly structured and not explained clearly by insructor",
    "Great course... One of the best classes taken at EMD and EPH... Labs help you understand the material being taught in class",
    "It was a good introduction to ecological concepts and trying to incorporate those into an epi base that public health students have. It was a particularly useful for class for those wanting to study the interaction of human health with that of vector and animal diseases."
