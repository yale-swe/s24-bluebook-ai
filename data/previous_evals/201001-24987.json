   "comments": [
    "If you're the type of person that enjoys designing things on Solidworks and then waiting in line 30 minutes to print them on a laser printer, and then making minor adjustments and repeating this process ad infinitum then you might enjoy this class. I enjoyed the design aspect, but I found the implementation excruciating. Also, the lectures were downright awful. Many of them involved spending the entire class inserting numbers into the wrong formulas and getting the wrong answers. It was obvious that Dollar was not even remotely prepared for class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I really enjoyed the course and it was great.",
    "Crash Course in Frustration Management that happens to introduce you to some cool stuff along the way and consequently cause you to hate it.",
    "The most boring lectures in the world, but some pretty cool labs--use a laser cutter, build a mini ATV out of parts from a cordless screwdriver, etc. Demands a ridiculous amount of time because of all the hands-on work, and the class is poorly structured. I'd recommend it if you're interested in ME, but be prepared to invest a lot of your time.",
    "This is a tough call. The final project was pretty fun, but I wouldn't recommend this project if you are not a MechE major. A lot of people ended up dropping the course out of frustration, and I agree that the way he grades and explains labs can be frustrating.",
    "Its a good class. HOWEVER IT IS A HUGE TIME COMMITMENT. Realize this also includes a 3 hour lab (7 to 10 or 8 to 11 pm!!) and is still a single credit. Problem sets are also very time consuming, but pretty straightforward.",
    "Mediocre class to get an idea of what mechanical engineering can be. Provides good introduction to the topics and the pending workload, but don't expect to do a whole lot of building. First lab is in the machine shop doing metal working, but the rest of the labs are spent using an automated laser printer. Taking it either freshman or sophomore year; taking it after MEng 280 makes it a pretty easyclass albeit work intensive w.r.t. labs. Psets are simple and short, and Friday class rarely happens (this year, anyway)",
    "I think you should take this course in your freshmen year, especially if you think you may end up doing mechanical engineering. It puts all the other mech e courses into perspective.",
    "I found this class really interesting and fun! (Coming from a senior of a totally different major who took this class). I took it because I wanted a creative class that was still practical and rigorous, and that's exactly what I got. The projects are sometimes difficult and it can suck having 3-4 hours of section each week late at night, but looking back it wasn't too stressful. The problem sets take time but are doable. The exams really messed up our grades though! But yeah I recommend this class.",
    "No, I wish I could, I was hoping that this would be an amazing class, but if anything it swept the creativity out of me and gave me doubts about any future work in mechanical engineering. While it is not difficult to do well in this class, it is a lot of work, and you feel entirely uninspired by the end of it. Maybe Dollar will have managed to work out the bugs in this class, but judging by how much he seems to care about it, I wouldn't bank on it.",
    "Good class in theory, but I didn't feel like it quite live up to my expectations. The last lab as a lot of fun, but other than that the class is kind of a drag. Dollar isn't very enthusiastic about most of the material and does a bad job of spreading out the work. Some weeks there is nothing due, and other weeks there are four things due.I didn't find it to be overall a very enjoyable class.",
    "Great class. Take it."
