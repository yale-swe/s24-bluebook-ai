    "Absolutely take it if you have a strong interest in development and can get in. It will give you the historical depth you need to understand how ideas evolve in the development space and the ability to critically analyze trends in the field. It will also give you a strong sense for where different actors--multilateral institutions, NGOs, governments, researchers--fit in, and how their roles have changed\/continue to change over time. Certainly, it will teach you more\/prepare you better for work in this sector than most (if not all) global affairs, global health or development econ classes at Yale. Don't worry if you haven't written a history research paper before: you'll spend the first few weeks of class learning how to do historical research. It's also a phenomenal history seminar in general, one of the best in the department. Professor Meyerowitz is one of the top three professors I've had at Yale, and runs great discussions (with really useful mini lectures at the beginning of class). She's very accessible and helpful through the research process.",
    "Do it! A great course with relatively little work for a seminar and a topic that everyone should have background in.",
    "This was one of the best seminars I have taken at Yale, largely due to Prof. Meyerowitz's skill in leading our discussions. I appreciated the chance to discuss some of the most difficult questions about poverty and aid with an academic approach, even though this is an area I have had little experience studying. I wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student.",
    "If you get into this seminar, you would be a wild fool not to enroll. This is incredible material, and a fantastic professor.",
    "This was a pretty awesome class. It gives such a good background on what recent (from the 50s or so onward) movements have been important in development circles. Meyerowitz is SUPER knowledgeable (and sweet!) and her background\/introduction of each movement was my favorite part of class. This year at least, I found the discussion to be interesting, but it could have been more useful if we had dug a little deeper into some of the movements instead of mostly repeating what we had learned in the readings. The readings are also great and not too heavy, so you should do them. The assignments are short for the most part, and also give you good exposure to the variety of research materials Yale has to offer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Although it can feel overly critical and negative at times, it gave a great overview of past development models and a handful of key lessons that we can take away and apply in the future. The reading was interesting and varied, and Professor Meyerowitz was great!",
    "This is a great class!! I loved it. Really interesting, comprehensive look and major attempts to end poverty. It challenges current development thinking and easily engages you in discussion. The professor is great also and I am so so glad I took this class.",
    "Good survey course on the history of anti-poverty movements. The way the class is structured helps give insight to different movements such that covered the green revolution, the basic human needs movement, microfinance, women in development, and many others. Just like any other seminar, a lot depends on who's in the class, and in the end, only about five or six students were regularly engaged. Sometimes, the class felt like we were just repeating the readings, but that changed a bit in the later half, and hopefully it'll be even better next year. Also, we mostly covered Western \/ US-lead anti-poverty movements, with little coverage of internal anti-poverty movements that took place in the developing world. Overall though, I'd recommend taking the class cause the coverage is good and Professor Meyerowitz is great.",
    "I really, really loved this class! I thought the syllabus was fantastic and thorough, and everything the tagline for the course said it would be. Great discussions in class, great readings, cool homework assignments, fair workload of readings and writing assignments. One of my favorite classes at Yale hands down. If the history of poverty alleviation and development efforts abroad appeals to you in the least - TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "Definitely take this class. It contains the right mix of economics, sociology, history, anthropology, and area studies to keep anyone interested. The topic is very much relevant to today and is widely applicable to any area of study.",
    "The Problem of Global Poverty is one of the most fascinating and important classes I have taken while at Yale. The course provides a comprehensive history of the ideas, policies, and initiatives behind the efforts to alleviate global poverty between the 1950s and the present day. The class was particularly valuable for its weekly research assignments that exposed the class to all of the resources available on Yale's campus. The class also exposed us to many incredible primary sources, critical secondary analyses, and theoretical foundations to contemporary programs to alleviate poverty. All, in all, the reading assignments were very fair and well-balanced. We would also cover all of the material in class, which made the readings especially valuable. Unlike many history seminars that are made up entirely of history majors, this class was unique in that it included majors from various disciplines, including Economics, Global Affairs, EP&E, ER&M, and HSHM. As a result, this seminar resulted in the best discussions I've had in any seminar at Yale. I highly recommend this class to majors and non-majors! Whether you are interested in not-for-profit or antipoverty work or are simply interested in one of the world's most complex problems, this class is one of the best and most valuable courses at Yale. I am sure that I will continue returning to the ideas and concepts covered in this class for the rest of my life.",
    "'This is probably the best class I've taken at Yale. If you've gotten this far, you should definitely take it. The class consists of around 150 pages of reading each week, two 4 page papers, and a 15 page final paper (and tiny primary source assignments each week). Prof Meyerowitz has crafted the syllabus with great care and attention, and the result is a wonderful survey of the changing views on development from the 1950s on. The weeks are not at all repetitive (something I've run into in some other seminars), yet the connections between them are clear. Overall, fantastic class!"
