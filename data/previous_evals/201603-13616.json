   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned how to challenge sources on their stances and beliefs and how to set aside my own biases. Being objective can truly difficult, especially if you're discussing a story on a topic you care about. I gained the beginnings of a journalism ethic that I will continue to develop. Also Audacity really is great freeware that can produce high-quality content without a large technological barrier.",
    "Learn how to use Audacity (soft ware), learned that you need to cut to the interesting stuff for radio or else people will just zone out",
    "I learned to use recording tech, use Audacity (audio software) and create a cohesive story using audio clips.",
    "I learned a lot about the art of radio journalism--how to write for radio, interview guests, and use Audacity. The technical aspects were the most helpful. I was clueless as to how to record and edit a story, and now I am very confident in my ability to do so.",
    "Improved interviewing ability, understanding of basic recording tech (Audacity), storytelling, writing, and people skills.",
    "This was a great introduction to the world of radio! I learned to cut and edit audio, write scripts, do audio interviews, and create a full-length radio piece",
    "I gained knowledge and skills in how radio journalism works! I feel like I know so much more about how stories should sound and be structured. I also loved getting to learn things and then apply them directly to the projects we were working on; that was very exciting!",
    "I learned how to write for radio, using sentence structures that are easy to listen to and a voice that is conversational. I learned about radio journalism ethics, particularly NPR's ethical framework. I learned how to conduct interviews that provide good actualities. We practiced workshopping pieces, and I also learned the basics about editing audio."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The final project is definitely the greatest strength of this course. It takes a lot of effort to develop, as it should, and teaches you a lot about how to create narrative for the ear. It also teaches you how to develop relationships with and work your sources. A large seminar size, even only with 15 students, really is a detriment to workshopping. Also more consistent feedback should happen next time.",
    "Arnold was clearly not that invested in the course. He seemed like this was very low on his priority list. The course could benefit by being more organized and perhaps by doing more group activities, such as shorter projects and a class project.",
    "Strengths: fantasy script writing, direction on using the audio software, the selected texts. Weaknesses: bulk of the class is workshopping--rarely spend time learning about reporting techniques and strategies. Furthermore, feedback from Professor Arnold was inconsistent (although, when he did give feedback, it was very thorough). Overall, I wouldn't say it is a well-constructed course, but you will leave with a finished story and a much higher appreciation of radio reporting.",
    "I felt as though this course did a lot to prepare me for actual work in radio journalism, but I did not think it was structured in a coherent way. I spent money on the textbooks but we were never assigned much reading and when we were we did not discuss it. We were also required to put in a lot of work outside of class for not much course time to workshop our material. I think we would have benefitted from a better system of who was going to be workshopped each week.",
    "Unlike many Yale classes, this one gave us an opportunity to develop a practical skill. The long-term final project was fun to work on. The class was mostly learning through trial-and-error and less classroom teaching, which could be good or bad. I was frustrated that we received no grades on anything we did throughout the semester. The class could also be improved by having fewer people in the class, as the number made it difficult for the professor to give everyone adequate attention.",
    "It was fun and rewarding to be able to create radio pieces regularly and critique them with the class. Maybe could have done one or two more short stories to get more practice (would have to cut down on edits and\/or critique time).",
    "The strengths were investigations subject matter that I'd never previously encountered, and working with a great professor. The biggest weakness was probably that we spent a lot of class time listening to other people's stories for workshop; this ate a lot of time and sometimes wasn't that useful",
    "Strengths: very fun to go to class, always dynamic, you learned a lot and got to feel that you were applying it to the pieces you were working on, it was fun in general! learned a lot about something you don't necessarily always get to study in school! Weaknesses: a bit disorganized, and sometimes i felt like if it were a little bit more structured we could have learned more!",
    "The course was an amazing introduction to radio journalism--I really loved the readings and advice Professor Arnold gave on how to conduct good interviews and how to structure and write stories that are easy to listen to. It was really interesting talking about the ethics of radio journalism and NPR. Classroom workshops were usually very useful. I wish we had done more smaller projects rather than spending so much of the last week workshopping our final project--the big final projects ended up only being about twice as long as the smaller projects, so I think I would have learned more by doing 3 or 4 small assignments rather than 2 small assignments and 1 \"big\" final project. Professor Arnold leads wonderful discussions, is always clear and approachable, and is an excellent instructor!"

   "comments": [
    "Seriously, only take this course for the grade. There were too many seniors taking it pass\/fail who were not working as hard at crafting good journalism and contributing to workshopping. Also being polite is fine but being nice is not. It's okay to be critical on people's work, they will benefit a lot from it. The seminar is more of a workshop than it is an intellectual discussion so please do not come into with overly intellectual ideas on how one should craft journalism unless you're able to apply it. If you're done for all that and into creating kick-ass content, take this course if you can get in.",
    "It is an interesting experience. I enjoyed going outside of Yale for my story. However, I think that really the main skill I gathered is using Audacity, and I don't think taking this class would be the most efficient way to do this.. so I probably wouldn't recommend.",
    "It's a great subject and the projects are fulfilling. But know that Chris is a real NPR guy, so he doesn't have a ton of time to devote to the class. It's still a great class -- but just know that going in, his job comes with pros and cons.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student but only if you are taking a somewhat light course load. Week to week, there is not much work, but actually editing a story takes a lot more time than you would imagine (especially for the final project).",
    "Take this course if you want to get hands-on practice with making radio journalism. It's not too much time, and it's fun to get out there and record people to make cool stories.",
    "Take the course -- Chris knows what he's talking about.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in journalism and curious about radio. It's an excellent fifth class, because it requires such a different type of work from other courses",
    "I would recommend this course to someone! It won't be a life-changing course where you learn about something in a new way that blows your mind, but it is a very very fun course. Chris is great and enthusiastic and cares a lot about his students and their work. Class is very fun and it is a gift to be able to create something tangible like a long radio journalism piece!",
    "This is a great class. We learned about so many aspects of radio journalism--how to conduct good interviews, how to structure and write stories that are easy to listen to, how to think about radio journalism ethics. Chris Arnold is an experienced NPR reporter, and he makes radio journalism seem incredibly important. He also leads great discussions and is a funny, approachable person! My main criticism is that our final projects ate up a lot of our class time toward the end of the semester, and the workshopping conversations could sometimes drag a little (it often felt like we were waiting until Chris Arnold would step in with his own advice), but discussions were generally great. This was a remarkable class that made me think hard about how to help tell other people's stories, and it improved my own writing. Although a lot of the class felt self-motivated, I learned a lot from this class, and I'll remember what I learned long after I graduate Yale. If you can get in, you should take it!!!"
