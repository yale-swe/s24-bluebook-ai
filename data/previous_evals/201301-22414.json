   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class, even if you're not looking for an easy QR. Professor Frame will give you a lot more to think about than rote calculations.",
    "Perfect if you aren't a math fan and need an easy but interesting QR.",
    "Interesting math class for students who don't have a really deep math background. Definitely recommended.",
    "TAKE THIS!! Only those who haven't taken calc in high school and are frosh\/soph are eligible.Professor Frame may not reach the course next year, but if he does, it's a must-take, especially if you find math very challenging and need a QR for humanities-type students.The homework is VERY doable and tests are fair (and open note). I had to drop into micro economics because I just couldn't grasp the material but i did very well in this class and enjoyed.Professor Frame is always eager to help his students and make sure they succeed.As long as u put in the effort, you will be totally fine.",
    "This is an excellent class and Professor Frame is an incredibly kind and caring teacher. The material can be somewhat tricky and sometimes Frame doesn't explain them incredibly thoroughly. Though the midterms were very straightforward and fair, make sure to study for the final because it is much, much harder than his other tests. Overall, however, I would still recommend this for students who do not consider math to be their forte.",
    "Take this class. It's not a gut-bustingly difficult course, but you'll want to put the work into it because it's interesting. Also, Professor Frame may be the best professor you'll have, here.",
    "One word: excellent. I highly recommend this class and Professor Frame is an incredible teacher. Help is always there when needed and this has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. I really enjoyed it!!!",
    "I WOULD 100% RECOMMEND THE CLASS. If you get in, take it. I don't think you would regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Geometry of Nature to a fellow student, especially someone who isn't great at math but is looking for a QR. The material isn't too hard, and it's interesting. It's really awesome how many of the topics relate and connect, and this class is particularly great for people interested in arts and humanities. Professor Frame shows examples of things we study and calculate in examples of art. He also incorporates 'historical' accounts relating to different mathematicians. Each calculation has an apparent function and outcome which makes it less abstract than most math classes I've taken.",
    "Geometry of Nature is the perfect course for students who haven't been exposed to calculus and\/or have difficulties with arithmetic and mathematics. As a potential English\/Art major, math isn't exactly my fort\u00c3\u00a9, but this course was perfectly suited for me. I felt like it reinforced a lot of basic mathematic concepts that I learned in high school which would certainly be helpful if I choose to take any further math courses at Yale in a useful, easily to understand way. Moreover, the material is surprisingly thought-provoking, and Professor Frame makes it feel relevant to everyone, regardless of their academic interests. Professor Frame is also one of the kindest, humblest, and most gifted people I've ever met--I'd recommend any course taught by him in heartbeat."
