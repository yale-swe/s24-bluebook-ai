    "I honestly did not really understand what money laundering was until I took this course, but I'm so glad I do now. It opened my eyes to a whole new way of fighting terrorism and corruption. The class itself was great overall. The grad school students all brought so much experience and insight, it was really interesting to hear their thoughts. Professor King is also great, he's incredibly dedicated and engaging and has so much experience!",
    "Seminar style course covering counterterrorist financing and anti-money laundering. An absolutely phenomenal course with one of the greatest professors at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you are interested in its topic.",
    "Take this class even if you are not interested particularly in the topics. Prof. William is a rare find that will unleash your creative talent like no other professor. Take this course before you graduate.",
    "Absolutely incredible class. Each class is enjoyable and engaging.",
    "Great course and I would absolutely recommend to another student.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to another student. The material is very interesting and the class assignments push students to develop a variety of skills -- writing (op-ed's and a long paper), research, and public speaking.",
    "For those who are intrested in the topic I do recommend the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Counterterrorist financing is an exhaustive examination of the fight against financial crime, which is a cutting edge approach to fighting organized crime and terrorism.",
    "Interesting content, worth taking if you're interested in these types of issues. Structure can be lacking at times."

    "The course opened a line to a whole new profession that I had never considered before. While I knew I was interested in international security, I did not realize I could pursue that interest within the financial sector.",
    "I am an undergraduate, so this does not apply.",
    "I walked in knowing very little about the topic of anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing, and walked out with the desire to pursue a career in the field and the ability to do so.",
    "This course directly relates to my career in the US Army.",
    "This course is very relevant to anyone interested in the financial sector, security, or public service in general. Holistic approaches to counter terrorism is the best way to address the problem and this course allows students to explore one of the most underutilized aspects of CT.",
    "This course addresses a very important topic in U.S. national security, and it also has implications for the business community and other sectors.",
    "This course has helped me a lot in my discipline, i have learnt a lot and very happy that i have taken this class."
