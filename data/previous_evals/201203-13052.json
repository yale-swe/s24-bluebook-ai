    "If you want to learn about China, historical anthropology, and how both of those things have changed over time, take this class! It's not the most scintillating class experience since it's mostly a weekly two-hour lecture by Professor Siu, but the readings and concepts she introduces are so interesting and comprehensive that it's worth it. The final research proposal is pretty difficult if you've never written one before, so start well in advance!",
    "If you're looking for a place to consolidate some of your thinking on china and a space to write a research proposal, this is a great class for you."
