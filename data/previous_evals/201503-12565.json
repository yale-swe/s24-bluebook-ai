    "If you're taking this, you're most likely a Sociology major (we had two other majors in a class of ~20). The readings are decent but discussions were stifled by the professor (which he'll hopefully fix by next year). Some assignments are great (e.g. reviewing a senior thesis) while others are boring. In the end, you'll come out with a polished research project proposal so it's best if you have a small idea as to what field you want your thesis to be in (but if you don't, that's fine too).",
    "Definitely take this course if you want to build a comprehensive research project! Sociology majors pretty much have to take it, but if you are outside the major I would also suggest it. Make sure to go to the professor's office hours after class if you feel like you did not understand a certain research method that was taught. The class feels considerably short based on the amount of information that we are given so extending your learning outside of the classroom is key to really grasping any confusing information.",
    "Methods course. It works.",
    "take it if you want to think meticulously about a qualitative research design.",
    "As a sociology major, I didn't really have a choice whether or not to take this class, but I'm really glad that I did. By the end of the semester, I had completely changed the ways that I think about, construct, and analyze research. The course starts with a few weeks of pure epistemology (essentially an overview of the various schools of thought on how we know what we know\/whether we can truly know anything in real and absolute terms), which forms the basis for the rest of the class. You also learn about the principles of crafting your own research from a pretty theoretical perspective. After that, you go through the more practical stuff and various types of sociological research: ethnographic, comparative, historical, and quantitative. Each unit has readings and discussion both about the actual practice of research (how to conduct interviews, write unbiased surveys, protect participants' privacy, etc.) and examples of published research using each model. The use of actual research really helps you understand what type of question each type of research is suited to answering and gives you a sense of the nuances of the field. There really isn't that much work, and Mahler is a ridiculously easy grader. The main assignments are 4 reading responses, a midterm paper (mainly on the first third of the class concerning theory\/epistemology\/crafting research), 3 journals and a final research proposal. The research proposal is great as a set up for thesis-ing, and you write most of it throughout the semester as a part of the 3 journals (which also lets you get feedback!). Before you submit the final proposal, you also have the opportunity to present in class and discuss your project with other students (which seems daunting but is actually really helpful, and it's cool to see other people's projects). Professor Mahler is great, though you won't realize that until you're well into the course. He seems a little bumbling at first, but it's only because he's actually very aware and doesn't like to seem omniscient or controlling. He's really into letting the class discuss on equal terms and will absolutely take students' concerns seriously. Given the breadth of interests of the students in the class, it seemed a little difficult for him to tailor it to everyone's wishes, but he still did a pretty solid job. Overall, it's a great class and I'd highly recommend it to those who don't have to take it, as well as all the sociology majors who do!",
    "I think this class is very major-focused in that not everyone would want to take this class. I would recommend it to students interested in research and the social sciences.",
    "It's a fair class to take as a sociology major. It gives a nice overview of the different methods of conducting sociological research and the dos and don'ts of being a social researcher. I do however think the material could have been learned in a more efficient way, rather than through long readings and then limited class time to discuss.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in learning more about research methods and are pretty sure you want to do a thesis or research project. Plus, hanging out with sociology majors is pretty fun :)"
