   "comments": [
    "Strengths: breadth and depth of material, lab sessions that timed well with class lectures. By the end of the course I do feel competent to perform linear regression modeling, which was my major goal in taking the class.Weaknesses: unreasonably high work load, so many small assignments (three part problem sets with separate components, take home and in class exam components, group project\/presentation\/writeup) that somewhat difficult to keep trackAreas for improvement: streamlined assignments, more healthcare-related examples to make subject matter more applied",
    "I think this class is a very useful class and I've learned a lot from this course. There is a LOT of work indeed, but the homework is very helpful in understanding the material.",
    "strength: you could learn a lotweaknesses: too much homework and feel painful during study",
    "It's very helpful but too much work to do.",
    "We really learn something new, it is just too much workload.",
    "just so so",
    "This class was very time consuming, but it's definitely one of the classes I learned the most from. Final exam was quite difficult and covered information outside of homework. I think some problems don't offer any practical, real-life use other than practicing one's math skills.",
    "Overall, I think the course was developed\/fine-tuned and constantly changed as the semester progressed making it (I think) needlessly stressful on the students, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d venture to say on the TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as well. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that the excess homework assignments were the best way to test our knowledge of the material.In addition, I think the most unrealistic and unfortunate part of the course was the group assignment. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem that Applied Regression material is appropriate for the sort of piece-meal work that comes along with group projects. How can we learn if we're taking parts of a project that require understanding\/involvement in all parts? And how can it be efficient to have all students involved in all parts unless you make it an individual assignment? Even if all other aspects of the course (excess homework, disjointed testing, etc. ) stay the same I would strongly advocate for eliminating the group project. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more time consuming and stressful than if it were an individual assignment.I understand that things sometimes unexpectedly require a change of course, but I felt there were too many turns\/about-faces\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.essentially too may trials\/errors to make this class anywhere near good memory.",
    "This was the worst class I have ever take at Yale. Possibly the worst course I have ever taken period. The teacher was a horror. You could barely understand what the teacher was saying in class, she refused to answer questions and would say \"it is in the book\" look there. Linear regression is an essential part of learning biostatistics and I did learn, but I had to teach it all to myself by reading the book and the lab notes from last year. The TAs took the lab notes from last year and made them terrible. To the point where they would do half the problem and not show the result. This is a graduate program, we are not fighting for As. Most of us just want to learn the material. Soon into the course the professor said that neither she nor the TAs would respond the email questions. In all my years of school, that has never happened before. I think I once got her to answer a question and it ended up being the wrong answer. I truly suffered through this course. And I am happy it is over.",
    "more than 10 hours",
    "Overall, this course was very poorly taught. We covered too much material in too short of a time period. The amount of material may not have been a problem had the concepts been explained clearly and concisely, but this was definitely not the case.I learned the most from reading the text book and completing the homework assignments. All of the assignments (homeworks, take-home exams, final project) took longer than Dr. Zhou estimated they would take.Finally, the in-class exams were not well written (there were mistakes which effected how we should approach the questions) and some questions were not entirely fair as they covered material that we had only briefly touched upon in lecture and did not cover in a homework assignment.",
    "Strengths- Interesting contentThe TAs were WONDERFUL, especially Ryan! They were so helpful, responsive, and able to clarify the content.Good mix of theoretical and applied information.Weaknesses\/Improvements-Multiple changes made to course syllabus even though we signed a course agreement at the beginning of the semester. Changes often made without consulting students and expectations were unclear. For example, when we originally signed the course contract the syllabus said that we would be doing projects individually. Later in the course the professor decided to change it to a group project. It seems somewhat hypocritical that we signed a contract but the processor can change things in the syllabus without consulting students first.The professor talked about changing certain assignments without making it clear\/getting students hopes up. For example, the professor brought up in class that we may have either a take home final OR an in-class final exam. In the end, we had both, which is fine but I don't think it was appropriate to bring up having just the take home or the in class exam if we were in fact going to have both.Should give weekly homework assignments with less problems. The professor assigned homework problem sets randomly throughout the semester and the randomness made it hard to plan. Would be beneficial if we were consistently given homework problems each week--say assigned on Tuesday and due the following Tuesday.",
    "This is a very basic and important course in data analysis, which forms the basis for many more advanced stat courses. It is very useful by instructing the basic ideas, methods in linear statistical modelling. I learned so much from the lectures, textbook, homework and the final project. I have a chance to try handling data in real world. Maybe the workload is somewhat heavier than others, but I think it is still worth devoting time and energy because I can get a good handling of the theoretical knowledge as well as robust practice from it.",
    "Strength: the material in the course is useful.Weekness: the course workload is extremely heavy.",
    "I learned so much from this course but it was gruelling and challenging and possibly catered too much to those with biostatistics as their major. I however gained a lot of knowledge from it. Weaknesses were ever changing syllabus and also lack of support from the professor and TAs for non-biostats students.",
    "Strengths: absolutely essential topics to know, instruction in SAS programmingWeaknesses: terrible instructor, mediocre TAs",
    "The slides are good summaries to the knowledge in the textbook.Well organized homeworks and project really let us learnt a lot from this course.",
    "This is not a well taught course at all. The materials are organized but it is all about self-learning. The class is extremely dry and not helpful at all. I learned everything from doing homework, reading the textbook, and using other resources online. The homework and labs are useful, but I honestly did not learn much beyond what was taught in Biostatistics I and II.",
    "I gain a lot of knowledge and I am familiar with SAS now",
    "This class is very important because it teaches us practical tools to modeling. But this class has too much homework.",
    "There is a considerable amount of information covered in this course, and I did learn a lot from the course. However, all of this learning was self-guided. The classes were terrible and it was very clear that the professor had not gone over the slides before class. The problem sets took 10-15 hours on average to complete, and there were way too many additional assignments (two in-class midterms, two take-home midterms, an in-class presentation, and a 10-page paper group project). In an \"attempt\" to make things easier, the project was made into a group project last minute, but in fact this made our lives much more difficult because we now had to coordinate between 3 other people. All in all, this was a terrible class. Although I did walk away from it with a solid foundation, it was because I had read the $250 book we were required to buy. The TAs did a good job - Ryan was great. And the lab sessions were really helpful, but the classes themselves were horribly taught and the amount of information covered in each class was very large so it was hard to keep up. The final project was a good idea because it did make us synthesize the information we had learned, but it should have been independent. The midterms should have been made into either take-home or in-class but not both because this took way too much time to complete without adding much benefit. This class took probably 4 times as much work each week as the other classes I was taking because I not only had to learn the information on my own but also had to complete an extremely lengthy problem set. This class needs a considerable amount of work.",
    "Very solid course! I have learnt a lot.However, the workload is a little too much. It seems a lot of repeated work for homework and exams.",
    "The course load was much greater compared to the other classes.The textbook was very useful.",
    "too much homework",
    "This course was a terrible experience. The professor is very nice but her response to the concerns of her students is not receptive. The workload was excessive. No student feedback was taken into account. The material was not well covered. If we had slowed down or had fewer assignments, I think it would've been better for gaining some understanding of the material in the class. In the future it would also be better if there was more examples and a better breakdown of material and also if TA office hours were held with sufficient time to get to the homework. Also, a lab setting for discussion section would be better\/more useful. It was difficult to learn anything from the sections because of the auditorium style.",
    "This course has so much workload. I cannot feel that I was paid back. Some of the homework is redundant and the workload is sooooo much!",
    "On one hand, I definitely learned a lot about linear regression analysis, but on the other hand, this course took up way too much time. I sometimes had to sacrifice work in other classes in order to make sure I would pass this class.",
    "Strength:-Textbook - textbook was what helped me to learn the material and understand the concepts-Group project were helpful to learn the real-life data analysisWeakness:-Lectures that are not very explanatory-homework schedule is not flexible (basically forced to spend 15-20 hours on homework each week). Because of this course, it was very difficult to spend time on the other courses.-Two-part exams and group project. Please give student only one-part exam and group project. In addition to very time-consuming weekly homework, we were given two-parts in-class and take-home exams, and paper and presentation for group project. Even though they are based on the same material, having additional assignment adds stress to students' busy schedule, especially toward the end of semester. Please understand that students take other courses.",
    "I think that while I did learn a lot in this class, the workload was excessive and took away from my other courses. I feel like it was taught to the biostats students, and as a non-biostats doctoral student who was required to take the class I felt like some of the 'real life' application was lost on me.",
    "Strengths: Thorough study of regressionWeakness: No real \"applied\" regression, way too much subject matter that was taught which weren't even put to use, homeworks did not cover a good portion of what was covered in exams, assignments were too many and overwhelming."

    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0I have to commend Teresa on taking on teaching this difficult course her first time teaching at YSPH. It can't have been easy, given the material, and the huge class size! She was very responsive to the student's needs\/requests\/demands and very accessible.The first day of class she handed out a contract with the syllabus that students had to sign, and she seemed very strict about the word of the syllabus itself. But asthe course went on, she made so many changes to the syllabus, lecture schedule, assignments, and exams (even while in progress) that it was difficult to follow! The assignments became more complicated, not less. In the future, it would be better to have a clearly laid out plan with assignments from the get-go...and very clearly written exams that test on the material we have learned in class.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Dr. Zhou is very nice and is very helpful helping students. Her lectures are not very useful though. I learned more from the labs when we actually did something. I hope her lectures could explain concepts\/rationales in an easier way, instead of dumping big formulas from the book.Dr. Zhou just started her career at Yale so I hope students can give her more time to adjust to the course styles at Yale. There may be complains for this class, but I think she has been trying hard to make us feel better. I wish her best luck at Yale :)",

    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Prof. Zhou is a responsible and kind lady. She tried hard to teach well. However, it's difficult to understand things she taught in class. I always had to spend lots of time after class to teach myself.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the instructor was horrible, she was just not responsive\/tuned-in with how the course structure was or wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t working.I appreciate that the course work should be challenging, but I don't think the way the course was run really encouraged us to be challenged as much as it did to be frustrated.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The worse teacher I have ever had at Yale. Possibly the worst teacher ever. As stated above if you asked her a question she would say look in the book. The one time she did answer my question it was the wrong answer. You had to fend for yourself. Learning linear regression would have been better if I didn't bother going to lecture or asking questions because it just resulted in aggravation. At least when I read the book, I mainly understood without the aggravation.For the midterm, she gave a take home and an in class exam. And for the final she said she would not do both again. She lied, and for the final we did have both a take home and a final exam and then a presentation and a 10 page paper due the next week. The project was supposed to be made easier by putting it in a group, but it is very difficult to do SAS analysis in a group and even harder when there are no native speakers of English in your group. So really for me, the group project was harder than an individual project.She was never prepared for lecture. It seemed like she was trying to figure out the slides when she was standing up in front of the class. She used the slides from the previous year which it did not seem like she looked at until she presented them.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The lecture notes are not well organized. The homework is tedious. Her instruction is not very useful.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0This course was very poorly taught. Dr. Zhou seemed to be using lecture materials that were not her own which might not have been a problem had she rehearsed her lecture ahead of time!Unfortunately she did not come to class prepared and there were times when she was unable to explain the material on the lecture slides. In those instances she would simply stop her explanation and tell students to read about it in the book instead.I am sure Dr. Zhou is a very accomplished researcher, however I am astounded that an institution like Yale would hire an individual as a professor only because of his\/her research capabilities and not assess teaching skills prior to hiring. I think Dr. Zhou has the potential to be a good teacher but she has much work to do to get there.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Strengths- Slides were fairly comprehensive though occasionally there were errors on the slides.Weaknesses- Overall lecture style could be improved. Often, felt like most of the slides were from the textbook. Would be helpful to do more example problems in class.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Prof. Zhou devotes much time and energy to this course. Although the workload is somewhat heavy(we have exams, homework and final project), but I think it's really worth the time and energy invested. Maybe Prof. Zhou should reduce the workload a bit next year.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Strength: responsible.Weekeness: the presentation part of the lecture is very hard to understand.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Professor Zhou's strengths is that she teaches at a very high level and I learned a lot. She could explain concepts more fully.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0I have waited so long for this moment, to finally be able to express my sheer and utter frustration with this course, to release the pent up rage in my chest that has been suffocating me for the past few months, and, yet, now that the moment is here, I am, almost nearly, at a loss for words. To put it simply, this class was hell. And it was not that the material was impossible to understand, no, that was not the case at all; in fact, I think that the main problem stems from the very opposite of that. This course was supposed to be straightforward. It is, after all, \"applied\". The textbook is incredibly straightforward. The homework problems are exceedingly straightforward. And I believe that it is because of these things that the professor decided to punish us. The weekly homework was torturous, not because I did not know how to do any of the problems, but simply because there was just so much of it. There were two midterms, each with an in-class and take-home portion, in which the professor did absolutely everything she could to make sure there were points deducted. A group final project ate up hour after hour, day after day, and then week after week. One fundamental problem with this class is that it takes precedence over all other classes simply because of the insane amount of time that it takes to complete any one assignment. The professor takes pleasure in our pain. She finds ways to take off points over the tiniest details that would never even be considered in another class. She questions us on things entirely unnecessary and irrelevant in exams. She does not understand the purpose of teaching. She is not a good instructor.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The professor is very patient and nice to students, and she asked for students' feedbacks througout the semester, which shows a lot of cares for us. But it is better if her oral english could be inproved :P",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0She really needs to learn how to teach. Reading straight from slides is not teaching. I do not think she has a solid grasp of the material. Every time when students ask her questions, she would refer us to the textbook, even a simple question such as a hypothesis test. Seriously? You are the professor and you should know the answer to these questions. In addition, I am sure she will not be able to explain most of the concept clearly if we converse in her native language.I also notice that most of the slides are from other people. She should site her source.The textbook can \"teach\" better than she does.I can not tell the difference between prepared and unprepared lectures. She mentioned in class once that she was unable to adequately prepare the lecture for that day due to the snowstorm, so she brought the textbook with her to class just in case. That lecture turned out to be the same as any other lectures.Some exam questions are not reflective of the materials learned in class.She is the worst instructor I have encountered at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0nice",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0If the instructor could provide less contents in each class, slow down the speed, and give more examples in this class, this class would be better.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Dr. Zhou seemed indifferent to teaching this class. When she taught, it was evident that she had not taken the time to go through the slides prior to class so that she was often confused by what was on the slide and skipped over them. She also covered a lot of information each day without taking time to go into any one subject in depth. Many students stopped going to class because they were not getting anything out of it. She was also completely unreceptive to students. I had a few experiences of my own where she did not respond to requests or refused to give me points back on a midterm because \"I was doing fine in the class.\" I interpreted this to mean that she was not willing to take the few extra minutes to change my grade in her gradebook. And I heard of other experiences from friends where she refused to answer questions online, making excuses like \"it's not fair to your classmates that I am giving you more attention.\" This is a terrible approach for a professor. I would really advise her to improve her teaching and mentoring skills as she currently lacks both.",

The instructor listened to student concerns but did not adapt the course to what students were asking for. Teaching style was also very difficult to follow. It was very fast paced.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0The professor really tried to give students a nice talk, however, sometimes she cannot explain the concept very well. And she just read her slides without looking at the students. With her slides, we can self-teach without being in the class, because she did not tell us anything else except the slides.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Needs to find a way to decrease the amount of work! I feel like many students tried to express the need for a lighter work load, but these requests weren't taken seriously.",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0Strength: Willingness to teach students the material",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0I think that Dr. Zhou could have been a little clearer upfront about her expectations of the students, for example the syllabus changed several times over the course of the semester. I realize that it is a new class for her and she is working out some kinks, but I was often unclear of how many exams we would have, the format, etc. I also wish she would have been more responsive to students, as the TAs seemed overworked\/unprepared and often gave us incorrect\/confusing answers to our questions re: the homework. I appreciated that mid way through the course there was more SAS-examples incorporated, because initially I was concerned that the class was too theoretical and I was interested in the applied side, as a non-biostats student. Maybe instead of the 'lab' section in the auditorium, an actual lab section at 47 would have been useful, to run through some examples and maybe get some SAS code that could then be used for the homeworks. I also thought that the homework assignments were incredibly long and took a lot more time\/energy compared to homeworks for other classes (and were worth a smaller percentage of our grade, for that matter)",
    "Instructor: Bingqing Zhou \u00a0She definitely tried to cover all the material, but I think that is impossible for a subject this big, and should have focused more on the applied aspect of regression. I did like that there was some separation of expectations for biostats and non biostats students, but in the end it seemed to not have mattered."

They were often unprepared to answer questions about the homework, I noticed that there were mistakes on some of the homework 'solutions' that were posted. I think the lab sections could have been more productive, as I mentioned above maybe having actual section in the computer lab would have been beneficial and engaged the students more, as well as taught us to understand the code and output. Maybe one TA could have done SAS and the other R, and students could choose which to attend. Ultimately for a class as big as ours I think we could have benefited from another TA (perhaps one who had taught the class before who was familiar with the material).",
    "TAs were helpful in the beginning and were the most helpful in understanding homeworks, but as the course went on, they seemed more detached and not very engaged in instructing or giving proper feedback to the instructor when students had complaints."

   "comments": [
    "This is a course in linear regression modeling, which covers related basic theory, SAS programming, and modeling techniques. By the end of this course, you will be able to generate a model from raw data, including all diagnostic and remedial measures. Take this course if you have a specific interest in this topic- otherwise it is probably too intense and workload-heavy!I would recommend this course to another student ONLY if some of the above issues were resolved.",
    "I don't regret taking this class. I'd recommend the class to anyone who wants to learn model-building but I'd also warn them the course load. Overall I have learned a lot :)",
    "Maybe not. Just a lot of work to do and feel painful sometimes.",
    "great course. recommend if have much time",
    "Take it anyway. I believe you could learn something new and useful.",
    "ok, but too much exam, homework, not like in graduate school",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. They can learn a lot from it.",
    "If this course is not a requirement I would certainly not recommend it as currently structured, as I don't think it's ultimately conducive to learning much.",
    "Would not recommend. Worst class in the biostats department at Yale. Possibly the worst most frustrating class I have ever taken.",
    "No, if you don't have to take this class, don't take it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student given the poor quality of the lectures.",
    "Course about applied linear regression. The content is fundamental for statistics, but I would not recommend taking this particular course. I did not think the lectures were particularly helpful to learn the content and I had to learn most content from book. So, if a fellow student purchased the textbook, he\/she could probably learn a lot of the content without having to actually take the course.",
    "This is a very basic and important course in data analysis, which forms the basis for many more advanced stat courses. It is very useful by instructing the basic ideas, methods in linear statistical modelling. Also we learned how to use SAS to perform basic regression analysis on real data. I learned so much from the lectures, lab sessions, textbook, homework and the final project. Besides theoretical development, I have a chance to try handling data in real world. Maybe the workload is somewhat heavier than others this year, but I think it is still worth devoting time and energy because you can get a good handling of the theoretical knowledge as well as robust practice from it.",
    "The course material is definitely interesting, but the lecturer could have done a better job in explaining everything, so the students wouldn't feel so frustrated after class. I would recommend this course because it is useful, and I would also mention it is heavy. I feel it is a little necessary to do all those homeworks, but since the content was not introduced in theclass clear enough, I pretty much need to study on my own for many hours, before I am really to do homework.",
    "Useful but difficult. Yes, I would recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student provided it would not be taught by the current instructor.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to other students. Because we really learnt things from it.",
    "I would not recommend it to other students becasue it is overloaded.",
    "Don't take this course unless you are required to!It is work heavy and requires self-learning. If you are not skilled at self-learning, grab a friend to take the course with you so you are not alone at suffering through this painful course. If neither is an option, just don't take it.",
    "Yes. We can learn a lot of things, but this course has too many homework and exams",
    "I would recommend this class due to applied regression is very important in our future work, but students who want to take this class should be aware of the heavy workload of this class.",
    "This is a required course for BIS students and CDE doctoral students, so many of you will probably not have a choice when it comes to taking this course. If you do have a choice, I would suggest you not take this course and just buy the book if you want to learn linear regression. That said, if you have to take the course, I would still recommend you buy the book and learn it on your own. You will not learn anything by attending class.",
    "Recommend. The course is very applicable and useful for conducting research and data analysis independently.",
    "good except too much homework and exam",
    "I would not take this class unless you have to. If so, do not take this class with this professor. Terrible experience. Tremendous workload assigned. Lessons aren't clear. Unless you have a very strong TF, it will be difficult to do well in this class. Taught 100% for BIS students.",
    "Maybe. This is a very useful course, however, it has too much workload.",
    "If the workload were to decrease, I would recommend this course, otherwise I woudn't.",
    "Not recommended if a student takes more than 2 courses or have lots of time. I learned the material because I put a large amount of time and effort to keep up with course. It was a not an efficient way of learning.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you have to take it (for qualifying exams or your course requirements). I do think I learned a lot, but all my other course work suffered as did my other commitments (TA-ing, research etc.)",
    "I would not recommend this to a fellow student unless they enjoy hours of grueling coursework and self-study on top of the workload. This course needs to be restructured."
