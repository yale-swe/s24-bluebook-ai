    "I would describe Mathematics 115 09 by stating that it is a comprehensive review on Calculus BC, with a few added elements. But do not think that it will be easy if you took Calculus BC in high school, and that you should definitely move up to Math 120. It adds many concepts that you may not have learned in Calc BC, and it also requires you to know the Calc BC concepts in greater depth. I would definitely recommend this course because walking out of it, I feel accomplished and feel as if I have a great grasp on the Math 115 math concepts. I received a great preparation for Math 120. In addition, if you have the opportunity, I highly recommend taking the class with Bogdan Vioraneau.",
    "Math 115 is the equivalent to AP BC Calculus. If you have taken that (and gotten a 5), I recommend that you take Math 120, because otherwise you will find yourself frustrated that you already know everything (like me). If you do take Math 115, take it with Bogdan because he's da bomb.",
    "I would not recommend it until the curriculum is fixed and the concepts are more clearly explained in the textbook and by the professors.",
    "I'll be blunt: Bogdan's section was the single best Calc 115 class this semester. I recommend him not only for his effective teaching in class but also his unconditional willingness to meet with you during office hours. It is truly wonderful that he is willing and excited to go over problem sets or concepts with you until you understand them. He also compiles infinitely helpful review sheets for his students before exams and e-mails them to everyone. His review sessions were frequented by many people who were not even in his class and by the end of the year at least ten students had transferred into the class (I don't think the department would let him take anymore otherwise he would have welcomed more). Definitely a teacher you want.",
    "It's a continuation of Math 112. It is somehard material dealing with integrals, series and convergences. It would good to have a strong knowledge of limits and derivatives before taking this class.",
    "This class is a lot of work if you haven't take BC calc before. Its manageable though and a lot of majors require it.",
    "Math 115 is about solving integrals. We learned different methods to do this and applications. I would recommend this class to another student if you are willing to take the time to learn and seek help when you don't understand something because each chapter builds off the previous ones.",
    "Generally people do not really enjoy this class, as it is sort of a routine for anybody with little background in calculus to take it and get the QR requirement. But if you decide to take Math 115, take it with Bogdan Vioreanu: he's an amazing teacher, probably the best in this class, extremely friendly and helpful. He was the only reason I liked the class. The workload is manageable; although sometimes it's annoying that the finals are such a big part of your grade.",
    "Math 115 is basically high school Calculus BC. The difference is that the concepts that are taught in class are only the foundation for the homework problems and exams. This encouraged students to think creatively and apply problem solving skills in the homework and exams. I would recommend Math 115 if the student is interested in math, needs a distributional requirement, or a preprofessional program requirement. It was a great class.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not too hard and not too simple. It is a fun math class- but also depends heavily on the professor.",
    "I recommend math 115 as it is structured to understand the concepts and not memorize certain problems. This is very helpful for success on the tests.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone with a background in Calculus BC. Having a background in just AB would help for the first third of the year, but after that, everything is a little bit too fast paced for someone who hasnt seen any of that material before.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 (particularly with Bogdan) for anyone with a need or desire to learn calculus up to multivariable. Infinite series, polar and parametric calculus, elementary and more difficult integration are all covered.",
    "Math 115 is hard and the work load is intense. If the student is looking for a challenge, I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, even if they don't need this particular credit, because the material covered in this course is quite basic and can be very useful depending on what they want to study in the future.",
    "I would recommend it to one who wishes to understand how calculus works and even how the world works a little bit. I really gained a better understanding of that by taking this class.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 to a student who has taken BC calculus in high school. I took AB and was very successful in that and on the AP test. I had a difficult time in 115 but it was a valuable learning experience for me and I had to push my mathematics skills to their limits."
