   "comments": [
    "Good introductory course.",
    "I would recommend learning german.",
    "German 120 is a good course. Expect a lot of vocab and grammar. Don't put off studying for the tests and don't let yourself fall behind; even though it's a language, concepts build on one another as if it were a math course. I would recommend this course, but with a few reservations.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to do minimal work and get a good grade without learning much German. Yes, it is very nice to get an easy A, but now that I look back on the course I realize I haven't improved my German communication skills, only grammar. The teacher failed to force students to speak in German and repeatedly reverted back to speaking in English himself!",
    "This class is a good continuation of L1. The tests are every other week, so the workload and study time fluctuates between weeks.",
    "A well-rounded look at the German language and culture.",
    "The introductory German courses at Yale are a lot less work intensive, actually, than other intro languages (Romance languages) so far as I can tell. In German 110 this year, we spent much more time than necessary on tedious busy work. But I did little homework at all this semester in German 120. Overall, I learned a lot however. More conversational practice would be great. Jan is such a great teacher! He is laid back, but expects us to learn, doesn't mind when you make a mistake, and displays a kind of childlike joy to be able to teach us something new. He's enthusiastic, funny, and really fun to be around. Plans really fun, great activities for us to do in class, and sends us fantastic worksheets for each test that help us learn. Take it with Jan if he teaches again!",
    "Yes."
