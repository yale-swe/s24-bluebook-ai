    "a framework for video art. a method of thinking that encapsulates different artistic mediums",
    "I learned a lot about the role of intention in performance work, how to build a wall (literally), and respecting the effort of others.",
    "I learnt to experiment with a new artistic medium that I did not have much experience with before. I also learnt to take risks in developing projects and ideas that weren't always full formulated",
    "I learned about video art, which was previously mostly unknown to me. It was good to see possibilities, and to be empowered to make things."

   "comments": [
    "The course was incredibly fun and engaging. I felt excited by the work we viewed, the work of the other students, and my own. That said, at times it was very disorganized.",
    "strength: discussions, homework, workshops. weakness: the lack of a solid technical basis.",
    "The artist visit was fantastic, would love to have more of that. Freeform prompts are excellent. Organization is where this course fell through. I think Sandra is used to leading classes with fewer students. Crit's always ran over time and it was difficult to get to everyone's work even given three days of critting. I took this class before when it only have 4 students and it was amazing. Lot of time really digging into our work. Its harder with 11 students, but I think Sandra will figure it out next time.",
    "We spent so much time critiquing each others work in class. While I enjoyed getting to see what other people were doing and making, class was not always very engaging when it became an endless stream of crits.",
    "I wish that this course had a more critical video. I liked watching the work of video straits but I wish we discussed more critically why their work is good and celebrated."

    "I'd recommend it to any student artist, especially those interested in filmmaking. It was very freeing and overall a lot of fun.",
    "for all interested in exploring alternative frameworks of art",
    "YES. Take anything that Sandra teaches. she is very positive in critique but still pushes you in good directions by picking out the interesting bits in your work.",
    "Yes, this was a great introductory art class",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes, I would! An enjoyable intro to video art for someone who has never done it before. I could see however how it could be a little bit slow or not deep enough for someone with more experience.",
    "Sandra is wonderful and this course is fun. Good to shake things up a bit, and to introduce you to video in a way that is expansive rather than restrictive."
