    "A film is watched each week from a specific Latin American culture, and a student gives a presentation about the film and country for Monday's lecture, and the professor speaks on Wednesday's lecture. Five film critiques are written for the semester with a midterm and final project. Yes I would recommend this course because it improves one's Spanish while also giving a student a chance to watch a diverse array of films and learn about Latin American culture and history and how film was connected throughout. A powerful course in learning about matters of social justice and world issues.",
    "Professor Tortora is incredibly sweet and many of the movies or fun to watch, but you won't learn all that much about film or history, though you will be taught some of both. You'll watch a few influential movies, a bunch of contemporary ones that are mostly just decent, and then have very basic discussions about what happened in each movie. The professor's knowledge about the film industry and her ability to get fim-makers to come talk to the class are wonderful, but I don't think I got that much out of the class.",
    "This class is great at times, but not so great at others. The class is set up so that one student does a presentation on a Spanish film on Mondays, then we learn about another film on Wednesdays. I watched many of the films but not all of them, and most were okay. More well-known movies should have been shown that were not shown, like Motorcycle Diaries, although she did show Amores Perros (for you movie buffs who know what I'm talking about). Either way, the course was okay. I wasn't excited for it, but it seemed easy. Overall though, it's not that easy, and she grades much harder than shedoes when she teaches L5 Conversational.",
    "Yes, take it! Spanish in film is a great class. The films are interesting and the professor is the best! The class is not difficult, although there are a number of short papers. The final paper or project is intensive, but great fun! So take it! It is a great class!",
    "Good class, take it.",
    "Great class! Once you've reached a good level of spanish and you are comfortable speaking\/writing, this class is interesting and not hard. there are a few essays but mainly you just watch movies. the teacher is also great",
    "This class is composed of two parts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the movie aspect and the history aspect. The movie aspect is incredible and makes the course totally worth it. Students get to watch Spanish movies from many different countries and time periods; the in-class discussions then supplement the film-watching. The history aspect from the lectures is interesting enough though certainly not the best part of the class. I thought that this was an excellent class for me to maintain my Spanish skills, though there is definitely more of an emphasis on listening than on writing, reading, or speaking. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wishes to take a fun class to keep up their Spanish."
