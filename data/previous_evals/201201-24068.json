    "I'm guessing this course won't be taught again, which is sad, because it was unbelievable.LOVED THIS COURSE SO MUCH. The readings were so engaging every week, and Prof Ramirez (Jesse) was great about engaging us on so many different levels, as we had to actually experience all the different mediums we were talking about. The discussions were always engaging, everyone in the class seemed like they really wanted to be there, and each week tied into the one before it. SO GOOD.",
    "This class provides the an open environment to deep contemplation about our technological world, how it has developed in the past and has shaped our culture, and finally what we should look forward too in the future.",
    "This has been one of the three best courses I've taken at Yale. I really enjoyed the material, but more importantly, the way it was presented and discussed. Jesse's selection of the texts we read each week let us see the ideological context of each film or novel (or graphic novel, or game) we studied. The students were also a great group, and discussion was lively and thoughtful each week. I often found myself thinking about the class themes outside of class, applying what we learned in class to my everyday life. My only complaint is that I didn't know how I was doing throughout the course because of the limited feedback on the content of my writing and no actual grades for any of the assignments. Otherwise, it's been a great experience. I don't think Jesse is teaching this again in the future, but if this class does end up offered, TAKE IT.",
    "Take it! You'll explore topics that aren't covered in any other Yale class. This has been one of my favorite classes- not only is it outside the box in content, the format and assignments are also very creative and unique.",
    "This class was awesome. Do it.",
    "Sweet class, just as awesome as it sounds like.",
    "This course made me look at our world a different way. It took a unique, humanities-based perspective on looking at the way technology exists in our world and influences the way we operate. Readings ranged from The Matrix to apocalyptic fiction to media theorists. So informative, so interesting, so good. This should be a yearly course.",
    "An excellent course for those interested in understanding our current technological moment, our moment's history and its future. For Yale, this course is ahead of its time. The professor is great and takes feedback seriously. You will get out what you put in; the class demands your participation."
