    "Definitely recommend if you're interested in the material and have some background in PET imaging.",
    "If you are interested in PET modeling or an understanding of tracer kinetics, this is a great class.",

I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in PET modeling& imaging."

    "I learned a remarkable amount about the topic from this class. Easily the most thorough understanding of a topic that I've gotten from any class here.",
    "Helps me to better understand PET modeling, why one models, the limitations of models, etc.",
    "Before taking this course, I was often confused with some concepts in PET modeling although I use them everyday. After this course, many concepts are made clear to me and would definitely contribute to the background part of my dissertation. It also sets an essential foundation for my qualification exam next fall."
