   "comments": [
    "You should absolutely take it, regardless of your level of experience with philosophy, politics, or IR. Pablo is a boss. And you'll learn so much and read so many cool things. Very manageable workload, god i wish i could take this every semester...",
    "If you into international political thought this is for you. Everyone who is into it really liked the readings, the professor is SUPER nice and very cool. That said, if you are not into really theory-based classes, this course will be confusing and hard to follow. If you are taking it for the writing credit, then perhaps there are less painful courses. However, Kalmanovitz really makes you overall like the class, even if you absolutely hate the material.",
    "Yep! This was my first course in political philosophy, and I got a lot out of it. If you have seen the material a million times before it might not be worth it though.",
    "This class is a truly hidden gut. No one looking for a gut would normally choose a class with a title like International Political Thought, but all it is is three papers of 5-7 pages. No final, no section. In class, most of the time is lectures where you just copy down what's written on his power point (and do copy it down, the slides aren't online and the info is extremely handy when writing the papers), and the rest is group discussion where it's easy to get by not having done the readings. And to top it off, I actually enjoy political philosophy, so the readings and discussions were interesting to me. An easy and interesting gut, doesn't get much better than that.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "I would say if you have an interest in the material and see thinkers you'd like to read in the syllabus, definitely take this class. There is a fair amount of reading and the papers can be more difficult than expected but it is otherwise low on work. I'd suggest writing physical notes when reading to anticipate working on the papers- all the readings are online and it can be difficult when writing a paper to remember what you thought when reading.",
    "I would recommend International Political Thought to anyone interested in the more nuanced aspects of political philosophy. I think the course's inherent strength is its balance of abstraction and application. The connections drawn to \"current\" issues never felt forced, nor did the later weeks (in which we explicitly talked about contemporary politics) sacrifice a nuance in thinking. A wonderful, forgotten course!",
    "Amazing. I can't believe it's not a seminar. Take this class. Seriously... Take this class"
