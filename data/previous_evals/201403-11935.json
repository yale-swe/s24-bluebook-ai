    "I feel that SPAN 130 is a good intersection between review of Spanish grammar and vocabulary and applying these skills. I would recommend this course to another student; it greatly helped me refine my Spanish skills.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 130 to another student. It is a fast moving course that covers a lot of different grammatical concepts, but it is not overwhelming or too time-consuming. Professor Mayer is very nice and approachable; she is also a very fair grader.",
    "The course is very challenging if you are placed in the right level. It is a lot of work all the time but is worth it. I would recommend it",
    "SPAN 130 01 presented some new grammar topics, while also reviewing things I knew but emphasized exceptions and irregulars-things you might not remember from the first time you learned the topic. You are constantly using the language in this course, and will definitely see your speaking ability improve during the semester. I would recommend this course because it really helps make you more comfortable and fluid using the language."
