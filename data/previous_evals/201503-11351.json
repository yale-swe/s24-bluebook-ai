   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a broader knowledge of the history of life on Earth. Professor Buss' lectures are wonderful; he clearly puts in a lot of effort into making them and it shows. There were many times I laughed out loud! However, be prepared to write a paper worth a lot of your final grade that does not really pertain to this class, using very outdated evolution stimulation software. This was really frustrating.",
    "Bio 104 is one of the best intro modules. There is an intimidating research project, but I did not feel it was that bad. The topic is really interesting, and the reading assignments and weekly quizzes are not meant to trip you up at all-only help you.",
    "Interesting! Dumb project though. The material in lecture is great!",
    "I would recommend BIOL 104 to any student interested in testing the waters of evolutionary biology.",
    "This class is good to take if you enjoy computers - I know that sounds odd, but 95% of the time you will spend working on this class you'll spend doing repetitive evolution simulators. It makes for easy homework, but expect it to be mind-numbing and tedious. Since the homework is only tangentially related to the concepts presented in class, be prepared to stay on top of learning the material yourself. If you need reinforcement via homework to learn the material, this is not the class for you. By the way, did I mention the evolution simulators? I'll mention them again. They will be your entire life. They will consume you.",
    "If you're already this far into the sequence, do finish it! Biol 104 is a great end to what can be a tough sequence, and very worth taking. It tends to be a lot of work, especially under Professor Buss who rightly thinks that even science students need to learn how to write, but he is also a great professor, and fun to watch and listen to in the classroom. You'll get a great deal of practice thinking about scientific experiments and get to run one yourself (on your computer, so don't freak out), and there's a lot of really interesting facts about snails, dating, and death to learn. I wholeheartedly recommend this course.",
    "BIOL 104 is work. A lot more work than the other modules. You must do everything and do it all on time. Going to lecture was not as interesting as it should have been. A lot of people skipped the lectures because you couldn't really learn from a PowerPoint with just pictures. I wouldn't recommend BIOL 104 unless you like the material and are willing to put in the time and effort. If you can place out of it, do it. If you like EEB or like to do a lot of work, then go for it. If you're an auditory learner, go for it. Otherwise, another class with a SC credit is better.",
    "No",
    "Lectures go by quickly because Leo Buss makes them enjoyable with his jokes and ridiculous comments. Make sure you start on the paper early; it can get tedious to write.",
    "My favorite of the Bio modules and a great intro to evolutionary biology.",
    "This was easily my favorite bio module. The lectures were fantastic (the worst one, oddly, was the first one), and Buss is the most awesomely cynical guy I've ever seen. Section, on the other hand, was pretty awful. There were a couple where we split into groups that went ok, and another that wasn't a section at all but a field trip (which was great). And be aware that the final project is big and rather strictly graded. Not nearly as rewarding as the lecture was.",
    "Required for all bio majors. The material itself is mind numbing and the project is worth a whopping 45%.",
    "Bio 104 is different than the other 4 modules in that a lot of grade is paper focused instead of weekly quiz focused. It also is more like an Earth Science class rather than what you would imagine to be a typical biology section.",
    "BIOL 104 is an interesting class with compelling lectures about topics I haven't really learned about in other courses. It's refreshing to have a less technically focused class in the biology modules.",
    "I would recommend the course if it's required for your major, but otherwise there are probably other classes that would be more interesting and fun in the same field.",
    "This course was pretty good overall. Leo Buss is a very engaging and entertaining lecturer. There is a final project paper that can seem very daunting and was definitely challenging.",
    "You know you need to take it to get to the cooler biology classes. Just do it, make sure your paper is in shape, and all will be well.",
    "I would not take Bio 104 unless you needed it for premed. The subject matter was not particularly interesting and the course itself did not dig below surface level information. There was a lot of memorization and regurgitation that made the learning process a bit less fulfilling.",
    "BIOL 104 is a great course. It's really interesting, and the professor is really engaging. The lectures are detailed, but the lecture study guides give them structure. The amount of homework is fair, and the final project is a good way to practice writing a scientific paper.",
    "Learn a lot of cool things about Earth's history and evolution. Some of the work (there's a good bit) feels tedious but turns out doing it helps you for the weekly in-section quiz (which isn't bad at all) and also for the exam. Throughout the semester you work towards a final project in evolutionary simulation in one of three simulators that you've learned how to use. They're really fun to play around with. I haven't felt this excited about evolutionary biology since I learned what evolution was. Prof. Buss is really engaging and [insert clich here because I don't know how to express how interesting his teaching style is]! Surjit Chandhoke is wonderful also.",
    "The materials of this course were very interesting, but I was also quite surprised at how boring the lectures were. Without the help from study guides, which were extremely useful for this course, I wouldn't know what prof. Buss talked about in the lecture. Most of his slides were pictures. Biol 104 was very different from the other three biology intro courses. Reading the study guides before and after the lecture would help a lot.",
    "The course material is fascinating and the lectures are very engaging. A warning: the workload is pretty heavy and the final paper time-consuming.",
    "This course will give you a great base knowledge of evolutionary biology. The reading supplements the class well and the outlines given for each lecture are very helpful. I recommend this course and the entire bio series!",
    "As seen from the other intro bio sequences, the course is very well structured and planned out. Leo and Surjit both obviously care very much about making the class a good experience for everyone. It's just that with both a final paper and a final exam, it gets a bit too much for a half credit class I think. The essay is definitely added work and I know some people put an unreasonable amount of thought and time into it for a half credit class. It's not horrible though because sending in multiple drafts and getting feedback to improve ensures that you know how to do well. I appreciate the quizzes - they're a good way to keep on top of the class material without stressing too much because they're easy. Like REALLY easy. I also really appreciated the tour of the Peabody museum.The class material itself is also very interesting since it's pretty different from all the other bio sequences. You learn surprisingly a lot about geology and the class starts all the way back from the big bang. Loved it.",
    "No, because I feel that although it was an introductory course, I don't feel like I came out of the class with a full understanding of the overview of evolutionary biology. I feel like if the course had been taught in a more clear, chronological order, the material would have been easier to comprehend.",
    "Great lectures but the work is busy work, especially if you've written a scientific research paper before. Don't take this class for fun unless you're going to take it Cr\/D. In the end, though, it was one of the more enjoyable parts of the BIOL sequence.",
    "I would not recommend taking this for fun unless you are into evolutionary bio. This was the my least favorite of the Bio sequences and MCDB courses I have taken. It is not taught in an organized fashion and the problem sets and papers are tedious and frustrating.",
    "It's an ok class, if you already know about evolution, don't expect to learn much new on that front, but you will learn a lot about the history of life on earth which is pretty interesting.",
    "A necessary evil. My personal favorite of the modules, BIO 104 certainly isn't what I'd choose to take if it wasn't necessary, but it's relatively interesting, and much better organized than 102. The quizzes are extremely easy, but be prepared for how much time the project will take.",
    "Biol 104 is different from many other courses, because it does not solely focus on memorization. Instead, it offers thought-provoking yet relevant material so that we are more knowledgeable about the natural world. I learned so much information about the Earth during this course, from the origin of life to evolution of mitochondria to shell design. Piazza was especially useful in clearing our doubts, as our teaching faculty and staff were quick and efficient in answering our questions. I would recommend this course to another student, because it is a course that can make all of us more informed and knowledgeable citizens. Even more importantly, the course material is interesting!",
    "The project and the final were a bit painful, but the class itself is so interesting. everything was graded fairly.",
    "The culmination of the bio module. Super interesting, worth taking to learn about the history of life on earth.",
    "This is definitely one of the better modules, especially with Professor Buss, who is such a riot. He's a very engaging lecturer, which is great when the material occasionally gets a little dense. The project is a lot of work, but it's somewhat fun if you make it fun, and the quizzes are fair. Way better than 101 and 102, but it's definitely still an intro bio module.",
    "A great class, but with a flawed grading system (too many areas in which T.A discretion could influence overall grade, even with standardization).",
    "The best of the 4 modules. That isn't saying much though.",
    "If you've never appreciated evolutionary biology before, this is a great class that will make you look at the history of life very differently. Some lectures were eh, but overall, the course was great!",
    "An interesting take on evolutionary biology that I was not exposed to in high school, even in AP bio.",
    "Very interesting material. Scattered a bit but enjoyable none the least.",
    "Best of the intro bio sequences, interesting material, good professor, and you'll take it if you have to, like all of the other bio classes.",
    "This module was definitely the most interesting and professor Buss is a great lecturer. The project and final are a little heavy at the end of the semester but if you pace yourself the workload is manageable. The study guides are relatively encompassing and studying along the way will definitely help for the final.",
    "Best module and lectures were the only ones out of the Bio 101-104 sequence that were actually enjoyable to sit through.",
    "I thought Biology 104 was a good final course in the introduction biology modules. I thought the lectures were generally interesting. Professor Buss did well to explain the material as well as provide interesting and relavant examples. I thought it was helpful to have the study guides as lecture guides. Yes, I would recommend the course because it was the final step in the module, and it gave you a chance to put your knowledge to the test and apply it.",
    "Biol 104 is pretty different than the other modules because of the project. The psets are centered on getting you ready to write the paper, is that is a little different. Weekly quizzes are less stressful because they are graded easier and are not tricky as in 101 and 103.",
    "I really enjoyed this module, and I highly recommend it. Prof. Buss is a great lecturer, and honestly if all you've ever taken is high school evolution, much of the content of this class will be new and incredibly interesting. The final paper is not bad if you work hard on the rough draft, and weekly quizzes are given full credit if you get 70% correct. It's a great course to take if you're pre-med or trying to discern what sort of a bio\/science major you would be--I never thought I would enjoy learning evolution (which to me used to mean Darwinian finches and complicated phylum names) so much!",
    "The most entertaining of the bio modules (in my opinion). Biol 104 is a very good overview of evolutionary biology taught by an engaging and passionate professor.",
    "BIOL 104 was probably one of my favorite intro bio modules. The subject matter is very different from BIOL 101-103, and I wasn't sure what to expect but ended up enjoying it far more than I thought I would. As someone who has always enjoyed cell biology and molecular biology, I didn't think that I would like evolutionary biology but found that the way the material was presented in this class made it far more engaging and interesting than I had thought it would be. Professor Buss definitely teaches you to think critically about the material and concepts in a very research-orientated way, and Surjit is a great course coordinator. You do have to do a fairly extensive research project and paper for this class, but I actually enjoyed doing the project and felt that I gained a lot from it in terms of being able to think critically about evolutionary biology and put together concepts we learned throughout the semester. Overall, I highly recommend BIOL 104!",
    "It was actually the best module of the entire bio sequence! Buss is such a cool dude.",
    "This is the best module of the four. Professor Buss organizes the lectures well and the material ties together all the modules. The project at the end can be time-consuming, but is manageable if timed well.",
    "I would highly recommend BIOL 104. The course provided an immensely interesting overview of life itself and a great way to bring greater cohesion (and a satisfying conclusion) to the sequence begun at BIOL 101.",
    "Yes! Biol 104 was my favorite of the four biology modules. It will give you a narrative about how and why life exists like it does today. It will teach you about the creativity of science and will give you tools to write about it.",
    "Only take 104 if you have to. It's a survey course that goes very quickly and superficially over the topics. Not too difficult, but I found it very dull. The project isn't hard but its time consuming. Stay on top of things and be sure to study the exam questions each week. This class is not very interesting.",
    "It is a good course but a fair amount of work."
