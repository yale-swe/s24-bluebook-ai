    "One of the best classes at Yale. It will change your understanding of human nature. Every lecture introduces something surprising and interesting. Zero homework--just two midterms and no final. There is a LOT LOT LOT of reading if you try to read every page, but the important parts are emphasized in lecture. The key is to get a big study group together, and assign people to write summaries of some subset of the assigned papers, and combine these summaries into a big study guide. This will get you through the tests just fine. John Bargh was one of the central pioneers of this field and has tons of insights about it. I have no complaints about this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend The Modern Unconscious to another student. It's a great class and teaches you so many things. The material in this class will make you view the world around you in a whole new light.",
    "i would not recommend this course because of bargh's lecture style. the material can be interesting, though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in the unconscious and especially if you are interested in going to graduate school for social psychology. Graded very fairly. A midterm and a final - both consisting of MC questions and a few short answers.",
    "It's worth taking, you learn a lot of interesting stuff.",
    "This class is not organized very well but is still the best course I've taken at Yale. The information covered in this class would appeal to anyone who is at all curious about how we think, make decisions, and perceive the world. Take this class.",
    "Learn about the ways the relative relevance of unconscious and conscious thought has evolved over the years, with focusing on priming",
    "Yes, I would recommend it only for students who are psychology majors",
    "This class is hard. Probably better for psych majors. It is interesting though.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. If you're not a psych major and have never taken a psych course in your life, you should probably take this for credit. There is only a midterm and a final though, so the workload really isn't too bad. The material covered is all so interesting and is tied together really nicely.",
    "TAKE IT! its fascinating, you learn from the expert, and it's very applicable to everyday life!",
    "I would recommend this course to those interested in psychology, sociology, cognitive science, and history.",
    "A solid 9\/10. Very little work and a lot of interesting material.",
    "Do it. Ridiculous studies on how you do things that you never thought you did, how people without the right knowledge can be slaves to unconscious processes. People named Dennis become dentists.",
    "Amazing course. A must-take if you are at all interested in psychology, human behavior, or just want to learn cool random facts about how the unconscious functions. The reading is completely supplementary and not at all required for the exams. The exams themselves (midterm and a final) are completely reasonable, focusing more on the overall purpose\/result of an experiment rather then who performed what when.Very interesting material, not too much work.",
    "Interesting material",
    "Take this course! Don't be afraid of just having two exams, they are not terribly difficult and the many reading are not crucial for the exam because Professor Bargh goes over everything you need to know in lecture.",
    "Yes. So you can understand what is actually driving that little bubble of yours.",
    "Yes! The course not only gave me a good view of the unconscious and how it interacts with the conscious, but also provided some very interesting answers to the philosophical question of free-will at the end of the course--a much appreciated and unexpected outcome.",
    "Good interesting class. Take as a senior with a lot of other seniors. As a non-psych major I still found the material really accessible.",
    "This course has some really interesting material that will make you think differently about everyday interactions and decisions. The professor is funny and clearly a leader in this field, but his lecture style was often confusing and unclear. The slides were also uninformative. He assigns a TON of reading, but I didn't do any of it. There's no section which is awesome, but be sure to come to class if you're not doing the reading.",
    "The stuff you learn in this class is awesome- makes you think about topics like prejudice, sexual harassment, and political conservatism in a completely new light. John Bargh is a cool guy and entertaining lecturer. Your grade is based entirely on two exams (50% each), so this might make you nervous if you're not a great test taker. Some of the details tested on the exams were a little irrelevant, but if you take good lecture notes (I suggest bringing your laptop so you can get everything down), you'll be fine. A LOT of people take this course credit\/D\/fail.",
    "I would recommend Modern Unconscious as a Cr\/D, especially if the grading system stays the same (2 exams, MC and short answer; one test had 90 MC... a little much for 75 minutes class. There's no work otherwise. Tons of people never went to lecture--the lectures were, however, very interesting; this material is fascinating. John Bargh is excellent--very, very intelligent guy. Not the most engaging lecturer, but can be entertaining and fun to listen to when he breaks away from his robot-like style. I enjoyed the class overall--learned a lot of interesting things.",
    "The material could be interesting and the tests were easy. It was a good fifth class, but the lectures were pretty boring and dry.",
    "This class covers some really interesting topics in the field of consciousness and unconsciousness. While lectures weren't always super engaging, they always brought up intriguing questions and insight into the way our unconscious mediates every day actions. The readings were pretty dense, but Bargh did a good job of hitting the high points of the articles in lecture, so doing all the readings wasn't exactly necessary. I'd definitely recommend it though!",
    "Take it. Only a midterm and a final plus the material is super interesting and not too hard to understand. You don't need to do the reading because he summarizes the important studies in class. What more could you want?",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's the best class I've ever taken. It was thrilling every single day. I could not get enough, I never wanted class to end.",
    "It's a great class for someone who's looking for a lecture. It's impersonal in that all you do is read, go to lectures, and take two exams, but for that level of commitment you really learn a lot.",
    "Fine lecture-- doesn't require too much work. Prof Bargh can be dry and somewhat redundant, but tries to make things interesting as well. He's also clearly an expert on the topic which helps. Would recommend for someone looking for a fifth credit without too much work that's somewhat interesting, but don't expect the course to blow your mind.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class except for an easy 5th credit. The exams are easy if you actually study for them (no reading necessary, just go over the lecture slides). The material isn't as interesting as you would expect. A great Credit\/D for very minimal work.",
    "This class is great for people who've taken Intro Cog Sci (it's nice to have a little review), and if you're a cog sci major, then YES DEFINITELY TAKE IT. If not, you'll probably still like it. It's not a huge time commitment (only two exams, and that's it, but you have to study for them), and you can get by without doing the reading (thank god--because Bargh assigns A LOT of it)",
    "Absolutely recumbent. Easily one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Huge amount of reading and material, but it's all very interesting, which makes it easier to do. Probably best to have some psych background, though.",
    "There's a lot of reading, and it's difficult to keep up. The exams are a huge portion of your grade (essentially all of your grade).",
    "YES. John Bargh IS the field of current unconscious research. his authority and passion is evident throughout the course, and his lectures are extremely interesting. this class was 50% midterm, 50% final, with no section, participation, or assignments, making it difficult to stick with readings.that being said, the actual subject is fascinating and very applicable to everyday life.take this class.",
    "Certainly. If you are interested in this kind of information, totally take the class--even if you're not a psych major. A very casual class, but not a gut.",
    "i guess take it?",
    "Very interesting material, not hard to follow, and not very much work.",
    "interesting material and pretty good lectures. Not much work and it makes you think about your own thoughts and actions a lot, which is pretty cool.",
    "I would recommend this course to almost anyone. Psych and Cog Sci majors should definitely take this course. It touches on topics relevant to economics, political science, history, and more. Take this course!",
    "This course was alright but definitely not one of the better psych courses I've taken. Some lectures were very interesting and others were very dry.",
    "entirely dependent on readings, so watch out for names and dates for the test. amazing class though",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Not lots of work and really interesting information. Great lectures that make you think about the world you live in in a different way",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to Psychology and Cognitive Science majors, as it is very interesting and does not involve too much work.",
    "Great course, not too much work. exciting stuff, take it for fun if you can.",
    "Hell yeah. Take this janx",
    "Definitely, definitely, definitely take this class. There's a pretty large amount of information you're responsible for, and sometimes the exam questions seemed unfairly nuanced, but the course itself is UNBELIEVABLY good, and John Bargh does an excellent job of covering all the material very thoroughly in lecture.",
    "Psychology 315 is one of the less interesting ways to get to know some of the most interesting material in the field of psychology.The large size of the lecture led to the class being just a review of a lot of research in the field. This review was somewhat interesting, but not extremely exciting.Tons of people Cr\/D\/F'ed the course. This isn't worth Cr\/D\/F'ing. It is possible to get a high B or a low A simply by attending classes and taking good notes, at least in my year.If you just wanted to take a random psych course because you thought it would be interesting, I recommend Intro to Psych over this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. Prof Bargh is incredible, and the fact that he had a hand in most of the studies we talked about speaks for itself. you don't have to do the readings to do well in the class; however, be prepared to do a lot of out-of-class review and studying to do well on the midterm and final. your entire grade is comprised of the midterm and final, so definitely start it Cr\/D and see how it goes after the midterm. Also, make sure you have friends in the class because they are instrumental in studying for the tests. Even though the tests involve a lot of studying, the class is really really great and I highly recommend it. definitely got me thinking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's awesome and although the readings are dry, the class and the material you learn is not. If you show up to lecture and do some of the readings, you'll do fine in the class.",
    "Yes...not a lot of work and dont need to do any work but study for the two tests",
    "This class is extremely difficult to follow. The lectures are somewhat unorganized, so sometimes you just feel completely confused. I think if the lecture slides were cleaned up and the material was presented in a more straightforward way, I would have gotten a lot more out of the class. It is clear that Bargh is passionate about the subject and he is obviously a leader in the field. But sometimes he would be jumping from slide to slide or there wasnt a coherent narrative in the experiment he was explaining and I would feel frustrated because I knew that the experiment wasn't that hard to understand if it was just presented in a more straightforward manner.",
    "I would suggest this class if you think you might be interested in the subject matter. If you have the motivation, the class is very interesting, but it's also very unstructured and you could fall behind very easily.",
    "It's a great two-a-week lecture where you sit and listen to a brilliant researcher talk about all the incredible ways our brain works when we aren't aware of it.",
    "A solid psych course. Not as cool as the course name makes it sound and the exams are definitely tough but still very interesting.",
    "This course is fascinating! John Bargh basically created this field and you will learn some pretty incredible things. In terms of work load, the course is very laid back. Only a midterm and a final. Both are very straightforward. My only recommendation is that you come to class every lecture because the slides will not help you on the tests. Other than that, you'll love the material and you'll actually want to do the reading (well, maybe not as it's not totally necessary to do well, but you might!)",
    "I would recommend this class, but is important to attend all classes and take good notes in order to do well.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class. It has a relatively light workload (there's only reading, no papers or any other types of assignments), and the material is interesting.",
    "Take it cred\/d for an interesting course.",
    "Easy and interesting. Great for a cred\/d\/fail 6th credit and an easy dist. requirement. Fairly heavy on the readings which are featured in the tests, but you can skim them and use your lecture notes to gather what they are about - they are not supplementary readings, he discusses them heavily in lectures. What I did was to make a list of each reading, fill in 2 or 3 bullet points on what each reading was about, and study that for the tests, and I felt well prepared. I would definitely recommend.",
    "If you like behavioral or social psychology you will enjoy this class.",
    "This is by far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! Every lecture fascinating, and John Bargh is simply the best. He knows more than anyone else about this topic, and you really get the sense that you're learning from the best. You learn a tremendous amount with very little work. This is a must!",
    "The topics seem interesting, but beware - the lectures are VERY unorganized. There is no textbook, and lectures have no clear theme. Lecture slides randomly skip back and forth and make you wonder if each lecture is not just a slight looped paraphrase of the previous.",
    "A great survey of the unconscious after Freud",
    "Engaging lectures, Bargh is pretty much a leader in his field. The material is so so interesting.Absolutely no work at all, there are readings but you really don't have to do them... maybe skim them if you can. No section to prepare for, just midterm and a final. This can mean that you will end up cramming for the tests, however.",
    "This is a great class. Bargh is a wonderful lecturer, and the topic is extremely interesting. Be prepared for only two grades in the class--a midterm and a final. This means a minimal workload, but a lot of pressure to do well on those two tests. If you're not an exam person, or if you don't think you'd have the discipline to keep up on the readings, don't take the class.",
    "Definitely recommend. Best class I've taken at yale.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student as an interesting and low workload psychology class. That being said, there are probably better taught and equally interesting psych classes out there.",
    "Very interesting course. You'll learn a lot of cool studies. The readings can be rough, but I have little psych experience and did well in the course. I would definitely recommend it",
    "fun, interesting, and not too much work. Yes, take it!",
    "A fascinating course about the effects of the unconscious on human behavior. I would recommend this course for its highly interesting subject matter.",
    "This class is really interesting and not much work, perfect 5th class.",
    "It's a good, entertaining course that doesn't really require reading at all. Essentially you just have to show up to lecture. That said, don't screw up the exams. Midterm = 50% Final = 50%.",
    "The Modern Unconscious is basically a look at how a lot of our judgments and evaluations and behaviors are actually driven by stuff we wouldn't have thought of -- the unconscious -- that we're not aware of. It's a lot of really cool information that's really accessible, cutting edge in psychology. There's just a midterm and an in-class final, both of which are 50% of the grade. Really cool material presented really well by an amazing lecturer. Take it!!!",
    "Recommend only to someone who hasn't taken much psychology and is interested in the subject.",
    "The Modern Unconscious is a great class, especially if you do the readings. The readings were never on the tests but you'll get more out of the class if you read a few articles that really interest you. The lectures are fairly good though the class wasn't as greatas I expected.",
    "I would recommend this course to any other student. The information taught is the kind that would prove useful for both psychology majors and non-psychology majors.",
    "This class is a survey of the progression of studies on the unconscious - it starts out with how the concept of unconscious developed and continues to the most recent nuanced studies. There are a lot of readings for the class that add to your knowledge, but you don't actually have to do them to do well in the class. Overall a good class, but not the best I've taken in the department.",
    "This course is FANTASTIC. The professor is engaging and interesting, and it's a very manageable workload as a fifth class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The material was incredibly interesting. Definitely go to lecture because that's where the important information is presented, and Bargh is an interesting lecturer anyway. The first half of the course was a little disjointed and confusing, but the second half was more coherent and definitely made up for it. Don't be scared off by the 50% midterm and 50% final; the tests are fair (although, if you're not a psych major, you might consider taking the class credit\/d, at least until after you get the midterm back).",
    "If you are interested in the workings of the unconscious, then absolutely. If not, it's still a very interesting course to take, although since it is a fairly long lecture it can be very easy to doze off. Also, since there is no section, paying attention in class and doing the readings is crucial.",
    "Very interesting and accessible course. I am a Psych major but I don't recall any situation where prior knowledge was a distinct advantage. Course material was interesting and not difficult to follow. Con: Felt a bit like intro to psych for the unconscious, ie very broad overview, no real deep analysis.Workload was ... non-existant. Reading was assigned but I know few people who did it. Class covered everything better. Two exams, worth 50% each, both in-term. Easy course. Exams were below average difficulty. (My advice, take it cr-D for the least work you've ever done as well as interesting)",
    "Take it if you are interested in the unconscious and how it affects everything",
    "Very good. This class is awesome, really interesting, and there is virtually no work. Also, the midterm and final are reasonable as long as you study for them and have all the lecture notes. So, YES, take this class.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. If you get a chance, you must take this course, psych major or not. The studies you hear about are mind-boggling and you leave the course with a greater sense of knowing how you as an individual operate and live your life. Professor Bargh does an amazing job lecturing and really exposes myths about what the unconscious is and is not.",
    "PSYC 315 is a great class with really interesting material. It is essentially a spinoff from Social Psychology with a real emphasize on conscious and unconscious processes, and is taught WAY better than Social Psych. It becomes clear early on that Professor Bargh is deeply invested in the material, and his contribution to the field is evident in the number of studies discussed in the class that include his name--yet he never seems to toot his own horn, so to speak. There are a lot of eye opening moments in the class, little details that are really interesting, and if you are into learning ways that we humans can be influenced by the world around us, this is the class for you. The only complaint I would have is that the topic is taught a little too quickly--some lectures can feel like a whirlwind of material, and some classes have ended in fifty minutes.",
    "Very interesting course without too much work. The lectures maintain your interest and some of the material covered is just downright fascinating.",
    "Good class, Professor Bargh was an interesting lecturer and the topics were very cool. Kind of repetitive material, which made it easier to remember, but also kind of boring and confusing about how all the separate topics fit together. Pretty straight forward, though, I would recommend it if you're interested in the topic.",
    "Take it! Best Psychology Class at Yale.",
    "This is the kind of course I think everyone should take. It answers so many of the questions about our mind (and beyond), which we contemplate everyday.",
    "Bargh is extremely disorganized in his teaching style. I finished the course with no idea of an over-arching theme, which is kind of the point of classes. That made it so that the class was interesting, but at times confusing (he would introduce seemingly random studies) and made the lecture drag on. What was cool was that Bargh was responsible in some way for a ton of the psych studies that I've heard about for the past 3 years as a Psych major, but the novelty of that wore off when I got frustrated again with his lecture style.",
    "Phenomenal class. Fascinating material presented in a rigorous but accessible way. John Bargh is one of the most eminent researchers of the unconscious, and it shows. First describes contemporary research on unconscious mental processing, then tackles implications for big questions like free will. Lots of reading (all scientific papers), and they're good, but you don't have to do any of them to ace the course - lectures are great - pay close attention to them!",
    "I would not recommend a psychology student take this as an elective course. Since it is not required, I would recommend something else from List A. (Or is it List B...?) Well, whatever list of course you're choosing from anyways.",
    "Take this class. It's extremely informative about the influences on our behavior that our conscious minds are often unaware of. Very interesting, and Bargh is a great lecturer.",
    "The Modern Unconscious was an amazing psychology lecture course. The subject material was fascinating theoretical material, and the course was low-stress and very enjoyable the entire semester. I would actually look forward to every lecture. The course was absolutely made by Professor John Bargh. Professor Bargh is the best psychology professor I have ever had. He is incredibly enthusiastic about his subject material, and is a brilliant and exciting lecturer. His presence and expertise made The Modern Unconscious a very dynamic course. The Modern Unconscious is a great upper level course for psychology majors and non-majors alike.",
    "I thought this was a fairly decent overview of the research done on cognitive psychology and unconscious processing. John Bargh is such an eminent figure in this field, so I was especially excited to take a course like this from him. He is certainly a good lecturer, though sometimes his powerpoints are a bit difficult to follow. I wish that there hadn't been only one midterm and one final, but I appreciated how responsive he was to our feedback. Overall, I'm glad I took this course.",
    "Yes, there is some really interesting material here.",
    "I would recommend it. There are a lot of readings but if you do attend lecture and skim most of the readings it's not too bad. It's possible to get an A\/A- if you do that, so I'd say it's not necessary to take it Cr\/D. Otherwise, the class grading consisted of a midterm and a final which counted equally, so take that as you will. I thought Professor Bargh was very engaging and interesting and I never fell asleep during any lectures (each 75 min long), which I think is a testament to his excitement about the topic.",
    "I'm sure we all suspect that a lot of things influence our decisions and actions without us knowing, but you will be amazed (and a little disturbed) by how many things and WHAT things cause you to act certain ways. If you think about it, \"The Modern Unconscious\" can cover pretty much any concept in psychology - cognitive, social, emotional, clinical - and it does. The diversity of studies is astounding.Despite the high number listing, you don't have to have a lot of psych background, although taking intro psych will make concepts like cognitive dissonance a little easier and familiar. In the end, the most difficult part will be organizing all the studies you learn about into a cohesive framework.The reading is not necessary to do well on the exams, which were both easy if you attend and reviewed lectures. Unfortunately, it's easy to forget what you've learned because you don't have to do the reading.",
    "This course was a semester of fun facts. Professor Bargh is clear and entertaining.",
    "This is a comprehensive course on modern unconscious research. Professor Bargh is a leader of his field and he's a great lecturer.",
    "The Modern Unconscious is a fascinating overview of the historical development and current state of research on the unconscious mind. Lectures consist of a summery of the studies covered in readings, which, though generally very interesting, are by no means necessary for success in the exams. Class is fascinating.",
    "It's an interesting class, but you might find yourself bored if you've taken social psych already.",
    "sure its okay. the reviews from the last time he taught this class (like 4 years ago) were stellar, which is why i decided to take it. there were so many people shopping it, it was annoying. you couldnt even get into the room to hear lecture for the first couple weeks until he managed to move it to another room. but while the material we covered was really interesting, he wasn't as good a lecturer as the reviews made him out to be. his voice is kind of monotonous, and he goes over everything so fast. he also repeats lecture slides like nothing other!! kind of confusing because it catches you off guard, you're like \"wait is this stuff new\" and you realize he is just repeating the same thing in a different way from last week. he is def nice though, and a funny guy, the grade was just made up of a midterm and final, so not too much work there. overall good class, just crowded this semester.",
    "I am so glad I took this class. I was considering taking Dilemmas of a Nuclear Age. HAH! This class is way more mentally stimulating in lecture and is actually interesting. I loved it. You get to learn some really cool stuff and best of all you don't need intro to psych to understand it all. John Bargh is at the top of his field and explains everything while still making it seem like the coolest thing ever. There's a midterm and a final, both multiple choice and short answer. IT WAS AWESOME. Seriously, if they offer this class again, just sign up for it. He didn't even cap it, there were like 270 people in our class. Just do it and be happy.",
    "Yes! The Modern Unconscious is such an interesting course that will point out things in your daily life that you've never noticed\/thought about. There are only two tests and they are not too difficult. You also get to read a lot of interesting primary articles. I highly recommend taking this class!",
    "Modern Unconscious is awesome. Take it. I thought it was really cool because I previously knew nothing about the subject, and now I see it everywhere. I was worried that it was going to be all Freud stuff, but it wasn't -- it was all really legit empirical studies."
