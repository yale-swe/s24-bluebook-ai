   "comments": [
    "Yes. The reading is not too much. The course is fun.",
    "Undiluted awesomeness.",
    "I would recommend DS only if you are willing to do the work for it.",
    "I would say it gives you a good grasp on Plato and Aristotle and a light grasp on a few other guys.",
    "DS philosophy is a survey of some of the most important works of Western Philosophy. I would recommend it.",
    "I would only recommend Directed Studies to a student if they were really interested in the Western cannon, were willing to spend a lot of time on readings\/papers, and were okay with simply skimming the surface of a lot of works rather than getting an in depth understanding of any one. Personally, I didn't feel like I got as much from the course as I could have taking another course maybe focused on 1-3 of the philosophers we covered in a very in depth manner.",
    "I would say that while at some points it gets a little dry (Aristotle is not the most fun, and papers sometimes feel more like math proofs than essays), it is overall a worthwhile course if you want to gain some foundational knowledge in philosophy.",
    "Philosophy is probably the third of DS most unlike any class you've ever taken. The first paper is tough, unless you just have the knack for it. If you have Edgar, EXPLAIN EXPLAIN EXPLAIN everything fully, and then explain some more. He's probably one of the better philosophy section leaders too, really knows his stuff.",
    "Yes. If you get a good section leader, it is a good opportunity to learn the basics of philosophy in an intimate setting. If not, a lecture might be better..",
    "I would only recommend it if they could have the same professor that I did. I didn't hear pretty stories about any other section.",
    "This is a great introduction to ancient and medieval philosophy. And while the pace is quick, it felt like Professor Edgar organized his class in a way that made us feel as though we were getting more then simply a taste of each thinker's ideas. I would recommend the class in a heartbeat.",
    "Philosophy is a lot of fun. Sometimes, class can give you a headache because it can get complicated very quickly when starting out with deceivingly simple premises but its worth it to give it a try. I definitely feel that the material we studied has given me heavy ammo for discussions on moralities and ethics, applicable to today's politics chiefly among other areas. It really changes your views on the world as well when you can understand and re-explain philosophical views that seem to come from opposite spectrums of belief, like epicureanism and stoicism. It's a great course for life."
