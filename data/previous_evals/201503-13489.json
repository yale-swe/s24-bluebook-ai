    "Great course, I highly recommend it!",
    "This is a good class to take and did not have an unreasonable amount of work outside of the classroom. It's interesting if you want some basic level of understanding of current topics in science.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student that wants an easy science credit, since that is what it is geared towards. The quizzes can be tough occasionally, but there are so many points associated with other assignments that its easy to get a good grade if you just do all the work, which is not too much since the course is only .5 credits per semester.",
    "YES, it's very interesting.",
    "i would recommend taking this subject as a credit that pushes your credits above 4, but not to fill the traditional 4-credit requirement.",
    "It's a good class to take if you're interested in having a surface understanding of cool, current scientific topics, especially if you are not a science major. It fulfills a distributional requirement, and the workload is usually minimal."
