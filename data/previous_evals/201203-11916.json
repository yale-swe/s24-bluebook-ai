   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this course if you're serious about participating and doing the reading. There is so much powerful material covered in this class, and it has a huge potential to effect you personally. Covering the intersection of two crucial movements gives you a very fundamental and powerful understanding of what really drives change and social movement.",
    "really fun course! a lot of reading but it's interesting. and you learn a ton about both the civil rights and women's lib movements. a great course, especially if you want to know more about feminism.",
    "Take it if you can! It's a lot of work (that final project is deceptively huge- start it early!), but it's definitely worth it. Feimster is amazing. The reading list is great, and she offers new perspective on books, like \"The Feminine Mystique,\" which I know a lot of people have already read or learned about before.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I would summarize it as a course covering the intricacies of the women's liberation and civil rights movements from the middle of the 20th century to the present, with significant focus on the different factions within each movement and the ways in which the two overlapped. There is a fair amount of reading and you're expected not only to do reading responses every other week, but to put together a portfolio based on the reading at the end of the semester, so this is a class in which you actually have to do the reading. That being said, it is definitely reading that you will enjoy doing, and a class that you will enjoy attending and contributing to because it will challenge what you think you know about the civil rights and women's liberation movements, which in turn will really challenge what you think about a wide variety of things in your life. Take this class to develop your ideas if you don't have a strong background in reading or thinking about these issues; take this class to add knowledge to your base if you're already a staunch feminist. We had both types of people in the class, and everything in between. (If you're on the fence about it, just take the class for Professor Feimster because she's the greatest).",
    "Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in Civil Rights or Women's history. You'll learn a ton and get to read some great books. Class is purely discussion based so come prepared!",
    "Civil Rights and Women's Liberation is very challenging: read 1 book per week (although you definitely don't have to read the full book). The books are really incredible, touching on very different aspects of the civil rights and women's liberation movements and how they intersect. The workload is VERY HEAVY: read the book each week, write a reading response every other week, midterm paper (8 pages), and 50-page final portfolio. However, although there is a ton of work, Feimster is not a hard grader so as long as you get the work done it doesn't have to be the best best best best best thing you've ever done.Feimster was definitely the best part about the course; she is incredible. She is SUCH A badass. So smart, so passionate, and she really pushes you to think about things in a different way.I think one's experience in this course will depend a lot on who is in the seminar. You will learn a LOT about the history of the Civil Rights and Women's Liberation movements, however, sometimes it felt as if everyone in the class knew more than I did and\/or had more background knowledge.",
    "A book a week, 6 reading responses, an 8 page paper and a big portfolio project at the end. It's a lot of work, so I would recommend it but caution you to be thoughtful about the other courses you pair it with.",
    "Absolutely I'd recommend this class.",
    "This is an interesting course that helps to show the connections between the Civil Rights and Women's Liberation movements. The readings (a book a week) are quite good, though some are better than others. Professor Feimster works to link the course to modern feminism-the midterm paper focuses on modern feminist debates. While this is interesting, the class doesn't actually teach too much about modern feminism, so these assignments feel very out of place. Discussion was interesting, though the class was a mix of students with a great deal of experience in WGSS and those with none. While this can be interesting, this often made the course slower for more experienced students. The final project, a big portfolio, has some interesting space for reflection, but a fair bit of it is just primary document analysis, which is dry. A final paper would be a better choice. This is a really great course overall, though, and I would recommend it if you're not afraid of the massive workload.",
    "This class examines (as the title says) the interaction between the civil rights and women's liberation movements. Reading can be a little heavy (a book a week) although some (the 1st person sources) move a little faster. You should also be aware that the work is weighted heavily toward the end of the semester (a long final portfolio), but you will have a much easier time if you do the work as you go along as suggested. Another thing I would say is that while this is cross-listed in WGSS, and while of course this depends on the particular group of students, it is more of a women's history class than a WGSS class. Which is totally fine! and makes the class accessible to people in AFAM\/AMST, and still interesting to WGSS types."
