   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it only if you have a very keen interest in the topic. There's a lot of reading, some of it a little dry and overly detailed. If the concepts were already distilled into more manageable excerpts, it would be better.",
    "this course was deceptively repetitive and the class discussion was pretty much stagnant throughout the year. the readings are great, but chances are, if you're at all interested in environmentalism or sustainability, you've already read the good ones on the list. the professor is mediocre, so the best classes are the ones where guests come in.",
    "Don't recommend. Readings are tremendously broad and the final project is a little ridiculous.",
    "Overall, al good class. Not as in-depth or as specific as I would have liked. But you do some interesting reading, and it's really helpful for creating a framework for thinking about creating change.",
    "Great class, especially if your interested in sustainability in particular. Teaches you how to think about systems in a new way. First half of the course more theoretical about \"what is sustainability\" and trying to grasp the concept of the movement. Manageable amount of reading (can actually be completed). Lots of in class discussion, but doesn't require preparation other than the readings. Summaries of the readings required each week. A written take home midterm, and a final 15-20 page paper evaluating a system (in light of sustainability) either on campus or in the community.",
    "Sustainability and Institutions is a dual course in the principles of sustainability and their application in the field of secondary institution development. It gives you the vocabulary to begin your search of sustainability and become a CHANGE MANAGER.",
    "This class emphasized on systems thinking. The only problem is that I wish we applied systems thinking more.The SOM business cases (especially the one on CABG) could be an interesting model to look at institutional sustainability.",
    "Great great class if you're interested in sustainability. Take it!!",
    "This class should be mandatory for anyone who plans on going into politics, business, sustainability, and really for everything. This is where the need-to-know information for how the status quo operates and can be drastically improved.",
    "EVST 170 is pretty much what the title says - it's about sustainability, specifically in institutions. There's plenty of stuff about the theory of sustainability and organisational change, and also about Yale's own sustainability efforts. Dr Newman is a great resource and infectiously enthusiastic about the subject, and she has lots of experience and unique access to information about Yale. If you're interested in sustainability change - actually making an organisation more environmentally friendly - this is the class for you.Because it's still a fairly new class, its structure is still in flux somewhat, so while individual classes are always great, the organisation may be a bit messy. But on the whole it's still well worth taking, and not an unreasonable amount of work. Good readings, too.",
    "A great course on all the different facets of sustainability in business, education, science, and policy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in the theory and the operational application, not just science and law.",
    "This course was a very basic introduction to sustainability theory and to some of its applications at Yale. I recommend this class only to someone who has never heard of sustainability and wants to explore it. Class discussions will be frustratingly vague, but some of the readings are interesting.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. I was very enthused about the subject-matter, but was disappointed in the lack of concrete material that I learned this semester. The readings were dull and disappointing, and the weekly summaries seemed rather pointless. Visits from architects and other staff members involved in sustainability on campus were a highlight of the course.",
    "Interesting, to a point. Heavy on the bureaucratic jargon. It was cool to find out more about sustainability at Yale, but there are better EVST courses.",
    "Yes. Take it, if you can. The class is great not just for EVST majors but for anyone interested in sustainability. The readings are ones that you remember and class discussions are actually interesting. I think it was one of the most memorable classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "ENVST 170 is a hands-on seminar that trains you to be an institutional sustainability change manager. If you are quite engaged in sustainability (a STEP coordinator, for example), this class is for you. If you're interested in gaining a background on environmental issues, the class might not be the best fit, because the environmental crisis is covered only briefly at the start of the course. The focus is on practical strategies to improve an organization and it sometimes felt like a support session for STEP coordinators, though there is a fair amount of theory as well."
