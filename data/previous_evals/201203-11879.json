    "Well, if you're considering this class, it probably means that you have to take it any way. But what I can tell you about it is that (unlike many other classes you might be forced to take for some or other reason) this class will actually benefit you tons in the long-run. There was a very reasonable amount of work. The aim of the class is to get you started on the senior essay. We did this through preparing several 5 and 10 minute presentations on our essay topics, and the \"final exam\" was to deliver a presentation of our essay to the WGSS department& friends. Maria's chill, and is a really helpful resource. Definitely glad this class is offered. Also, unless you royally screw up\/don't do any of your presentations, or like, never come to class, it's pretty much guaranteed that you'll get an A in this class. Maria doesn't grade the presentations, because she wants us to feel comfortable making mistakes and learning from them, without the fear of hurting our grade getting in the way of learning how to become scholars.",
    "Yes, it was very helpful in developing and staying on track with my senior thesis.",
    "This course will teach you how to give a formal academic presentation. At the end of the semester, you will present the progress of your thesis to the assembled WGSS faculty and undergraduate majors. This is your chance to show off your stuff, so do the department proud. Use this course to interrogate the methodology of your research and to refine the theory behind your work. Work closely with your advisor and let the Senior Colloquium be a retrospective of all you have learned as a WGSS major."
