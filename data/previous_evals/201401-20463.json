    "Yes I would recommend Surrealism. There are a lot of big concepts to understand, but it is worth it at the end of the semester when you finally feel like you have a good grip on the concept of Surrealism and the Avant-Garde.",
    "HSAR 496 was an incredibly stimulating course that probably will effect the way I look at the avant-garde movement for the rest of my life. The readings were purposeful and rich, the classroom discussions were heavily engaging and often fun, and Zeidler is a rare professor. I would take it again in a heartbeat.",
    "If you are interested in Surrealism this is a good class, but make sure you are before taking it"
