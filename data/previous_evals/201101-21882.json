   "comments": [
    "Very easy, not a lot of work, a lot of reading but not required in order to write the paper. Only one paper and one final. TAKE IT!",
    "A fairly interesting course, lots of assigned reading which can be very interesting if you do all of it but it is not really required.",
    "Sure, interesting and relevant subject, but rather boring lectures. Be prepared for falling asleep in lecture!",
    "This class was interesting but would be so much better with less reading. The amount of reading expected of us to do was ridiculous and prevented people from actually trying to do it (1000 page course packet + 13 books + various articles online = expensive and absurd). A lot of the articles in the course packet were very similar to one another--it could have benefited from a lot of editing. I also think the class would also benefit from either a midterm or a section (to actually motivate people to go). Otherwise, not a bad class to fill out a schedule--limited work, just a paper and a final, 50% each.",
    "A good class to take to balance off a heavy course schedule. I would recommend taking it for a letter grade.",
    "It's an easy class in the sense that there is only one essay and a final. However if you're looking for an interesting class about the nuclear age, this is not it.",
    "it's an interesting class on an important topic, but the lectures can be painfully dry at times. but only 1 paper and a final so not a huge amount of work. its a good humanities credit",
    "I wouldn't take this class.",
    "The perfect Credit D option. But really, you should go to lecture, because the subject matter is interesting and relevant.",
    "Not a bad class. not much work",
    "you will learn a lot, its a good course",
    "I loved this course. The material is SO interesting - all modern day history\/political science, development of the bomb to present day nuclear terrorism. The lectures are actually really fun and interesting even though Professor Schell's voice takes getting used to. He is the absolute sweetest - definitely go up and get to know him (don't be intimidated by the size of the lecture). This was my favorite course this year. The paper can be something really interesting if you work at it, and the reading is interesting but by no means do you have to do it all.",
    "a good class",
    "Not much work involved. But make sure you have some background in the subject.",
    "It was a very little work course.",
    "I got to meet the whole hockey team! This course is a joke and all the jocks take it.",
    "Yes, it is a great history class, and Schell is an expert!",
    "Yes, good way to fulfill humanities credit and interesting. A little dry without powerpoint, but movies were cool. And the topic overall is interesting.",
    "yes",
    "If you're a history major who actually cares about history, this class will drive you insane. Schell is a great writer but a poor historian. He should teach writing courses in the English department. Still, it's an interesting course. If you have some interest in international relations, you'll find a way to make it enjoyable. And, with one paper and one final, it's not like you'll have too put in too much time.",
    "It's a great primer on the problem with nukes and policy on them. It can be a little dry at times but going through all the material in the end makes you realize how much you learned. It's great for anyone interested in international politics from the last 70 years.",
    "EP&E 442 is a fantastic course if you are interested in nuclear weapons and the political and philosophical issues they raise. It covers a lot of material, but by the end you really feel you have learned a lot. Prof. Schell is fantastic at making the material interesting and easy to understand, so I highly recommend taking this course. The arguments you will hear will be surprising but very interesting and compelling.",
    "Professor Schell is the foremost expert on everything nuclear; it was an awesome class!",
    "A great course on the debate of abolition, covering all the aspects of the nuclear dilemma from its very beginning in the early 1930s to the Obama administration policies. I would totally recommend it for anyone, especially if someone is very interested in nuclear weapons policies\/Cold War\/Current Proliferation threat.",
    "A filler class that will serve you as much as you want to do work in it. Make sense? Probably not, but the class is interesting if that helps. One final. One paper. 50\/50 of grade.",
    "It's very hard to feel inspired to go to lecture because they are extremely dry and tedious. It's not a setback to miss lectures. The class is set up solely on one midterm paper (10-15 pages) and a final. The material is very interesting and not too hard.",
    "Most students don't go to lecture. You don't have to do the readings. But you should, or you will leave the course not having gotten anything out of it.",
    "This course has some great content about the cold war and dilemmas of the nuclear age. I would recommend it to another student because it's interesting and requires little to no work whatsoever. Probably the easiest class I've taken at Yale so far. Great class to take Cr\/D because you literally won't have to do anything. At the same time, even if you take it for a grade, you won't do much either.",
    "Great class, interesting material, easy to learn, manageable workload.",
    "Yes, take this class!",
    "If you're interested in the material, you couldn't get a better course. It's comprehensive, and Schell is the authority on the subject matter. If you want to do absolutely no work, you couldn't get a better course, either.",
    "While Prof. Schell's lectures aren't given in the most exciting manner, this course is highly relevant to our world and our future. You will understand the history behind Iran's nuclear reactors controversy and the inherent problems in North Korea's nuclear power status. Do the readings--at least give Rhodes and Schell's books a try--but don't worry about them as the final will be completely based on his lectures. Final: 10 ID's, 2 short essays (chosen from 4 options). Midterm paper: meet with Prof. Schell after somewhat writing your paper--it'll help you get an A.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is the definition of a gut. One paper and a final. It's great as a fifth class. The material is also very relevant.",
    "Good class, interesting overview on some important subjects. Paper was graded fairly leniently and the final was very fair, I thought.",
    "fine",
    "This class is the overview of the development of the nuclear bomb from world war II to the present day. Additional topics include nuclear energy and briefly a section on nuclear meltdowns",
    "GUT. Otherwise terrible.",
    "If you are interest in nuclear dilemmas and ethics i would take the course however be prepared to really focus and concentrate in lectures.",
    "Very little work, but still interesting. If you have taken Cold War with John Gaddis, then you will know most of the material already.",
    "If you are interested in nuclear history and philosophy this might be a good choice. The two assignments each accounting for 50% of your grade is kind of nerve-racking.",
    "I would reccomend this class to other students....it's what you make it. If you have the willpower the stay engaged during lecture and stay attentive which can be a major struggle at times and if you do some of the reading, you'll really gain a perspective about the \"dilemmas\" of nuclear weapons. One paper and one final sounds fantastic, which it is, but be wary of getting lost in between.",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially for non-humanity majors. It is a good 5th course to take. The majority of the work is just reading, with a 15 page paper and a final. The paper was not difficult and the final was not hard either. While it it possible to get through the class with little effort, if you take the time to do the readings and make an effort to learn the material, it is truly fascinating. You get out what you put in.",
    "YES! The class is very informative if you're interested in post WWII history. There is an essay and a test and Professor Schell is awesome! Some people don't go to class, but I'd recommend going even if you just go to listen to Professor Schell. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "GUT.",
    "This class is realtively easy if you attend the lectures. The final asks pointed identification questions. I would have been in trouble if I had not studied! If you have any interest in nuclear weapons, or international politics for that matter, go to class and you will learn a lot.",
    "This class is not difficult to receive a high grade in if you spend a good amount of time on the paper and final exam.",
    "Highly recommend it. Really interesting and not too bad work-wise.",
    "Take this class if you're really interested in the nuclear age - don't take it if you're looking for an easy gut. Professor Schell is a leading scholar in this field (as any high school debater would know). Also, he's not a dynamic lecturer, so you will probably be bored unless you really really like this subject. The material presented is thought-provoking and great, and Prof Schell is a really good professor. In short: take it but not because you want a gut, take it because you want to learn something.",
    "Awesome class. Take it. Not difficult and fairly interesting.",
    "If you actually want to learn the material, the attitude among the others taking this class will frustrate you. Professor Schell is great, though.",
    "This class looks to analyze all of the \"dilemmas\" of the nuclear age. These \"dilemmas\" range from the fact that the nuclear bomb was created from human scientific knowledge to the fact that it is extraordinarily hard to capture a territory once a nuclear bomb has been dropped on this territory. I would recommend it to anyone who has a genuine interest in the nuclear age, and wants to learn from one of the best.",
    "it was pretty boring",
    "Good if you need a PLSC that is not too much work and has some interesting and relevant topics.",
    "Not much work, but it's interesting if you do at least some of it. Definitely a good 5th class. The lectures aren't super helpful but the reading is pretty good.",
    "A far reaching and interesting overview of the nuclear age.",
    "Requires little work, but good notes are required for the exam.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "50% paper and 50% exam was quite easy task, although there were much readings to do.",
    "It really is a good class, if you pay attention an show up. Lots don't, but I got a kick out of it.",
    "This is a look at nuclear age history and themes. It's decently fast-paced. The subject is interesting, but lectures are dry. There is only a paper and a final, but a lot of reading that accompanies the course. I don't know if I would recommend this class--there were times when I didn't want to go to lecture, especially when I had other big assignments to do.",
    "A great intro to nuclear dilemmas",
    "Great class. Interesting lectures and a must-know subject matter in terms of American history.",
    "Chill class. But as you know you need to do very well on the paper plus final.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "This class surveys different debates and dilemmas of the nuclear age from various perspectives, including cultural, scientific, and political\/military. It's a great class, even if you are inexperienced in this area. You will get the most out of it if you can put a lot of time into the reading and the paper.",
    "Take it.",
    "Gut class. Take it if you're looking for one.",
    "Yes, definately one of the easier classes. No section and you don't have to do the readings",
    "Gem, don't have to go to class really, and only two assignments without sections. Material is pretty cool too.",
    "Yes!",
    "I took this for the humanities credit. There aren't many humanities-related issues in the course, and I'm not actually sure whether it'll have a HU credit in the future. Lectures were dry but most people just didn't go. Final is 50% of the grade and the paper is 50% of the grade, so you're always a little unsure of where you stand in the class. The grading on the paper was very easy, though. There are a lot of readings but I don't know that you're actually expected to do them - even for the final, Schell said he wouldn't \"ransack the readings\" for obscure facts not discussed in class, and that seemed generally true of the questions on the exam. If you're looking for a really in-depth exploration of the issues I wouldn't take this class, but as far as low-workload humanities credits go, it was fine.",
    "very easy gut class - the material and reading is actually quite interesting if you take the time to do it, but even if you don't go to class and study just 3-5 hours for the final, you'll prob still get an A",
    "I would recommend this class only to a student specifically interested in the nuclear age history. One will only get something out of this class if they are willing to do the reading that is assigned.",
    "easy A if you do the work.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting, multidisciplinary class. The workload is manageable for anyone who keeps up with the lectures and class themes.",
    "Take it if you don't wanna do much work in a history class. Just dont screw up the paper or final.",
    "Very interesting material and the professor is great.",
    "This can be a pretty easy class if you want it to be, but if you actually do all the reading (which you should, you don't pay to party), it's quite a lot of work. Moderately interesting as long as you like the topic of the class.",
    "It was a fairly interesting class and the paper was fun to write because it really made me think. However, the material is pretty straight forward and you don't really need to go to class to get a good grade in the class. It consists of a midterm paper and a final.",
    "It was a sweet ride along the history lane",
    "Great class with a genuinely nice professor.",
    "A great, wide ranging course",
    "It's an extremely easy class that looks at the development of nuclear weapons and how they have affected politics and society. The lectures are frustratingly dull, and the reading list almost completely unnecessary. In short, easy but boring.",
    "Very easy class. The reading is not actually necessary, so don't bother buying all of the books (like I did). Pick a paper topic you're actually interested in though, it makes writing it much easier."
