    "As an intro course, I would recommend it to any student interested in getting a nice overview of computational models. For a fellow graduate student who is only interested in getting an overview of computational models and is not that interested in the specific mathematical details, this course might not be worthwhile. Programming experience although not a prerequisite is very helpful for the course as all the assignments involve some level of programming. In this sense, the course is nice since the focus is on applying your knowledge with assignments and not on memorizing concepts for exams.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students because it introduces approaches not typically discussed in other linguistic classes and because it requires the students to apply this knowledge practically, in running programs."

    "I learned a lot about computational models and different ways in which to model \"knowledge.\" It helped me understand different ways of modeling linguistic phenomena and therefore broadened my perspective. It helped me acquire a more in-depth understanding of different cognitive frameworks."
