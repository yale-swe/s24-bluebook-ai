   "comments": [
    "Class itself is sometimes painful. Preparation of for the trip is stressful. Hopefully it will all pay off for the all-expense paid trip to another country.",
    "This class focuses on two questions: What is social enterprise? and Does it work?While these questions are important, they can also be frustrating so prepare to come to class and experience some of the frustration that I'm sure those in the field do on an every day basis. I can't fully summarize the experience because I haven't done the case study component that extends into the summer and next semester, but overall I would say that this class is worth the year-long commitment!!!",
    "I haven't finished the actual site visit or the second half of the semester yet (so it may be more useful to look at Fall reviews), but so far I've really liked this class and I'm SO Excited for the site visit!!! I don't see why you wouldn't take this class (unless you had second semester commitments)",
    "Bo is a great professor, and this is a very interesting course that comes with a really unique opportunity to experience an applied side of development.",
    "A unique opportunity at Yale that is still surprisingly under the radar! You meet for a semester in the spring to talk about what a social enterprise is, then go abroad on a fully funded excursion to a developing country (don't worry, you can make it work with any summer plans) and then come back and use your research to write up a business case.Not that academically rigorous, and there were some times when I wished the discussions had more substance to them (business theory discussions tend to disintegrate into generalities much faster than other topics) but the summer opportunity is the reason to take this course. If you can get in and deal with the two semester commitment, I'd say do it.",
    "A course where you learn about markets in the real world. A very unique application of all the economics courses that we've taken so far.",
    "Yes, definitely!! it's a really unique opportunity to travel over the summer and visit a company of your choice.",
    "Great class, I would definitely recommend it! I'm surprised how few students know about this seminar. If you can get in, I would suggest that you take this awesome opportunity. Although class discussions are sometimes unstructured, the readings are usually pretty good.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend the class. It was always a treat to go to class and I enjoyed the discussion. Professor Hopkins is great and is always enthusiastic about the class. I've learned a ton regarding the ground realities that exist in business environments, especially those in developing countries. Plus you also get to travel over the summer and observe for yourself how social enterprises operate in the real world.",
    "Absolutely take this class! You learn a lot, the professor is great and you have the opportunity to travel to a developing country to see what you learned in action!",
    "take it!"
