    "Absolutely take it. Singing and playing piano, dictation. It's so much fun!",
    "Yes, good to learn music and improve skills. Light workload compared to other classes and usually a pleasant size.",
    "If you are at all interested in sight-singing\/dictation\/music theory, I would highly recommend this course! Bakulina is a great professor, and gives one-on-one time to almost every student during class. The work load is not bad at all, and I found myself enjoying this class a lot semester.",
    "Take 219. It's no work if you are fairly comfortable with sight singing and so is keyboard lab if you have some piano background. Great course for learning solfege and developing better ears to the music you listen to."
