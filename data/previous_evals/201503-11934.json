   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class! It's a fascinating chance to tackle a subject you probably won't get to study unless it's your specialty.",
    "I do recommend this class! Especially because it's a unique way to experience the English department.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It does not require a deep knowledge of African literature (although some familiarity would be useful) and is an excellent starting point. It is important to note that because this course is cross-listed with African Studies it is not only for literature students.",
    "This class is a gem. I hadn't ever taken an African Studies class, and all the authors we read were new to me, but I'm so glad I had the chance to take this course. The syllabus was excellent. The discussions were really good overall, and Steph was just a phenomenal teacher. She is one of the most caring and intelligent professors I've ever taken a class with, so if you can get in, take it!!!",
    "It was a great introductory class to African literature. One 25ish page paper due during finals. No weekly assignments. Very manageable reading each week---one novel and some supplementary articles. I would definitely recommend!!!",
    "I would 100% recommend this class. It is an incredible exploration of many incredible texts that you will not encounter in any other English class, Professor Newell is amazing, and the class discussions were consistently the highlight of my week.",
    "YES, I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to a fellow student. It opened my mind to an entirely new tradition of literature that I had never previously studied. (I especially recommend it to other English majors who would like to use their senior seminars as an opportunity to escape from the cannon of European literature and modern English poets, etc. etc. and explore a new world!!) Studying with Steph is an absolute thrill and pleasure, and you will learn so much from her. You will have no regrets: really: TAKE THIS COURSE!!!!!"
