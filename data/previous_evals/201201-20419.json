   "comments": [
    "I would say it is exactly what the course title describes. It is somewhat mathematically intensive and requires some programming experience. I would definitely recommend it if someone is interested in this area of biology.",
    "This is a good class for people who want to learn system biology or look at biology from a physicists'\/engineers' point of view. The first few homework may feel intense. But you will get over and enjoy it.",
    "Not worth taking it. The few things that you can take from it - modelling of chemical kinetics - can be learned in a few days of individual work on the side.",
    "Great class, all BME and MCDB students should take it.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Learned a lot from this course.",
    "A good class to audit but skip it as a class to take. Learn good information but the work expectation for it along with other classes is ridiculous. Also incredibly skewed towards being easy for CBB students and not really interdisciplinary. Too vague in stating requirements or expectations.",
    "good class, useful. psets take time.",
    "Yes. I would totally recommend this course! It introduces mathematical concepts in context relevant to current biological research landscape."

    "It did not.",
    "The course introduced me to the field of system modeling biology. I enjoyed learning it and may consider integrate the idea into part of my graduate\/post-graduate research.",
    "This course opened my eyes to things I never thought or cared about before and made them interesting and meaningful.",
    "Forced me to improve programming to the point of appreciation. Learned a little about systems modeling. Did not contribute at all to my research except originally thinking of maybe using some modeling and now would never. Actually, maybe I will but this class will not have helped at all.",
    "deepened my understanding of stochasticity and fluctuations in cellular systems--and how critical the contribution of noise is. also the role of feedback loops.very important to dissertation."
