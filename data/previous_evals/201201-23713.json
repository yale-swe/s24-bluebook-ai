    "if you get a project that's what you were hoping for, it can be very very instructive \/ useful.",
    "Field trip: visit to NRDC's offices for an energy efficient panel. Also private tour of Empire State Building retrofit, which was great.Regarding the class, it all depends on your client and the work you do for them.That being said, the class may be a little too \"legal\" for some F&ES students (if you are in it for the client work and not for the law side of things).",
    "The whole course is an out-of-class project. There were a few in-class exercises but they were not well-introduced or explained and expectations were unclear, which made it difficult to get anything out of them. The nature of this course is weirdly amorphic. Some groups are doing legal work, others LCAs, others business plans. It's all over the map. If it's a legal clinic, it should be run as a legal clinic, with appropriate projects, appropriate oversight (i.e., a team of professors, not a single part-time adjunct), and appropriate in-class exercises and discussions.",
    "The field trip to NRDC was a wonderful learning experience. I'm so glad I went. The sessions were extremely interesting. I also enjoyed the mock hearing.",
    "This has been one of the most valuable courses I have taken at FES. I have learned a lot of professional skills through this course.",
    "Clinics are probably the most useful classes at FES because the student consulting work gives us real-life experience with the work and situations we will face in our careers. By far one of the most valuable experiences at FES.",
    "I only worked for the client, and evaluated this course last semester.",
    "This course provides experience in analyzing and helping to solve real world problems. In that, it is unique and it provides students with the opportunity to effectively \"intern\" on a part time basis with the client organization. The workload is intense, which was stressed by both the faculty and the TA, but one never gets a true sense for how much so until one lives it. To do the course project right requires lots of time, which sometimes made me feel like the lecture courses piled on me. However, those lecture courses were very useful, and I would not suggest eliminating them.",

There is far too much theory taught in this school, and students don't get enough practice putting that theory to work on real projects. This should be a primary focus of a professional degree program.",
    "Obviously, the ability to work on an applied project and actually help a client in the real world is fairly unusual. I feel like I really learned how to prepare a report for an NGO, and I also feel good that something I wrote will be of value to other people, rather than disappearing into a professor's desk drawer.",

   "comments": [
    "bimonthly team meetings with the prof weren't necessarily useful, though I do understand they were there in case a team was falling behind etc.",
    "Eliminate the timesheet\/time tracking system. We are not in the workplace, and it's a pain to constantly keep track of hours.",
    "Most class sessions and were not particularly valuable. The class on writing as very basic and covered material that all students already know, so may not be necessary.",
    "The strict 120 hour requirement may not be the best way to gauge students' performance for the class\/client. I know that many project deliverables were complete in well under the 120 hour requirement. Asking that students adhere strictly to this requirement encouraged fabrication of the hours, giving the instructors\/TA an inaccurate measure of how much time was actually needed to complete a given requirement for a given project.",
    "I don't really have many improvements. I think it runs pretty well. The 12 hours a week is pretty rough; but people do it, obviously.",
    "Nothing; this was a great course.",
    "Nothing that Yale\/the instructor can actually improve, unless it's screening and prepping the clients a bit better about what the students can deliver and how much interaction\/direction the students do or do not need.",
    "In my case, the client organization was not so clear as to what issue we could solve or work on initially (up front). As such, the scope of our project shifted a few times, which was a bit disorienting and likely cost us time. Also, the client was not very responsive at times, taking long times to respond to the few emails sent to them. Perhaps clients could be coached a bit more on what is expected of them for purposes of the clinic.Lastly, the day of the class presentations (last day) did not run as timely as scheduled. Some groups were allowed to take much longer than their allotted time, which resulted in a time crunch for other groups. I would suggest being much stricter about the allotted time for each group. Students should understand that as professionals they will need to stick to the schedules they are given and not deviate needlessly.",
    "There might be a need for mid-semester group evaluations. I think this would have had some group members push forward towards the end of the semester rather than lagging behind.",
    "The timing of the mock trial and climate change negotiations was inconvenient since they were both in the same week. It would help in the future if they were spread out more so we can better balance our time with client work.Furthermore, our client at NREL could have been managed a little better in terms of expectations. The instructions he provided were not always consistent and sometimes asked too much of us in the given time frame.",

    "Disparate skills sets. This is an advantage and disadvantage, but it is certainly important to practice working in a diverse group.",
    "I really enjoyed my co-workers. They were all more knowledgeable than me, so I learned a lot from interacting with them. They were also just nice, interesting people who were pleasant to be around. And it was nice to have someone to share the workload, too. On the downside, they had all been working on this project for a while, and it was hard for me to just pick up in midstream. It took a couple months for me to really find my niche within the group.",
    "Group members took on various roles. This semester I took the clinicfor 1 credit, so my experience this semester was very different from last, but still rewarding.",
    "Advantages: exchange of ideas, ability to divide work, more individuals to keep the group on track time-wise, more perspectives and expertise brought to bear on the issue.Disadvantages: some things take more time to resolve, scheduling.",
    "Working on an interdisciplinary team is hard work. We were very good about having weekly meetings and keeping everyone up to date on our research progress. Having students on different schedules was sometimes a disadvantage to meeting deadlines in the clinic but this is unavoidable and by careful scheduling it can be overcome entirely.",
    "Having group members with diverse talents was extremely helpful in tackling research and analysis questions, but having many members on the team with sometimes conflicting schedules did occasionally slow progress of the team overall.",

Several people lagged behind in working on their project each week and ended up cramming their work into the last couple weeks classes\/exams.",
    "I would advise clarifying the expectations of your client. Write follow up emails after conference calls and rest assured that even if the beginning of the semester seems to go at a slow pace-- it will pick up in the end!",
    "You should really like your project inorder to stay motivated through the semester.",
    "Pick your project carefully and don't take it if you don't get the project you want.",
    "Definitely be proactive. Some clients probably tell you exactly what they need and want from you, but my client left it pretty open-ended. I wish that I worked harder to find a role of my own, rather than just picking up loose ends from my teammates.",
    "Keep up with your hours!",
    "Take as many Clinics as you can, it's so worth it.",
    "Make room for it. It will take much more time than you anticipate to produce a quality product.",
    "Make sure to define group tasks as clearly as possible and even sharing a google document where people have to check off tasks would be helpful. A few times we would assign tasks and then weren't sure if certain things got done. In the clinic, you are pretty much putting most of your colleagues on the honor system to get things done and the checking up to make sure everyone is doing what they said they were doing part can be difficult at times. I think an internal checklist shared with the group members could create more accountability with group members.",
