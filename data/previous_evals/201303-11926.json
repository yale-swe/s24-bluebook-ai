    "Hasmik is great. She genuinely cares about her students and tries to help each of us improve as individuals. She also stresses speaking in Arabic in class, which I hear not all teachers do. The workload is pretty hefty - daily either one to two hours a day.",
    "Definitely a great class! I had Hasmik, and she is a really, really great professor. She spoke to us in Arabic, which was tough but does help you learn grammar and vocab faster because you're always practicing it. She also brought us in tea and snacks sometimes, and even cooked with us once. I definitely recommend Hasmik as a professor. Overall, the class had a lot of reading from authentic sources, which was pretty tough and took a long time, but it's definitely not too hard or too much work to manage.",
    "If you made it this far in Arabic, it is definitely worth continuing to L3. This class is conversation-heavy and pretty much all in Arabic. I came out more comfortable speaking; however, the gap from L2 to L3 is huge, and it was challenging at the beginning to keep up with the conversations in class. Expect to not review grammar as much as in L1 and L2. A lot of this class is learning things on your own."
