   "comments": [
    "Great course. Very useful, pratical.Great structure. Good combination of labs and lecture.Allows students to become more comfortable with SAS.",
    "Strength: labs helped me solidify the concepts I learned in class.",
    "Exactly what we needed as an overview course to feel comfortable in data analysis. Great tour of SAS.",
    "Practical. I love the cookbook recipe format to learning SAS. I just want the simple explanation as explained in class.",
    "This class is so applicable to epidemiology and has been incredibly helpful. The powerpoints and lab assignments really help me comprehend the material. I will keep my data management notes and assignments forever.",
    "This course was fabulous. Everyone started out thinking it would be the worst class ever, but by the end, almost all of us really enjoyed working with SAS. It also helped my understanding of biostatistics. Don't change a thing!",
    "Very useful course, notes and skills will come in handy for years",
    "Very practical.",
    "SO important to be able to operate SAS. I feel a lot more competent now than I did at the start of the semester (though I still have a long way to go). Lectures are very dry and the concepts don't make much sense until you are sitting in front of a computer, but I guess they are still pretty necessary.",
    "This course was by far the most useful course I've taken at YSPH. All of the labs for this course will help me in my career. The course uses real world data sets to instruct us in analyzing data using SAS.",
    "Good course, not the most interesting of subjects, but I learned a ton. Totally worth it!",
    "The course was excellent. The material covered during the first few lectures helped clarify our rather incomplete understanding of SAS that was presented to us during Biostatistics 505A. Lecture covered similar information as Biostastics 505B and helped reinforce the material even further, but providing it in terms of SAS programing. The course did not only focus on how to program SAS but also how to interpret the output. Lectures usually provided reasoning as to why the particular method is to be used, SAS programming format, and extremely helpful examples. I think it may have helped to include some of the interpretations of the output on the slides since it's hard to be able to type\/write down every interpretation during lecture.",
    "The lab was unbelievably helpful, however, the actual lecture was dry, repetitive, and hard to pay attention to. This may be a function of the material-- I am unsure.",
    "The course is relevant for those who need to understand how to manage large amounts of data. I feel confident with my ability to use SAS.",
    "great class! i would not change a thing! i am now a lot more confident in my SAS programming skills!",
    "i think epi is so important to your understanding of public health, so this course was great for solidifying what i learned in epi 1.",
    "This was a great class. Very important to take this class to really know how to use SAS.",
    "Strengths:Labs are the emphasis of the courseLearn SAS from scratchWeaknesses:Instruction in SAS code from PPT gets tedious.",
    "The lecture seemed pointless. I learned most of the data management skills in lab, where there is practical application.",
    "It's a good class but the lecture style doesn't make it as engaging as it could be.",
    "Strength: This course explains very clearly how to organize, manage, and analyze data using SAS. I can see practical applications of the material in future projects of jobs.Weaknesses: Since there are so many ways to code SAS, the class tend to get into too much detail for how to code certain things. Perhaps the class can be shortened by 20 minutes?",
    "Though it was a somewhat hard course, I am pretty confident the knowledge and skill I gained from the course would be utilized a lot not only for the thesis project but also at the job.",
    "You learn a lot bout SAS and the assigments are useful. Listening to a lecture about SAS is difficult though.",
    "Assignments are clear, practical, and useful. Labs are very helpful. Lecture notes are also great, but it can be difficult to learn a lot during the actual lectures because it is not possible to follow along on a computer during class time.",
    "I learned a lot in this course - it started from the beginning, assuming little knowledge of SAS (you had to know some very basic details about opening SAS, the different windows in SAS, and the concept of typing commands), which was helpful for me because I waived both of the biostats courses and therefore had little SAS knowledge. It is not a comprehensive and exhaustive treatment of SAS; instead it teaches you what you would need to know to conduct epidemiological analysis. You don't get into the nitty gritty details about the biostatistics behind it all or how SAS computes various parameter estimates, which may be a good thing or bad thing depending on your perspective. The goal is to teach you how to clean and code data, plug and chug, and arrive at paramater estimates via bivariate or multivariate analysis, and understand what these estimates mean. If you only understand the biostats at a very superficial level, you'll be totally fine. From the this case, I feel confident that if given a dataset, I could analyze it and submit my results for publication.",
    "Strengths: You will actually learn SAS.Weaknesses: You will have to put up with Dr. Desai's endless paranoia of students cheating.",
    "Data Management is an excellent course. I highly recommend it to anyone who is hoping to utilize SAS for future research analysis.",
    "It's hard and time consuming, but it helps you learn Data Management.",
    "Data Management is a tough course that requires a lot of outside classroom time and effort. I don't think the time spent in lecture was very worthwhile considering Dr. Desai had such great lecture notes. Lab sessions were the most conducive to learning the material and I wish more time was devoted to the one-on-one experience with the TAs.",
    "The class was extremely helpful in understanding SAS coding. I would have preferred to have taken this prior to biostatistics - which requires writing SAS code first semester.",
    "The course is boring by nature but it was taught and practiced in a practical way that made it more interesting. Lab was engaging and I feel as though I actually became somewhat familiar with SAS lingo.",
    "This class was great- among the most practical and applicable I have ever taken! Even after one semester of biostatistics, I felt I knew very little about how to use SAS; however, after having completed this course, I truly feel much more confident in a myriad of procedures on SAS. The lectures were usually well-paced and each one covered lots of material, all of which was perfect for beginners. The slides walked us through everything discussed and will serve as an excellent resource in the future.",
    "Very good. Lab were helpful and educational. Maybe split the lecture into 2. Or have it earlier.",
    "learned important aspects of SAS. could maybe be twice per week rather than a long session once per week...it was a lot of sas code for one day!",
    "A very large number of students in the course makes it difficult with questions etc.I also beleive that more focus should have been spent on when to apply the different methods, and especially what to do when assumtptions are not met. Just running the analysis in the labs that Desai provides is easy, but when working on new data this might be different.",
    "This course was worthwhile! It provided me with the ability to code SAS in ways that I never imagined before and I am not afraid of SAS any longer. The lab sessions were practical ways to practice what Dr. Desai had taught throughout the week, and I feel that it was useful.",
    "Excellent intro to sas",
    "Overall, I believed this course to be very helpful for future analysis of data sets as well as for practical application of research methods and design.",
    "Fair. It's REALLY hard to listen to someone talk about SAS code for almost two hours once a week. Would benefit from WAY more lab time rather than lecture time.",
    "Structure was very boring. Also having class once a week for such a long period of time was very hard to sit through.",
    "Very useful in the long term for data manipulation in SAS",
    "This course offers practical and useful information on how to use SAS for data analysis. I found the powerpoints and coding tips to be of great use, especially for my own work on my thesis.",
    "S: the labs and definitely the exams help clarify thingsW: lectures were a little too long and a lot of information to wrasp in one lecture",
    "strengths: end product of the course is a good referenceweaknesses: instructor should provide sample code and output for students-- while i understand that everyone has their own approach to coding, sometimes my code would be wrong but i'd still manage to get output that matched the answers and wouldn't realize it was wrong until later assignments that revealed errors.",
    "The course was very good and allowed for practical application of SAS fundamentals. Lectures were a bit dry, but this is likely the result of the material and not the instructor.",
    "This is one of the most applied courses I have had the opportunity to take at Yale. It will be incredibly useful for my thesis. Without this course, I would have really struggled to do my own research, and might not have been able to figure out SAS.",
    "Great class. Will be able to use it on my Thesis.",
    "good course overallgood practical work and experience",
    "This was the most helpful course I took all year. The lab exercises are well put together and illustrate a lot of the points gone over in lecture. The material has a slight learning curve, so smaller meetings would be helpful as opposed to one 2 hour chunk per week.",
    "Strengths: Good introductory class for SAS based programming. Midterm and final are take-home exams.Weaknesses: Midterm and final are cookbook procedures so there is not a very good opportunity to explore data on your own terms. Also, there is no opportunity to collaborate with peers on the midterm or final, which makes the procedure tedious and time consuming.",
    "Labs were the most useful part of the course. Lectures were exceedingly boring; 2 hrs is too long to show slides of SAS code. The instructor should also slow down a little when going through slides."

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a great asset for Yale.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur's a great professor and he knows what he's teaching and talking about.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a wonderful teacher. His lectures are clear and his notes are well organized. He is also funny and makes data management fun. I do think the class can be shorted a little bit though.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very good.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is knowledgeable, clear, friendly, and available to help.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is clear, engaging, and responsive to student questions and concerns. He himself doesn't always know the theoretical biostats which underlies the SAS analysis, but he admits this and assures us that that is not the point of the class. The lectures, although long, were important. The labs were fair - the assignments go through the coding step-by-step. He does not give a lecture on a topic and then expect you to fend for yourself. The instructions are very methodical, which is helpful when learning SAS for the first time. Because of this, it is entirely possible to do the lab on your own without going to the lab session (which I did on a number of occasions). The midterm and final were appropriately challenging and fair. However, he does seem very strict and rigid sometimes. The way he addresses certain logistical concerns - like the honor code, asking for help from him or the TAs - is very intimidating. It is important to stress the honor code or the types of emails he will not respond to, but he could do it in a less aggressive way so that students are not afraid to approach him.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Lecture was a joke. For me, the only way to learn a computer skill is to actually have a computer in front of me and to start trying. The course could easily be learned through lab, without having a lecture.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is very insightful and knowledgeable. His labs are very well thought out and they highlight the main skill sets that are required to analyze any set of data. His lecture slides are very clear and he goes through them very thoroughly in an efficient manner. His exams are also very fair.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Desai is great a teaching Data Management, unlike Epi (maybe because of it's more objective manner), he is good to talk about Data Management with, and extremely good at explaining things. He makes himself open during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a great instructor. He explains the material well and really helps students apply what is learned. He is always thorough and concise in his lectures and has the best lecture notes of any of my previous professors. He was one of the few professors to keep me engaged during lecture.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor wasn't entirely helpful during lecture, read straight from the notes and didn't add much to them.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur did his best to keep it light and fun. Its hard to make statistical programming something to look forward to but again, it is necesary to learn adn at the end, I walked away with skills I didn't have before.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was very engaging, as he knew the material very well. His assignments were excellent. They were challenging yet methodically explained.My only complaint was that Dr. Desai continually threatened the class with repercussions of cheating. While I understand that this may have been a problem in the past, I was beginning to get offended by the end of the semester that we had to discuss this issue so often. In the context of a professional degree program, after signing the honor code, this should go without saying.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very good.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0made SAS interesting and convinced us that we were capable of tackling it. would have like to see some examples of long SAS codes just to learn the flow of them rather than piece by piece.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Prof Desai teaches in a very practical way which makes it easy to follow.Some of the lectures covered a bit too much information, and maybe it would have been a better idea with two shorter sessions for this course. At the end of each session there was often limited time to wrap things up.",

    "Jenna is the best TA at ysph",
    "The thing in general about TAs (particularly TA office hours) - it is VERY unhelpful to have office hours outside of the computer lab. I don't use SAS on my laptop, so it is almost impossible to ask questions since the exact problem is not in front of me. It would be much easier, instead of running to and from the computer lab, to just have office hours there.",

She cares dearly about everyone in her lab, and will go out of her way to make sure that the students get a good grasp on any SAS-related concepts. It is apparent that she spends a copious amount of time prepping for labs and giving feedback to everyone's lab write-ups. She is very supportive and she is always available. She even held review sessions for both the midterm andfinal exam. She is enthusiastic, funny and caring.",

   "comments": [
    "Overview of how to use SAS to conduct a variety of SAS procedures. An absolute must. AFter completing this class you will be confident in your SAS abilities.",
    "The course is a must-take if you're planning to use SAS after graduation, I have learned so much more with this course combined with biostat 2.",
    "Even though required, this is a wonderful course. To me this is what being an MPH student is all about.",
    "Good to take in your first year.",
    "Most practical course I took while at Yale. Will use everything I learned in practice",
    "This class provides students with tools to manage and analyze data sets.",
    "This class was great. You will learn more about SAS in this class than you will in a full year of biostatistics classes.",
    "Mayur is great and the material is very useful. Lectures may get too bogged down in details and are tough to follow",
    "Welcome to SAS! Starting at Step 1 and working your way to being able to design and execute a program from start to finish. A must-take class for anyone intending to any type or amount of research in their time at Yale or their career.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--it is very useful.",
    "Good course, challenging at times, but you really learn SAS well.",
    "Data Management focuses on SAS programming of various statistical methods but also how to interpret the data. This course will be and has already been helpful to me outside of the classroom. This will be even more important for the summer internship and thesis project. I would encourage students to take this course.",
    "Data management is like driving a car with a manual transmission. It is difficult, but once you get started, it is a smooth ride. I am glad I took the course because it helped me understand SAS so much better. I would recommend it to another student because it was a relevant course, especially for those pursuing a career in epidemiology.",
    "great class!",
    "you should take it, you'll learn a lot and Dr. Desai is fun. Watch out for his homeworks and exams. They are time consuming. you must be meticulous and expect that he'll ask anything!",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "It is an incredible class as far as the information presented. It is very practical. However, its hard to sit through a lecture about SAS coding. The lab was the most beneficial part of the course.",
    "It's a good class to take if you want to learn how to manipulate data effectively in SAS.",
    "This is a great course to take for students who will be working with large data sets. It focuses on using SAS and teaches you how to use and understand SAS. I would recommend it to another student. The professor is very good and the hands-on mid-term and final exams are very good in terms of tying together all the data management skills we've learned.",
    "If you want to know SAS for epidemiologists then take this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is extremely practical and I have already begun to the skills I have learned on other projects.",
    "I would recommend this course even to students who are not required to take it. It is a course that is important for all future epidemiologists, even if you will not be conducting the SAS analysis yourself in your future job.",
    "Unlike bio stats, you will learn SAS and become comfortable with it.",
    "This is one of my favorite classes thus far. I would highly recommend taking this class.",
    "The labs take forever, don't take short cuts, keep up with the work. Labs are absolutely the most important, class is fairly important as well, and the notes are good. Make sure you get all questionsanswered before the midterm is handed in, otherwise everything gets tight and freaks out.",
    "The course is applied epidemiology and biostatistics. Students finally get a chance to analyze data using what they learned in epi and biostats.",
    "This class is perfect for anyone wishing to increase their proficiency in SAS, from beginner to intermediate. I highly, highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in or thinks they may use SAS in the future.",
    "I would recommend. Good practice with SAS",
    "more in depth use of SAS and a great class to take if you want to analyze your own data.",
    "Data Management is a course that teaches you how to code SAS and understand the implications of the code.",
    "Def recommended if interested in learning basics of sas",
    "This course was a broad overview of the types of SAS coding available to do certain analyses. I would recommend this class to all MPH students who might work in data analyses and interpretation.",
    "Definitely worthwhile taking if you plan on using SAS at all in future endeavors.",
    "This class made SAS make sense. It was amazingly gratifying to write my own code and see results, because during first semester it feels like SAS is a completely foreign language. I would recommend this class to everyone, because at one point or another, we all have to use SAS.",
    "Totally recommended to a future student.",
    "absolutely necessary to anyone who needs to use SAS-- should be taught to everyone and admins should eliminate the SAS component to BIS I.",
    "Great intro to SAS fundamentals.",
    "Great class. Wished they had data management 2 though!",
    "I would recommend this class to all students who intend on utilizing SAS for the data analysis component of their thesis project or in the future for their career."
