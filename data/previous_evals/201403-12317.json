   "comments": [
    "Definitely consider it. Know ahead of time that the first half of the course is like a history class while the second half is much more theory-based, and the shift is abrupt. Either way, Skowronek is an engaging lecturer and you'll leave the course with a new perspective on the presidency.",
    "Lots of reading, but the material is very interesting.",
    "The American Presidency is a good class in which you go over many aspects of the executive branch not just a summarization of all of the presidents. The class also gives you great knowledge of how the American Government works. Yes I would reccomend because it has given me a great inside look at the workings of the Modern Executive.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you really love American politics and are fascinated by the presidency. Skowronek is an incredibly knowledgeable and fascinating teacher with some incredible theories - but beware the grading structure and the TAs. Having a good TA is absolutely necessary.",
    "This is definitely a good class. Take it if you're interested in American history, government, and politics.",
    "You better nope right out of this class immediately if its format hasn't changed by next semester. There's a reason one of the most famous writers in the PLSC department gets about 20 students in a half empty lecture hall. Need to update this. It's like doing the reading and work for Con Law, without any of the excitement and fun of Con Law.",
    "Highly recommended, even for non-political science majors. The course not only evaluates the American presidency but examines different facets of leadership and how those facets apply to today.",
    "The course is designed incredibly well; very thematic, and almost has a narrative flow to it; definitely offers what I believe is a unique theory on the presidency; would definitely recommend"
