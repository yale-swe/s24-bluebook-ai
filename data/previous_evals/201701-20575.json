   "comments": [
    "I loved this course, and I think it provided students with a strong foundation to succeed in the rest of their ER&M courses. I liked having the opportunity to link our discussions from week to week, and writing the reading responses made me a much more attentive reader and better at pinpointing the central arguments of a book.",
    "This course greatly strengthened my understandings of the background of ethnic studies as a discipline as well as some of the field's contemporary texts. The opportunity to develop a course unit for the class was a valuable exercise in curriculum development, something I am personally interested in. The class discussions were fruitful and allowed me to make more personal connections with other students in the major. This has been one of the most useful courses I have taken for my discipline.",
    "I re-learned to listen to how people's lived experiences inform their understandings of how white supremacy and racism function in the U.S. I also learned the power of the law in the ways in which it creates social categories to differentiate groups of people and reproduce racial hierarchies in this country (and abroad in many cases).",
    "Professor Barraclough made sure to provide a very extensive history of ethnic studies throughout the country, starting with where it all started. As a result, I learned a great deal of background about the major, which put things into context for me.",
    "This is a very important foundational course for the ER&M major. I learned a lot of theories about ethnic studies and covered a range of topics housed within the ER&M umbrella.",
    "I learned about the discipline of Ethnic Studies and the history of the discipline. We read the seminal Ethnic Studies texts giving me a broader understanding of the field.",
    "Great class for developing a comprehensive Ethnic Studies framework! The nature of the field of Ethnic Studies in the US that it often focuses on a specific marginalized group's relationship to systems of power and histories of oppression, but what is often left out is how all these groups relate to one another and also to power. This class does a great job filling that gap!",
    "This is a great survey introduction to ER&M. You learn a lot a read many essential texts throughout the semester, and learn how to situate current events in a rich context, as well as compare and contrast histories, experiences, modes of resistance\/resilience, etc.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I think the best part was being able to read and look at documents that were foundational to Ethnic Studies and its development. We were able to engage with scholarship that is very important to the field, and better understand why the field has taken the direction that it has. Further, the consistent writing throughout the semester really helped me with my time management and with my ability to present an argument in a concise and relevant way.",
    "I learned lots about ER&M as a discipline in higher education. Aside from that it's a good look into a number of topics that are important discussed in one week long units.",
    "I learned how to read a large amount of text, summarize, gather the author's main arguments, and analyze the text in relation with other texts and with personal experiences. I also learned about the different theories and aspects of ethnic studies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Fantastic reading list. Because this is a required course for the ER&M major, it tends to attract a group of students who are fully invested in learning from the texts and from one another in a supportive, engaged, dynamic classroom environment. Although the workload can feel on the heavier side--with a good deal of reading every week and a two page reading response due on 8\/13 weeks of the semester--Professor Barraclough is really good about providing substantive feedback on each and every assignment. This is a welcome change from most Yale courses and makes it feel like the professor is putting in the same amount of work that she expects from you. I do wish the final project (a 15 page literature review) had allowed for a bit more flexibility (it would have been great to be able to focus more on primary source analysis or personal experience), but from the conversation we had on the last day of the course it sounds like Professor Barraclough may be switching up the way she teaches the class in future semesters--so this might already be subject to change.",
    "The course's strengths include it's syllabus structure and the style of assignments (reading responses, course unit, and term paper). I do not believe the course to have had weaknesses, I enjoyed it greatly and got a lot from it.",
    "The strengths of this course are that 1) it opens up with giving students an overview of the formation of Ethnic Studies in its history and purposes, 2) it provides students with a well-rounded look into and practice in engaging with a variety of materials that can be found in different Ethnic Studies classrooms (i.e. migration, policy, history, literature, social media), and 3) it challenges students to see how they and their communities are constructed and policed through law.",
    "This course's strength came in the group discussion; it rarely felt as if we had a time where we had nothing to say and I think that's in part because Professor Barraclough asked a lot of thought-provoking questions. I also think the reading responses helped to have thoughts in people's minds so when they finally did sit down they knew what they wanted to say and had more cohesive thoughts. As for weaknesses, I am not sure there were any. I thoroughly enjoyed the class.",
    "I would say that the course was designed well. I personally enjoyed the conversation structure. The reading responses were often a fair bit of work on top of the readings, but the parameters were laid out at the beginning of the semester well.",
    "The structure got a little tedious at times. I liked the weekly reading responses, they made sure I was engaging with the material and had a strong grasp on the central arguments and themes we read about.",
    "This was a windersul class. It was Professor B's first time teaching it so understandably there were some kinks. Sometimes grading\/expectations were unclear, but overall very well taught.",
    "One of the things I liked best about this course was that Professor Barraclough gave us the option of doing any of the 8 of 12 weekly posts. Other professors often have you do every single post, and this doesn't take into account the realities of being at Yale. Further, I really liked that the final paper gave us a lot of freedom and allowed us to engage with something that might go on to be our senior project. I also really enjoyed the discussion and the way it allowed me to hear other students' ways of thinking and engaging with the material. Another great thing about Professor B was that she really values personal experience and personal knowledge, and acknowledges how valuable it can be in shaping academia and academic knowledge. This was extremely refreshing. Some things I would want to change about the course would probably be to change the kind of assignments to have something less traditional. I really enjoyed designing a course unit and seeing the different ways in which students like to lead class. Sometimes sitting around a table and talking for two hours can get a little repetitive, so having different formats for different class meetings would probably be helpful.",
    "strengths: really good syllabus for the most part. Good and interesting readings and good discussions in class. Reading responses are a significant portion of the grade which I really, really appreciated.",
    "I like that we talked about different aspects of ethnic studies, the readings were very very interesting, and our discussions were amazing. However, I would have liked if we were not assigned to read 2 books near the end of the semester at the same time that we had to work on a 15 page literature research paper. Also, I would have like to have engaged with different mediums, not just read all the time, but maybe watch documentaries. The weekly papers were useful in engaging in discussion, however, I am not sure if there was a grading rubric used, if so, it should have been much clearer as it was unclear as to why certain points were deducted and it would have helped in improving.",
    "I loved that this course brought the ERM majors together. Everyone in the seminar was thoughtful, engaging, and committed to building an open and honest community in the classroom, the major, and Yale. The challenge of this course is that it felt very repetitive and unstructured. I enjoyed the materials we covered, but it seemed to cover the same topics. I would also like to understand how this course creates the foundation of the major, so I think there should be some greater continuity between ERM 200,300, and the senior seminar, especially since the major itself is very interdisciplinary and broad."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It provides an important overview of the scholarly underpinnings of Ethnic Studies and, as such, provides an essential classroom experience that ought to be more readily available at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, though the seminar size cap is a limiting factor in who is able to take the course. If a similar seminar existed that was available to non-majors, I would recommend it highly.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to engage with Ethnic Studies in a way that goes into more analysis and discussion of class materials and the role of Ethnic Studies than does Intro to ER&M (similar overview, but closer analysis and more of theory and law instead of stories of particular groups of people).",
    "Aside from being required for the major, it actually covers a broad range of topics within the ethnic studies major and is super informative about the history of ethnic studies. Additionally, Barraclough is an amazing instructor who takes time to really contribute to discussions in a way that gets people thinking.",
    "You have to take this course if you are an ER&M major, but it's really well taught and worth it. It became one of my favorites of the semester. I found the material very engaging. Weekly reading responses, midterm proposal paper and final paper with a lot of guidance.",
    "Yes! Take Comparative Ethnic Studies! Be an ER&M major! You will read wonderful texts and learn lots.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student based upon their own level of commitment. Although I think this is the type of class everyone should take, it isn't one to be taken lightly to the point where I'd think it would be fruitful towards one's learning experience if they weren't invested in at least thinking about he subjects seriously.",
    "Yes!",
    "This class, as a broad study of the fields in Ethnic Studies, provides a really great starting point for thinking about the important issues in the contemporary moment. The syllabus is wonderfully chosen, and we read a mixture of canonical and modern texts, all of them feeling absolutely critical one's understanding of the present state of race and migration in America. We learned about mass incarceration, immigration, the construction of raced subjects, state surveillance all potent issues that need a class like this to help us learn and think through deeply. Professor Barraclough is a great teacher who guides your thought process while completely respecting the different viewpoints each and every student brings to the table. This class is not only necessary learning it's also great and enriching and an absolute joy to learn about these difficult issues under the confident and kind tutelage of Professor Barraclough.",
    "This is a great class and a necessity for ER&M majors. Some of our discussions talked about how ideally non-majors would take classes like this as well, but since there is such a high demand from majors it might not be possible. More classes like this should be offered at yale. It was intensive, interesting, and interdisciplinary. Definitely would recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I know it is a requirement of the ER&M major for junior year, but it really is a great course. Prof B does a great job of teaching it and is a fantastic, organized, and understanding professor who really cares about the class. This really makes all the difference in how the class goes. Also, the materials you engage with in this course are critical to a holistic understanding of Ethnic Studies and ER&M. I really enjoyed taking this course and am really glad that even though it's a requirement of the major, it isn't a drag in any way.",
    "The ER&M junior seminar is a great course in part because you get to meet all of the other majors in your year and have conversations with them. It's also pretty good material though likely you will have seeen some of it before. The workload is reasonable (it is a lot of reading) and I really appreciated the diversity of assignments.",
    "YES!"
