   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student, except be aware that it will be significantly more difficult if this is your first Spanish class at Yale.",
    "This class focuses on improving grammar and speaking skills in Spanish. It is operated solely in Spanish. The readings (and subsequent discussions) help to solidify new vocabulary and grammar skills. They also show a lot about Spanish culture. I would recommend this class to another student, because, although it was challenging, it was fun to become more comfortable with my speaking skills and to learn about Spanish culture through all the interesting readings.",
    "Spanish L3 as a whole is a generally good class--there is some work, but you really get used to it fairly quickly. As for Sybil Alexandrov, she is amazing. Completely and totally exceptional, and she makes the entire course so comfortable and enjoyable. I can't recommend her highly enough--if you get the chance to take her section, do it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have to take it. It is a lot of work, but it's enjoyable for the most part.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You learn a lot of Spanish and overall it's a very fair course.",
    "SPAN 130 was intense and a lot of work, but it did improve my Spanish skills significantly.",
    "Yes helped improve spanish and wasn't too much work.",
    "It's a fun class that legitimately made me better at Spanish. I would recommend it.",
    "This class focuses mainly on vocabulary and grammar, while being conducted entirely in Spanish. It is very effective to help people learn Spanish quicker and better. I would recommend this class to anyone else."
