   "comments": [
    "The first few classes, where we learned about basic joinery, wood, etc. weren't that exciting, but definitely crucial later. Loved the course overall - interesting readings, looking hours were always pretty fun, and Yale really does have a great representation of iconic American furniture.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get through the initial slowness.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. It is a really small, uniquely social class where you really bond with your peers over the subject matter, whether or not you were interested in furniture when you signed up for the class.",
    "Take this class!! Professor Cooke is an incredible professor. You will learn so much about furniture and by the end of the semester you will look at the material world in an entirely new way. The course readings are easy to get through and not too much (if you have a hard week, you can sometimes even skip them, but I read them all because I just loved the class so much). You get to meet in the Furniture Study which is a really cool place few Yale students get to know, and every class you have hands on experience with priceless pieces of furniture. Each week you gave a presentation about a piece of furniture, but by the second or third week these presentations didn't take much preparation-- all you had to do was go down to the Furniture Study, read over the object file, and look at the object a bit. In addition to these weekly, fun\/easy presentations, we had just three short written assignments and a longer final paper. This class was my favorite class by far my first semester. If you have any interest in Art History or how material objects influence and are influenced by the way we live, take this class.",
    "Do it if you find furniture interesting.",
    "In this class, we got to hold classes in the furniture study, an amazing roomThe first few classes were introductions, so they were more class-like. However, after that we started giving presentations every week. That sounds scary and like it would be a lot of work, but they were very informal. We would just go for looking hours on Monday for a while and study our pieces and get excited about other people's pieces and generally have fun. I'd definitely reccommend it- you learn a ton, and it's pleasant all the way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It's a great introduction to both art history and Yale's amazing furniture collection. After the first few weeks of learning about wood and joinery, it gets much better. Every week you do very low key presentation on a specific piece of furniture from a specific time period. The pieces in the collection are both interesting and priceless. Professor Cooke is amazing as well, you'll definitely learn a lot. The workload (3 essays at about 2-3 pages each, final 7-9 pg paper on any piece of furniture) is manageable. Only do the readings when it relates to your piece of furniture. Overall, it was a great class and I would recommend it highly!",
    "Take this. Do it.",
    "Each week every student is assigned one piece of furniture in the study to focus on. You observe it, read the file on that piece, and think about its context. Then, during class, everyone presents what they have learned about their piece - from its materials and construction to its function and back story. The class thinks about what this piece of furniture says about the period in American life that it is from. I would definitely recommend this class to all, even if you have not previously considered furniture or American Studies. After taking this class, I look at something I encounter in my everyday life in a completely new light, and I think that is something everybody could experience.",
    "Take this class. No, seriously. There's not much work (weekly presentations, 3 short essays, and one long paper) and you learn so much.",
    "The course is basically a survey of American furniture from the pilgrims to present. If you are interested in interior decorating or furniture in general, it's a must-take! Professor Cooke is also pretty incredible and super nice. The class is pretty much all presentation based with very minimal lectures. While this was intriguing, it could sometimes get a little boring when presentations dragged on or people obviously had not done the reading. The writing assignments were really interesting and not very difficult. This is one of those \"only at Yale classes\" which I would definitely take advantage of if you have an interest in the subject! The furniture study where the class takes place is also really cool!",
    "Furniture and American Life is an intimate discussion-style class ideal for any freshman interested in learning more about the evolution of American furniture over the span of the last four centuries. There is no perquisite knowledge necessary. The course covers all aspects of the furniture design process- design and construction, manufacture and production, wood grains, joinery techniques, historical and cultural implications, contexualization of pieces within specific American and English art and design movements, etc. Though there is \"suggested reading\" every week to supplement class discussion, homework is at a minimum and class presentations usually take on a friendly and informal tone. Professor Cooke does a great job making an alternately obscure andmundane subject personable and interesting. I would recommend this class to anyone."
