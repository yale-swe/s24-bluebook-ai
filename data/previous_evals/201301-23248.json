    "Take it! it's a lot of work but it's worth it.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. It is hard work, but take it anyways, because it teaches you so much about how to write good essays. Take it especially with Barbara Stuart. The readings were interesting and provided good (and diverse) models for our writing. The professor, Barbara Stuart, gave great comments, helped immensely during office hours (both with the content and the structure of the essays), led engaging discussions during class, and obviously cared a lot about her students. The system of draft one week and then paper the next was also good, because it forced you to think about your topic well and write a serious draft well in advance of your final draft, giving you time to look at your essay with fresh eyes when you rewrite it. Professor Stuart also keeps a \"Writing Tool Kit\" that is full of helpful advice about how to improve your writing. This contains readings as well as the advice that she gives in class and analysis of good writing techniques in our general class readings. Reading the sample student essays that Professor Stuart posts is also very helpful in understanding what you can do with each essay (although Professor Stuart's guidelines never seemed to be strict, as long as your essay vaguely fit into the instructions and was a good essay). The one aspect of the class that I am slightly ambivalent about is the workshops. Some of the comments from the workshop are very helpful, particularly if your first draft was on point; however, the conflicting advice from other students is sometimes difficult to sort through. Yet even this should notpresent a problem as long as you attend Professor Stuart's office hours that week and ask for her advice. This has been one of the harder and probably the most time-consuming courses that I have taken at Yale so far, but it has been completely worth it.",
    "Yes, providing the student likes writing and is interested in improving it.",
    "Yes, take it, it's hard but very very worthwhile. I probably wouldn't take it concurrently with another hard writing class unless you think you can handle it.",
    "Take it before you graduate. A staple. Also worth every second of your time--you will get better at writing.",
    "This is as they say, one of the classes that everyone should take sometime in their freshman or sophomore year. This section with Stuart is particularly good, and for the most part the readings were great. It's an excuse to read the New Yorker, Lena Dunham, and David Foster Wallace. It's also great to discuss them in class as well. The essays are for the most part interesting, and require a lot of revisions to do well. The final essay, Why I Write, is a great reflective piece to end the semester. Stuart has been doing this for a long time, so the class is organized and the workload is manageable. This is a must-take in order to learn how to write.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as a way to improve your writing. It's incredibly fun and rewarding to write about yourself and the progress and satisfaction that come from this class more than redeem the sometimes lagging class discussion.",
    "I'd recommend it to another student because although it was a lot of hard work and many all nighters, it was rewarding to write so many essays and explore your personal beliefs in any way that you want in the essays.",
    "I would recommend English 120 to another student if they want to take a course on personal essay writing. It is also recommendable if you try to get the most out of it and really workshop your pieces so that your writing improves."
