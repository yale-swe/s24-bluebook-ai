    "If you are chemistry or chem e then you have to take it. If you are mb&b then you might want to consider it. I have heard it is better than the new pchem with bio apps. And it definitely isn't that much work. I don't know how relevant the other course is towards stuff you might actually want to know. The course covers very few apps. Mostly it is just derivations.",
    "If you like math, this will be an easy course. Otherwise, you will lose 20 points on each test. In fact, for the majority of people, lectures will be completely useless; since they are pretty much a summary of the textbook, they won't help those who get it easily, nor will they save people who are struggling to weave through the endless array of partials and integrals. Grading is ridiculously easy, so my advice is to just put something. Chances are you will be rewarded generously for your efforts.",
    "This semester, Chemistry 332 was a lot of basic thermodynamics, some applications of thermodynamics, and a small taste of kinetic theory and kinetics. We didn't end up covering the whole syllabus for the class, which is a shame because it seems like some of the more interesting things were at the end of the syllabus. We spent a lot of time talking about central concepts such as entropy, enthalpy, etc. which was great because they're so fundamental but at the same time it felt as if some of the time time could have been better spent applying the concepts to more interesting things.All in all, a lot of the material is flat out dry. It's not easy to get excited about deriving the relationship between an equilibrium constant and the pressure (ha -- got you, Keq is independent of pressure). That being said, Professor Schmuttenmaer is really lively and does a good job ensuring the class is not painfullyboring. At the same time, he seemed a little flaky. Twice throughout the course he did not show up for lecture. Once was due to illness, and is understandable, but the second time was during reading week because he forgot to set his alarm. Mistakes happen, I know, but I think that everyone was a little bitter that we had to get up science hill during reading week for a 9:20 class only to have the professor sleep through it.The class isn't that challenging. Some of the material is pretty complex, but the exams (so far at least -- still have the final tomorrow) have focused on the easier, more central stuff. You get massive formula sheets so there's an emphasis on understanding the equations and their predictions rather than memorizing them. Problem sets were FAR more challenging and time-consuming than exam questions, which was a bit of a downer as they were only worth 5% of our grade total...Don't be too worried about the physics part of the course. My last experience with physics was AP Physics in high school and I've never felt behind in this course. Make sure your math skills are good. A lot of the problems end up as messy algebra. I imagine it'd be really helpful to be familiar with partial derivatives coming into this course.In short, would recommend. Chances are you'll take it for your major anyway so it's not much of a choice but it's not a bad class by any means. Keep up and you'll do well.",
    "I would take CHEM 332 again, it's very straightforward PChem. Stay on top of the problem sets and supplement with the textbook and you'll do just fine. Just don't take it your senior year.",
    "Most of the semester was spent on thermodynamics. We also spent a bit of time on electrochemistry and then squeezed in some kinetics in the last couple weeks. The lectures follow the book very, very closely. Professor Schmuttenmaer makes the lectures fun and can keep your attention pretty well, but occasionally he gets a little disorganized. The weekly problem sets are very reasonable. There are three hour exams and a final. The exams are actually quite different from the problem sets. Also, they are not too difficult, but for some of them you might be short on time.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the fundamentals of chemistry- if you want to be a scientist you should really take this class.",
    "Sure, it's not too difficult and you'll encounter worse required courses.",
    "You aren't reading this review unless you've had organic already. This class is easier than organic. However, it is a ton of math. Your background knowledge in calculus and intro physics will be equally or more uesful than your experience with chemistry. The tests are not that hard but you obviously need to study. The psets are a lot more complex and difficult than the tests (making them poor study aids).Schutenmaer was an entertaining lecturer but not the most organized or informative. I never missed a class despite the 9:20 time slot, and I highly recommenddoing the same, because the tests are based more on lecture material than book material (he follows the book pretty closely though).",
    "It's not as bad as people say it is. Professor Schmuttenmaer's test are all about speed though so watch out for that.",
    "Chem 332 is an interesting class, and Prof. Schmuttenmaer is a hoot! Seriously, he will make you laugh about volumetric flasks. The problem sets and exams aren't bad. This class is good for people who like chemistry and math.",
    "Yes. This one is much better than the 328 one, which is too simply if you want to learn real PChem. The course is fairly comprehensive and covers basic theories in both thermodynamics and kinetics. It's also well organized, although the later part is a bit loose and was not given enough time. The only thing is that the professor was later for class twice -- one is for a make-up class in the reading period for the previous lateness. This should be improved. Otherwise, it's a great course.",
    "This class is quite manageable; invest the time to complete problem sets and understand concepts and you'll do fine. I did not take this course with the lab, though. Section was very helpful. The textbook was clear and lecture material corresponded well with reading without being overly redundant. Problem sets and tests were fair and provided a goodmethod for measuring progress. The pace of the course was good and I felt like the sequence, depth, and number of topics covered was appropriate. Professor Schmuttenmaer is a good lecturer as far as science classes go.",
    "Prof. Schmunttenmaer is very enthusiastic and has a good sense of humor when he teaches, but he does teach basically to the book. The difficulty of his tests can vary; the first two midterms were much more difficult than his last midterm and final, making it really hard for someone to catch up from a rough start.As for the material itself, it is mostly thermodynamics, with only a little about kinetics at the end. I think Prof Schmuttenmaer wanted to cover more about kinetics, but he ran out of time in the semester. If you wanted a class more about kinetics you might want to look elsewhere.",
    "My guess is you won't be taking this unless you have to, so my opinion isn't all that helpful, but for the record it is a good class and I learned a lot. Unfortunately, a lot of thermo isn't new to me, so it wasn't all that interesting, but nonetheless it was worth it. Also, the curve has the potential to really screw you, so don't take it unless you think you can actually MASTER the material; a firm grip is apparently not strong enough.",
    "As a biochem major, I wanted a good foundation inactual chemistry, and this course certainly provided that. Not as challenging as it has been made out to be, the problem sets this year were really not bad at all (3-4 hours tops). The tests were inconsistent, but the hardest part about them is that the course is filled with such smart students. The concepts are hard to grasp, and to be honest, schmuttenmaer wasn't the greatest at explaining them. he was in general easy to follow, though a little bit spacy (he slept through class one day). Nevertheless, if you are interested in learning real chemistry, this is a course you have to take, and one that you can enjoy. Also, michael williams is a beast of a TA.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chem332 to another student, because you relearn basic chemistry concepts but with a much more rigorous and mathematical approach. Worthwhile class and a fair amount of work that is rewarding.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It feels like the class that explains everything that you have been told in the past to just memorize and someday somebody would explain it for real. Well, this is it. Prof. Schmuttenmaer teaches straight out of the book, but the book is dense, and I would definitely recommend going to class. Exams seem like they are full of random questions, but they are mostly just applications of things we have learned, and if you understand it they really aren't that hard. I actually enjoyed studying this material, but maybe then I'm just a nerdy chem major. Take it if you want to understand everything in gen chem that never made sense.",
    "Chemistry 332 is a tough course, not necessarily due to the complexity of the material, but because of the people who are taking it. Most people who are taking it are taking it the second time, after having dropped it the year before. They already know the material and end up doing very well on the test, which makes the curve really difficult to beat. That makes other people drop andtake it the following year, creating a vicious circle. In addition, although Prof. Schmuttenmaer is very good at teaching, I personally thought the thermodynamics&kinetics concepts covered were quite boring.",
    "I would recommend this class only to those who want to learn, because you might not get the grade you want from this class. The material covered in this class is very useful and interesting, and you will enjoy learning it. But because everyone in this class will do well, don't be disheartened when you get below average scores.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with a fairly strong aptitude for science. I'm taking this class to fulfill the advanced physical sciences requirement for the math major, and I found the material to be accessible and the pace to be reasonable.Prof Schmuttenmaer's love of teaching is something of a rarity in the sciences (at least from the courses that I've taken), which makes the early mornings up science hill a worthwhile trek. He does tend to go off on tangents that aren't really relevant to understanding the material (we once spent a whole class watching videos of phase transitions) and glosses over other topics that end up being really important on exams, but his quirky personality really is part of what makes him a fun and engaging lecturer.Just about every pset has a problem that takes absurdly long, and homework is worth next to nothing, so it was hard to justify staying up late every Thursday to finish. Be warned that distributions on the exams vary wildly, and in our case the scores got steadily higher so that it ended up being impossible to get 2 std devs above the mean on the 3rd hour exam and the final exam. Like most chemistry classes, the top of the curve is really competitive, but staying on top of the material and getting a good grade is definitely doable.",
    "I actually had fun. Problem sets were mostly painless, exams were sort of annoying, Prof. Schmuttenmaer is fantastic.",
    "Prof. Schmuttenmaer is a good professor for this class.",
    "The class is pretty much just taking physical principles and equations and applying them to chemistry concepts to help further explain them, such as ideal behavior of gases or thermodynamics of different processes.If you are a Chem major, you probably will have to take this class and so I recommend it. I imagine this course is not much harder than the Pchem with biological applications. If you think more quantitatively, then I think this class is much better since the exams are fair\/easy given that you just have to think fast and solve problems, not really spit out facts or do too much memorizing.As long as you pay some attention in lectures, do the problem sets, and review a little in the book, it's fairly easy to keep up with everything and you won't feel like you have to cram for the final."
