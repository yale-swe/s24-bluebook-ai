    "I'm very glad this class exists. Utilities are a vital part of the energy system and understanding how they work and think is super important. The presentation of the content isn't super dynamic since Larry mostly reads slides, but he tosses in fascinating tidbits from his work experience, which is always very interesting.",
    "The class was OK for what it was (trying to teach a dry subject). However, the assignments were not well developed, and did not provide much in the way of a challenge. In addition, in class assignments\/exercises would be very very welcome, and might help with a 3 hour lecture. Grading was unclear and inconsistent (e.g. when comparing with other students, some got points and some didn't for the same answer). There is no clearly defined metric for understanding of the material, so an exam might be a better option as well.",
    "Extremely useful material but delivered in a very boring way. The lectures needs to be livened up with student presentations, more material from outside the US, more case studies, etc.",

    "The depth of the material was excellent and we learnt just about everything we could on utilities and the energy industry in general in one semester! Its a lot to cover but all very necessary....",
    "This class provided a wealth of information in a very specific subject area. The assignments were well thought-out and provided great insight to the lectures.",
    "It was nice to have a practitioner teaching a course on electric utilities, with real experience in the field.",
    "Provided technical understanding of utility industry, the nuances of which are essential to our transition to clean energy but are less often discussed than simple installation of renewables",
    "The final couple projects allow you to go in-depth into a utility and a utility project, which allowed us to really dive into the issues in detail.",
    "The professor is earnest and better than many tenured professors at FES.",
    "The weekly homework assignments did deepen my learning. The field trip was cool but the presentation went on for a bit longer than it needed to and had a lot of overlap with basic concepts from class. That being said it's really nice ISO NE host us.",
    "The material was very useful and structured well.",

    "It's good to have an overall view of the electricity market in the United States.",

   "comments": [
    "Would be useful if: 1. The teams for the group project are released\/setup at the beginning of class, that way students can do the group project at their own pace! 2. Assignments like the final case study\/group project were tricky because finding information was hard. The sooner these assignments are released the better, gives students enough time to start taking a look and finding info. 3. Definitely more interaction but in a concrete way so for example, maybe the last 30 mins of class students can present something on the topic being discussed. Have questions for students to read up on before each and every class and have a discussion about those questions. Above all avoid the professor talking the whole time, by having students have to read up and have to discuss and maybe linking to their participation grade it will incentivize them to participate and be even more engaged. 4. It takes time, money etc to do this but maybe two field trips per semester. For example to visit a power plant or a utility. If the utility agreed you could ask a group of students to do the heavy lifting and make the logistics happen 5. Lastly the course could borrow aspects from RE Project finance to make it a practicum. Ie exercises like the deconstructing rate cases, working out tariffs etc. Maybe we could even have in class exercises so that students also leave with hard skills.",
    "The pace of the course could use a few adjustments. Especially in the second half of the course.",
    "Larry's a great guy, but his teaching leaves something to be desired. His slides are verbose and dry, and the content seems to be getting outdated. If I could give him two pieces of advice, they would be: 1. Make the course more engaging, in whatever way you can. I think a simple way of doing this would be to constantly be asking the class questions, instead of just lecturing to the class. The size is right to do that. If it means you can't cover as much material, that's ok. It would help people understand things better and learn more from each other. 2. Part of the name of the course is \"an industry in transition\" -- the content should reflect this. There is so much that's constantly changing about the electric utility industry, yet much of our reading, the slides, and graphs and data we were looking at were from 2013-2014. It would be great if the class were constantly updated to reflect the newest regulatory filings, utility proceedings, and best practices so students looking to go into the industry can get the most possible value out of the course.",
    "In-class engagement, assignments, grading, structure, pace.",
    "I think this class needs to be restructured and revised to truly reflect the changing nature of electric utilities and properly prepare students to enter the field. The material needs to be presented in a more engaging manner with more class dialogue. The bits of discussion were very forced and basic so it didn't really provoke much participation. The group project needs to be much more specific and engaging - it was clearly an assignment to check a box for the class and I can't say I learned much from it. I think electric utilities are really interesting and complex, but this class needs to be redone. Maybe bring in speakers who are working on the ground, and from a real range, not just from the old school industry. The last bit of the class focus on the current controversial topic and I just don't think Larry has as much experience in this sector so I still feel like I lack a lot of knowledge on these issues and this would be good opportunities for guest speakers.",
    "The course could be a bit more interactive, especially for such a long class period.",
    "The instructor is very slow - the lectures are very long and drawn out and not super interesting. Part of it has to do with the nature of the material - but part of it has to do with how the course is taught. It could be a lot more interactive.",
    "Lectures were dry and information was outdated",

Came highly recommended from previous students who wanted a US electric utilities primer, and I have been highly recommending it to students who want the same.",

A project of that nature would be too much for one person, it's a great idea to have groups and perhaps the final case study could also be done in groups? Downside is teams were formed late. Teams should be decided right after shopping period so that everyone gets a full semester to work on their individual portions, it can only raise the overall quality.",
