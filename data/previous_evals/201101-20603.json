    "Of course, I had thought about how my story, our stories, inform our work but I hadn't engaged this idea with the kind of rigor the course provided. I feel better equipped to apply the autobiographical in my work as a writer and teacher.",
    "It gave an excellent opportunity for self reflection and meditating in what is at stake in writing of any sort. Especially thinking about the fact that all writing even literary criticism is very useful and true. I more at ease with this fact because of Professor Stepto's class.",
    "Gave me the tools to do analysis of autobiography genre, which I didn't realize but does involve methods and ways of thinking that are not part of reading regular ol' fiction"
