    "Yes. The course offers a wonderful opportunity to practice Spanish while learning about Latin American politics. It covers a pretty broad range of material, and I felt that I came away with a much better understanding of the region. Carballal is excellent--she guides the discussions brilliantly and is always willing to help outside of class.",
    "It is a great way to fuse Spanish with international relations, but I would not recommend it for someone who was not yet interested in the subject of foreign affairs. It is definitely an interesting Spanish class, and a different approach on learning the language which I thoroughly enjoyed, but the readings are difficult and long. Take this course if you like foreign politics.",
    "It's a relatively low-key Spanish class with some interesting discussions. I'm not really sure what I learned over the semester, but it was good practice of my Spanish. If you are looking for vocab or grammar practice, this isn't the course for you. It's mostly about discussions, learning a little about Latin America, etc. You will practice writing somewhat.",
    "I highly recommend it! I took it because I needed to get a language credit and didn't want to do conversational because it seemed pointless. This course teaches you a lot about latin america although a disproportionate amount of time is spent on argentina (prof is from argentina). My language skills have greatly improved and I feel definitely more comfortable in my speaking and writing. I came in as sophomore who took ap spanish in my junior year of high school so it had been awhile. But this class was still accessible and not too hard. Reading assignments were hard at first, but towards the end I could read them as quickly as I read english and often times without a dictionary or anything, which was extremely rewarding. Take it instead of conversational, you'll get so much more out of it. Pretty easy to get an A-, a bit harder to get an A.",
    "While this class wasn't all that I was hoping for in that it didn't meet my expectations, it was still a pretty good class. I would recommend it as a fifth class. Much of the class honestly depends on your fellow students taking it, but Professor Carballal still did a pretty good job in explaining the material. The workload was totally manageable: anywhere between 10-30 pages a week, two papers, and two simulation exercises to prepare for. (No exams.) These simulations were good opportunities to engage more personally with the material and to practice arguing in Spanish. What I didn't particularly like was the source material: It was almost all opinionated commentaries and rarely merely objective historical accounts (despite the fact that much of the class focused on historical events in Latin America). The few primary sources (speeches, letters, etc.) were appreciated. Carballal made an honest attempt to paint things objectively, but her leftist tendencies inevitably showed, including the readings in the course packet. In sum, if you're looking for an opportunity to discuss politics in Spanish, this is the class for you. But if you're looking to actually learn more about Latin American political history, as I was, you might be better off taking another course.",
    "Spanish 224 is a class that briefly touches on a lot of different aspects of Latin American politics. This is interesting in the sense that you get to learn superficially about several topics. However, this also meant that class discussions weren't very useful because they generally reinforced what people already believed about certain issues. Moreover, class discussions could be discouraging if you disagreed with Professor Carballal's opinions on the issues - it felt like differing opinions were not always welcomed. That being said, Professor Carballal is an incredibly interesting and intelligent speaker who knows a lot about the material. I would recommend Spanish 224 if you enjoy debating.",
    "This course will push your Spanish to the next level. The essays and simulations taught me to use Spanish to express political opinions. Do not go into this course expecting serious Political Science. The readings can be boring, discussions can drag, and you will learn little about Latin America. Only take his course if your goal is to be able to argue in Spanish and use the language for political discussion. I would, however, highly recommend this course for Spanish learners.",
    "Absolutely take it! Profesora Carballal knows so much about the material, and she is very helpful with writing and research. Class discussions are always engaging and sometimes turn into intense debates. The papers give you flexibility to delve a little deeper into something you find interesting. Whether you want to keep your Spanish sharp or learn about Latin American politics, this is a great class.",
    "Professor Carballal is an absolute gem. She is highly knowledgeable about all the material covered, and her grading is not too harsh. She always provides constructive criticism, and the way she has structured the course makes for a smooth ride throughout the semester--you won't find yourself stressing for a test or trying to play catch-up. The 15-person class size makes for good discussion. Take this course if you want to gain a holistic understanding of 20th-century South American politics, movements, and individual leaders. I didn't know much about South America before and am walking away with a good working knowledge of the continent's politics. Don't worry about the intensity of topics; they are presented assuming students lack prior knowledge and never delvetoo deeply into any one subject.",
    "Spanish 224 is an excellent advanced Spanish course that explores historical and contemporary issues in Latin American politics and international relations, including democracy, populism, U.S. relations with Colombia and Cuba, and freedom of the press in Latin America.If you are interested in Latin American politics and are looking to improve your Spanish, I strongly recommend that you take this class. Although the readings can sometimes be challenging, Prof. Carballal explains the material well and works hard to make the class discussions interesting, encouraging her students to examine the issues from different perspectives. Perhaps the most difficult yet most rewarding feature of the course, the two debate-like simulation exercises compel students to rapidly craft and articulate arguments in Spanish. Overall, if you keep up with the readings, participate in class, and approach each topic with an open mind, I think that you will enjoy this course and deepen your understanding of Latin America."
