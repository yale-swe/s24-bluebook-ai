    "For requirement.",

    "i hate the forign language requirement",
    "I recommend it. Not incredibly hard, more of a review of the past two years with few new concepts and a fun syllabus.",
    "It is a very thorough review of Spanish. Like most classes at Yale, the class is largely dependent on the instructor's personal strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Basically a review of what you already learned to make sure you are ready for higher level spanish.",
    "It is an overview of Spanish 110 and 120 with a bigger emphasis on literature and culture.",
    "A lot of work since there's class everyday, but if you do it all you can get a good grade. I think Oscar is a good teacher and recommend him to others",
    "It's a fine class. My speaking got better, but it could have been more efficient. Obviously, the everyday deal get's tiring. Most of the people in the class are there because they have to be for requirements, anyway."
