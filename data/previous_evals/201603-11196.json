    "An insight into higher mathematics \/ abstract mathematics and some if its applications to linguistics",
    "I learned about a range of mathematical topics and how they are applicable to linguistics. A lot of what I learned is how to think about and approach a problem and what types of reasoning are relevant in this area. I learned how not to be intimidated when confronted with a really long written-out problem with lots of different symbols in it (an important life lesson!). I learned how to reason out and write mathematical proofs.",
    "Basic literacy in set theory, abstract logical\/algebraic skills, some experience in representing linguistic systems with formal models.",
    "A whole lot of useful theoretical computer science, for those who come from a Moreno Ca bent. It is a great crime that Yale CS has no real theory of computation course, but between Phil 427 and his course, I think the rest of Yale stepped up."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Frank is a very engaging lecturer and a deeply compassionate professor who wants to ensure his students learn. He was good at communicating complex ideas. Having said that, the material was extremely challenging, and though I took it for the intellectual stretch, I feared by the end of the semester that I had chewed off more than I had bargained for. My suggestion would be to assign letter grades for the p-sets and the mid-terms, just because it would have been reassuring (or not!!) to know how we were doing.",
    "I think it could benefit from having more frequent problem solving sessions. However, I generally liked the format\/participatory nature of the course. Professor Frank is very enthusiastic about the material, and I think he does a very good job with pacing.",
    "I think that the content and organization of the course was very good, and I think that the homework and exams were well-designed and useful. I liked how the workload was distributed very evenly throughout the semester, and I think that it had a good balance between challenging and manageable. I would like to have gotten the graded problem sets back more quickly and with more detailed feedback.",
    "The strengths of this course are that you will learn SO much. This course presumes you know nothing about linguistics (although if you do have some background knowledge, that would obviously be helpful) and then by the end you will know so much in this field. Another strength is Professor Frank's enthusiasm for the material which will often make you excited about learning it. The weaknesses of the course are the pace and the intensity. This class demanded so much of my time and even then, I felt like I was unable to give it as much time as it needed for me to not get behind. The class definitely prevented me from giving enough time to my other four classes. This was especially true around midterm time and finals time. He gives out take-home exams which took me around 30-40 hours. It wasn't just me who took that long - everyone I spoke to expressed the same feeling that they were very very demanding assignments. It was extremely hard to balance with my other papers\/projects\/exams. Also, during finals week, we had a PSET due over reading week in addition to the take-home final. It was just so much work. I think I would've liked this class a lot more if I could have devoted the amount of time it needed, but sadly that just wasn't possible for me with my other courses\/extracurricular activities.",
    "Professor Frank's lectures were always extremely clear; however, I did sometimes wish I had a handout, or access to slides, to supplement the notes I took in class, since we tended to move very quickly. Since I lacked any prior experience in linguistics or college level mathematics, this course was extremely challenging for me; I understand that, to some extent, it has to be challenging, but I wish I'd had a better idea of what I was getting into.",
    "The course material was excellent -- we got exposures to whole lots of useful CS theory as well as math that was otherwise kind of inaccessible to. The non math genius (group theory for example, without taking Asher's bruiser of ancourse). The instructor was great and funny, but he frequently cancelled class. Which was fine since it was for Jewish holidays, but then made us come to class during reading week despite this not being an RP course to make up for his absences which was unfair, considering the number of things we had to juggle that week. Also, he wa slate a few classes. But this is only a problem because of how great a teacher he was. This was perhaps the most intellectually interesting course I've taken this semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but know what you are getting into! Only take it if you really want to stretch yourself.",
    "Yes. I might recommend starting off Credit\/D, because it's hard to know at first how easily the material will come to you. However, I think I learned quite a bit and generally really enjoyed the material.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who likes math, puzzles, and\/or logic and wants to learn formal implementations of that sort of thing in a rigorous but accessible way. This class is nice in that it is simultaneously challenging, manageable, and appealing to people from different backgrounds. It covers really cool mathematical topics in a way that is more relaxed and approachable than the parallel courses offered by the math department (e.g. set theory or discrete math). If you don't like QR and problem sets or are easily frustrated by those things, I would not recommend it, because it is not easy and the topics require thought and attention to really figure out. You also pretty much have to be in class in order to understand what is going on, so if you like to skip class a lot I would not recommend this one. Professor Frank is excellent and there is a lot of opportunity to ask questions and get extra help. Also, the workload is spread out very consistently throughout the semester, which was nice. I am very glad that I took this class!",
    "This class is fantastic and fascinating. Professor Frank is great at teaching complex concepts in a way that makes them (relatively) easy to understand, and there's lots of really cool math and computer science material in this class that most people wouldn't otherwise be exposed to.",
    "You will learn a lot and much of the course is very interesting. Professor Frank is a great professor and is so excited about the material. However, just be wary of the time commitment that this course demands.",
    "DO NOT TAKE FOR AN EASY QR. The course is extremely well taught, and Professor Frank is great -- he has an encyclopedic knowledge of the subject material, he's an excellent lecturer, and he's very helpful in office hours. But: the class moves quickly, and the problem sets are often very, very difficult (especially if, like me, you have no prior experience with linguistics or college level math). The take-home exams were brutal (especially the midterm). I had no idea what I was getting into -- this class, which I took to fulfill distributional requirements, ultimately consumed more of my intellectual and emotional energy than any of my other courses. If you're really into the topic, and if you're good at math\/formal logic, then go for it. If not, proceed with extreme caution.",
    "Take this course. Just do it. Ye huddled masses oppressed by the ridiculous difficulty of pure math courses, by the startling lack of breadth in the Yale CS course offerings, come forth. Bob Frank will teach you advanced pure mathematics (groups, algebras, lattices) and theory of computation (CFGs, pumping Lena) eith grace and clarity and a little bit of wit. This is perhaps the one of the best CS courses there is, and the best Math course, but it isn't listed in either department, making it a gem to find. Take this course if you want to learn, not just grade grub."
