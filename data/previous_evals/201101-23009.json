   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class because it offers a very interesting topic that is been explored only minutely.",
    "It's a good overview of Latin American history. I didn't know much about it coming in to the course.",
    "A good class for those interested in the History of Science and History of Medicine major, and for others, an easy way to get a humanities credit. It was interesting to see the implications that science and medicine had on a global context.",
    "I would recommend this course. I learned a lot about Latin American history, economics, politics, and society. Public health? Not so much, especially in lecture, where it was often tacked on as an afterthought. This is mostly a history class viewed through the lens of public health policies. The readings were quite interesting (who would've thought that c-sections were originally evangelistic?), though they all have the same bottom line: public health is used to subjugate certain groups of people. The workload and tests are manageable, and Prof. Espinosa is nice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I really liked this course. I was hoping that it would be more about public health and less about the history of Latin America, but I thought the material was very engaging. Professor Espinosa makes the material interesting and I enjoyed going to lectures. The class also didn't have an overwhelming amount of work.",
    "I didn't get anything out of this class. I took it because I'm interested in Latin America and I thought it might help me get a more complete picture of Latin American history, but it really didn't. Section was BRUTALLY boring, the readings were even more boring, and lecture (although it was usually really interesting) had nothing to do with public health. Everyone keeps saying that this class was the perfect balance between history and history of medicine, but I totally disagree. It was like taking two different classes- one a broad overview of Latin American history from a leftist perspective, the other a close analysis of several random and obscure essays about disease in Latin America. The class is really easy, though, if that's what you're into.",
    "If you're interested in History of Latin America, and want to relate it to Public Health, take this course. It's great, the work load is not too high, and it will never make you feel stressed nor confused.",
    "I don't think I would. There are better history, Latin America, and Public Health classes out there.",
    "Easy class to do well in and not learn anything -- if you work to do the readings, you could probably get something out of it. Lectures are very unorganized but you learn a lot about the basic history of Latin America.",
    "I'd think very hard before taking this class again. Th readings were fascinating and I got a LOT out of section (because I had Jenny, a fantastic TA) but thelectures were at times very frustrating. Especially second semester, many of the lectures hardly even mentioned public health or medicine and were more of just a summary of political events. Fascinating material, but lectures are only so-so.",
    "if you have no knowledge of latin america, take it. if you do, it'll be super boring",
    "I definitely learned a lot from this class. Fair grading and easy assignments. Midterm and final exams are not hard if you've gone to class and done the readings. Prof. Espinosa is a good lecturer. I'd recommend the class, but don't go in with the expectation to only be discussing health. Unfortunately, the lecture often focuses on economical and political status of countries more than how they effect health. But you'll get this understanding in the readings.",
    "It was a good course, but not great. Some of that is just me, because I like history and I like science but I realized that I don't like the history of medicine and public health. Most ofthe readings deal with responds to public health crises, and there were some interesting themes but I wasn't enamoured with the subject. Some of the problems, though, are structural: the lectures are a bit disjointed, dealing with overall Latin American history and not just history of medicine (I actually liked this but HSHM people were disappointed, I think). The biggest issue is that the lectures and readings were all disjointed and it was left up to the students to piece together what was happening when. The section was sort of boring, though that wasn't the fault of Jenny Lambe, who's a great TA. The students were just not hugely into talking. On the plus side, the class has relatively little work, only 40 pages of reading most weeks, and you do get to learn about a part of the world you may not know much about. It's a good ROW credit. Also Professor Espinoza is a good lecturer despite the disjointed nature of the lectures, and she seems to care more about the students than many other lecturers.",
    "It makes connections between history and science not seen before. Overall very interesting and highly recommended.",
    "Yes--if you have even an inkling of an interest in medicine, public health, or Latin America, definitely go for it.",
    "If you're interested in global\/public health this is an awesome class. It completely changes your perspective of history and goes to show how complicated the world is and how much we still have to learn. Professor Espinosa is so incredible and anybody would be lucky to be taught by her. Sometimes the class can get a bit frustrating because the connection between lectures and readings isn't always well defined but there are points throughout the semester when the connections become clear.",
    "Straight-forward and interesting lecture about public health in Latin America. Helpful if you've already taken some public health or history classes of some sort, but not necessary. Lectures are sometimes boring, but I did enjoy the readings and section, and the experience was rewarding overall.",
    "I was kind of disappointed by this class. More than History of Public Health and Medicine in Latin America, it was a Vague Overview of the History of Latin America with Some Readings About Public Health and Medicine. May be interesting if you're interested in a basic introduction to the history of the region taught from a public health angle.",
    "Yes. Take the course!",
    "The readings were pretty interesting and generally so was the class, but it was never really that fascinating. The lectures ran on a different story arc than the readings, and the class generally lacked an overall arc. The class did show a unique perspective on health care, but it mostly became a Latin American history class, rather than a history of medicine class.",
    "Great course, if sometimes disorganized in lectures. A better name for the course would be \"The Politics of Medicine and Public Health in Latin America\", since it seemed we were getting the political background in class, whilst getting the medicine\/public health side in section. It worked alright, but more mixing up would have been good. Nonetheless, very interesting, and a great introduction to Latin American history through a medicine\/PH lens.",
    "If you are interested in Latin American history more than the public health aspect, then this class may be useful. If you have a good background about Latin America, the material might seem redundant and unhelpful.",
    "Yes, it was interesting and if you have any interest in Latin America or Public Health it was a good class.",
    "Good class to take if you are at all interested in Latin America or medicine. The ways that public health plays into everything from architecture to politics in Latin America is really fascinating and definitely worth studying.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class. Although I did learn interesting things about public health in Latin America, it was a frustrating battle to pull that information out of the class. Too often did I ask myself, \"and what does this have to do with public health?\"",
    "Sure",
    "If you're interested in the history of medicine and you're fascinated by Latin America, you'll love this course. Although I felt a lot of people took the course for an easy grade or to fulfill a requirement, I learned a lot and I was always engaged by the course material. Science and math majors might feel like the course is more focused on the history aspect rather than the science and medicine aspect of the syllabus, but I enjoyed all of the material we covered and I learned a lot about things I knew very little about. Overall, if you like the title of the course, you'll love the course. Also, Professor Espinosa is a wonderful professor!",
    "Hist 359 is a survey course, so know that before you take it. I took it because I didn't know anything about Latin American history, and the class is very broad in its coverage of Latin America. I would recommend this class to someone who wants that broad coverage, not someone who wants anything in depth."
