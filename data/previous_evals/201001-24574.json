    "I would definitely recommend it to a student who wants to really improve their French. If you're not pretty confident with your French at the beginning of the semester though, I would start it Cr\/D\/F. It's a lot of work and by no means easy; you have to be motivated. But you will be better at speaking French by the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. This is not a gut class, however, and it will require a lot of nightly work on your part. Also, you will have to learn to not take hundreds of corrections personally, they are just trying to help.",
    "A well-taught course. Like other French L5 classes, French 160 confers a solid amount of workload. However, Monsieur Delpech makes the material fun and easy to understand. Take it with him if you can!",
    "This class is pretty good. I definitely recommend it. I think it's appropriate for most students who have taken AP French, especially if they received a 5 on the exam. That said, I got a 4 on the AP French exam and although I pushed myself a little bit, I felt like I still really benefited from the class.The course is well structured and your French will definitely get better. You'll also learn a little bit about France along the way, so if you don't care for learning about French society and stuff, it could get boring at times for you.The class is definitely a lot of work, but for the most part, it's well spaced and manageable. The small class size is nice and the discussions are usually fun.I really like how although the professor is French, he speaks slowly and comprehensibly enough that everyone can understand him. He also has a legit French accent (being from Paris) which not all the French teachers have, and I feel like it's always nice to hear native French so that it's easier to emulate it.Personally, a French teacher who speaks with a French accent is important for me, but hey, to each his own.The fact that English was the professor's secondary language really didn't matter. He knew enough English to help us out,and if anything, I kind of felt like it made this sense that he understood our struggle and difficulty to internalize French.You should know that this French teacher is pretty new and is still learning. He was a really harsh grade at the beginning of the semester, but then he winded down a bit, maybe because my French was getting better, or maybe because he was learning how to grade more appropriately. He's still a pretty good teacher.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared to work really hard.",
    "This class doesn't focus on grammar. Its a good class to improve your reading comprehension, speaking skills, and french culture. I skipped French 151 to take this class and found the workload more manageable and the material more interesting. Like language classes, there is a fair amount of work for each class -- be prepared to write a lot of 200 word essays."
