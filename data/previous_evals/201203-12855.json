   "comments": [
    "You should take this class. A great way to practice your writing skills too.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. The material is really interesting, weekly writing assignments are super easy, and Mercedes is the best professor ever. If you speak Spanish decently well, this class will be an absolute breeze for you and really fun too!",
    "A very basic course, essentially a lecture in Spanish with little participation necessary. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking to improve your speaking skills.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is either interested in law, or is an incoming freshman looking to fulfill the language requirement. SPAN 150 demands far more time than this class, and sounds far less interesting. On the other hand, this class requires a much greater commandof the Spanish language than 150 does. In a sentence, this class is a comparative politics course conducted in Spanish.",
    "Yes. An amazing, relaxed, and engaging setting in which to continue one's Spanish into L5.",
    "A good overview of Spanish Law topics as well as some focus on American law topics. Good writing and reading comprehension practice. Yes, I would recommend to another student.",
    "Best L5 Spanish you could take.",
    "This class really took off about a week after reading period ended. It was a whirlwind, fascinating, in depth exploration into the Continental Law system (what is used in Spain and many other countries). Short writing assignment (approx 15 lines) due every class. Taught entirely through lecture despite small class size; not much focus on development of oral skills.If you like law and want to learn about other legal systems, take this class. If you're looking for a class that will improve your spanish skills, look elsewhere.",
    "Early morning spanish twice a week, 1 page of writing in spanish before each class, sort of a lecture based feel in the classroom, while you are also expected to contributed maybe once or twice a class.",
    "TAKE IT YOU FOOL",
    "Outstanding class--Mercedes is the best. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great L5 spanish.",
    "It is a really interesting course, gives you an outlook on continental law and new vocab. It's reasonably easy and the workload is low.",
    "Great class. You'll learn about various aspects of the law in Spanish. You cover a variety of topics ranging from Common Law to Constitutional Law, from homicide to contracts, and from the theory of crime to undocumented immigrants in the US. Profesora Carreras is an engaging lecturer, and she does a great job keeping the class fun. The workload is absolutely manageable with very brief writing assignments due pretty much every class, a presentation on an interesting legal subject, and a final paper. Take it if you're interested in improving your Spanish skills while learning some surprisingly interesting stuff about the law.",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for a solid Spanish class and have at least some interest in Spanish and American law.",
    "A good look at basic law concepts in Spanish. Taught well.",
    "Legal Spanish is a good \"topics in Spanish\" course, which means, in my mind, that you should approach the seminar with an honest interest in learning the material.Every class is spent in a sort of lecture-discussion mode, both hearing about and talking about concepts and topics surrounding Spain's \"Continental Law\" system. If you're a proficient Spanish speaker with an eye towards improving your writing in Spanish (there's a one-to-two-page writing assignment due every class) AND you're interested in law, this is definitely a class worth taking.Dr. Carreras is compassionate, knowledgable, and a pretty talented communicator of concepts and ideas. Most importantly, she cares deeply about her students.",
    "I would not recommend this course because my spanish did not improve."
