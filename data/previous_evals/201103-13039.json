    "Mercedes Carreras is one of the shining lights of the Spanish dept. at Yale. Very focused material, laid-back nature of course emphasizes improvement through participation in class and repetition through 2-a-week homework assignments. Works well as a complement to difficult schedules, while also allowing a person to maintain\/improve their spanish.Highly highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend Legal Spanish to another student. I took the class my sophomore year after AP Spanish in high school and didn't struggle too much. This is definitely not a Spanish practice class--it is a law overview taught inSpanish. You cover a wide range of topics, though with fairly little depth. A few words of caution: 9am feels a lot earlier come midterm than it sounds while reading the Blue Book, be prepared to analyze some complicated legal matters, and if you, like me, aren't that great at spoken Spanish, be prepared for major ego shattering. That being said, the homework was fairly easy, the classes were pretty enjoyable, and Profesora Carreras is fantastic.",
    "Great course. Minimal work. Barely any reading--just a paragraph (or two) response for homework. No final. Great class.",
    "I would recommend it as a good 5th course. Not too much outside work, but very engaging in class if you choose to let it be.",
    "Yes the material can be dense but she makes it understandable",
    "Great introduction, would recommend. Great fifth class. However, if you're doing this because you want to debate and participate in heavy class discussion, you will be disappointed. It is more of a lecture style course.",
    "Take this course.",
    "This class was great and the work load is fairly light. It makes for an excellent fifth class that is still really interesting. If you want to improve your Spanish writing and reading skills, I would definitely recommend it, but in terms of speaking skills, it was not the most beneficial (take conversational instead.)",
    "After having studied abroad in Spain, I elected this course to maintain fluency. I think if I hadn't had that semester abroad, I would have elected a conversational class because speaking Spanish during class is sometimes limited as it is more designed as a presentation of legal terms and ideas (as the name implies). What I'm trying to say is that I would recommend this class because I found the ideas interesting, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone who really wants to work on his or her Spanish speaking skills. It's more about comprehension.",
    "While Mercedes Carreras is really nice and cares about her students (and has a good sense of humor), I didn't really enjoy the class. Lectures were confusing and unstructured and I don't think my Spanish skills improved at all -- we often read articles in English for homework although we had to write up reading responses in Spanish. Also, there would be long periods of silence in class while we waited to take notes on a blackboard which just seemed to be an inefficient use of time. That said, Prof Carreras is wonderful (she's really great, actually) and Legal Spanish is a great 5th class",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Spanish 222 gives a nice overview of general topics in the law, from simple abstract foundational concepts like the sources and structure of law to the workings of penal codes in Spanish-speaking countries (mostly Spain). Current topics of public debate come up intermittently in the course, like immigration, drug trafficking, and the death penalty. We learn legal vocabulary as we learn the concepts, but it is not too extensive or difficult. Overall, the course was pretty easy. Although there wasn't much time for fully engaging conversation in Spanish, we were able to practice speaking a sufficient amount, and if you'd brave enough, you could probably practice a lot; Profesor Carreras never forces anyone to participate. If you're interested in legal issues and Spanish or are looking for a reasonably easy L5 to fulfill your language requirement, Legal Spanish is not a bad way to go.",
    "Good practice in maintaining one's ability to speak, write and listen to Spanish. Interesting material on legal knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly if he\/she is considering studying law. It is a great introduction to Spanish legal culture.",
    "Yes. Great class, great professor, reasonable workload.",
    "Definitely take it. It is a great class with minimal work. You write one 1-page response for each class, a midterm, an in-class group presentation, and a 5-page final paper. DO IT!"
