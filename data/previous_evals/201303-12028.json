    "I would not because ALEKS on top of problem sets was too much.",
    "Chemistry 012 is an introductory chemistry course which is taught very vaguely, yet has a very large work load. I would not recommend that a fellow student take this class; I find that my high school Honors Chemistry class was much better than this course. I would recommend that future students take Chemistry 114 instead of this course as the content is very similar, yet it seems to be better explained in 114.",
    "It is a waste of time.",
    "I would recommend Chem 012 to another student. I found it to be a very rewarding class.",
    "I would say that Chemistry 012 01, an additional section for chemistry, is helpful, but not something that every student NEEDS to attend. I would recommend it to students who need the extra help to succeed in the class.",
    "Be prepared for a class full of online assignments in addition to Problem Sets.",
    "I personally would not, but I can see why people may want to take the course.",
    "I would recommended this class to a fellow student as a very good way of gaining a general background to chemistry from little or no previous experience in this field.",
    "This was just a regular and sometimes helpful chem section. Nothing special.",
    "Yes, I thought it was a good class. I would definitely recommend taking good notes while reading the chapters and understanding the lessons in class.",
