    "The negotiation simulations were fantastic, and you absorb a lot during the lectures. It's a very time-efficient way of getting the big concepts. The other benefit is just seeing how Ona leads the course, and how she puts the principles she's teaching into practice.",
    "I appreciated Ona's flexibility to address topics of interest. I also enjoyed her style of teaching, where she would teach us a new mediation tool by using it on the class and then bringing our attention to it after the fact. That was very helpful for us.",
    "Practicing meeting facilitation and negotiation skills with classmates. Overall, the course made the oft-invisible processes of how to run a good meeting visible, and equipped me with tools I have and will continue to use.",
    "It is very practical and applicable. The instructor practices what she teaches.",
    "The activities, the fact that Ono models all of the techniques throughout the class so you get to see them in practice.",
    "The simulations were great to get experience applying some of the concepts we have been learning about.",
    "Ona is such an asset to this school. Her willingness to share stories and experiences was invaluable. She really cares about whether what she is teaching is applicable to students' lives."

    "Nothing",
    "The first two sessions could move a bit faster to get to more practice of mediation. I'm not sure how that could be done, but it felt like many of the concepts were easy to understand in theory, but much harder to practice. More practice would have been better. The outside assignments fell over spring break which I found was a difficult time to complete those things.",
    "It would have been great if the course had been offered either in the fall so the skills we learned could be applied in future coursework in the spring semester.",
    "Consider adding one or two more sessions to cover some topics more in depth. Consider adding a toolbox or summary of contents reviewed in class.",
    "Nothing, my only regret is that this course wasn't a full three credit course!",
    "The first class should not be on the Friday before spring break",
    "The timing this year was tricky; having one class the Friday before spring break was not ideal, because several people who hadn't realized that setup ended up having to drop the class. It would be better to frontload this class at the beginning of the semester so that people don't feel overwhelmed by the time it starts."

    "It fits well for students interested in social processes, coflict resolution and environmental decision making.",
    "It's so important to have the skills of a facilitator in the environmental community, and I wish we had the opportunity to talk more about actual instances besides the example ones that we role-played. But overall I know that I will take a lot of these things I've learned forward.",
    "Facilitator and negotiation are important aspects of environmental work that are fundamental skills students should know despite their career path. This class inspired me to look into facilitation\/mediation for a career.",

This is one of the only places at FES to learn about facilitation, mediation, and negotiation, including salary negotiation for soon-to-be graduates."
