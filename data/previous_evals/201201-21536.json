    "Great course that really helped me with my speaking. I'm so much more confident now than I was at the beginning of the semester. My classmates and I really bonded -- we had great discussions and helped each other with the language, assignments, etc. Just beware, there is a lot of work involved here. Stay on top of it (it's not so hard if you're conscientious) because if you don't complete all the assignments and research you won't get as much out of the class.",
    "Contemporary French learning.",
    "Be careful about what you take this class with. There's a lot to read, and, more importantly, a lot to write. I found myself losing more sleep over this than anything else, and wasn't really able to truly engage with the course or material because of other commitments. Still, under the right conditions, this is a good choice.",
    "I definitely would recommend it, especially anyone planning on traveling to France in the near future as the focus of the material studied is the present condition of the country. We researched current events and political parties, which was very exciting considering the recent presidential elections in France.",
    "There is undoubtedly a lot of work (multiple short essays a week plus readings). That said, it is definitely manageable (maybe not as a 5th class, though. That was my mistake...). I would suggest shopping the various sections to see which class dynamic and teacher you like best."
