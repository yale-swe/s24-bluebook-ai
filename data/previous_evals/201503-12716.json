    "I mean it's research.... free credit i f you're going to do research anyway.",
    "you do research as usual. would recommend if you are going to do research.",
    "You know the drill - do awesome research, learn a ton, and get experience in presenting your research. Really fun experience, and a great way to learn more physics.",
    "If you want to do research, why not sign up for credit? I thought it was a great experience. Research can be frustrating sometimes, but 471 is flexible enough to accommodate it. Tipton was great leading it. He was very encouraging and responsive. The lunch he organized for all of the students made us feel more like a community and less like a bunch of physics students doing different things separately. In the end of the semester, you have to give a 15 minutes final presentation to a few other students and some faculty, but it's very low-key and not super stressful (even though it's during reading period). Workload varies a lot depending on your lab and research mentor. I was working a lot, but I know other students who worked about 6 hours a week and got away with it.",
    "This course is a great chance to get your hands dirty actually doing what physicists do (spoiler: it's not problem sets). It's a considerable time commitmentmost advisers expect 10-15 hours a week, and the reports\/presentations are time consuming to do wellbut you have lots of flexibility to set your own hours. Your enjoyment of 471 will depend greatly on your adviser, so make sure you find someone you enjoy working with. In particular, communicate openly from the beginning about what sort of guidance you will receive, from the assistance of grad students to personal time with the professor, so you don't end up frustrated and adrift. Take the class seriously, and you should get a lot out of it."
