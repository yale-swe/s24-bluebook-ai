   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Bilakovics is great, and I can't imagine not enjoying the conversation. The work was a bit much, but completely worth it. It has made me look at the Constitution, and at our whole political system in an entirely different way.",
    "It weas a great class. If you have interest in the philosophy behind our government, or American political thought, take it! Also great if you are interested in the formation of our government. A few of the discussions were not quite as engaging as they could have been if they had been structured to address more interesting issues (sometimes we just went in circles over things we had already discussed) but overall it was a really thought-provoking class in timeless questions that still have lots of significance today.",
    "This class focuses on the views of Anti-Federalists and Federalists and debates surrounding the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. Each week has a broad theme. Be prepared to read The Federalist Papers. Yes I would recommend this course to a fellow student. This course would be particularly good for students with an interest in the crafting of the constitution. Each word is important.",
    "If you are interested in theoretically discussing the form of American government, take this class. Nothing about the course material was necessarily original but Prof Bilakovics does a good job of pushing discussion into areas where the readings don't take you.",
    "Some weeks better than others, but overall a great discussion of the design of our government, its weaknesses, and how the Constitution should be changed.",
    "Great advanced civics course on the foundations of US government. For anyone that is at all interested in the subject, this is a great class.",
    "This class has interesting reading, and Professor Bilakovics is a nice guy who leads interesting discussions. I enjoyed it because I thought my classmates were interesting, I think this class would be awful with a boring class.",
    "A good course. Not great, but certainly worthwhile. Bilakovics is a good seminar leader and our discussions were very good. He is more than willing to talk about and help with papers, and neither the midterm nor the final were too much work (although certainly took thought). I definitely recommend the course."
