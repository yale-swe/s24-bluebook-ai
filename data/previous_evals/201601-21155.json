    "If you're interested in how political parties operate in democracies around the world, this is the class for you. The readings are well chosen and work together, though actually reading all of them before class really is a must. The assignments work to encourage this, as it's just reading responses and class participation, which go together well. Will not answer every question you have about every possible political party, but will help you think about them in a completely different way and create a foundation to go explore more on the topic. Definitely recommend.",
    "This course is without a doubt a 10 out of 10. Professor Thachil is incredibly engaging and wonderful and the way he teaches is fantastic. He is so clear in his communication, in his ability to pick very relevant and engaging readings, and to run a very enjoyable seminar. Attracting students from a variety of backgrounds, the course is a fantastic opportunity to engage with classmates and to think critically about political parties not only in the Developing World but also in general. Additionally, the work requirements are by far some of the most logical that you could possible ever get while at Yale. First, there are no papers at all just reading responses which require you to read the readings (which are wonderful and not insanely long) and then interpret them. Second, your responses are due the day before so it means 1) you can't procrastinate 2) you'll be prepared for class. Anyway take this as a sign that you should take this course! DO IT BECAUSE ITS THE RIGHT DECISION!",
    "Take this class if you enjoy political theory. The class isn't too area specific to South East Asia so don't worry if you don't have any expertise on India, the developing world, or even any country at all. It's more about thinking about how theory would play out in the developing world, and given the diversity within this \"world\" the course does not rely on you being a specialist in any region at all. I recommend being creative with your reading repossess and realizing that doing well on them makes life MUCH easier for you since you will literally know what sort of grade you are working at as you go along.",
    "Yes, I would recommend plsc 383 to a friend. It is a great seminar course on a very fascinating topic in political science. I am not even particularly interested in the developing world, but the class also gave me such a stronger understanding of political parties in society as well as peaked my interest for continuing to pursue coursework related to developing countries.",
    "Definitely take this class! I was really doubtful at first that I would actually enjoy this class because it seemed to be more focused on theory than classes I would normally take. But I'm so glad I did take this class. Professor Thachil is one of the best seminar professors I've had in the past four years at Yale, and I learned a lot of things that were incredibly interesting. Classes were really well balanced between Professor Thachil going over the reading and making sure we understood it and interesting discussions that he moderated very well to make sure they were always on track and relevant. All in all, this was one of my favorite seminars at Yale when I really didn't expect it to be.",
    "Great class, wonderful professor. The class very well structured and pertinent. Makes you do and understand the the reading. One of the better ones I have taken. Perfect balance between serious analysis and sometimes more relaxed conversation."
