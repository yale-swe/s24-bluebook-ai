    "HIST 221 covers military history from 1500 to today. There is a focus on the rise of naval power and the advent of aircraft. The lectures are really engaging and Professor Kennedy is great! There are also several guest lectures by those involved in ROTC. Their personal anecdotes and experiences really add to the class! Be warned that there is a lot of reading - sometimes roughly 400 pages a week. As there is not a lot of concrete information dispersed in lectures, the reading is necessary to really get something out of the course. There are also weekly reading responses for section, a midterm exam, and a final exam.",
    "I would summarize this course as an excellent one, with a significant but manageable amount of reading and a wonderful professor. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Kennedy is a great lecturer, but the class can be difficult to follow since it covers such a wide range of events. The workload is very manageable and the tests are graded fairly.",
    "Way too much information. Make sure you find good ways to summarize important events and such, or else you're probably screwed. Great lectures though!",
    "Its not quite as easy as people make it sound (depends all on your TA and the final sucks) but its a good class, great if you're interested",
    "As the course title suggests, it is a course teaching 500 years of military history so don't expect the course to give you too much details about each period. The readings assigned are also quite a bit but you can do them selectively. It's rather focused on the military sphere so make sure you are interested in listening about weapons, tactics and wars, twice every week.",
    "A great course if you are interested in Military History.",
    "If you are interested in the topic or just want to take a history class, take this one and you won't regret it!",
    "I would recommend this class. Lots of reading, but you can be successful in the class without completing all the reading. The information is interesting, and Professor Kennedy is a good lecturer.",
    "Not just military history of the west. Basically history of the west with a focus on military and then lots of stuff about ships. Kennedy loves ships. A lot.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Highly recommend this course, which covers military history during the most conflict-riddled centuries. If you are holing to learn more about naval history and have no interest in airpower, this may not be the class for you. Readings are manageable and interesting, and lectures by Professor Kennedy are fun, though occasionally difficult to understand the point.",
    "Though the lectures sometimes devolved into military hardware porn, they were entertaining for the most part. A not-too-challenging class that tries to answer why the West rose to power after ~1450 without addressing the issues of exploitation and brutality, etc. Better as a Global Affairs class than a history one because of its focus on strategy.",
    "Good overall. I think, however, it would be worthwhile to delve into a bit more depth in certain areas instead of being so broad and sweepingly general all the time. The course lost a lot of its potential rigor and benefit because of it. It basically felt like watered down AP European History from high school seen through a military history lens.",
    "Very interesting. Ridiculous - seriously - amount of readings. Comprehensive modern history course. I would recommend it.",
    "Great course with light workload. Excellent professor and section. Definitely take this course.",
    "A broad look at military history in the Western world, particularly interesting to anyone who enjoys European history.",
    "It's pretty interesting, but if you haven't taken AP Euro, you will be pretty lost for the first half of the course, as it is rush through way to fast. They assign a ridiculous amount reading, a lot of which is useless, but sometimes needs to be done to fill in the blanks left from lecture. Take it if you love military history, don't bother if you are just looking for an easy humanities credit. It is not a gutty as you might expect.",
    "If you want to know how the world works, take this class. Military history is the evolution of humankind. The grading is straightforward: one midterm and one final. Essays in each, IDs on the final. Easy to get an A if you like the subject.",
    "You'll get as much from Military History of the West as you put into it. Some of the readings in particular are very interesting, but you do not need to do most of them if you just want to earn a good grade. The course subheading was \"including sea and airpower.\" I would say a more accurate description would be \"in particular, sea and airpower.\" Not a history of war per se, but a sampling of particular moments, people, and technologies, which I guess is all you can ask for in just one semester. If you've taken AP Euro, you should have a breeze; if not, you'll probably have to do a little more work to fill in the gaps in Kennedy's lectures.",
    "It is a broad history class, and it is not very hard. However, the twentieth century coverage was extremely technology-heavy, so rather than covering twentieth century events, battles, or people, we mostly covered technological advances in warfare. While this is relevant, it was a little boring and clearly aimed towards the ROTC program rather than a study of a broad and full history of warfare.",
    "Extremely easy history course. Didn't do any of the reading and did great. Its fun taking a class with Paul Kennedy even if his lectures just ramble on. Worth it for anyone interested in military history.",
    "This is my favorite class I've taken yet in college. The readings were all fascinating and the lectures were wonderful. Don't miss it!",
    "Absolutely. It's a must-take, and there isn't very much work (just a midterm exam and a final exam-- no papers!).",
    "A cool class about how economics and military might combine to shape history, and how policymakers try to shape the future by accounting for those two factors. If you like political history and policymaking, check this course out.",
    "It was my first history class in Yale, and I really loved it. Paul Kennedy is a great professor. He is incredibly engaging and makes people excited about the material. He is very good at pointing out the important parts of the readings, which serves as a nice guideline for studying later. I feel like I learned how to look at historical events and make connections after taking his lectures-he was very good at teaching us how to see the big pictures and even make sense of politics a lot better. Some people think that he is not a great lecturer because he does not talk about the material a lot and you have to do quite a bit of reading (which is true) I don't see it as a problem-he gives you the outline for studying and inspires you to read on the particular subjects. I liked the course especially because it was more about the big pictures\/grand strategy rather than details of the fighting of the wars (which can be disappointing, depending on what you are looking for). Also, the workload is light, and if you are behind your work, you can be fine with reading his book and skipping the other ones. The final is 60 percent of your grade, which can be stressful, but it's fine because the essay prompts are generally predictable questions such as 'what s the effect of economy in the rise of the west' . Take it if you don't already know a ton about Western military history-it's a great class!",
    "I would recommend it as a low work humanities credit. Many readings unnecessary. Class is interesting but it's not the best. Good 5th class",
    "Pretty good class - attendance at lectures are definitely not 100% necessary to succeeding in this course, but readings and section attendence are. Of course, this all depends on your initial grasp of the subject, as many people come into this course from vastly different backgrounds, but that's a decision to be made for yourself. I personally learned a lot from this course, coming from a background not exactly rich in military history.",
    "A very interesting course with a light work load.",
    "Summarizing Military History... It is a simple history course of military history, with lots of reading and two heavyweight exams. That's it. Good 5th class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to every student at Yale, even if you are not the type of person who normally takes history courses. It was engaging, interesting, and fun.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. I have been waiting to take it for a while now and I wasn't disappointed! It was a good survey of military history from 1500 on in Europe and the Western World. Bear in mind that the midterm covers material from 1500 to WWI and the second half of the semester focuses on WWII and challenges facing airpower and the challenges of thinking about the world post WWII as a bipolar one between the US and USSR.",
    "The easiest class I've ever taken.",
    "A great time with a good amount of work. The subject is amazing, and the teaching quality is superb. Please take this class before you graduate.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Essentially all of the information is obtained from the readings, and I found the lectures too general (likely by design) to be of much interest to me.",
    "This course was heavily based on the substantial readings; however, it was worth all the work. The coursework was fascinating and this course helped me appreciate how far military technology has come, and how military innovations have shaped the society we live in today.",
    "Its a broad military history course. It doesn't focus on tactics or the specifics of battles, but on broad themes of national development. If you are interested in military history and power dynamics then I would recommend the course.",
    "Definitely take it. Low workload and interesting material.",
    "Simply put, this is an amazing class. Even if you're not interested in military or Western history, I recommend that you take it. Professor Kennedy is a fantastic lecturer and the readings are great. You will come out of this class with a newfound appreciation for and understanding of the Western world.",
    "Perfect credit d",
    "A broad overview of military history, solid gut",
    "Cool subject good insights. Poor lecture. Paul Kennedy's book is great its insightful detailed and to the point, but in the last 20 years his lectures have grown rambling slow and at times wrong and self contradictory. If you get a good TF take the course do the readings and skip the lecture. The answer to every question Kennedy asked was either Churchill or Nelson, I get that they are important but 10 minutes talking about the buildings they were born in seems a bit excessive.",
    "An excellent opportunity to see Paul Kennedy in his element. Highly recommend for that reason. 90% of the grade comes from the midterm and final, which can be a pro and a con, so keep that in mind. There's a lot of reading and not all of it is necessary to succeed in the course, but all of it is interesting if you enjoy the topic.",
    "Military history was a great course! I was glad to have to opportunity to be taught by a great historian like Professor Paul Kennedy. His passion for military history runs deep, and it can clearly be seen through his lecture presentations. Although some of the lectures are a bit dry, his book, which is a required reading for the class, was very good. All of the other readings for the course were carefully chosen and interesting reads as well. For the most part, the lectures were used to guide the themes of the course, while the readings allowed students to dig into the details. The readings are essential in order to perform well on the midterm and final. I enjoyed having only two grades throughout the semester for this class, but the end of the semester becomes stressful when you realize that your final is 60% of the grade. Also, I enjoyed going to section for this class. I participated in the Yale Air Force ROTC section with Colonel Haun, and it was one of the best experiences that I have ever had. Colonel Haun was extremely knowledgable and a one-of-a-kind guy. Everyone loves him.",
    "not a gut, but an interesting class. Not exactly only about military warfare - it incorporates other facets such as economic revolutions, etc.",
    "Most definitely. Not a lot of work and fascinating class. It covers a subject that most Americans should be sure to learn.",
    "HIST 221 is a straightforward history class that is pretty interesting. It is not overly difficult but does require a fair amount of work to receive a good grade. It's great for anyone interested in European history even if you aren't in ROTC.",
    "Definitely one of the lighter history courses I've taken at Yale (I'm a history major). Must-take at Yale. It's a survey class that examines really important aspects of the rise of the West. It's designed to meet ROTC specifications, so there is some focus on weaponry and technological development. I would recommend this course to anyone especially if it is taught by Paul Kennedy. Professor Kennedy is an absolute gem and really knows his stuff. ROTC sections are run a bit differently from the others, so be aware of that when shopping. There is less focus on the readings, but you're expected to contribute to really practical conversations about the role of the military in the past's and today's affairs.",
    "Take it. There is absolutely no reason not to. If you are a history nerd (as I am), you may be excited to know that both Vauban and Frederick the Great were discussed in the same class.",
    "Basically story time with Professor Kennedy. Great introductory history class that was very engaging and interesting. Section helped facilitate a lot of lively discussion about military history, and made me feel like I was in a seminar, which section rarely feels like. However, the guest speakers at the end of the semester made the course more fragmented. Very fair exams in terms of topics and IDs; highly recommended."
