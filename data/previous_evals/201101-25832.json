   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in learning about the social, political, economic, biological and cultural dimensions surrounding the food we eat and the habits that govern our food-related practices.",
    "A good class that teaches you some interesting things about food in our culture and in a few cultures around the world. Two students lead each class session so it's more like a conversation about the readings. Readings and discussions are interesting but not amazing.",
    "Overview of history of food culture, food preference, and everything food! The class is mostly student led with student leading discussions every week, so if you don't like being involved or want to hear the Professor lecture during the whole seminar, this is probably not the right class for you. If you like talking a lot, you'll enjoy it!",
    "If you are interested in food policy, public health, or just the evolution of cuisine in general, you should take this class. The readings are enjoyable and seminar feels more like a dinner table discussion than class. The workload is extremely manageable and the final project is something I was actually excited to do (ethnographic study of New Haven's food trucks!?) Awesome class.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes, take this course. It has a good mix of undergrad and grad students, and the weekly topics are fun and very relevant.",
    "Take this course. If you are at all interested in global health, food or anthropology it is so interesting and makes you think about food in a very different light. The workload is very manageable.",
    "It is a great topic that more people need to learn about because it is discussed to infrequently. But be prepared to do most of the learning on your own."
