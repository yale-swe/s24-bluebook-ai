    "I learned a great deal about Afghanistan, a country fascinating in its own right, but also one extremely central to the United States' foreign policy for approaching two decades. I learned about past and potential strategies for supporting governance, stability, and economic development as tools for long-term goals of sustainable peace. This can be applied to other national or local 'weak states'.",
    "I learned a lot about Afghanistan which I had no background in before the course.",
    "I learned a great deal about how to conduct a long-term research project and create a product which is client-driven.",
    "How to work with a client! And a lot of knowledge about Afghanistan.",
    "I learned how to conduct remote research and develop policy recommendations."

    "The selection and content from guest speakers was excellent - academically stimulating and actionable. We were also heavily supported by Clare and Dev in our final semester projects. As a School of Management MBA student, I would also comment that the class was extremely welcoming and approachable for non-global affairs students interested in the covered topics. I would have loved to take an optional field trip to DC (e.g. Afghanistan embassy, Clare's office, etc.).",
    "The course would benefit from more structure and having the point people figured out earlier. That would have allowed teams to start earlier, have greater engagement with clients, and get further along in the projects. While the many speakers were super interesting it would have been good to have more class discussion time to go over readings and situate the talks in discussion. There wasn't much cohesion in what the different teams were learning.",
    "I think the idea behind the course and all the guest lecturers were great. I think maybe turning this into a year-long course, if possible, would allow for students to really get the most out of it.",
    "I would have liked to have been matched with a client sooner.",
    "Strengths: very well-taught, lots of resources for every student, fascinating and practical projects. Weakness: not enough time"

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend the course! You'll love the content, structure, professor, guest speakers as well as classmates (self-selected for students interested in these fascinating and applicable topics).",
    "With some structural improvements, yes",
    "This is a great class where you learn a lot about how to create a client-driven product. If you're looking for a broad introduction to Afghanistan, this isn't the right class for you. You're going to be looking at a very specific area or sector of your choosing. However, a background in Afghanistan is definitely not required for this class. I would definitely recommend it to anyone willing to put in the time throughout the semester on their project.",
    "For a student who could work well with a client-based model, yes",
    "Yes! This will be a once a in a lifetime opportunity to contribute to shaping the future of a country where America, despite all its efforts and investments, has failed. This is the one class on Afghanistan and probably the only Global Affairs class at Yale that is about a country but not through a \"foreign policy lens.\" In this class, you will learn about the people of Afghanistan and the potential and the resources that the country has to offer to shape its own future. For the first time at Yale, I felt that I learned about a country without being forced to believe that I was saving it or that I was superior than the people of that country."
