    "This course helped me think about Arabic translation as an art as well as a science, and pushed me to think about the context of intellectual production then and now.",
    "We learned a lot about the Fihrist and tenth-century-book culture. We also developed our Arabic language skills. A particular challenge of this course was the sheer volume of the weekly readings, so we learned how to digest a large amount of Arabic quickly."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was poorly structured, and often times not very demanding as a result. We could have covered a lot more of the text, and still had time for important discussion. However, class time was often spent debating a small detail of the translationthis is helpful sometimes, and even important, but there was too much discussion that got off track or belabored the argument. There also could have been more of an effort to engage with secondary readings. Some were assigned, but not really expected to be discussed.",
    "This was a great course. Professor Toorawa is one of the world's leading experts on the Fihrist, and he is one of the most engaging teachers I have ever had. After the first few weeks, we drastically rewrote the syllabus because the original reading plan was too ambitious, but I thought that what we ended up doing worked well. The only downside of this class was that there were a few too many students for us to get enough practice with in-class reading."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes because it is such an important text (the Fihrist) and because the instructor has a valuable and unique perspective to the field of Arabic literature.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you have a VERY good grasp of Classical Arabic and are willing to put a lot of time (way more than for an undergrad course) into keeping up with the grad students. The Classical Arabic seminar covers a new topic each semester, so it's worth checking that you're interested in the semester's particular topic before signing up. If you take this course and do the work, you will improve a lot. Getting to know the super nice grad students is also a plus."
