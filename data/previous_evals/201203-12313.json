    "Would recommend, based on the material. Would not recommend, based on the assessments\/assignments -- the weekly quizzes were fine, but the homework assignments were somewhat tedious and the midterm was actually pretty difficult because the TFs checked for very minute details in the answers. It's still a good introductory astronomy course, though, for any students interested in the subject.",
    "It was challenging and probably not because it was not what i expected it to be.",
    "I enjoyed this course and didn't find it very difficult, but beware, it's not as gutty as you might expect. There's a fair amount of homework and weekly quizzes (which are easy but sometimes time-consuming). Still, I thought the course was really interesting and I'm glad I took it. Professor Fischer is a really nice and approachable, and a great lecturer whose enthusiasm for the material is truly tangible. Also, she's truly one of the leading figures in the field of astrobiology.",
    "This is a class studying the possibility of life in the universe. But you go over a lot about the make up of planets and there's some geology too. I would recommend it to a friend, but don't expect it to be an easy A.",
    "I would, if you need the science credit or are interested in astro-biology",
    "terribly boring class. i took it for an easy sc credit (as did everyone in the class). its just boring. prof fischer is really nice, but the class itself is so so SO so boring. find another science class if you can.",
    "If you are interested in Astronomy, then you MAY find this course interesting. Personally, I found reading through the book quite interesting, however I found the classes quite dull. I simply couldn't be bothered to go to class most days since I found it both more enjoyable and informative to learn the material on my own. It is a bit of work, though it is not often very challenging. If you are interested and don't care about the credits, you would be better off just reading the text.",
    "It is more work than I expected. The content is easy for non-science majors. It is important to read the book and listen to guest speakers, more than normal lectures.",
    "I thought the workload was tough, especially at the beginning of the term when we were writing homework assignments and taking weekly quizzes simultaneously. The homework often introduced concepts that were completely new, and I found myself having to look up material on the internet quite often, which I was not entirely comfortable with because I didn't know if I could trust my sources.",
    "This is a fabulous course. The material is fascinating and taught in an accessible, interesting manner using a variety of resources and techniques. Student feedback featured heavily into the flow of the course and it felt like our feedback was actually taken into account.Definitely take this course if you are looking for an interesting survey of a fascinating field of science -- astrobiology incorporates everything from bio to chem to physics to astronomy so there is something for everyone. Professor Fischer is a wonderful professor. Definitely take the time to get to know her and ask follow up questions.Bottom line: if you are willing to take the time to do the readings, pay attention in lecture and invest about 2-3 hours on the homework (every two weeks) and 1 hr per weekly quiz, you will be fine.",
    "Don't take this course, watch the Discovery Channel for an hour or two instead, you'll learn just the same stuff but in a more interesting format.",
    "Pretty basic class. This is about as easy of a science credit as you will get. Not too much work. About 6 homework assignments which take a couple hours each, a 3-page paper and a midterm and final. I would recommend it.",
    "It is a great course to complete a SC credit. There are various assignments that impact your grade, which means that not any one assignment is absolutely important to your overall course grade. The teacher is fantastic. If you are not interested in astronomy\/know nothing about the field, it will most likely get boring at times, but overall I developed a great interest in Astronomy because of the wonderful professor and interesting material that relates to modern science.",
    "Have a high tolerance for disorder? You'll be fine.",
    "I highly recommend this class for a student who wants to try something different and broaden their classes.",
    "Very basic overview of the search for life in the universe. Covers a lot of topics: geology, biology, astronomy. Exactly as advertised: well suited for non-science majors.",
    "This class is on Astrobiology. Pretty good class. Not a gut.",
    "This is a good course for those who want to earn their science credit while learning interesting material. It is not your typical gut, though, and you will have to work fairly hard to earn an A.",
    "If you are a non-science major and need a science credit, you should take this class.",
    "You should take it. It's fun and fun.",
    "I think it is pretty clear that if you are taking Astronomy 130, you are taking it as a science credit. Be aware of a few things, this class is not a gut but it is a little ridiculous at times. I ended up working harder in this class than all my other classes. There are an unnecessary amount of assignments - quizzes every week, psets, midterm, paper, etc.I love space\/astronomy yet still found this class to be pretty boring. Just first and foremost, don't expect this class to be an easy A, if you want to get an A you'll have to put in a ton of work - it is doable, but it requires A LOT of work.",
    "Life in the Universe overall was an interesting survey course in astronomy, accessible to non-science majors. Having very little background in the sciences, I found that some knowledge of chemistry and biology would have been helpful. That being said, the course was still manageable- yet definitely not easy. The midterm and finals required lots of studying and memorization. Professor Fischer is really dedicated to her work and students, and it shows. She also brought in lots of guest lecturers, who provided an interesting angle and helped break up the lecture.",
    "I would recommend this to another student if they were looking to gain more knowledge concerning astrobiology, but if they are a non-science student looking for an easy science credit,they should not be suprised when the coursework is more difficult than they expected.",
    "This is a fine science credit but it's not interesting or particularly easy. The material is very interesting but its presentation is utterly boring. If you don't have to do the clicker responses like we did I would recommend taking this class, skipping lecture, and reading the textbook. Professor Fischer is a very nearly incompetent lecturer.",
    "I would summarize it as an overview of astronomy and geology, with some technical aspects brought in. It is a very interesting class, and is especially useful for non-science majors who wish to be exposed to interesting topics in science without being surrounded by pre-meds.",
    "I would recommend this course to another non-science major student looking to fulfill their science distribution requirement.",
    "I AM: Freshman, computer science (and maybe art or psychology) major. Last touched science in 10th grade. I like science, am bad at math, and have even worse memory. Lucky for you, (almost) no math here!THE GOOD: Relatively easy. By that I mean that there's work, but it's just time-consuming and not difficult at all. There is virtually no QR here and it's general enough for everyone to enjoy, but I didn't feel like I was taking a fluffy course that dumbed down the science too much. Also, astronomy is badass.THE BAD: But the way class is taught is also kind of boring. It's pretty much \"Professor Fischer repeats the textbook, but with slides and a little bit of extra information, and if you're good you get a guest lecture or photos of Hawai'i!\". Actually, if you're not that interested you can probably skip all the lectures, just read the textbook, and know 90% of the material the course imparts. The remaining 10% is stuff from guest lecturers from other universities or departments, or multimedia (NASA videos mostly), or anecdotes and photos from Prof Fischer about her research and what it's like to be an astronomer. These are fascinating.I also did NOT like how the course was very heavily focused on memorization. I am crap at memorization, and the open-book quizzes saved my life. During the exams I was just BSing off what vague fragments I could remember, so I didn't do too well in the final.THE WORK: You do have to put in a consistent amount of work. Weekly quizzes and homework. The semester paper is fun and really not a paper at all (seriously, it's 3 pages, double-spaced. I know you write blog posts longer than that.)TAKE THIS IF: You're even slightly science-minded (i.e. you think \"hey that's cool\" when you read about new scientific discoveries instead of \"man, those nerds\"), and good at memorizing things.THE PROF: Prof Fischer is a very likeable, patient and dedicated professor who is really enthusiastic about what she does, and she took time to give me very thorough explanations when I asked her stuff after class. If you're worried about not being sciencey enough she sets up a lot of review sessions around midterm timePARTING WORDS: If you're interested, look out for times when she mentions that their lab will be observing, and head up to Gibbs to spend an hour or so watching them do observation. Since usually no one bothers going for these, you get to ask all the questions you want, and chat with whoever's observing. There was another opportunity to tour their instrument lab, which would probably have been cool too (though I couldn't make it). Attend the extra stuff! It's fun.",
    "Take this class if you're not a science major and need a science credit.",
    "I would recommend Astronomy 130 01 to another student if they were genuinely interested in the sciences and in this particular topic. For a student who is simply taking the course to fulfill their science credit, however, this may not be the best course as it becomes very in-depth in all of its topics.",
    "I would recommend this class only for those who may be majoring in Astronomy or you have real interest in the class. It is by no means an 'easy' science credit",
    "If you're not a science wiz but you're looking for a way to learn and have fun, this is a great course. It's easy to do decently well and you will learn a lot.",
    "Very interesting class. Would take it again in a heartbeat",
    "It is a good course that will give you a general overview of the search for life elsewhere in the universe. I would recommend it. It is also a highly accessible science credit for non-science majors.",
    "Yes manageable workload and good class",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a solid sc credit.",
    "Great professor. interesting class",
    "I might have considered this the one true gut I've taken at Yale, if I had cared enough to put in a little more effort to do above average. Instead, I begrudgingly did all the work with minimal effort, so it's definitely what you make of it.",
    "I am unsure about this course. I would say take this course if you are genuinely interested in the material. It's an OK way to get a science credit but there is a lot of constant work - weekly quizzes, biweekly homeworks, a midterm, final and a final paper. None of it was particularly difficult though...",
    "Overall there seemed to be little structure to the course and the course material. Class assignments seemed like busy work and online assessments were more like scavenger hunts than actual assessments of course material. Many assignments seemed unnecessary or irrelevant to course material. It was difficult to tie the different teaching units into the overall theme of the course. The Teaching Fellows were not engaged with the course and largely unavailable - sometimes they did not even respond to emails. There were frequent errors in assignments, assessments - it seemed as if they were sloppily put together.",
    "This was a good class! Personally, I thought the material was interesting, especially because it did not get anywhere near any math. If you are needing a science credit, I say take this one.",
    "If you need a science credit it is worth consideration, but as a non-science major I was not a huge fan. The topic of life in the universe is interesting but the material is presented in a very broad and at uninteresting manner. I don't regret taking it but i'm not sure if I would take it again if I could go back.",
    "Great for science majors. Very difficult otherwise.",
    "Hmm...it is what it is...an easy-ish science credit that you probably won't get that much out of. However, I did some stuff out of it: you learn some cool things about life (lecture on viruses is really cool, too) and the organization of the universe. Take the extra cred. opportunity to go to the observatory, it's awesome! The class seemed like a quick, shallow overview of astronomy, biology, geology, etc. You might be better suited just taking a basic class in one of those sciences if you want to go more in depth. Unfortunately, this class felt a little bit like a waste of time.",
    "A broad survey of astronomy and the development of life. I'd say the course may try to force too much into too little time. Also, I found that the work for the course was frequently just frustrating rather than helpful.",
    "If you need a gut, then I guess this is a good class. Beware, though, since it's probably going to be one of the most boring classes you take. It's not like Fischer doesn't care; she completely cares and you can tell she's trying. The lectures are just soooooo boring. Hopefully she does something different with the lectures next time or changes the format a little.",
    "Do NOT take this course unless very passionate about Astronomy! If you are not a big science person or do not have previous experience with astronomy, you will probably get a B or worse. The lectures are often disorganized and confusing, and the textbook material is not integrated well with the lectures, exams, or homework. The workload was unexpectedly large, too.",
    "This course is a work in progress. I think that Professor Fischer is keen to make the material approachable for students of all scientific backgrounds, in particular non-science majors, but that assignments and exams need some adjustment. This is an interesting course to take if you need a science credit and I think that future revisions by Professor Fischer will improve the format of the course.",
    "Life in the Universe is a fine course. Guest lectures are interesting, and it provides a handy tour of a lot of different scientific disciplines - astronomy, physics, earth sciences, and biology. The course a bit disorganized at the start, but the instructors are responsive to student needs and it soon took on a coherent form.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student that is interested in astronomy and wants to fill a credit for distributional requirements. The workload is decent and the information is interesting if you're into that kind of stuff."
