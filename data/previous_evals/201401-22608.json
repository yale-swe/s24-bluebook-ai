    "STAT 645 is an excellent class and I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student. Students primarily learn about HMM and MCMC methods and their applications to biology. There are two difficult problem sets and a final project with a presentation. The course is an excellent balance between the theoretical and the applied. You learn the math behind the techniques as well as how to execute the techniques with dynamic programming. I would only recommend the class for someone with a strong background in statistics and practice in R.",
