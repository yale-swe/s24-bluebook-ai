   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the energy sector, this is a great class to take. Oristaglio is very knowledgeable professor and the science behind fossil fuels is a compelling subject.",
    "goes over everything in the petroleum industry including exploration, discovery, history, and math related concepts (equations for finding oil, natural gas, etc. it also teaches you a fair amount about coal geology.",
    "I actually learned a lot about petroleum geology and related topics. You don't really need a a lot of background with science but knowing some basic chemistry and physics would probably be good. A worthy science credit.",
    "It's an interesting class if you're looking to gain a first or second look at the issues and want a geological perspective. It's not the best if you already have a lot of background knowledge, and some of the content isn't that engaging. It's not a difficult class the way it was taught in 2011.",
    "Fossil fuels is a really cool class. Very few classes at Yale are practical, but this one gives you a real practical understanding of the fossil fuels industry and how it functions. Definitely go on the field trips if you can!",
    "Surveyed the usage, effects and acquiring of fossil fuels in an industrial and geological context.",
    "Yes! Regardless of your politics, it is important to have a fundamental understanding of the realities of fossil fuel exploration and extraction as it has become such an important part of our world today.",
    "Energy is extremely important, and if you have any interest in how the world works (and need a science credit), it's worth taking this class. Lecture attendance is not necessary as the slides are online. There is a field trip to a shale gas fracking site -- fascinating to see environmental catastrophe taking place in front of your eyes. Profs. Oristaglio and Skinner are very nice and, although generally pro-industry, maintain a good balance of material and debate for the class."
