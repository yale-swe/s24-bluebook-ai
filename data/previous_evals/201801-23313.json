    "This was a great introduction to the various methodological approaches to comparative politics.",
    "I appreciated the broad approach to different research designs within the field of Comparative Politics. We read works that utilized different methodological approaches, some of which that I had never considered. I also feel better prepared to assess research designs in the field following the conclusion of this course.",
    "This course was a great survey of contemporary research in Comparative Politics, with an emphasis on exploring the range of methodologies used in the field. I gained a much better sense of how each of the methodologies discussed -- formal theory, field experiments, small-n case studies, and mixed methods -- work in application, and appreciated the opportunity to read and discuss important and respected books in the field.",
    "This class was vital for understanding the nuances of research design, and under what circumstances what designs might be most useful.",
    "Very helpful to conceptualize research design"

   "comments": [
    "I would have appreciated a bit more time on what process tracing is - but that might also be a personal failing. I really liked the processof designing and presenting a research agenda to my peers.",
    "The strengths of the courses were the student presentations. As first-years, we infrequently get the opportunity to stand up in front of a group and present our findings. This was very valuable, and would still be valuable if offered during the first semester. I also enjoyed the final project. It served as a great culminating project for the first year. Sometimes I felt that the discussions of the CP workshop went too long and detracted from discussions of the work assigned for class.",
    "I would have loved to read more books from the CP qualifying exam reading list.",
    "It would be helpful to focus a bit more on qualitative and quant methods."

    "Yes! This course was a wonderful introduction to the methodological approaches to, and current trends in, comparative political research.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students pursuing the CP sub-field as well as those who are looking to take one course in CP to gain familiarity with this portion of political science.",
    "If the student is interested in Comparative Politics, this is an excellent introduction and survey of contemporary research in the field.",
    "Incredibly useful class. Could not recommend highly enough. The final project was beyond helpful in allowing us to outline a research agenda and begin to think about how to conduct real research.",
    "Yes, good way to begin work on a potential dissertation topic"
