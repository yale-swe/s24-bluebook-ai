    "Take it. Very chill and you can learn something if you want",
    "You get the opportunity to focus on an area you're interested in with your paper. At the same time, class times are great overviews of material.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The workload is not difficult, and the material is interesting, particularly if you are entering the field of corporate finance or have thought about a job in corporate finance. The professor presents the topics in an easy-to-understand manner and the supplemental readings can be very interesting and applicable. The paper can be on any range of topics and the professor is great about providing assistance. Take this class.",
    "Survey of important concepts in corporate finance, followed by an open-ended research paper. The research paper is flexible and can be on your topic of choice, and it does not necessarily have to be technical.",
    "Great Econ seminar with manageable course load and freedom to write a paper on the topic of your choice. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in finance!",
    "You basically have to write one 15-20 page paper in the entire class. For the midterm you have to write 5-6 pages and then present your paper in class. There was no other lecture based work",
    "Easy. No work except one paper.",
    "Highly recommend this course. Fascinating balance of theoretical corporate finance, and real world policy and practice. Very manageable course load for a very interesting subject."
