   "comments": [
    "Abundant lecture contents.Assignments well matched lectures for practice.Not trying to make it difficult for us on the exams.",
    "I'm sure the material will be very helpful in the future, which is the biggest strength of the class. The class is also well-taught and structured, though, although I heard that might depend on your TA to some extent. Very importantly, the exams were fair.",
    "Weekly sections were helpful",
    "Strengths - well organized, comprehensive overview of subjectWeaknesses - Lectures are word for word on the slides, attending class isn't necessaryImprovements - Section was the most useful part of class, attending lectures was not necessary. Maybe making the lectures more discussion based or worth while.",
    "Strengths were clear lecture notes posted onlineweaknesses were that lecture was scattered and unclear sometimes.",
    "I thought the course was good and all of the slide material was very clear. However sometimes I felt like there was a little too much information to memorize, especially for the final.",
    "I didn't feel the necessity of going to class.Most of the concepts that were necessary were better taught and simplified in section.Workload was sometimes unnecessary.",
    "Could be improved if practice exam and exam answers were posted, or discussed in class. I didn't find the application lectures helpful at all, and wish we finished the slides we werent able to get through that day.",
    "Great introductory course. Helpful section discussions and homework assignments. The textbook worked well with the lectures.",
    "Excellent\u00ef\u00bc\u0081",
    "This course teaches many of the essentials of Epi which are needed throughout a public health career. I think this course could teach even more by cutting out some review sessions and having one less midterm.",
    "Learned a lot but it took a lot of time and effort.",
    "It was a great course. I learned a ton of material that coincided with that of other courses I was taking at the time. Definitely a good introduction to epidemiology.",
    "Strengths: The instructor introduced the material in a very clear manner. The material learned in this course is so pertinent to public health, and through the lectures, homework assignments, section, and even the exams, I was able to walk away feeling confident that I understood the foundation for epidemiology.Weaknesses: It was frustrating how the answers to the practice exam problems were never posted, even if we didn't have time to go over each question in class.",
    "The organization of this class was great! It is obvious that a lot of thought has gone into planning this class. The initial memorization of formulas is a little overwhelming, so I might help students with those first few lectures more.",
    "Great intro course.",
    "I liked the text book and felt that the material was very relevant. I did not enjoy the lectures.",
    "There was far too much busy work for a core class. There does not need to be a homework assignment or exam every single Friday.",
    "This class was good, but I wish the lectures were a little better. Then again, epidemiology can only be but so interesting when you are in the early stages. It was a lot of base knowledge we will need for the future.",
    "This class is a pretty standard introductory epidemiology class. The course is very well organized. The weekly problem sets are good for reviewing the lecture concepts. The readings are pretty much unnecessary.",
    "This was a great introduction to epidemiology. I appreciated that we had a number of exams and the sections were very helpful for going over new materials.",
    "This course was a great introduction to epidemiology and the basic statistics needed to read and understand research articles.",
    "Strength: Very structured and easy to followWeakness: Since I am not in an epidemiology program, most of the content will be inapplicable for my career. I enjoyed the first section of the course, but going into subjects like bias and effect modification felt like a pain to study. I had other courses I needed to focus on, but had to work on epi\/stats because they had a higher workload.",
    "I learned a lot, but it was easy.",
    "I learned so much from this course. I feel as if I have a really good basis for learning more epidemiology after this course.",
    "Good",
    "The homework, discussion, tests every week are most helpful.",
    "The lectures were very clear and easy to follow, though sometimes we did not finish the material that we needed to cover during the class period. I wish there had been more practice problems available before exams.",
    "I thought that the course was well structured, but I would definitely eliminate section. I kind of felt that after taking the time to look through the slides and complete the homework, section was a bit of an overkill. Lectures were very well organized though and the slides were easy to follow and use for reference when studying\/completing assignments.",
    "strengths: learn a lot, taught well, great professors and TA, accessible office hoursweaknesses: sometimes no time to go in depth or understand conceptually instead of mathematically",
    "I thought there was a little too much focus on some overly technical aspects of epi, but overall the course was good",
    "I enjoyed the weekly recitation and homework, and the semester design worked well. It's difficult to speak directly to the course, since Prof. Desai was working with someone else's lectures. I expect that things will be different next year, no matter what.",
    "Interesting",
    "Lecture slides were clear and complete enough to be useful in studying. I thought I was going to severely dislike the structure of recitation section, but I actually learned a great deal by doing the homework on my own, and learning about my mistakes immediately each Friday. This was much more effective for the learning process than turning in homework, and receiving TF comments\/grades.Also, I kind of hate to say this, but the tests were too easy (and I have no epi background). They could have been a bit more difficult and challenged us to apply the epi material in a less straightforward fashion.",
    "Strengths:--The class is a great introduction to important concepts that we will need in the public health field.--It was helpful to discuss homework in the discussion section. I know that I would not have bothered to check my answers without the discussion section.Weakness:-Many questions on the exam seemed to focus on some random, erroneous line on a random slide. It did not feel like we were getting tested on general concepts.--We should be allowed to use formula sheets because in the real world we will not be expected to have all this memorized",
    "The course was well organized and the homework followed along with the lectures. We should have done more math problems together in class though. Sometimes lecture felt very rushed.",
    "Great introductory course in epidemiology, very comprehensive",
    "Very helpful, learn a lot of things",
    "The course is very useful.",
    "I thought this course was a great introduction to epidemiology. The powerpoints were very helpful for studying and as a lecture supplement. I don't have much to suggest for improvement.",
    "Great class, I learned a lot of new information. Some weeks the lectures were a bit rushed and harder to follow.",
    "It was great! I loved everything about it.",
    "It's a fantastic class, and my favorite one in this semester.But the class is so big, and every time discussion cost too much time and the rest is not enough to cover lecture materials. Maybe elongating the class time is considerable.",
    "I really enjoyed Mayur's CDE 508 class. The material really appealed to me, and Mayur presented it well. The TAs also did a phenomenal job leading section.",
    "Meh, I think it could be a bit more challenging. I learned more in my undergraduate class at Berkeley.",
    "Learn basic knowledge about epidemiology. TA section is great for us to discuss problems.",
    "Like biostatistics, epidemiology is an important and necessary part of an MPH curriculum -- but this class was far too heavily focused on research methodologies, which are just short of irrelevant for anyone not going into research. We completely neglected the more interesting topic of how disease moves through a society, and the overall language of the course was very clearly aimed at students with a background\/future in the sciences. We were required to memorize unnecessary amounts of formulas and inane details, which were then tested and graded more harshly than necessary. TAs were helpful, and both they and the professor were available for consultation, but lectures often wandered around the heart of the material without answering direct questions. Overall, a somewhat frustrating experience.",
    "The lecture slides were helpful, but for the ones that require calculations, I think it would be nice if we could go through at least one example more in depth perhaps on the board rather than just going through the slides briefly.",
    "It was very interesting and covered many topics in a short amount of time.",
    "I thought it was a perfectly serviceable introductory class to epi. It was certainly very useful and covered all of the necessary topics. The cumulative nature was quite helpful. It felt a bit easy, but that might just be the nature of the beast. I kind of wish that the class had asked you to deal with some examples of complicated questions without absolutely clear answers, to help teach us how to deal with the issues we are likely to deal with later on. Most of the problems we were asked to work were very simple and straightforward. In terms of basic theory, it was a very solid course.",
    "Useful in building epidemiological knowledge",
    "Good lectures and the homework",
    "Good",
    "I am in the healthcare management track and although some of the lessons I learned from this course were interesting and useful, most of it is irrelevant to me and my career plans. I thought that those of us in the management track could've take this course in half a semester with the main concepts learned in that time. With one 2 years in the program, we could've taken a course that was more closely aligned with our career needs.",
    "I thought this was a well taught class as an introduction to epidemiology. Mayur Desai is an excellent teacher--engaging, responsive, funny, available--and is incredibly helpful one-on-one so I HIGHLY recommend office hours if you are having a hard time. Overall well-taught and well-organized (which is more a testament to Linda Niccolai's powerpoints).",
    "Strength: Very clear introduction.Weakness: Tough for those who just began to understand epi.",
    "At first I felt the class was too much work, but I think it really helped us to gear up for the tests and understand concepts. However, test questions were a bit ambiguous and felt it was too tricky.",
    "Although it was a lot of work at times, I learned so much. And I may be a bit biased because I have always liked Epi, but nonetheless an overall great course. This is truly the foundation of public health, so being able to understand Epi and read studies is critical for a public health career.Strengths: giving us hw assignments and exams every few weeks ensures we are keeping up with the material and tying everything in together; being able to review and print out the powerpoint slides before each class was really helpfulWeaknesses: the weekly hw assignments simply because sometimes it seemed like so much work (and the workload was not consistent from week to week)Improvements: When the guest lecturer (PhD candidate) presented the topic on PH screening, she integrated mini discussion groups throughout the lecture which I thought was fun and a great way to keep the class interesting",
    "I feel like this class gave a good overview of the field of epidemiology. It covered all of the important topics, and was really interesting. I liked all the use of articles from real journals, because it really highlighted all the things that we now know how to do!",
    "The lectures covered too much material and usually the last 20 minutes of class he sped through the slides. It may be beneficial to cut down the slides in order to give adequate time to go through the material.",
    "It was a well organized class, with great TAs and professor. The hw did allow for the opportunity to pace learning with the material.",
    "Albeit didactic, I found the material extremely useful especially for future research projects.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I liked that the book and the lectures were synchronized in their material. I also appreciated that there were important real-world cases included in the class. I could see myself thinking differently, reading papers differently, as the course went on. I think the homework assignments were helpful to hammer in the concepts, but sometimes were overwhelming in the amount of work they involved.",
    "The weekly assignments and Friday sessions were useful in grasping the material. The TA powerpoints were especially helpful in preparing for exams.",
    "This course was a very good overview of epidemiology. Dr. Desai is engaging and knowledgeable. The content covered here is very important to public health.",
    "This is good for a big introductory level class. The lectures covered a wide range of topics with generally a good level of detail, and the homeworks made sure we were clear on concepts and calculations. I like the homework grading system, whereby homeworks are graded pass\/fail based on your original work plus the corrections you made to it during discussion section. That made it more a learning opportunity than an up-front test of your grasp of the material. One weakness was that some of the requirements were specific to the point of preventing more in-depth exploration or tolerance of answers at all different from exactly what was given in class.",
    "Good. Glad this course is required for the MPH program.",
    "Powerpoints were helpful, especially if you were not able to make a class you can learn a lot from the powerpoint. Not sure how helpful sections were because mostly we just went over homework, I don't think it was needed every week on top of lecture.",
    "Excellent course!",
    "Going over homework in section was very helpful for learning how to apply lectures",
    "The course was able to give a good idea and understanding of epidemiology, and gave us skills for reading epi studies that I think are incredibly important. The biggest weakness would have to be that the homework setup (self-graded and then turned in, for credit), makes for far less motivation to put energy into the homework.",
    "Nice Leture, helpful discussion session",
    "I think the structure of the class was excellent and very organized and coherent. No recommendationns for improvement.",
    "Strengths:Discussion sections are extremely helpful and reinforces a lot of the key points taught during lecture. Weekly homework assignments are also beneficial.",
    "Everything about the course was great except for the section. Section did not need to be as long. It also would have been helpful if answers to practice test questions were posted online before the exam.",
    "The classroom instruction was great, the tests left something to be desired though.",
    "I thought the instructor did an excellent job given that it was the first time teaching this course.",
    "I enjoyed the course material, however, at times I thought the material was a bit basic and somewhat boring.",
    "I thought the course was an excellent intro into all things public health. It seemed like critical subject material for first year students regardless of department. The weekly homework forced me to stay on top of subject material, and I felt like I retained a lot of information from lectures.",
    "excellent and useful introduction class for health professionals.",
    "A broad but good foundation for epidemiologically relevant concepts.A bit taxing to the un-initiated and\/or unexposed but not exactly overwhelming.PLUS: Discussion sections truly designed to support comprehension of the material as opposed to simply critiquing performance.NOT-SO-PLUS: Practice Exams meager previews to the actual examinations.",
    "This an excellent course. Among the several strengths of this course are the essential content for public health, and the professor and TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to teach and willingness to help. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any weakness.",
    "The course is very useful and absolutely essential as a foundational course in public health. I felt that there could have been more practice problems during the weeks when we had exams, although the problem sets were useful in preparing us for the exams.",
    "The organization of the class with lecture and weekly problem sets is very helpful, as are the practice exams and TAs. I didn't find the power points as helpful as they could be. They frequently did not have full explanations of topics that we were tested on."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Of the five cousres I took this semester, this is the most useful and meaningful course. I had an overall understanding of epidemiology, and because of the way Dr.Mayur Desai taught us, how students in the past developed their thesis and publications, it was so encourging that persuaded me into a path of epidemiologist, and I'm preparing for a PhD degree because of this course as well. Just want to thank Dr. Mayur Desai for this wonderful course.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was a very enthusiastic professor, which was very helpful to the students. However, he also would be confusing at times, wouldn't get through the whole lecture in class time, and would graze over many concepts that were mentioned in the lecture. I think you can attribute this to the fact that he didn't design the slides or structure of the class, though.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strengths - knowledgeableWeaknesses - talks on tangents, spends more time talking about not wasting time then actually getting through the course material, long winded.Improvements - more to the point and concise",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0There was too much information on the slides and too many slides to get through in the time provided",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Desai was friendly and engaging but wasn't always great and teaching us the information we needed to know.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I thought Professor Desai followed the lectures well but sometimes digressed. If he stayed more on point I think I would have gotten more out of the lectures",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Though a very enthusiastic, well informed professor, I felt that more time was spent on studies while not building the foundation making some concepts more difficult to grasp than others.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great instructor, but I wish he were able to get through all the lecture slides in class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Enthusiastic, great sense of humor, clear powerpoints. However, sometimes the review sessions for exams left me more confused than if I had not attended.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent\u00ef\u00bc\u0081Informative!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great teacher, keeps the class involved and intrigued. Sometimes goes on too many tangents which are unrelated to class. There was one person in the class that took up way too much time with his questions. Mayur probably should have told him to restrict his \"participation\" as it took away from other students' time.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur took a while to grow on, but once you adapted he was great. He tended to go on rants and wouldn't answer course material questions via email (which was annoying) but he was very helpful after class and in office hours.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor's presentations were great, and he was always willing to meet with students outside of office hours. He does tend to digress during lecture, which resulted in presentations not fully being completed. As a result, students became confused of some material because he did not explain it in lecture. Tracking time more effectively would be the key of this evaluation.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strengths: Although the material was mandatory, the manner in which it was taught made learning it enjoyable. The professor was funny and used relatable examples to explain some of the concepts. He made sure his tests were transparent and was always readily available to talk.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Prof says too much jokes at times and thus the lecture material cannot be fully covered during the lecture duration. Maybe by not talking outside the lecture content, he could cover the essential lecture materials.Having said that, Prof is very friendly and approachable and explains the content material quite well.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I liked this professor, but sometimes it was difficult to understand his lectures. I also understand that he filled in at the last minute (and you could see how much effort he put into the class), but sometimes he was a little disparaging. I kept working harder to improve my test scores, for example, and he seemed almost upset when we did well on the third test (which I had studied very hard for). I know professors have varying personalities and shouldn't be expected to hold our hands, but the combination of our professor and the new material was a little intimidating for a first-time epidemiology student.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0LOVE Mayur! Although I was very sad for Linda's medical situation, I'm so glad I got this great introduction to epi with Mayur. He's very frank, funny, clear, and incredibly FAIR with grading and how he goes about the class. Looking forward to taking his Analytic Methods course next semester (which is saying a lot because I really very strong dislike stats and SAS...)",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0For me, the lectures were frustrating. It was difficult to follow Dr. Desai and he sometimes created more confusion.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I liked him a lot, great sense of humor and really easy to talk to. He was especially helpful outside of class. He helped me in office hours several times and I really benefited from those sessions one-on-one. The only bad thing was that he would often talk too much about unrelated things and then run out of time for actual course material at the end of the lecture. He did that for at least 4 lectures near the end of the semester, where he would spend too much time entertaining \"what if\" scenarios from students who just wanted to be contrarian, or he would try to crack too many jokes, then we would not get to like 8 slides. Besides that, he was a very good professor, he is super knowledgeable. Very dedicated, and he loves his kids.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur explains things very clearly.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Mayur was fabulous. He was very engaging and yet informative in class. He was very accessible during office hours and stayed until all questions were answered.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was very clear in lecture and explained concepts in a way that was very easy to understand.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a good instructor, but he went on tangents too often. Something that should have taken 5 minutes to explain ends up taking 20 minutes because 1) he says he's not going to talk about something but then ends up talking about it, 2) he tells stories that have just a small bit of relevance to the subject, 3) he allows students to ask simple questions about subjects that have already been covered in class, so it's wasting everyone else's time. Those questions are meant for office hours and TAs.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He was awesome. Really wanted us to learn, was clear and funny.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Desai was a great instructor, especially considering he had to teach us Professor Niccolai's slides.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is very smart and very funny. I love his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0very interesting and nice teacher",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I found his teaching style to be interesting and easy to follow. His explanations were helpful, and he was always willing to answer questions. I do wish that he would have tried a little harder to get through all of the material for each class period without having to rush through important concepts at the end of the class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a really great person. It is clear that he is very knowledgeable and cares so much about epi. Sometimes though, he would get so excited that we would not be able to get through all of the material in that day's lecture.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Desai: great lecturer, seems like a great mentor, energetic, caring, humorousNiccolai: great lecturer, seems like a great mentor, caring",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Good, cared about students, could have been slightly more efficient in presenting lecture material",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He should have a mustache year-round. The mustache with the Nehru jacket was priceless. If he didn't have such an infectious smile he could have passed as an evil super-villain.Other than his appearance, he was an engaging and responsive instructor who was happy to spend time working with students.Several of us took offense, however, when he assumed that the reason the class did well on the 3rd exam was because it was easier than the others. I know that, for me and my friends, the reason that we did well was because we worked hard on the homework, talked with out TAs, read the book, and studied well into the night. It was somewhat offensive to have the result of our hard work dismissed offhand in such a way.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0enthusiastic, interesting, coherent",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The professor is charismatic and passionate about the material. He can be a bit shrill about harping on completing the reading material for the class. At this point we are adults and graduate students and we all make cost\/benefit analyses of how much of the reading to complete. Scolding\/shaming does not increase the chances that I will read (although it does increase the chances that I will wear a bike helmet... odd, that).Mayur loves to perform in front of the class, and the class is receptive to it, which made class more entertaining for all involved.While I do not have a natural-born love of epi or an aptitude for the required epi mindset, this class taught me to appreciate some of the finer details of the discipline.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0In the beginning I had a really negative perception of Mayur. He treated us like children. The first class all he did was scream and tell us that we are not allowed to go on the internet during class. He mentioned how he can see everything and that he will catch us texting, sleeping or browsing the internet. The second class all he did was rant about how he was so mad that many of us were late to section and how we will get points deducted.After the third exam, the class average on the exam was a 90 and he kept ranting about how most likely the exam was too easy. He said he should be happy that we did well but all he could think about was the exam not being challenging enough.In regards to the first two classes: Of course, the professor should discuss the class rules in the beginning. However, he does not need to treat us like children who do not know basic classroom rules. Of course we know that we cannot text, sleep, or browse the internet. He did not need to spend more than 1 minute mentioning this. During the second class, I agree that he should mention that lateness will result in reduction of class participation. However, he said it in a very angry and accusatory way (more like a parent). It was not fair for the whole class to be subjected to this, especially when most of us were on time. In regards to the exam, instead of celebrating the class successes, he seemed angry that we did well. That does not encourage us to do better.Besides these three incidents, Mayur was very likable for those of us who got past these incidents. He always approached students and seemed to care for our opinions regarding the exam. He really tried hard to make the exams fair, by discussing it with the TAs.Mayur was full of interesting anecdotes and we were often sidetracked by some tangent (many times relating to class material). As a result, many times we did not finish going over the slides. It was confusing to go home and go through class material that was not discussed in lecture. Mayur was well aware of the fact that he often did not finish going over the slides, but he still kept discussing random anecdotes.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was very approachable and easy to get in touch with. I wish we had more lecture time because we were often rushing, but he had such interesting things to talk about.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The slides were great, but Mayur tended to digress many times and consequently, run out of time to cover all the material in time. Maybe a few less digressions next time would be helpful so there's time in class to go over all the slides.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is so nice, and always willing to help.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very good instructor",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is great!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was an entertaining and informative lecturer. He tied ideas together well and I thoroughly enjoyed attending class despite the early hours.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was great, some classes he went off topic and was forced to rush through the material at the end of lecture, making it difficult to understand the topic.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is incredible. Very informative and fun lectures.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He brings lots of fun to class. And he is so humble and easy to talk.weakness.... haven't figured it out.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I thought Mayur was an excellent instructor, and I always found lecture to be engaging and insightful. Mayur's lecture style really appealed to me - I liked that he was always animated and never dull. I think he also was very good at responding to questions in class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is great. He came into an awkward situation and did his best.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great teacher! Clearly rule out the knowledge, make thoery interesting and practical.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0If you have experience or interest in the sciences, Professor Desai is right up your alley. If you do not, his lectures can feel patronizing or dismissive of non-scientific backgrounds or interests. Too much relianceon powerpoints made lectures often just a read-through, and when there was confusion about the material answers were often indirect and unfulfilling. Exams were tricky, with too many points taken off for an initial mathematical error and too many trick questions that didn't test for knowledge so much as they tested for memorization of slight and barely-significant details. Overall, not a good fit for me -- but the CDE\/EMD students were thrilled.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very available, and office hours were helpful. Sometimes rushed through slides and I would end up having to learn a lot of the material on my own.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is very intelligent and a good professor. Sometimes he spoke very fast and still we didn't always finish the lectures which was frustrating. However in office hours he really takes the time to explain and clarify all questions.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I thought he did an admirable job stepping into someone else's course. He often had a tendency to give very lengthy answers to questions, meaning that he often failed to finish the powerpoints. In one instance, he asked three separate questions about a slide that he rushed over at the end of a lecture, which was frustrating. He's obviously very knowledgable and very open and receptive to questions in office hours. He was committed to making sure that the students fully understood the material.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Good in lecture and provides good feedback when meeting with him one on one",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Spent a lot of time babbling at the beginning of lectures",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Nice guy",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Had a lot of charisma but I found myself teaching myself most of the concepts outside of lecture.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Professor Mayur tried to keep us engaged and interested in the subject matter. He was able to talk through concepts using real-world examples. He often ran out of time and didn't finish the slides because he would go off on tangents sometimes when explaining certain concepts. Overall, he did a good job of taking on a class that was pushed onto him last minute. I do like Professor Niccolai more asan instructor for this course.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent teacher. Engaging, responsive, funny, available.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Strength: Able to sustain attention.Weakness: Write difficult exams.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Good professor. It was his first time teaching the course and I think he did a great job, considering he was using other slides.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0In the first few weeks, I felt like he was not as prepared as he could have been. He often went off on a tangent and wasnot always able to finish presenting the slides in the time allotted (but given he was not prepared to teach the class, that was expected). He did get much better though, and I really enjoyed him as an instructor. He is very funny and entertaining, and really drilled into our heads how important Epi is to public health. Going into his office hours was really helpful; he explained things very clearly and helped me understand some of the more challenging Epi concepts.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was enthusiastic about the subject matter and a good teacher. While he did occasionally get lost on a tangent, I thought his experience in the field was a real asset to the course.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0strengths: his humor made the morning lectures more than bearable, esp for those not interested in epiweaknesses: many times, he wasn't able to finish the lecture on time leaving some material uncovered (which is fine if you read the book as a supplement or attend OH)",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He was great in making the course information valuable for all students, and was one of the more engaging professors this semester. Also, very helpful during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was very clear in explaining the concepts. He did an excellent job considering the lecture material was not his. He is clearly very passionate about teaching epidemiology as thoroughly as possible. However, sometimes he does tend to go off track and so would end up speeding through the material towards the end of the class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I thought Mayur did a great job stepping in, and really taught the class well. The one problem was pacing the lectures so we could cover the material in time. But overall, I thought he was an engaging and effective teacher.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I liked that the instructor brought in a lot of real world experiences.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was a very good lecturer, and he wrote well-balanced and relevant exams. He sometimes tended to go over the allotted time, but his tangents were still relevant to the course content.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Very good. Personable, even in front of a huge class. Interesting to learn from, and gave his honest opinions of methods\/ideas, instead of just teaching us exactly what the book said.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Good sense of humor. Very organized and easy to follow. Clear.Grading was overly harsh at times. Instead of reflecting the students knowledge of the material, the grades oftentimes were more of a reflection of the standardized mode though which the papers were graded.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Good lecturer, knowledgable, personable, did a good job conveying the information in lecture.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Excellent instructor! Could probably work on time management, but is excellent at getting concepts through to the students in the most practical manner.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mature Desai was very engaging and presented the material in an interesting way",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur seems like he would be a great instructor with his own material. Sometimes you could tell what he was not a fan of as far as material from Linda's syllabus. He also seemed to skip over the math sections, which really made it hard to associate them with the bigger picture concepts he discussed in class.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur was engaging and fun to listen to. Occassionally he would be tangentile which would cause us to not get through all the class slides so this coulkd be improved upon. Overall he was a great instructor for a class he doesn't normally teach.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is a solid insturctor. I wish he didn't rush through the material at the end of most lectures. However, it's understandable given the massive amount of information.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Good; engaging and interesting lectures, although sometimes expects a higher level of experience in the class than we have.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Awesome the best!!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Great instructor, made a relatively uninteresting subject engaging. Test marking was way too rigid.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The only critique I have of the instructor's teaching style is that sometimes he went way through the material too quickly.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0I thought Mayur Desai did not do an excellent job with teaching the class. He would often ramble in the beginning of class which would result in us not finishing the lecture in time. This was be especially problematic during review sessions.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was great! He was witty and had firm control over subject matter. There were occasions when we did not make it through the lecture material, but that did not bother me, since lecture slides were relatively thorough and easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0profound knowledge of epi, and he knows how to unfold complex concept by breaking down to small and easy piece.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He strikes me as very passionate about his subject matter, even the bits that definitely would be elementary concepts to his eyes, and was able to transfer some of his enthusiasm to students.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0VERY knowledgeable. Passionate. Willing to engage. Thoughtful with regard to the subject material. Quite humorous.Can be a bit intimidating especially when offering a scathing review of an academic paper that incorrectly describes measures of association or incorrectly classifies study design.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is an awesome instructor. He was very passionate with the topic of the course and he transmitted his passion to the group. His explanations were very clear and he was always opened to any kind of question. He was very punctual and respectful with the group.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He tends to go off on tangents during lectures and despite his protest to the contrary, his exams did seem unnecessarily tricky at times. However he genuinely made an effort to be available to students to answer questions.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai was pleasant and professional and I can't think of anything he should change. He was particularly fair with regards to ensuring test questions were fair and clearly understood."

    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Very strong TA. Adrienne went above and beyond the basic requirements. Clearly cares a lot.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Adrienne was wonderful! Very knowledgeable and helpful. Even when she didn't know the answer to our questions, she would admit it, ask Mayur (or others), and then get back to us with the answer, making sure we understood.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Adrienne did a great job. She was responsive and knew what she was talking about.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0BEST TA! Helped with the material so much. Cant say enough good things about her.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Adrienne was an amazing TA. She was super helpful each week during section, makingsure that we understood the important concepts and creating very helpful summary slides at the end of her powerpoints. She was always patient and I feel very lucky to have had her as my TA!",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0She was the best!!! So smart! Really smart and helpful, she even met with me by myself once. I liked her a lot. Good at Epi, she knows her stuff.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Adrienne was a fantastic TA. She obviously knew her stuff, and she explained concepts very clearly.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0I'm really grateful that I was in Adrienne's section. She has such a thorough understanding of epi and was incredibly fast in returning our assignments!",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0She was always nice, helpful, and well-prepared. I really appreciated some of the extra materials that she provided to help in studying for exams.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0She's a gem! Always available and willing to help.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0I am so grateful to have Adrienne as my TA. She is always helpful, and her summary of the lectures is very good.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Very helpful and clear, office hours were also helpful, always willing to answer our questions",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Adrienne is a great TA, very helpful when answering questions, explaining. She also makes extra efforts putting together study tables that are very helpful! Overall, excellent TA.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Great TA. She was very helpful during discussion sections and had the most helpful slides for tests. However, for discussion I wish we didn't focus as much on going over the homework. Instead maybe go over some important concepts and prepare us for the tests?",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Good. Very nice and helpful. Thorough, patient with questions, willing to explain things differently and ask the professor for help if she couldn't answer our questions.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0One of the best TAs I've had! Very helpful and good at explaining concepts.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Great TA, Very helpful !",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Everyone loves Adrienne. Excellent teaching and section organization. Extremely confident and knowledgeable about course material. It is very lucky to have her as my TA.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Suzanne Viola \u00a0Adrienne was a smart and earnest TA for Epi. She had a great command of the material and was professional yet helpful in her interactions with students. I would want her for a TA in the future.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Really helpful on weekly assignments discussion.Prepared easy ways for us to understand difficult concepts or calculations.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0A bit meek in the classroom; some of the students spoke over him and he needs to be more confident",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben seemed extremely uncomfortable answering questions. I felt that several of his answers were not always correct. Additionally, I felt that he did not properly explain several of the questions that came up during section.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben is very nice and incredibly smart. But for whatever reason, he seemed very nervous in class and seemed to get easily shaken by questions from students. I think because he's so intelligent in epi, many things seemed common knowledge to him, when we really needed super basic explanations for things that he wasn't fully able to provide.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben was very knowledgable about epidemiology, but needed to be more assertive to deal with our section and the hypothetical questions.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben is clearly very smart and very knowledgeable about epidemiology. I think that sometimes he struggled with the dynamic of our section given that we had a lot of women with very strong personalities. I kind of felt that his timid demeanor got in the way of my comprehension because I would be worried about asking questions because I didn't want to make him uncomfortable. I think that if Ben was a little more assertive and had some more confidence in his answers (which are always correct), he would be a more helpful TA.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Was good at explaining class material, ran the sections efficiently",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben has a good mastery over the material and was earnest in addressing everyone's questions. However, he seemed to be insecure about his ability to control the class... which I think was sensed by the students and possibly led to increased undesirable behavior such as tardiness. The context of recitation seemed to be more in line with college than graduate studies. Have confidence, Ben! We are all peers in the same discipline with intellectual curiosity working toward a common goal.",

    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben was a good TA.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Was unsure of himself most of the time but understandable it was his first time. He will get better with practice!",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben was knowledgeable and able to answer almost every question lobbed at him. As some constructive feedback though, a LOT of the class could have been streamlined. What frequently happened in open ended responses is people continuously asked \"Is my answer ok?\" Perhaps on those questions Ben could bullet main points to include and then people can check off for that instead of exact wording.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Strength: Makes powerpoints for homework\/studying. Helpful. Clear.Weakness: Sometimes lack confidence in himself.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Strengths: the hw slides were very helpful each week, but perhaps a couple more summary slides or comparison charts about the material we had learned in the week.Weaknesses: sometimes he was not able to or did not know how to answer some questions students presented to him in class. He seemed a bit nervous, so if he could try to make the class a bit more laid back and interesting, that might help",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben put together excellent powerpoints that were really helpful when studying for exams or reviewing homework. He seemed a bit nervous during seminars at times, but his explanations are extremely valuable.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Good TA! Very resourceful!",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Good. Sometimes his explanations make the topics more complicated than necessary, but generally good at answering questions and keeping the discussion section running smoothly.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Richard Szymanski \u00a0Ben is a wonderful TA but section was often drawn out. It may have been better if we went a little faster and those with personal confusion stayed after to ask questions,.",

    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0Excellent and Responsible!",
    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0I loved Elise -- she was confident, knowledgeable, and approachable. I almost learned more from sections with her than I did from the lectures. One strength is that Elise is great at not making you feel embarrassed when you are incorrect; she just meets you where you are and helps redirect you.",
    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0Wonderful TA! Great instructor, good feedback!",
    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0Strength: Very patient and explained things well.Weakness: There were times during the TA sessions that felt like time had slowed down because one student would start having a one-on-one conversation with Elise about all the hypotheticals of a question. I understand that she's trying to be helpful, but allowing a single student to take other people's time is unfair. When a student begins to ask multiple 'what ifs' and no one else in the room is joining in, that student should be told to go to office hours.",
    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0Great. Helpful and very knowledgeable. Graded my homework thoroughly.",
    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0Strengths: sweet, friendly, approachable, easy to understand, willing to helpWeaknesses: she could perhaps know the material better, but I think that shewill get better with experience.

    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0Very good. Clear and helpful",

    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0Great TA! Able to answer questions asked by students clearly.",
    "Instructor: Elise Grace Elliott \u00a0Elise was fine. A couple of times she didn't know how to answer a question or would say incorrect things. Most of the time she would come back later and make it clear what the right answer was. She gave ample opportunity for everyone to participate equally, and was committed to doing a good job as a TA.",

    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0Very excited, and invested in students",

    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0Pavita did a very satisfactory job. She encourages students who are struggling to do better. However, for questions a little beyond the scope, she didn't give as much of her own opinion before just saying that I should speak to mayur.",
    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Pavita Singh \u00a0Pavita was awesome! She was a great teacher, and made herself available as a resource to us. She reviewed the pertinent topics at the beginning of each section, and wasn't afraid to tell us if she wasn't sure about the answer and had to look it up.",

    "Instructor: Robyn Arcadia Cree \u00a0Very approachable and knowledgable. The only weakness was that she would have a hard time telling you your answer was wrong which confused other students.",
    "Instructor: Robyn Arcadia Cree \u00a0She was so wonderful and helpful in section every week. She did a great job in recapping important lessons from the week's lectures.",
    "Instructor: Robyn Arcadia Cree \u00a0Robyn is great, very knowledgable and friendly. In general during the section we went over homework I'm not sure how helpful it really was especially every week on Fridays. This has nothing to do with the TA just the section itself. Maybe it would be more helpful to have it less often. It was helpful to have access to all the information on classes v2 as well as the powerpoints Robyn and the other TAs put together.",
    "Instructor: Robyn Arcadia Cree \u00a0Great TA!",
    "Instructor: Robyn Arcadia Cree \u00a0Robyn was great and covered the required amount of material in section (going over homeworks) but it would have helped to include more of a review of the lecture material in section as well.",

   "comments": [
    "This course is foundamental to all public health students, so it is recommended to take, even for biostatistics majors.",
    "It's a requirement that gives knowledge on the basic concepts of epidemiology. I would recommend it.",
    "averagee",
    "Good overview of material. Tests are fair.",
    "The material is necessary for a degree in public health, so yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes",
    "Great introduction to epidemiology, would highly recommend it.",
    "Great!",
    "Very important information, highly recommended for those inside and outside of Epidemiology.",
    "I really learned a lot.",
    "I believe this course would help students deconstruct and analyze research studies effectively. It definitely touches on many aspects of public health research. I would definitely recommend taking this course to any student interested in learning about epidemiology design and research.",
    "This course teaches the fundamental tools needed for epidemiology. I would recommend it because not only was it taught well, but the material is interesting and pertinent to public health.",
    "This is an important class to take and really well-organized. I would strongly recommend it to another student!",
    "Of all the required courses, this is a class I enjoyed and I feel like it has prepared me (or began to prepare me) for a real life experience and career in public health. Thanks!",
    "I thought that this course was effective for teaching the basics of epi. However, I did not feel that the lectures were beneficial.",
    "Of course, if you want to know anything about Epidemiology you need to take the class because it covers all the principles you need to know. You will get to read some good papers and start to appreciate the methods they use and how epi studies are done.",
    "This is a solid intro epi course, I recommend it.",
    "This is a great introduction to epidemiology that is assessed fairly and very engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was very informative",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I enjoyed the first section about the measures of frequency, association, and studies.",
    "It's required, so it really doesn't matter if I recommend it.",
    "Great course!",
    "Yes!",
    "Strongly recommend. After taking this course, you may find epi very interesting.",
    "I would say that the course requires a lot of hours in the classroom, but that the material is pretty intuitive and the exams are fair. I would definitely recommend this as a good introduction to the field of epidemiology.",
    "great intro to epi, very reasonable workload",
    "It is a class about the study and investigation of patterns of disease. The course covers quantitative and qualitative aspects of epidemiological research design and analysis. Plus, it's required.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the class but warn the student about the interesting personality of our professor and ask the student to get past Mayur's random outbursts and tendencies to get side-tracked. If Mayur would treat his students like young adults, not complain about stellar class performance, and stick to his material...he could be a great professor.",
    "This class was a great into to epidemiology",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "This course is really important as a foundation for all public health.",
    "Very good course",
    "This is a great introductory course. If you have basic knowledge of epidemiology, it might be less useful.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to those who have not taken epidemiology before.",
    "I would recommend this course, I learned a lot of useful new information.",
    "Wonderful class!",
    "It's an awesome class, everyone enjoys that.",
    "CDE 508 with Mayur was a great class. I would definitely recommend it. Mayur is great, and the TAs were also excellent. I feel that I got a solid grasp of introductory epidemiology from this course, and I feel well-prepared in moving on to more advanced classes.",
    "If you've taken epi before, do what you can to get out of this. Its bare bones simple epidemiology.",
    "It's a required course but i do recommend it!",
    "Useful material for evaluating public health research, but frustrating if your primary interests lie outside of the sciences. Stay on top of the readings and life is a lot better. Making flashcards for every definition and formula as the semester goes along will be a big help. Learn when to use Relative Risk versus Odds Ratio!!",
    "Useful in understanding studies that we discuss in other classes",
    "I thought it was a perfectly serviceable introductory class to epi. It was certainly very useful and covered all of the necessary topics. However, it's hard to get too excited about it because of the nature of the material. But the class will teach your more or less what you need to learn.",
    "Solid basic epi course",
    "Good class! I retained a lot of information",
    "Good",
    "yes",
    "As I mentioned before, students who are in the health policy or healthcare management tracks will probably not like this course. I feel that I could have taken a more useful course that is more relevant to my interests in its place. Nevertheless, I did learn a lot in this course. It was well organized despite the sudden instructor change. I am not sure how much of this information I will actually use in my career, and I am glad we only need to take it for one semester.",
    "I would recommend it and believe it to be essential to your formation as a Public Health student.",
    "Great start for public health career but need a lot of effort.",
    "It's required and should be. Learned a lot.",
    "The coarse was awesome to give an overall view of Epidemiology.",
    "It's a required course, but I would still take it even if it wasn't. You learn an incredible amount in just one semester, and being able to read and understand a research study or article is so fulfilling.",
    "This course is a broad overview of epidemiology that will make you familiar with all of the major types of epidemiologic research and the types of calculations that you need to know to do such projects. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "I would recommend it; came out with a solid grasp and understanding of the material.",
    "I would recommend it because itteaches the fundamentals of epidemiology and the concepts are something any public health professional should strive to grasp. It's also well-taught and well-organized.",
    "I think this was a great introductory course to Epidemiology. Really made you think the way you should when conducting and evaluating a study. The material may not have been the most fun, but I can definitely see the importance of taking this class.",
    "It's a required class but is worthwhile.",
    "This course is a really good introduction to an important part of public health, and Dr. Desai is a very good teacher. I would recommend it to anyone entering a public health field.",
    "This is a general introduction to the field of epidemiology, covering general concepts, study design, and basic data analysis. I would recommend it as a good overview to someone without an epidemiology background, but would not recommend it to someone who already knew the field, as it would likely be too basic.",
    "Great course! learned a lot. Tough grading, though!",
    "Introductory course to Epidemiology - 2 lectures with one section on Friday. Core course so it is required. Spent a lot of time on homework and exams for this classes compared to other classes.",
    "Definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in public health!",
    "This course provides the fundamentals of epidemiology in a digestible manner. I absolutely would recommend it, if for no other reason than it helps you to interpret the results of public health studies, and make conclusions based off those interpretations.",
    "awesome. And yes!",
    "Overall it is a very enjoyable and useful course.",
    "Definitely a good class to take in order to get a general understanding of study design\/evaluation of results.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The instructor and TA'S were all excellent. The only thing that may need to be improved is the speed in which the instructor went through the material, which I believed was too fast.",
    "I think this course is critical for any 1st year YSPH student. It lays a nice groundwork for the research methods and studies that all of us will encounter innumerable times as public health students, and I think I got the most out of this class of all the courses I took this semester! I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Of course yes. She sets a great example for future TAs.",
    "A broad but good foundation for epidemiologically relevant concepts.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have ever taken. I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. The course\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content is essential and the instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teaching abilities are very remarkable.",
    "Epidemiology is not my area of interest, but it is useful. Whether or not I would recommend the course (which I do), it is mandatory for students in the school of public health.",
    "This course is required, butI would say that every effort has been made to make it a manageable work load and subject material."
