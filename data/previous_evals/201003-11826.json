   "comments": [
    "This is a superb course. The workload is demanding but your Latin will improve enormously throughout the semester. Prof. Peirano is an exceptionally good section leader who involves the entire class in translation and discussion. She is also accessible and ready to help both with any difficulties you may encounter and to direct you to other texts which connect with your academic interests. Don't hesitate to take this course, or another taught by Irene Peirano.",
    "This is a great class, and Professor Peirano is truly a wonderful teacher. She explains things very clearly, makes time for her students and designs the assessment well. In addition to having an impressive knowledge of the subject matter, she is also a lovely person. The material on the syllabus (all of the Bellum Catilinae, and much of the Bellum Jugurthinum) is very interesting too. Expect to work moderately hard but be rewarded for everything you do.",
    "This is a good course to take if you are interested in Sallust and his works. Prof. Peirano is very kind and one of the best Latin teachers you can ask for here. You will be expected to translate every class out loud as she calls on everyone. There is a lot of work at the end of the semester with a presentation, final paper AND final exam.",
    "This is a great class to take, especially for any Classics majors. The texts cover really interesting periods in Roman history (though you may, like me, get a little tired of warring African kings by the end of the Bellum Jugurthinum) and the language is challenging enough and fun to translate. Professor Peirano is actually the sweetest person and is very supportive, especially when you're writing the papers. Not a huge workload when compared to other Latin classes, though some weeks it doesmount up, but overall, a pretty good deal for a Latin class.",
    "Latin 433 was a fantastic class with a fascinating examination of Sallust and his historiography. Professor Peirano is also fantastic, and you should absolutely try to have her for a Latin class if possible. She does a great job keeping the translation accurate without stressing out the person translating, our discussions are interesting, and she gives great feedback on papers and other written work.",
    "In this course, we studied Sallust's historical monographs, the Bellum Catilinae and the Bellum Jugurthinum, focusing on the historian's writing style and its relationship to the content. I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in Latin because I think it dramatically improved my ability to translate and taught me to read Latin in a different way. It also deepened my understanding of the role of historiography and of Rome itself.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who is very interested in the subject and enjoys reading and analyzing lots of Latin text. It is a demanding course."
