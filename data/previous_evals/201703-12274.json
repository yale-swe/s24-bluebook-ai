    "This course did force me to speak more during class but I felt at times I was forced to speak even when it was clear that I was uncomfortable and confused on our discussion.To improve this I think teachers should force more on making sure students truly understand the stories and content we are discussing.",
    "The strengths of the course is the amount that every student learns. It is impossible to take the course without learning a lot. The only weakness was the hard assessments.",
    "I think this course did a good job teaching the grammar rules, however, I did not feel very comfortable and fluent when it came to talking on the fly.",
    "Strengths: small class size Weaknesses: extremely fast paced, if I had not taken Spanish courses in the past there would be no way for me to keep up, Supersite is unnecessarily expensive",
    "The professor was bad",
    "strengths: you get out of the course what you put in (generally) weaknesses: not interested in the course"
