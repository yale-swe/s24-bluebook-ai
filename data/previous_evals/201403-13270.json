    "I can never be bothered without filling out evaluations, but I felt compelled to write this in order to save other students from the misery which is Yale's Japanese program. Taking Japanese here has been the worst academic experience of my entire life, and honestly, one of the worst experiences of my life. The workload is beyond excessive and the teachers are downright mean, condescending, unnecessarily harsh, and overall just not very nice people. The syllabus is overwhelming compacted with assignments; the emphasis in this class is to assign a colossal amount of work that is unbearable and completely forget about having students actually learn content. One of the worst aspects is the grading. If you take this class, expect to take tests and quizzes and finish them feeling confident you performed very well and then have tons of points taken off for irrational things that no teacher would ever consider doing. Nothing about this class is positive other than the fellow students who endure the misery. Do NOT take Japanese at Yale. Nearly everyone in my class has said they wish they had pursued another language. I guarantee if you take this class you will abhor the teachers and coming to it everyday to encounter their evil attitudes, harsh as can be grading, and thousands of quizzes, tests, and homework assignments. And to clarify what I mean by the workload: example: Monday: Quiz + 4hours of homework + speaking recording + in class memorization. Tuesday: Group Skit + 4 hours of homework + in class memorization + Writing Test. Wednesday: Lesson Test + Final Skit Submission Due ....and the terrible experience only continues. The overall level of professionalism and lack of teaching ability by the Japanese instructors is appalling especially at a place like Yale. Again, DO NOT TAKE. You will regret everyday; I promise.",
    "Best language course ever. Plenty of work but not as hard as people make it out to be - although things get much faster at the end of the semester so watch out there. Just put in consistent work and you'll do fine. Teachers are all awesome (although Saito-sensei is pretty intense while Murata and Stever-senseis are very chill so it can be pretty variable from week to week) and the materials and lessons are very well planned out. But you still have to put in work outside of class so be prepared. Bottom line - take this class! And do your work regularly and DO NOT FALL BEHIND.",
    "It was hard and next semester will probably be harder, but I took it because I wanted a neat skill and I am really happy I went through with it! I with I had started the class sooner so that I could get to higher levels so if you're a freshman, don't hesitate to take it. Also the teachers are amazing. They grade stuff faster than I can believe, and show up with so much enthusiasm every day, the best thing ever was when Nishimura sensee told us a short story (in Japanese) about her college roommate and we all understood it and that felt so good! Last thing, talk to the teachers outside of class- I didn't do this until I bombed a test and needed help figuring out what I didn't know, but it's probably a good idea to check in with them and get personal help because you'll never get a better chance to clear up your problems, and it's important to fix your mistakes early before they compound.",
    "Fantastic course that has awesome instructors and a heavy workload. Definitely would recommend.",
    "It was a difficult course with a lot of work, but it was also very rewarding. Definitely would recommend.",
    "So hard, but so worth it.",
    "It's a fun class but VERY INTENSE. Take it if you really care about learning it otherwise you will be miserable! Hard to keep up if you don't pay attention to the homeworks.",
    "Japanese 110 is a very good introductory course to the Japanese language. It covers hiragana and katakana in the opening weeks of the course and the rest of the course ensures that you know those character systems really well. The course covers basic conversational skills and Japanese mannerisms.",
    "L1 languages are a lot of work, but it's worth it in the end. Definitely do well on the tests, as they determine your grade. Also, spend the time throughout the semester learning the CCs, because trying to cram all of that in before the test does not work. Make study guides for the grammar points!",
    "For anyone interested in learning Japanese, this is the best course I could ever think of. I learned Japanese on and off for two years before coming to Yale, and the two-year learning was not as effective as the three month here at Yale.",
    "This has been my absolute favorite class at Yale. You'll learn so much of the language so quickly that you can hardly believe it. The instructors are all so amazing and so dedicated to your Japanese education. I would recommend that anyone take this class. Definitely one of the best-taught courses at Yale and probably beyond. Truly amazing.",
    "If you want to learn Japanese, go for it. Be prepared for an avalanche of work. Two hours a night is a light estimate; expect three to four. The instructors are wonderful and want to help; let them."
