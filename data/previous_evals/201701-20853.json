   "comments": [
    "I learned about 3-D calculus, mathematical reasoning, and more.",
    "This topic was completely new to me since I've only ever done single variable calculus. I learned a great deal about how to visualize calculus in 3D and how to make more complex integrations.",
    "You'll learn line and surface integrals primarily, and 3D mathematics as well.",
    "A lot of maths skills for sure; course provided thorough knowledge about multivariable calculus, towards the end of the course I had developed not only a deep understanding of multi variable calc but also improved problem solving skills and analysis skills.",
    "Learned a lot about multivariable calculus",
    "Improved problem solving skills - much of the class focused on multiple ways to approach a problem, and emphasized analyzing the different ways and choosing the most efficient",
    "Learned basics of Multivariable calculus including: double and triple integrals, line integrals, surface integrals, stoke's and green's theorem, parametrizing lines and surfaces",
    "Multivariable calculus",
    "In this course, I got a solid overview of multivariable calculus. We began with familiarizing ourselves with basic concepts in three dimensions, extending knowledge about vector calculus and functions to three variables. This included understanding how to calculate the length of vectors, the tangent plane to a curve, the directional derivative, etc. Then, we learned how to calculate line and surface integrals and how to apply a variety of theorems (i.e. the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, Green's Theorem, Stokes' Theorem, Divergence Theorem, etc).",
    "I learned about linear, 2-D, and 3-D analysis of funcfiona and their associated graphs, as well as theorems to evaluate line integrals, surface integrals, and triple integrals.",
    "This course gave a good foundation in multivariable calculus. Besides the general concepts and theorems, I learned to be better problem solver and to pull from a variety of techniques to tackle whatever was thrown at me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "My experience with the course was very positive. Professor Havlickova is a wonderful teacher who explains concepts very clearly, making it easy to learn. She does lots of examples and is always stopping to see if we have questions.",
    "Strong textbook and teaching staff. However it rewards those who have taken multi-variable calculus a bit too much and the 115 entrants are left a bit in the dust. But nothing some diligence and office hours cannot make up for.",
    "Course was as expected, lots of places to seek support, content was well-explained",
    "Strengths: very interesting material, very engaging, very lucky to have Miki as my professor Weaknesses: grade distribution is very tough (pretty much no curve)",
    "The strengths of the course are the material covered and the way in which it provides students greater depth about where a theorem comes from. The main weakness is how heavily the course weighs the exams.",
    "Miki is the greatest strength",
    "Strength: It's math Weakness: a lot of people who have already taken multivariable take this class and it is hard to tell whether you really are learning the material or not by looking at your grade. the p sets don't really reflect the exam level questions until the very end of the year with the problems that Miki makes a part of the homework that aren't a part of the book. and the textbook is awful in every shape, manner, and form",
    "I think one of the biggest strengths of the class was its relatively small size. I felt that the class size was perfect for being able to just sit and absorb the math and also to ask questions when needed. I also thought that it was well organized, in that each concept built upon preceding concepts--which is so important in math! There was also definitely a lot of help given out during this course, from office hours, to peer tutor hours, to review sessions. I suppose one weakness would be that I wish there was more collaboration and discussion between sections.",
    "Two strengths of the course include its introduction of difficult concepts and themes in multi-variable calculus as well as its enforcement of rigorous practice through weekly problem sets. One weakness of the course is that some of the TAs who teach math 120 sections seem inadequately prepared to teach.",
    "The course does a good job of providing a ton of resources for students to do well, which is especially helpful because it compensates for the course's incredibly fast pace. Between the weekly problem sets and jam-packed lectures, I was mostly forced to stay engaged with the course, but if I didn't internalize a concept the first time around, it was somewhat difficult to play catch up."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If the student needs the course for his or her degree, I would recommend it. The material is interesting but difficult.",
    "If you have to take the course for a major, definitely take it. It is rather difficult and moves at a quick pace with not exactly the most fascinating material, however, so definitely only take it if you have to. Grading is fair but rather unforgiving.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who truly wants to learn the material. You definitely have to be willing to put in an effort to follow at a good pace and get help when necessary.",
    "It'll take some work, but if you're interested in the material and willing, you'll do fine. Start it C\/D\/Fail if you're worried.",
    "not an easy\/ fun class, what you'd expect of a calculus course, course has a bad reputation for being too hard but if you put in the work it is not that bad, a lot of places to get support, maths 120 also places you in good standing for a large variety of majors if you're undecided, if you enjoyed maths in high school, placed into maths 120 and want to take a maths course, then definitely take maths 120. taking it with MIKI makes all the difference, try and get into her section",
    "Yes if necessary for major\/premed\/other requirements. No if you don't need to take this course.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you enjoy math this will be a fun and challenging class. If you do not like math this class will be extremely hard for you.",
    "Nope. Multi was terrible. Miki however is a wonderful professor and she is amazing at explaining things. Take the course if you need it, but not for fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any other student that wishes to get a solid foundation in multivariable calculus. It was a fast-paced class, but there was always plenty of resources to reach out to if you felt yourself getting lost. I came out of the course able to understand concepts that seemed completely foreign to me before and an understanding of basic multivariable calculus has helped me understand subjects in other courses as well. This is a great intro mathematics course and really pushed me to learn and stretch my mind to tackle new problems.",
    "I do not recommend this course to anyone who does not require it for a major or pre-med requirement. The class feels tedious most of the time and is overall not well-taught (with the exception of Miki).",
    "Go into this course an open mind and try to put something into it. If you don't give any effort, it'll steamroll you. You're going to have to work hard no matter what, so definitely engage with the concepts early. The tests are hard but fair, and the problem sets are doable. Also, make use of all your resources--all the 120 professors do an amazing job of organizing review sessions and have generous office hours. Overall, a very difficult course but a manageable one if you put the time in."
