   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a survey of canonical English poets from about the mid-17th century to the present day. I would recommend it to another student as long as you're ready to do plenty of writing.",
    "Only take this class if you're an English major. If you're just looking for a writing credit or a poetry class, there are better options that aren't so exhausting. Five papers and a final is exhausting, especially when taken with other English classes. Kramnick is an awesome, pretty chill professor but the class structure is intense at best and exhausting at worst. You'll read ALL of Paradise Lost, a lot of Pope, a lot of Wordsworth, and not enough Eliot or a modern poet (we read Gluck). Like 125, 126 focuses on these \"famous\" longer works that could probably be understood and appreciated if you just read a small segment of them. Overall, it's a requirement for the major, so English kids don't have much of a choice. You leave the class feeling really accomplished though.",
    "Only take it if you need it to be an English major- it is not a good survey and almost any other English class will be more interesting.",
    "I think it's a goo dclass to take, even if you aren't sure you want to be an English major. You'll read some classic poetry and get a good foundation for whatever else you might want to read, whether it's modern-day, or Milton era.",
    "I would recommend this course to an English major because I do see value in learning this type of material. However, I would not take this if you are not an English major because the coursework is difficult.",
    "I took ENGL 126 without taking 125, and this wasn't a problem. The selection of poets is a good one (though I think we all wish there were more non-white male writers in it). The reading amount varies a fair amount: Milton is A LOT (for some silly reason they decide we have to read the whole thing), Pope isn't too bad, Wordsworth's Prelude is long, Eliot is relatively short. I wish they abridged certain parts of the reading but generally enjoyed the course. The number of papers is not overwhelming (three of five pages and two of three pages) and the final exam is pretty tame. I'm not going to be an English major but I still had a lot of fun, so if the list of poets interests you, definitely jump in.",
    "This class basically allows students to delve into a few very influential and amazing poets' work. Of course, don't buy the idea that this is the ultimate guide through literary history... Just try to enjoy the authors who made it onto this syllabus."
