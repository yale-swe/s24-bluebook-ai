    "I would recommend the course to another student. The material is interesting and it challenges you to think about real problems. The readings were sometimes dry, but the work load was totally manageable.",
    "Race and Class in Brazil and South Africa is pretty much what the title states- a discussion of race and class within these two very racially-different societies. If you are not interested in either country and just want to learn more about the importance of race and class in public policy, I would double-think it, just because after a while you might get annoyed. My only complaint with this class is the way grades are assessed. Basically, there are two papers-midterm and final- with the former being worth 40% and the other 60% of your grade. Seekings isn't too harsh of a grader, but the paper topics are so broad that it really takes so discipline to just sit down and begin thinking about it.",
    "Good course if you are interested in how race works in other countries and understanding how history frames current structures of inequality. This course is also helpful for gaining a better understanding of the American \"race dilemma\" although the emphasis is on Brazil and South Africa.",
    "Weber vs. Marx. 2 (40% and 60%) papers and you lead a discussion. Not too bad.",
    "The class did what the description said it would. It was a good opportunity to learn about Brazil, South Africa, and even the US in a new way. By examining the myth of racial democracy in Brazil and the effects of apartheid, you come away with a new perspective on the two countries.I'd also say that by examining Brazil and South Africa, one comes away with a better understanding of the theories which underpin racism and class hierarchies (such as those of Marx and Weber)I'd definitely recommend the class!"
