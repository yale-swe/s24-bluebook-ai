    "I'd definitely recommend this class. It ended up being a majority of undergrads, with a few PhD students, so the level of discussion was perfect for me (junior undergrad). If you are interested in taking a deep dive into behavioral psychology, there is no better course.",
    "I would definitely recommend MGMT 753 to students interested in decision-making or choice architecture. Class every week consists of in-depth discussion of 3-4 articles, with discussions being led by students. The workload is very fair but students should get started on the final research proposal early. Ravi and Nathan do a great job moderating class discussions, and I learned a lot from classmates' questions and research ideas.",
    "This class sounds cool BUT precaution, it is a heavily research based class. You won't be able to talk about topics because they sound cool, your contributions to discussion must be ground in some kind of intuition of scientific reasoning. Otherwise the professors make you look stupid and then they feel bad and then you feel bad. And honestly, half of the undergraduate participation in this course consisted of asking the professors \"Has [so and so study] been done before?\"One of the undergraduates who participated the most in the course didn't contribute much to the discussion of the papers, but he sounded smart every time he talked. If you can do that, then this is totally your class.",
    "Read and comment on three papers per week, which are then discussed in depth during class time. The focus is really on critiquing the research and exploring future directions. Highly recommended for anybody interested in doing decision making research.",
    "I think this was my favorite class this semester. What was cool about Behavioral Decision Making is that it brought me so close to the cutting edge of a field. I feel like I've gained not only a greater understanding of how people make choices, but also a greater understanding of how people design research experiments and what makes a good research design. I've also gained a greater skepticism for the way that science is reported in the popular press. And I've gained a greater appreciation for the fact that I can go online and look up primary research for myself. This class wasn't about reading papers and accepting them as fact. It was about critiquing them. Examining them rigorously. Teasing out all their assumptions and fallacies. It was cool to read papers that were, for the most part, published within the last decade. Here's what's different about the cutting edge: you spend more time talking about alternative explanations than about accepted theories. You question more often. You keep an open mind. It was also fun to watch two experts talk with one another (Nathan and Ravi). Two extremely accomplished researchers in their field were often hesitant to talk about anything that was out of their very narrow area of expertise. (E.g. Nathan, who focuses on loss aversion, didn't want to talk much about goals). I think the deeper you go in one domain, the more aware you become of how utterly little you know about the others. This is the reason why the smartest people are the ones who are most aware of their ignorance. They think to themselves: \"If it took me this much effort to learn this much about [X] topic, I must not know anything about [Y] topic, which I've spent no time studying!\" The ideas I found most interesting in the course: the power of intuition, borrowing from future goal progress, broadening the choice frame, mental accounting\/the non-fungibility of money, preference reversals in different choice contexts."

   "comments": [
    "Having little exposure to decision-making research before taking this class, MGMT 753 was fast-paced and technical some weeks, but I feel like I learned a lot very quickly. This class has definitely changed how I view choice in my everyday life, and sparked my interest in continuing research in this area.",
    "As a cognitive science major, this course provided the basis for the much-necessary practical leanings of the discipline. The course focuses on the experimental paradigm just as much as the research itself, and is an excellent springboard into an empirical senior thesis."
