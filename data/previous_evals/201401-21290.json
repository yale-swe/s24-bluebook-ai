    "it's fine, not too stressful, you can write about everything. the professor is very distracted and loses essays every assignment, but teh people drawn to it are usually pretty talented and helpful readers.",
    "The class is very openly structured with assignments and syllabus changing as the class progresses. For this reason, I would recommend taking it if you already have taken several structured classes and want to be in a more free form environment and just write and talk about modern essays with a group of other Yale writers and a great professor. There are no writing prompts which allows you to have a lot of freedom and creative leeway, but might be more difficult if you are looking for more guidance. If you take the class, take advantage of Prof Zarin's office hours; she provides time to meet with students and gives really helpful feedback."
