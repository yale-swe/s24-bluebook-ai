    "only if the student really wanted to\/enjoyed doing the readings. otherwise it wouldn't be good",
    "Yes! DS Philosophy equips you with a really solid foundation in modern philosophy and teaches you things that every student in the humanities should be familiar with. The texts are not easy to read, but at the end, you will be proud of what you've accomplished.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. SImply fantastic.",
    "Normal ds class with hard thinkers.",
    "This is a great modern philosophy class with one of the best section leaders there are. Professor Grimstad places a lot of emphasis on in-class discussion, so make sure to do as much of the readings as possible to get the most out of it.",
    "It's a brief overview of some very big, complicated ideas. With some units, you'll feel satisfied with the grasp you have on things; with others, you'll be moving on almost immediately after grasping the core concepts. But it provides a valuable basic familiarity with some important thinkers, and it serves its purpose in providing both an introduction to the study of philosophy and valuable intellectual context for other disciplines. Professor Grimstad is very kind, dynamic, and engaging. However, he often gets off track, and you won't necessarily engage specifically enough with arguments and objections to feel like you have a firm grasp on what's going on."
