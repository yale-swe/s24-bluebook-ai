    "No I won't. But it doesn't matter, since everyone is required to take it.",
    "I'm not sure that I'd be quick to recommend it, but it's required for our track anyway. The concept of the class is appreciated - in exposing first year graduate students to a wide variety of methods&techniques - but its execution was not ideal. More organization and coordination between lecturers is needed.",
    "It is a requirement. However, most of the class pertained to material I will never use in my research. Thus, I suppose it depends on whether you're more interested in biochemistry or in other areas of research. Admittedly, some of the class was applicable to my research, so it is likely that most students would gain at least something from the course.",
    "I may not recommend the course. Again, it was difficult to really learn the material since none of it was taught in great detail.",
    "A survey course for biophysical methods. Is a good course for non-biochemists who are interested in knowing the type of data that they can get out of these types of experiments.",
    "No I would not recommend the class to a fellow student. For someone with a background in biophysics, the class was not taught at an advanced enough level and for someone with no background it biophysics it was not taught at a simple enough level to actually take away any practical information."

   "comments": [
    "It did not. I did not learn anything useful at all.",
    "The course exposed me to a number of techniques, but I still don't feel comfortable enough with the fundamentals of many of the techniques to be able to propose to incorporate them into my own research.",
    "It allowed me to realize some different potential approaches testing hypotheses, which is helpful. However, most of the course did not apply to my field.",
    "Again, I feel that I did not learn very much from this course. However, I feel as though this could be easily improved in future years, if the methods are presented and taught in greater detail.",
    "I may apply mathematical modeling to my research."
