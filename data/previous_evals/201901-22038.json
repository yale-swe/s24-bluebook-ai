    "Multivariable Calc",
    "This course has taught me a lot about multivariable calculus. Not only that, but it taught me how to adapt to having to learn and know a lot of different but related subjects.",
    "I learned the rudiments of Multivariable Calculus, ranging from vectors to triple integrals and flux theorems. I also learned how to apply these theorems in various circumstances that required creativity.",
    "I learned how to do derivative and integral calculus of multiple variables, as well as vector calculus.",
    "Multivariable calculus in a lot of detail. Related skills. How to solve challenging problems and synthesize a large amount of material.",
    "Multivariable calculus and some relevant forays into linear algebra (if I am not mistaken).",
    "I learned how to find many different types of integrals, including surface, flux, and line integrals. I also learned how to visualize 3D shapes and equations better.",
    "Multivariable Calculus (3D geometry, vector fields, double\/triple integrals, line integrals, surface integrals, volume\/flux\/curl\/divergence etc.)",
    "In addition to learning the content of the course, I was able to further develop my problem solving and analytical thinking skills. I improved my abilities to identify types of problems and integrate. I also learned that various topics that we learned in 120 are used in various different fields, such as contour maps to indicate changes in elevation or vector fields to indicate wind patters.",
    "I learned a lot about multivariable calculus, and its uses. Much of the course content involved generalizations of 2D ideas into 3D and higher space. I also learned the origins of many strange formulas that I had learned previously in AP Physics C. Overall, this class taught me a lot about how to generalize the stuff from Physics C to apply them in other situations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Ximera was a good tool",
    "I think this course does mostly well in teaching the material. It provided numerous resources besides our section professor on its course website and even on a secondary site online that enabled us to get a lot more practice with the course material.",
    "I had a great professor who was very open to helping students outside of class, which was nice in case one missed a session since it is such a fast-moving curriculum and thus it is easy to get left behind.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting content overall which builds on itself over the term Weaknesses: Can get a little repetitive at the end",
    "Strength: manageable workload on a weekly basis (one straightforward pset a week) Weakness: exam difficulty, amount of material",
    "The course delivers what it wants you to understand: multivariable calculus. A lot of additional help was put in place to ensure students understand the concepts and practice. On the other hand, the class can move very fast and require you to be in tempo with it every week. As much as help was available, it can benefit from just having a slower pace.",
    "I liked how the course was very organized and all the homework taught us what we needed to know. However, I think the course could benefit from including some real-life applications, because I don't see why we would use this kind of math anywhere (except for physics).",
    "I have taken this course twice here at Yale, and I have to say I've definitely noticed the clear effort to provide more practice\/support to students in the form of the booklets and such. Ximera is one of the best inventions ever, it has saved my life many times over. I think the course was structured remarkably well to teach such a dense amount of material in such a short amount of time without overloading the students in terms of workload or information. The only thing I can point out for improvement is a logistical one; due to the organization of materials on Canvas it's still a bit hard to find things like office hours and exam information.",
    "I think a major strength of this course was the Ximera modules, which were a series of videos that helped explain concepts and had practice problems for each chapter section. These videos and practice problems greatly helped me perform well in the course. Another strength was the number of practice problems available for students. My professor gave us various worksheets and packets that contained helpful practice problems.",
    "This course covers a wide range (read: A HUGE AMOUNT) of material which needs to be covered in a very short time. This is fine if you have the right instructor. I was fortunate to have ended up in a section with an excellent instructor who was engaging and work extremely hard to ensure that all students understood the extremely difficult topics - even with this, I needed to put in a very large amount of extra effort and heavily take advantage of extra help to do well. However, I was initially in a different section with a different instructor who was not nearly as patient and engaged with students very poorly. The inconsistency in the quality of teaching across the different sections of this class is very apparent and incredibly unfair to students who do not get placed into the few sections with great instructors."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Only if you really need to for a pre req.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in higher level math, or calculus specifically. You learn a lot of skills (ie. learning various types of integrals, vectors, optimization, etc.) that you can use and apply to other subjects, like applied math and physics.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in math or another quantitative course that requires strong critical thinking abilities.",
    "If you like math, absolutely. The content is really interesting and you learn a lot of new things that may be applicable in other STEM fields.",
    "If you have to take it, the instructor really comes to matter. I was lucky to have a great prof, but the class was still difficult. The weekly work is not a lot (psets are pretty straightforward), but the exams are hard, and you really have to know the material in order to do well. That being said, if you put in enough work into it, the class is doable. But definitely would not take it for fun or if you do not have to.",
    "Yes. If you are taking the course, it is probably because you have topicking the right instructors is key to enjoying the class. The Spring semester seems to be more tolerable too.a",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I tried taking this course in high school and it was not taught as well as the course here. I learned a lot more this year, everything made sense, and there was just the right amount of content.",
    "I've heard it really depends on who your professor is, but I've had fabulous experiences with my professors, and while the workload isn't what you would call light it's definitely very manageable. If you want\/need to learn multivariable calculus this is your only choice anyways, but I think it is taught well from my experiences. I used to hate math, but I don't anymore, so that tells you how much of a difference the right class and right professor can make.",
    "If a student is interested in learning math, then I would highly recommend this course. It teaches you how to think analytically and identify problems. There is a lot of content, so I can understand why those not interested in math would not enjoy the course. However, I thought the workload was fair and all of the professors worked hard to provide practice problems and review videos to help students understand the content. The amount of support from the professors definitely made the course less daunting.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who are genuinely interested in math and who are willing to devote the effort it takes to do well. Also, this class would probably be a lot more difficult for anyone with less than stellar spatial reasoning skills. IF you placed into this class and are merely looking for a math class to fulfill your requirement, do not take this class!! Take an easier one. But if you're genuinely interested in math, I would recommend this one."
