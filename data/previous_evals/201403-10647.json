   "comments": [
    "It's very helpful course if you want to learn light-matter interaction.",
    "APHY 676 develops a framework to treat the dynamics of a wide variety of physical phenomena, particularly for interacting modes. There's a lot of classical mechanics, though probably not in a form you've seen too much before. I'd definitely recommend this course--it saved me a lot of time having to slog through textbooks and papers trying to learn this stuff on my own and helped me to understand nonlinear phenomena in a new light.",
    "This is a fairly advanced course, which definitely requires a basic knowledge of optics, lagrangian mechanics and quantum mechanics. It is a great introduction to non-linear optics and quantum optics if these are the areas one wishes to pursue research in. If you are interested in seeing the transition between a purely classical approach, to a semiclassical approach, to a full quantum approach, and how close related they actually are, this is the course for you.",
    "Yes, it is important to understand basic phenomenon of light-matter interaction. I would surely recommend it.",
    "A great course for graduate student interested not only in learning about light matter interaction but also connections between classical and quantum mechanics.Also, doing the final project you can learn a lot.",
    "I think it's a great course for optics\/mesoscopic physics people. I would definitely recommend."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me the tools to understand the physics of nonlinear optical processes and mathematically treat coupled-mode problems...the material covered will definitely prove useful in my research.",
    "This opened up the way for me to start understanding non-linear phenomena and quantum optics, which is great for me, since that is exactly the fields I wish to do research in.",
    "Very much",
    "the course material is very good and it was nice to learn some of these things that are currently only explained in research papers. I didnt answer question 4b. My answer is the following: some classical physics topics were too slow and some mode dynamics and quantum things were too fast."
