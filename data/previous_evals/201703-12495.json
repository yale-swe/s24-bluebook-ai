    "I thought the tenor of the workshop was really great. Other workshops I attended were often combative and some of the participants were downright disrespectful. I was impressed that that was not at all the case in the IR workshop. The participants consistently offered thoughtful critiques without being rude. A weakness, though, was some of the subject matter of the workshop. It was very focused on political economy, which makes sense now but which I did not anticipate when I signed up for the workshop. Some of the work was so niche that I had a hard time understanding how it fit into broader IR research (the paper on medieval Florentine monetary policy stands out in this regard)."

    "Given my interests, I think I will probably sign up for the ISS workshop as my primary workshop next semester. However, I would definitely recommend the workshop to students interested in political economy and I plan to keep an eye on the upcoming presentations to keep attending on occasion."
