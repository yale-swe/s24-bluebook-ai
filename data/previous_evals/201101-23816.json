    "I would definitely recommend the course to other literature students regardless of their specialties. The texts, approach, discussion, assignments were all interesting.",

    "The \"quarrels\" approach of the class contributed a great deal to myresearch interests.",
    "As expected, the course did not contribute to my personal research, but it certainly deepened my knowledge of my discipline by allowing me to read canonical authors and understand the context that they were writing in.",
    "First time in the 17th century, so this was very helpful.",
    "This course helped me learn more about a chapter of french literary history that I didn't previously know very much about. I now feel more confident in my global understanding of French literary history."
