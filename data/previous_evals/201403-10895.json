    "This is a requirement for the program so its hard to say I recommend it. The course was somewhat disorganized in terms of the guest speakers. I feel like they were never what we expected them to be. I really enjoyed the Sarah Brinegar Lecture, and the man from Yale University Press, however, the two other speakers were not as great. I found myself wishing professor Gordon would just lead those seminars instead. I feel like he is more knowledgeable and would have provided more interesting topics for discussion."

    "I feel like the final paper was a good idea for this course. I loved hearing the ideas and topics that other people were writing about in our final meeting. Such discussions may help me in deciding on a paper topic for next year. I also liked the History lectures we had to go to on Wednesday nights. Most of them were really interesting, and the dinner was good too."
