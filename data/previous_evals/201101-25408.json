    "Yes. Take this class.",

    "Art 120 is an introductory class that requires no background in sculpture but offers students quite a lot to glean: technical skills, a new perspective on space, and exposure to a wholly different kind of art from what most of us had experienced before. Brent is a wonderful teacher who knows when to be present in your learning process and when to be on the periphery as you do your thing. take it!",
    "The course is an intro to metal sculpture. If you're thinking about taking it, take it, and make sure it's with Brent. Dude knows his craft, is a lot of fun, and will help at every step of the way. The projects are a lot of fun and allow for a ton of flexibility (no jig-related pun intended). And people love it when you tell them you know how to weld.",
    "This class was an exciting adventure.",
    "An excellent course! A therapeutic break from academics, but still challenging."
