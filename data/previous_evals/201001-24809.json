    "Yes, you should definitely take it, although Leuprecht is a visiting prof so I don't know if it will be offered again, and if it is, it'll be different from when he taught. But the subject is SO interesting.",
    "Great course. Covers ethnic conflict and governance in a fresh, new way. Having the ability to be part of a case study simulation on Nepal really allowed us to feel what conducting negotiations is like - the challenges and difficulties and how to resolve them. The material covered was extremely interesting and useful. Due to this course I plan to continue focusing on this subject in future studies at Yale. Professor Leuprecht is awesome. He encourages students' learning and interaction in class. He is great to talk to and very helpful in the development of our thoughts and future plans. He really does all he can to encourage our learning in interactive ways, through a class simulation and trip to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York.",
    "This is one of the few classes I have taken at Yale in the Poli Sci department that has a truly international focus. Professor Leuprecht is very knowledgeable about a number of countries and their current affairs, which was refreshing, since I felt that many classes had either a regional or American focus. Students had many opportunities to explore areas that they were interested in, and to focus on one country in particular as a case study. I especially enjoyed the simulation, in which we devised a way in which the constitution of Nepal should be drawn up to appease as many stakeholders as possible. Not only was it relevant since Nepalese leaders were doing the same thing in May 2010, but it was also a great way to experience conflict resolution firsthand.",
    "Amazing class, absolutely take it if you're interested in ethnic conflict and why we just cannot get along as human beings. Readings are very interesting and the things you have to do are not the usual paper writing but involves keeping a blog, responding to other students. The class has a lot of unusual components which make it even more interesting like a field trip, many guest lectures, an evaluation of other students, crisis simulation at the proffs home etc. Also you have a lot of imput and freedom in the class to really shape it the way you are the class as a collective want. TAKE it. Expect to do some work for it though."
