   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about being able to teach myself the material, since a lot of it was not taught in class.",
    "You gain a general sense of what chemical engineering is all about and how to solve general mass\/energy balance problems along with other tidbits that you'll relearn in Physical Chemistry. Honestly, this course is really dry and you probably won't use much math other than algebra, but I would argue it's necessary.",
    "I learned crucial skills useful for my career as a chemical engineer.",
    "Nothing in this course is new, you just apply a bunch of general science knowledge and algebra to material and energy balances.",
    "I learned the basics of material and energy balances. I also learned about various ways to approximate the properties of systems of chemical species.",
    "Material and energy balances. Recycling is useful because it allows you to increase your ouput.What chemical engineering is about. I had never taken any CHEM E class, and this class helped get an overview of what the profession is about. I learned to learn material by myself, and to prioritize doing more exercises because it is tricky to do material balances in exams if you don't practice enough by yourself.",
    "I learned how to do energy and material balances and about the many fields chemical engineering majors can contribute to.",
    "As I already had familiarity with material balances from my environmental engineering class last semester, I took away only a few cursory ideas relating to chemical engineering processes.",
    "mass balances, reactor and process functions, unit conversions, heat transfers",
    "This course introduced me to the basic principles of chemical engineering.",
    "How to do algebra a little better than before",
    "I learned how to perform mass and energy balances, and how to do calculations involving reactor systems, solutions, and mixtures of gases and liquids. I learned how to read and analyze a bunch of different tables. And I learned how to learn on my own, which turned out to be really necessary in this class: due to the relatively poor teaching style, there is a good chance you will have to learn a lot of the material on your own."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is a flipped classroom, and so basically none of the relevant material is covered in class - instead we have to teach ourselves the material and take very difficult and often wrongly written pre-class quizzes. The professor really could have improved several aspects of the class.",
    "Including more interesting applications of chemical engineering and investigating those could be more interesting.",
    "The pre class quizzes had two tries but you averaged the two and sometimes the questions were so badly worded that you knew it was either one of two answers but you couldn't tell which. Also there were in class clicker questions and if you did't use the app sometimes you didn't get the points.",
    "I was not a fan of the flipped classroom style, and I felt that class time could have been used more efficiently. Much of the class was just spent waiting in silence while everyone worked on the in-class problems. While it makes sense that some of the class time should be dedicated towards doing problems (as it was a very problem-oriented class), I would have preferred some lecturing for the more confusing material. Many of the questions on the assessments (mainly the pre-class quizzes) were confusing or poorly worded as well.",
    "The strucutre of the class overall was very poor. The grading was unfair. The clicker questions for instance were graded from a false or right basis. Also, the homework had a 10 % penalty for missing a question one time, and the pre-reading quizzes were also marked out of many points. I did not like the fact that we had slides that were very lengthy and sometimes not relevant to the material learned. I liked the fact that we discussed what chemical engineering is and its applications. The class organization not great especially regarding exam scheduling.",
    "The reverse classroom structure is completely ineffective and in our experience led to less engagement with the material and course than would have a standard lecture. Additionally, the course is very poorly organized with a lot of lecture time being wasted on irrelevant personal tangents from the professor or in attempting to make connections between chemical engineering and real life applications. A lot of class time is also wasted between students debating about correct answers to in class questions, and the professor often does not provide clear, accurate clarifications. Finally, solutions to practice problems, tests and recitations are often not posted, making it hard revisit material and impossible if you have to miss class.",
    "Dont make it a flipped classroom",
    "This class is dynamic and often interesting. I would recommend that more time was spent in lecture going over central themes and key concepts. I often felt confused about certain ideas and wouldn't know if they were important or not.",
    "I like the idea of an interactive classroom but the execution could've been improved. Overall, the class could've been more organized.",
    "This is hands down the worst course I have ever taken at Yale and I am actually slightly reconsidering my major as a result. Completely restructure the way this course is being taught. The reverse classroom applied in this context is completely flawed as the lecture failed to reinforce anything we attempted to glean from the textbook yet on exams we were responsible for complex problems. The grading of exams and types of problems posed were also insanely unfair. Never have I seen a harsher opposition to reasonable partial credit awarding for processes on problems. Everything about this class was unfair and poorly conducted.",
    "The lecture slides and lectures were often too cluttered and filled with unnecessary \"fun\" information that could have been omitted and replaced with the actual chemical engineering teaching and clear information about exam material that was always lacking.",
    "The course material was interesting, but the professor made the course almost unbearable.",
    "The course really doesn't need to exist - everything that's taught is either intuitive or taught in pchem",
    "This class closely followed the textbook, which made it easy for me to follow along. And there were helpful resources for understanding, such as the homework (Sapling) problem sets. But I hated the \"flipped classroom\" method because I don't think it worked. We didn't exactly learn outside of the classroom, and we certainly didn't learn much inside of it. The clicker questions, which were intended to help us follow along with the lecture, felt very punitive and unfair. We also spent a lot of time on irrelevant material that did not help on exams. Exams were too long to be completed within the time given, and grading did not accurately reflect how much of the material we understood."

   "comments": [
    "Only if you're truly thinking about being a chemical engineering major.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "If you're reading this course evaluation I'm sure you don't have choice about whether or not you take this class. Good luck and be glad Professor Taylor isn't teaching it anymore.",
    "If this class is not required for your major, there are probably better science classes you could take. The flipped classroom format is frustrating at times, but the class is very manageable (not a lot of homework) and if you keep up with the readings in the textbook you will do fine.",
    "Yes, if you would like to learn what chemical engineering is and if you want to decide whether chemical engineering should be your major.",
    "Unfortunately, this class is required by the chemical engineering major. On the bright side, the course will be taught by different faculty in the years to come. The course has the potential to be pretty engaging and interesting, so hopefully it will be when taught by a different professor.",
    "Only if it is required for your major.",
    "The course will be taught by a different instructor next year, so a specific evaluation will not be terribly useful for other students. As more general feedback, I think it is difficult to have a course that introduces students to all (rather, as many as possible) chemical engineering concepts, while not feeling too rushed, confusing, or forced. So, I would not recommend this class unless you have to take it, in which case do not let it influence your decision to continue on with the major. Advanced classes in the major are more focused, engaging, and rewarding, just by the nature of the type of material that needs to be covered (probably true for advanced classes of any major). So, if you need to take this class, I recommend taking it while taking at least one other chemical engineering class at the same time (there will be material overlap, don't worry!).",
    "It is required for Chem E majors so I would just wish them luck and give them a fair warning of what they were facing.",
    "No, if you don't have to take this course, it may be better to stay away. The experience with mass balances and the later material in the course is critical and required for chemical engineering, but the course itself tries to make challenging material seem more intimidating by harshly penalizing wrong answers even on assignments not yet covered in class.",
    "I would recommend that no other student takes this course with Dr. Taylor if possible.",
    "I enjoyed the course. Pretty interesting.",
    "Professor Taylor is TERRIBLE. He barely knows chemistry - he consistently mispronounced simple words like \"methane\" and \"solute,\" didn't know the difference between rates and rate constants, and couldn't explain basic solubility properties. We had to self-teach all the material by reading the textbook (which is pretty bad) because it's a \"flipped classroom,\" except it isn't because we still had to do problem sets and pre-reading quizzes. He took off 10 points on an exam problem I got *right* because I did it an easier way than he had taught us; he doesn't seem to understand that \"partial credit\" is usually only used when students get problems *wrong*. He didn't show up for class the day before a midterm and refused to post practice exam answers on Canvas. He couldn't answer a very simple chemical engineering question and instead rambled for 10 minutes about different reactor types (read: not in this class' curriculum). He put out a mid-semester anonymous review and then went over the results in class, and where people said they felt lectures were generally unclear he spent 5 minutes explaining why we were wrong and the class was in fact organized (it wasn't). He responded to my comment that the flipped classroom just gave us more work than we needed by saying that \"engineering is hard and not for everyone.\" That's right, he took time over Thanksgiving break to respond to each and every one of our comments on the mid-semester review. Oh, but he didn't have time to grade our exams.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student if they can help it. If you are interested in chemistry, you would do better to take a chemistry class; if you are interested in physics or math, you would do better to take a class in each of those respective subjects. Chemical engineering is interesting if you are interested in the subject. But it is rather poorly taught, and it will take a lot of mental effort to counteract the confusion and punitive grading of the class, so that you can cut through to the beauty of the material. You will end up with a level of frustration disproportionate to how hard the class had to be."
