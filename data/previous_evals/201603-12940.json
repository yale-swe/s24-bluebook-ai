    "This course gave me an overview of a set of methods in social science research.",
    "Exposure to a lot of things.",
    "Advanced methods.",
    "Substantively: basic approaches to causal inference and modelling, non-parametric techniques, the use of causal graphs to understand mechanisms and mediation, placebo tests, maximum likelihood estimation and a brief (but very informative) introduction to machine learning. Programming: LATEX, R, ggplot",
    "I have a better understanding of why certain methods are used, as opposed to just learning how they are done. In addition, I became more aware of what the assumptions behind classical statistical models mean. For example, I learned that there is more assumptions to using an instrumental variable than just the exclusion restriction. I also learned that due to the messiness of causal relations in the real world, it is difficult to get consistent OLS estimates from observational data (though not impossible). Overall, this class has empowered me to ask deeper questions about methods and use them with a better conceptual understanding."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The slides and other course materials are excellently prepared and a valuable resource. Teaches vital skills *and* how to think about causal inference. Excellent marriage of tools and philosophy about how to use them. Posing tough questions and asking students to write down their thoughts before revealing the answer is a great pedagogical technique. The replication exercise is great training. Weaknesses: It was apparent that no one was doing the reading, and that doing the reading was not expected. The exhaustive syllabus is a great resource, but maybe identify a few key readings that students really should complete before class. Then test students on the reading. Let students know that the problem sets are front-loaded. After spending 15 hours each on problem sets 1 and 2, I didn't even attempt problem set 3, preferring to spend time on other classes. I would have been less frustrated in September if I knew that these were actually the most time-consuming problem sets of the entire course.",
    "Strength and weakness: Professor Dafoe gave a lot of great advice in the course, but I think time could of sometimes been allocated better as we sometimes got off track. Weakness: I wish we would have gone in more depth with certain methods and learned the mechanisms and math behind many methods. Weakness: I really don't like the 3 hour course blocks. I think the course broken into 1 hour 15 or 1 hour 30 minute intervals would be better. I know that we have a break in the middle, but I think it might help.",
    "It was good to be exposed to a lot of things, and we are at the point in our training where it is appropriate to say \"here is this cool thing, do the reading if you want to know how to do it.\" We got a lot out of that. But the course tilted too far in that direction. There should have been more focus on fewer topics. For example instead of cramming in a cursory tour through time series, we should have finished covering logistic regression and GLM. Especially at that point in the semester, it did not make sense to cover something at a cursory level, then quiz us on details only mentioned in the readings. Would have been better to cover something fully.",
    "Strength: We covered a wide variety of topics, and we were given ample resources to learn about the topics if we ever need to. The opportunity to write a replication based research paper was also valuable. Weakness: We didn't cover anything in enough depth to understand it much less implement it. Improvements: This course should probably be taught in multiple lectures per week. If it must be scheduled for weekly three hour blocks, we should use that time to learn about political methodology. If we're going to spend half the time talking about our feelings, we should not then spend the other half flipping through slides with lots of math that is never explained. We might as well just go through the slide decks on our own time. Not that I recommend eliminating lecture; I could never make sense of the (many) slides we didn't cover in detail when I tried at home. Real office hours should be held for this course. I appreciate the incorporation of previous feedback into the evaluation structure, but I think you may have over corrected. Six 30 min quizzes is the opposite extreme of the practice comp final. While requiring reading, lengthy weekly problem sets, and a \"publishable quality\" term paper, there really shouldn't be any tests. The only reason to have a test is to help with qual prep. For this purpose, the practice qual or even half practice qual is perfect. Perhaps an optional final along these lines would best serve student interests. You can incentivize it without attaching it to a grade.",
    "Strengths include the deep content of the course but the breadth is too wide.",
    "I think this course attempts to cover a lot of material which often implies surveying concepts rather than developing a deep understanding. In today's academic world, research design and methods training are key to any professional success. The department must work to improving this sequence by: 1. Offloading some material from this course and creating a fourth course. This would allow students in this course to go into more details of fewer concepts. 2. Streamlining the reading list and course material. While there are excellent readings on the list, there are way too many and students taking this course obviously lack the judgment (at this stage) to select the most necessary ones. A \"textbook\" might be a helpful start. If that is not possible, perhaps a \"key\" reading for each topic. 3. The class slides are an excellent summary of all the material but can do with an introductory slide that describes what we are learning, why and how it fits with larger discussions in the methods field. I often found too much new information in the slides (and I read for EVERY class, making extensive notes and covering most readings). It might be good to have more concise slides that focus on some themes, leaving others in a larger \"parent\" slide which motivated students can look up. 4. Section should not cover new ground - it should revise (in slow motion) the content in the class, especially when that content comes in one dose and large amount. 5. One three-hour lecture per week is not the best way to learn methods. Methodological concepts are dense and require a lot of concentration - which no reasonable person can have for a full three hours. Two shorter lectures allow us to digest the material and remain attentive for the full duration of the class. I cannot emphasize how important splitting this lecture is. 6. While each of the course requirements were really helpful in learning the material I think there is an urgent need to rationalize the amount of work expected of students doing this course. Weekly homework, three exams and a full replication paper along with extensive reading for each class is a lot of work. This is not to say the assignments are not useful but methods are best grasped when students have some time to think and revise (re-reading and replaying every proof line-by-line, word-for-word). The existing workload creates a frenzy, from which no one recovers and barely has anytime to reflect and engage with the material. In my experience, the best courses take-off slowly - giving students a lot of early weeks to grasp key concepts and then rapidly build on well understood concepts. Here, because of the amount of material we must cover, we essentially do no groundwork and plunge straight into deep methodological discussions.",
    "The replication project is excellent - much of my learning in this course came from the hands-on nature of this project. For the lecture\/problem set coursework, though, I would have found it more helpful to spend more time proving\/learning about the underlying mathematical justifications for the various methods we study, and I also would have preferred to study fewer topics in greater detail"

   "comments": [
    "One of the most important courses in the entire program. Take it to become a better political scientist, whether you like stats or not. It will expose you to the tools others are using, and even if you do not use them, how to think about causal inference.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course but you will have to do a lot of the learning on your own.",
    "Highly recommend the course. Great perspective on methods. Helped me gain a higher-level understanding of material covered earlier in the sequence. Exposed me to new things. I wish I had been exposed to causal graphs sooner.",
    "If only for the replication project and exposure to philosophy of social science, I would recommend this course to other students. I was advised to take this course as part of my preparation for the quant methods exam. After completing the course I feel wholly unprepared for the exam, so I would not advise future students to use this course as a study guide. I would not recommend other students to sign up as a TF for this course. Our TF helped write (possibly wrote most of) long weekly problem sets, answer keys, and six tests. She was regularly asked to use section to lecture on material not covered in the main lecture. When our professor was out of town, she was asked to give a guest lecture (on an advanced topic which we were then tested on) in clear violation of university teaching policy. The high workload for students is fine because we can sometimes choose not to do things. TFs are not allowed the same flexibility. She never complained, but I strongly suspect that our TF was asked to put in way more time an effort than her contract mandated. If a professor knowingly assigns far more than standard quantity of work, they should personally do more than standard quantity of work rather than passing the full burden onto a TF. Again I would like to emphasize that our TF has never expressed dissatisfaction. But it would have been very hard for her to object to anything while TFing for her primary adviser, which makes the violations to teaching policy far more troubling than they would otherwise be.",
    "Yes it is must to master methods.",
    "Yes, necessary methodological training."
