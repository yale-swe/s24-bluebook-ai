    "Physical simulation of mass-spring systems, deformable bodies, and fluids. Numerical methods for solving complicated differential equations (like Navier-Stokes).",
    "I learned many physics-based simulation methods for computer graphics.",
    "This was an incredible course! I think it's my favorite course I've taken at Yale. I've taken graphics at yale before, but this one is really different. You really learn what's used outside of school, both for research and in industry. I learned so much about physics simulations and how graphics can be used outside of school. This course has convinced me that graphics is an incredible field, and I wish we had more courses offered like this one!",
    "Computational methods for solving physics problems that have interesting applications in animation. We learned about particle simulations, deformation methods, and fluid simulations.",
    "Physical-based simulation for computer graphics",
    "I learned many of the fundamental techniques used to simulate phenomena that we see in video games, movies, etc. with emphasis on theory in lecture and connection to applications on the psets.",
    "Several topics relating to movie and game physics simulation. The course requires strong background knowledge other than computer science and coding skills. It polished my mathematics, physics and creativity.",
    "This class prepared me for research in the area of physics-based animation as well as other areas of applied math. Generally, the class introduces you to methods for solving difficult problems in mathematical physics such as the Navier-Stokes equations as well as numerical methods like iterative linear solvers. The class is specifically a tour of how these methods are used to simulate physics for animation in movies and video games. The class goes through both the history of the field as well as what is state-of-the-art."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: you get a taste of a lot of amazing things actually used in production in the movie industry. Ted is a humorous and engaging lecturer, but the material covered in lectures relates to a lot of advanced numerical analysis stuff so don't be fooled by the apparently innocuous prerequisite list in the blue book. Weaknesses: homework assignments can be quite boring; he gives you a lot of starter code which basically covers all the rendering stuff and you are supposed to fill in a few functions that implement (or should I say \"translate\") the equations taught in class with code. Ted also wasn't particularly helpful during office hours and there is only 1 hour of office hours every week which can be frustrating (but this is a graduate course so maybe the expectation is that you need to figure things out on your own). The final project is very taxing and perhaps too \"open-ended\" and takes up 50% of your total grade, which is extremely stressful.",
    "Strength: - instructor is very knowledgeable and has worked in this area several years in Pixar. Weakness: - you need to take notes by yourself. It would be better if the instructor could provide electronic notes after class.",
    "This class has so many strengths. The professor is incredible, his lectures have a ton of information but aren't overwhelming, the homework really uses material from the class so you learn it super well, and the end results of all the homework and the final project are so fun to play with even after the course is over. The only weakness I can think of is that I wish I had more time for the final project!",
    "Strengths: The material is VERY interesting! This class will absolutely get you interested in research for physics simulations. The assignments, though sometimes difficult, are very enjoyable to program. The professor is a fantastic lecturer. Weaknesses: There are no class notes or course reference materials. There are no TF's.",
    "The course has rich content that let us learn a lot about the related topics.",
    "There is a strong connection between the topics presented during the lecture. However, there lacks a gradual build-up process from the assignments to the final project. Or there should be clearer instructions on how to build a successful simulation project.",
    "Sometimes could get lost in details of implementation and lose grasp of the big picture or the reasons why a particular implementation step was being used",
    "Strengths: The class size made it very easy to get individual attention and focus on specific areas of interest. Also, the subject material of the course is difficult to find at most universities; so this course at Yale is a gem for those who are interested. It gives students the opportunity to learn something that few people are capable of teaching and the professor provides a wealth of knowledge difficult to find elsewhere. The lack of tests both makes sense and also prevents students from spending their time poorly. The final project is a great assignment. Weaknesses: The final schedule of the lectures ended up not matching what was provided by the syllabus, so I think there is some work to be done with the scope\/depth of the content. The PSETs could be unnecessarily challenging at times. I think there is a good way to restructure the homework assignments. Maybe divide them up into two piecies where the first is focused on the analytical math and derivations and is due before the second piece is due. Then the second piece is focues on implmentation\/coding. The first piece of the assignment would also asks students to numerically verify their work. I also think that the course should maybe require some prerequisite graphics knowledge. Students can certainly get away without it, but it seriously helps to have it - especially for the final project."

    "If you are just looking for an easy CS elective, then avoid this class. This is NOT an easy class, and it's not in the same sense of difficult compared to other hardcore CS classes like 323 or OS. You don't need to write a lot of code for this class or spend countless hours debugging, but the trouble is that this is a 600-level course and it seems that the professor expects you to figure everything out on your own (yes, the level of support is much lower compared to other CS courses at Yale). This is hard especially if you don't have a lot of background in vector calculus and numerical analysis (mind you, Ted doesn't warn you about this since he doesn't mention it in the prereq of the course description). But having said that, if you love graphics and are into animation and feel prepared to put in a lot of time to read the primary literature and self-teach numerical analysis and spend your life on your final project, then go for it--what you get out of it depends on what you put in.",
    "Yes. This is absolutely a fantasic introduction to physics-based simulation.",
    "YES TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Even if you are an undergrad - the majority of students this semester were undergrads and it was manageable! The professor is incredible and the content is amazing! You'll even get an awesome project out of it to add to your resume",
    "Absolutely! This course was an awesome introduction to physics-based simulation. This course has heightened my interests in animation and exposed me to a fascinating field of computation. You are expected to fare well with new advanced mathematical concepts, but if you are comfortable with ODE's and PDE's you will not struggle.",
    "Yes, students can learn a lot solid knowledge about simulation and animation in computer graphics.",
    "This class is a unique combination of physics, art, and computer science, and for people who are very visual-results-oriented, this class is perfect. You'll code simulators and see the fruits of your labor immediately, which is more satisfying than whatever grade you may get in the class. You don't need to be too advanced in physics a calculus-based physics class is all that is required. The final project was also a blast, as we got to come up with a scenario that we wanted to simulate and then spend roughly a month just working on that.",
    "Yes. But since this is a graduate course, I would recommend only to students with strong mathematics, physics, and computer science background, together with self-motivated research intent.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in physics simulation whether that interest is a modicum or a passion. The course is ultimately made to prepare students for research and\/or work in the field so you would otherwise not get much out of it. Students who are interested in simulation but perhaps for non-creative purposes would also find this course useful. Additionally, I would only recommend the class if the student is willing to devote enough time to it (6-12 hrs\/wk). This class is amazing but it is certainly not for everyone. Anyone who is hesitant about taking the course should just contact the professor."
