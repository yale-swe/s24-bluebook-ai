    "Incredibly fun class. Seriously, take it. I'm a CS major (it counts for the CS major!) and had a blast with this course, which consists of a lot of microcontroller programming. There isn't really any theory here; it's all about making stuff, and Kuc comes up with some really cool projects, like implementing an optical communication protocol with an infrared LED and a phototransistor or making an acoustic tape measurer with a SONAR device and an LCD. Make sure you put time into the projects, because that's your entire grade; no problem sets here. While I thought the programming was pretty easy for the most part (I'm taking CS 323 right now), there were some EE students who struggled with some of it, so you might want to make sure you're at least familiar with the C programming language. I heard from EE students that this is a lot less work than other 300-level EE classes, and I can say from personal experience that this is a lot less work than CS 323. So in conclusion: this is a fun, chill class with a very manageable workload. You'd be a fool not to take it.",
    "This is an excellent class for EE\/EECS majors. It covers the general use and operation of microprocessors and other digital hardware. I really enjoyed my time in this class. However, I would recommend this class to majors only. While the class is really interesting, the course material is specific and the semiweekly\/weekly projects are time consuming.",
    "Take it! It's a light EE elective that also counts for a CS elective for those of you who are not sure about whether to major in EE or CS. The course load is really light with short weekly projects to begin with and a couple of long bi-weekly projects in the end. The project reports can be quite long sometimes though. There is a midterm and a final and if you do well enough on the midterm, you won't have to worry about the final at all. The grading is pretty lenient too. Overall, this is one of the least work and most fun electives that EE has to offer.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It is great, and professor Kuc is a very good lecturer. There are a lot of projects for this class, but they all build on one another, so nothing feels like busy work.",
    "I would recommend EENG 348 to another student if they want to learn about digital systems and want to design their own systems. If you don't like doing projects with the Arduino definitely don't take this class because that is what you will be doing all semester.",
    "Lots of project work. Writing the reports for each project was a lot of busy work. I doubt the professor checked the code rigorously for each project besides the last one. Needs a bit more of structure: e.g. the professor would change some project tasks in the middle of the project. Also the project expectations were not always clear, possibly because this was the first time this class did projects with Arduinos instead of PICs. Not hard, but I didnt know what to expect during the early part of the course, because we did not get much feedback on the lab reports that we submitted after the very first one (and we never knew how to answer the theoretical questions correctly, but apparently it didnt matter for our project grades, it was only important for the exams). Also, we didnt know when the exams were going to be taken - the midterm got delayed till practically the last week of class: again this class could do with some structure. On the plus side, work was fairly easy, Arduinos are fun, and Kuc has interesting tidbits to share in class.",
    "Definitely take the course. If you are EE you will. If you are a CS major looking for an interesting elective, definitely take it. I enjoyed the course as an EE major. Make sure to start the multi-arduino optical communication project earlier than the others.",
    "The class started off simple and easy but the last few assignments were hugely complicated and took forever. Personally was not a fan of his grading policy of 50% projects and 50% for your exam, Still I would recommend this class. It was neat to learn about and program the Arduino microcontroller. This is most likely a better class than other 300 EE classes.",
    "Excellent class with a very animated Professor Kuc. Format of the class is weekly projects with one midterm. Depending on how well you do on the midterm, the final can be optional. Projects are pretty time consuming but fun if you enjoy coding and hands-on work. There is a lab time, but it is optional to attend if you need help on a project. I would definitely recommend the class to EE's and CS majors alike as both can learn a great deal from this class.",
    "Really fun course. Not too difficult until the last few projects. Kuc is a boring lecturer but the work he has you do is legitimately fun at times. Kuc dropped a really ambiguous exam at the end of the course that ruined everyone's grades so watch out for that.",
    "348 was a good and interesting course. I feel that I learned a lot about microprocessors and Arduinos. It was a good hands-on course with quite a lot of programming. The CS majors had a much easier time, but as an EE major, my level of programming was a bit lower and projects would take longer. The first few assignments are relatively easy, but they soon get very complex and start taking 10+ hours. The course is challenging and you need to enjoy programming. The projects you end up doing are mostly fun and actually allow you to build mini-robots with the acquired knowledge. All in all, the weekly reports take a lot of time to complete and the course is good."
