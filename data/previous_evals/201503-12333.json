    "Fantastic course! Definitely take it, although it is a lot of reading. But that reading is stuff you'll take with you, so the benefit is far greater than the work to put in.",
    "Introduction to Narrative was good because of the texts. In other ways, it was not as good. The idea that this is theoretically equivalent to English 125 or DS Lit is disturbing: there just isn't enough close reading or writing. The theory component is pretty basic but useful, even for an upperclassman. But to be completely honest there were moments during this course when I contemplated changing majors."
