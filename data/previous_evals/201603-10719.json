   "comments": [
    "Really learned how to craft a successful personal essay (and some skills for academic essays). Ehrgood really makes you notice the words you're using, and forces you to microanalyze your own work.",
    "I learned two main things from this class: (1) what makes good writing good, and (2) how to learn to write well. (1) I learned how to pay attention to register and voice while writing, and to make conscious decisions about what I want to convey to the audience. I also learned techniques for writing sentences of various length and crafting logical transitions. (2) The key to writing well: reading examples of essays I like, and stealing elements that I enjoy. I also learned the importance of divorcing the idea generation stage and writing stages from the revising and editing stages.",
    "I learned how to read and write from a totally new perspective, and I also learned how to discuss with my classmates about these pieces.",
    "I learned about the literary moves behind good writing. I learned about myself as a writer. I learned to think about words (and the world they represent) more carefully and more critically.",
    "I learned how to write a stronger clearer essay",
    "- learning to appreciate written language - learning to verbalize and analyze why I like certain sentences\/passages I read - practicing different kinds of non-fiction writing and seeing what kind of moves, both intentional and non-intentional, are most effective in communicating an idea",
    "Good class.",
    "I learned the art of personal nonfiction and nonfiction essay writing. I also read any great examples of master works that provided a basis to start my own writing.",
    "I learned how to write essays in the context of modern literary thought and practice. I learned how to analyze text, and how to form my own literary thought based on that analysis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Course has really great readings (for the most time) and interesting discussion. Sometimes Ehrgood goes on mental tangents when he's speaking--momentarily losing the class--but he always brings it back to the lesson. Individual meetings are also great for learning, but workshops not so much.",
    "The readings are great.",
    "Strengths: The workload of the class was reasonable, but was enough to facilitate useful discussion during class. The instructor provided an appropriate amount of guidance to the students, gently correcting us and getting us to consider certain conclusions about a particular piece without telling us what opinion we should have. The essays I read were interesting, as were the prompts I was asked to write about. The class workshops on my individual writing, as well as one-on-one meetings with the professor, were very useful in helping me find my voice. I had a lot of fun and learned a lot while taking this class.",
    "I think this course is really strong in structure - I loved the way the essays were scattered among relevant readings, and I never felt overloaded with work.",
    "Strengths: incredible one-on-one attention with professor; ideal seminar style course; engaging and well-orchestrated discussion; useful input from peers during critiques; thoughtful selection of course material; appropriate pace and development from start to finish Potential Improvement: a more clear overview of the year's calendar; a regularly updated syllabus available online",
    "It's well organized and individualized",
    "Strengths: The readings were amazing and insightful and didn't feel like homework because I would have read them anyways. That made class discussions enriching because students came prepared. Ehrgood did a great job of providing countless amounts of feedback for every daft, and the workshops in class were actually helpful. Weaknesses: The sheer volume of writing made it easy to feel a bit burned out at the end. Grading felt somewhat unpredictable and inconsistent.",
    "I loved the interactivity and discussion element of this class. I also really liked the essays that were chosen for us to read. An improvement could be the level of use each essay received (there were some that we never actually discussed or discussed rarely). The ones that we did discuss, however, fueled very compelling discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Ehrgood is the Christ of ENGL 120, and really knows what he's doing. Take this course if you want to read a lot of dope, modern essays while also being able to write some of your own. Dont expect to get good grades on all your essays--different topics are challenging for different people, and all ENGL120 professors are tough graders. But worth it if you want to improve your writing.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, regardless of whether or not you are majoring in something English-related. It teaches you to recognize, articulate, and employ the elements that make good writing \"good.\" It encourages you to find your voice and helps you develop a feel for what techniques work for you. The entire process is painless, thought-provoking, and fun.",
    "Absolutely. I feel like I came out of this class a better and more introspective person, although I'm unsure whether I can articulate exactly what I learned. I think it just gives you a greater perspective about language and how it is used in every place. It's also helps you learn so much more about yourself.",
    "Yes, I loved this course and it was a great way to learn actively!",
    "If you are interested in reading and writing the modern essay, take this course. With the necessary time, effort, and careful thought (which is more than the average class), this course can change your perspective about words and the world they represent. Ehrgood is incredible. The attention he devotes to students is unbeatable, and my work has improved tremendously as a result. Five creative non-fiction pieces throughout the term, with critiques from peers and specific feedback from prof. Ideal seminar; well-orchestrated discussions. Students might complain that this course is less applicable to future courses since the essays are not academic papers, but I believe writing and thinking critically are some of the most important skills for much more than future courses.",
    "Yes it was useful",
    "Yes, definitely take this course! Professor Ehrgood leads a wonderful section of English 120 that will challenge you to think about what you're writing and how to write it most effectively. I think each section of 120 is a little different from other sections. Whether you like your section of 120 or not will depend on multiple factors: the assignments, the professor, and the class members. Use shopping period to see if you think you'll \"click\" with the course instructor. Professor Ehrgood's assignments are a little different than most ENGL 120 sections, but in my opinion, they challenge you to write in many different sub-genres and styles. As a science major, this course challenged me to think analytically about many of my life experiences and to write about them in a way that would be interesting for others to hear about.",
    "Highly recommended if and only if you are interested in long-form nonfiction writing (like the pieces you'd read in the New Yorker) and you have lots of time to dedicate to this class.",
    "If you love writing nonfiction and personal essays, definitely take this course. If you hate writing, avoid it. It's a ton of writing!",
    "Absolutely. Prof. Ehrgood is a genius at his craft, and the discussions we had were some of the best in my life."
