    "This is an absolutely excellent class if you have any interest in social contract theory or the basic philosophical foundations of government. The class is very Hobbes heavy, with a fair bit of time on Locke, and almost none of Rousseau. That said, it probably covers the latter two more than any other class on campus, so it's still worth your time. Professor Smith doesn't hide his views in this class and definitely has an agenda he is trying to push, especially with Hobbes. I found this very intellectually stimulating because it challenged my preconceived notions of the text, but if you are looking for a reading more tailored to normal academic discourse, this is not it. Overall, this was easily the best course I took this semester, and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Matthew Smith's interpretations are pretty idiosyncratic, but in my opinion brilliant. I completely bought everything he said in class. Whether you do or not, this class is all about close textual analysis with a broad view of the major problems these thinkers were addressing. And despite Smith's views, a variety of interpretations are consistently entertained. On the last day of class, Smith broke down all of political theory in terms of two opposing interpretations of Rousseau's general will in a way that made perfect sense to me and really taught me something about the major questions of political philosophy. Model philosophy seminar. I chose to take it on the last day of shopping period and I'm so glad I did.",
    "This was just a fun class. Some days we had great discussions, other days we just listened to Matthew Smith talk, but it was always (or at least most of the time). Even though I had read all three people before, I have a grip on what they're saying now in a way that I didn't before, especially Hobbes (and, actually possibly Rousseau to a lesser extent, mostly because we only had three days on him and it was the end of the semester). Work-wise, there is extremely little reading, but a lot of writing, and Matthew Smith is a pretty demanding grader, which is good to keep in mind.",
    "If you're at all interested in the social contract and the issues it raises (philosophical and political) you should absolutely take this class. Workload isn't bad and neither is the reading. That said, you're expected to think and write creatively and deeply.",
    "If you have some knowledge of pol. phil. and are interested in the field, take it. great overview, you get to choose you essay topics and the reading is not all too bad.",
    "TAKE IT! These three men are so incredibly influential to the founding documents of this country (ie the constitution) and for even framing modern political discussions. For anyone who is really interested in constitutional issues or is a news junkie this class is fantastic. For anyone interested in modern western political history this class is also great. I talked about this class all semester and would recommend it to pretty much anyone.",
    "A worthwhile course for those interested in really taking the time to study some works they have probably surveyed elsewhere.Professor Smith is fantastic - however, this course peaks early with his analysis of Hobbes. The time we spent on Hobbes were some of my favorite hours in a classroom at Yale. However, Locke and Rousseau are covered well too.He is a pretty hard grader, and he doesn't take classroom participation into account when calculating grades. However, he will really engage with your essays, leaving extensive critiques, which I loved.If you're interested in social contract theory - and especially a new way of looking at Hobbes - take this course!"
