   "comments": [
    "It's a pretty natural way to talk about all the things you've done in the past if you are involved in humanitarian stuff.",
    "Mostly I have a newfound appreciation of the tough work that humanitarians do - discussing it in class showed how complicated it could be, and I can't imagine actually participating in those interventions.",
    "I gained an in-depth understanding of the complex, moral challenges that humanitarian interventions involve. Also good writing practise.",
    "Great insights into the humanitarian sector and the host of problems and challenges that it faces.",
    "This was definitely one of the more intellectually challenging seminars I have taken at Yale, given the extremely complex and difficult subject discussed in class. There are so many angles, opinions, and moral\/ethical questions intrinsically linked to humanitarianism, and this course offers a good overview of all of them. The variety of guest speakers as well as the dialogue sparked in class were incredibly thought provoking, and I am grateful to have had the ability to take this class given the current political climate and how relevant\/topical humanitarianism is to the world today, and its increasing necessity in the years to come.",
    "This course provides a comparative, critical overview on current issues and themes in humanitarian interventions (especially medical, given the expertise of Prof. Panter-Brick and Kristen). We learn how to evaluate interventions on the basis of unintended outcomes, conflicting moral\/ethical approaches, and accountability and success as understood from various perspectives (e.g. international donors vs. local beneficiaries).",
    "The class was great, learned a lot about different aspects and challenges of humanitarianism.",
    "I learned how humanitarian interventions have unintended consequences and how interventions should be evaluated prior to their implementing. A core tenant of the class is learning about the perspective of those receiving the intervention.",
    "I developed a strong and interdisciplinary understanding of humanitarianism as a challenge, an imperative, and a practice.",
    "writing + analysis (ethical\/logistical) + quick thinking international & national insight into humanitarian world (for both sides of world)",
    "I gained a new perspective on solution-oriented studies. I liked that we considered both theory and case studies in thinking through how we would solve real-world problems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Guest speakers are the best, and having class at professor's house is so nice. However, the discussions are often flat.",
    "The class was a bit too large for my liking, but I appreciated the built-in flexibility of the reading, where we had the ability to \"choose __ of __\" readings according to what struck our fancy. It enabled more interesting class discussions. Also, we often had really interesting guest lecturers, and other experts from around the world.",
    "The course was wonderful. It would have been nicer with fewer people, so that we could get to know one another better and have some more in-depth discussions. The guest speakers were all fascinating, but it would be good to have 15mins at the end of each talk just to discuss as a class. That we we could have linked their first-hand insight into the concepts we were studying.",
    "Good seminar, cpb is typically pretty engaging and brings in great guest speakers. The class was a little too large, but that lets you hide in the corner for a class if you hadnt done the readings.",
    "Super intersting material and great speakers were brought in. The presentations at the beginning of the semester were a little long and made it difficult to actually discuss the material together, but that changed in the 2nd half of the semester. Overall the class is a little big, which also makes discussion difficult, so would recommend taking a smaller class next year.",
    "The strengths in this class lie in the readings required each week, which were all phenomenal, even if tough to read at points, as well as the quality of the class discussion. Professor PB and Kristen were amazing resources, both extremely well-versed in their fields. However, the quality of the guest speakers seemed to range, and while the majority were amazing, there were a few that seems a little lackluster.",
    "Professor Panter-Brick shares rich insights from her own experience in the field, and invites diverse and impressive guests from many spheres within the field (UN-related offices, local NGOs, policy\/advocacy, journalism, etc.). She challenges the class to appreciate the complexity of a single intervention and how it affects all stakeholders. At times, the discussion felt a bit rushed and unproductive because student presentations took very long, but students were given the opportunity to provide mid-semester feedback which addressed this problem.",
    "I wish I had more structured feedback on writing. I was not sure what I was meant to be writing for",
    "The strengths are Panther Brick all the way, and the speakers she invites. The weaknesses are that the conversation seemed hindered at times, probably by the competitiveness of the global majors.",
    "strengths = assignments (schedule, amount, length, content); professor; variation of weeks weaknesses = not enough structure",
    "I thought the material was very interesting, but the seminar as a whole was oversubscribed and too large for effective discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's fun.",
    "Yes, especially if you have some background in human rights\/development and want to really understand the unique, humanitarian perspective.",
    "Yes! Very interesting class, interesting discussions, and great readings. It's 3 reading responses and one final paper - so very doable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course just because everyone should know a bit more about humanitarians and the work that they do in this world. I really appreciated the insight and knowledge gained from the course material, as well as the thoughtful dialogue had with my peers. It is a great reading list with a variety of speakers, and it is held in Morse College which is both incredibly convenient and also means that some classes are catered (as Professor Panter-Brick also happens to be the Morse HoC!)",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, particularly for people who are interested in the ethical\/moral dimensions of humanitarianism. You have to be okay with the fact that there are no clear answers to many of the debates that the class delves into, and that the course is more an opportunity to practice evaluating from many angles as opposed to learning the right way to do humanitarian work. Overall, the course is a rich and engaging opportunity to learn about the field from an experienced and impressive professor.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes! I learned how humanitarian interventions have unintended consequences and how interventions should be evaluated prior to their implementing. A core tenant of the class is learning about the perspective of those receiving the intervention. The professor and TA are super supportive and great at communicating with students. I truly appreciated the supportive environment they fostered in the course.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially as a non-major.",
    "Yes - a great professor & a great topic that all, regardless of major, can benefit from learning more about.",
    "Yes I learned a lot and the professor and TF are great."
