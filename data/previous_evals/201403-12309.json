   "comments": [
    "Its interesting, dense, moderately heavy workload and very writing\/discussion based.",
    "Definitely take it if this is the academic areas you are interested in! It's truly one of the best seminars I have taken at Yale -- the workload is not easy and the readings can be long and complex but if this is something you are interested in, you will gain so much out of it! Professor Monteiro is also one of the most interesting professors out there!",
    "I would recommend this class to people who have an interest in military power and are willing to read a lot about it. The main text is Clausewitz, and really it's the class discussion that makes it come alive. I think for this semester especially, my classmates really made the section since a lot of them were very knowledgeable and had great insights about the text and military affairs in general.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for any student interested in military power or Clausewitz. The course is a bit theoretical, so be prepared to engage in philosophy-type reading.",
    "Military Power is one of the best seminars I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Monteiro is extremely helpful and engaging, and the class discussion is excellent.I would highly recommend this or any class with him.",
    "Military Power is an outstanding course for any student interested in learning about international conflict and how war and politics relate. The topics are fascinating, the professor is outstanding, and the potential for learning and improving student work and knowledge is very high. I would highly recommend this course to any interested student.",
    "This course studies elements of war, using Clausewitz's \"On War\" as a starting point for discussion. Topics include but are not limited to morality, the element of surprise, the difference between attack and defense, and the changing nature of warfare throughout the ages. I recommend this course for someone who already has some background or at least very strong interest in armed conflict, the military, or the history of war. It is a class that tends to lean toward theory rather than practice, although elements of both were present throughout the course."
