   "comments": [
    "If you like microeconomics this is a good course for you.",
    "Yes, if you want to get into nuts-and-bolts micro",
    "If you liked Intermediate Microeconomics, I would recommend this course. There's a good bit of game theory and strategic thinking, and the material is engaging and moves quickly. This isn't an easy course, but it can be very interesting and rewarding to work through the problems. I would recommend this course to those who have a solid background in economics and mathematics. It helps, too, to have some familiarity with econometrics.",
    "If you like microeconomics and\/or game theory, this course is great for you! It's all about firm strategy and modeling how firms interact with each other in different scenarios. Professor Haile is very clear and a much better lecturer than most in the econ department.",
    "Great class that does an in depth study of what it sets out to do.",
    "Take if you like calculus and econ theory",
    "Overall, this course was a great overview of the different models used to analyze firm interactions. The beginning starts off as a review ofGame Theory, but extended beyond within the context of firms. The good thing is the math is not too complicated, but you can learn a lot from the models nonetheless.Don't be afraid by the first problem set - it gets easier after that. Everything else is traditional for an econ course - 1 midterm, 1 final 9 problem sets.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone interested in micro and competition in markets. You will be introduced to a lot of industrial organization theory and I think is sparks a lot of thought about the way large firms operate and make decision. Great class, you should definitely give it a shot.",
    "I would highly recommend Firms, Markets, and Competition (Economics 409) to economics majors who enjoyed intermediate economics and who think they may be interested in economic theory applied to imperfect competition. This course covers, at an advanced level, the fundamentals of industrial organization; this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s course covered price discrimination, durable goods, static and dynamic oligopoly, horizontal and vertical product differentiation, strategic investment, mergers, asymmetric information, and auctions. The course was mainly approached through a game theoretic perspective though no background in game theory is required since Professor Haile teaches and reviews what is needed. (I would still recommend some minimal background in game theory before taking this course.) Professor Haile was a great teacher and he certainly made it worth attending the twice-weekly 9:00 am lectures. The workload for the course was moderate. There were (approximately) weekly problem sets that ranged from two questions to seven questions in length. Completing the problem sets well would entail a commitment of at least a few hours each week. Additionally, there were two exams, both of which were challenging: an in-class midterm and a final exam during exam week. If you are willing to invest some time in learning the theoretical basics of one of the most interesting subfields of economics, I highly recommend ECON 409 with Professor Haile."
